Mr. President, the coming weeks are a critical time, not \njust here in the Congress but in our country. This month we will work \nto stabilize our broken health care system and lower costs for the \nmiddle class. This month we will also discuss, debate and, I am \nconfident, ultimately confirm President Obama's outstanding nominee, \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor.\n  These goals require both sides to work together. I repeat. These \ngoals require both sides to work together. Each will require all of us \nto work in good faith. If we are to do what our country needs us to do, \nwe must work as partners, not partisans.\n  We have said all along we strongly prefer to fix health care as one \ncollaborative body, not as two competing parties. I had a positive \nmeeting with four senior Republican Senators about the road ahead for \nhealth care, and it is health care reform we talked about. We finished \nthe meeting and there was a general agreement we needed health care \nreform, and it should be done on a bipartisan basis, not resort to what \nwe call reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority.\n  I appreciate very much the commitment of those four Republicans to \ngetting this done. I look forward to more Republicans showing the same \ncommitment.\n  The Finance and HELP Committee chairmen are working tirelessly to \nmark up the health care bills. Our goal remains the same. We would like \nto see those bills on the floor in July. I hope our Republican \ncolleagues will work with us to achieve that goal.\n  Just as our commitment to a bipartisan plan has not changed, neither \nhave our principles about that plan: lowering skyrocketing costs, and \nbringing stability and security back to health care. We are committed \nto passing a plan that protects what works and fixes what is broken. A \nplan that ensures that if you like the coverage you have, you can keep \nit.\n  We will make sure people can still choose their own doctors, \nhospitals, and health plans. Americans need affordable health care they \ncan count on. Too many families live just one illness or one accident \nor one pink slip away\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\nfrom financial ruin. The cost of inaction is too great and the status \nquo is no longer an option. The status quo simply is not something we \nneed to look to.\n  On another subject, today is a historic day in America. Right now, \nthey are having opening statements in the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nDemocrats and Republicans, regarding Sonia Sotomayor. She will, later \ntoday, testify before that committee as President Obama's nominee for \nthe highest Court in our country. As we all know, she is the first \nHispanic American to do so.\n  Judge Sotomayor has a wide range of experience, not just in the legal \nworld but in the real world. Her understanding of the law is grounded \nnot only in theory but also in practice. Her record and qualifications \nare tremendous. She has worked at almost every level of our judicial \nsystem--as a prosecutor, as a litigator, a trial court judge, and \nappellate judge.\n  That is the exact type of experience we need on the Supreme Court. \nWhen she is confirmed, she will bring to the bench more judicial \nexperience than any sitting Justice had when they joined the Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor has been nominated by both Democratic and Republican \nPresidents. She has been confirmed twice by the Senate with strong \nbipartisan support. Her record is well known and well respected. We are \ncommitted to ensuring that she has a rigorous and reasonable \nconfirmation hearing. We expect both sides to ask tough questions and \nwe expect both the questions and their answers to be fair and honest \nbefore she is confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7378-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwill begin its hearings on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to \nbe an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. The consideration of \na Supreme Court nominee is always a historic event. Since our Nation's \nfounding, only 110 people have served on the High Court, and 10 of \nthose were nominated by George Washington. There are few duties more \nconsequential for a Member of the U.S. Senate than to vote on a Supreme \nCourt nominee.\n  This particular nominee comes before the Judiciary Committee with a \ncompelling life story. Like so many other Americans before her, Judge \nSotomayor has overcome great adversity. In this, she has reaffirmed \nonce again that ours is a nation in which one's willingness to work \nhard and apply one's talents are the principal requirements for \nsuccess. And yet, as we begin these hearings, it is important to remind \nourselves that our obligation as Senators under the Constitution's \nadvice and consent clause requires us to do more than confirm someone \nto a lifetime position on our Nation's highest court based on their \nlife story. Rather, it requires us to determine whether he or she will \nbe able to fulfill the requirements of the oath taken by all Federal \njudges, that they will, ``administer justice without respect to \npersons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that \n[they] will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the \nduties incumbent upon [them] under the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States.''\n  The emphasis here is on the equal treatment of everyone, without \nrespect to person, status, or belief, that everyone in America can \nexpect that when they enter a courtroom, they will not be treated any \ndifferently than anyone else. That is what justice is, after all. And \nthat is what Americans expect of our judicial system, equality under \nthe law.\n  Now, President Obama has made it abundantly clear, as a Senator, as a \ncandidate for President, and now as President, that he has a somewhat \ndifferent requirement for his appointees to the Federal bench. He has \nrepeatedly emphasized that his ``criterion'' for a federal judge is \ntheir ability to ``empathize'' with certain groups. That is a great \nstandard, if you are a member of one of those specific groups. It is \nnot so great, though, if you are not. So it might be useful to consider \nsome of the groups who have found themselves on the short end of the \n``empathy'' standard.\n  First, there are those who rely on the first amendment's right to \nengage in political speech. Then there are those Americans who want to \nlawfully exercise their right to bear arms under the second amendment. \nNext, those who want protection under the fifth amendment's requirement \nthat private property cannot be taken for a public purpose without just \ncompensation, and that it should not be taken for another person's \npreferred private use at all. Also, there are those who want protection \nfrom unfair employment practices under the 14th amendment's guarantee \nof the equal protection of the law.\n  I mention these specific groups because Judge Sotomayor has had to \nhandle cases in each of these areas. And looking at her record, it \nappears the President has nominated just the kind of judge he said he \nwould, someone who appears to have ``empathy'' for certain groups who \nappear before her, but not for others.\n  As I discussed last week, Judge Sotomayor kicked out of court the \nclaims of New Haven, CT, firefighters who had been denied promotions \nbecause some minority firefighters had not performed as well as a group \nof mostly White firefighters on a race-neutral exam. The Supreme Court \nreversed her decision in this matter, her third reversal just this \nterm, with all nine justices finding that she misapplied the law. Her \ntreatment of this case, the Ricci case, has been criticized across the \npolitical spectrum as ``perfunctory'' and ``peculiar,'' and it called \ninto question whether her dismissive handling of the firefighters' \nimportant claims was unduly influenced by her past advocacy in the area \nof employment preferences and quotas.\n  I also spoke last week about provocative comments Judge Sotomayor had \nmade about campaign speech, including her claim that merely donating \nmoney to a candidate is akin to bribery. It is her prerogative to make \nsuch statements, as provocative as they may be. But it is not her \nprerogative as a judge to fail to follow clear Supreme Court precedent \nin favor of her political beliefs. Yet when she had the chance to vote \non whether to correct a clear failure to follow Supreme Court precedent \nby her circuit in this very area of the law, she voted against doing \nso. Ultimately, the Supreme Court, in an opinion authored by Justice \nBreyer, corrected this error by her circuit on the grounds that it had \nfailed to follow precedent.\n  There are other areas of concern.\n  Judge Sotomayor also brushed aside a person's claim that their \nprivate property had been taken in violation of the fifth amendment's \n``takings clause.'' As in the Ricci case, her panel kicked the \nplaintiffs' claims out of court in an unsigned, unpublished, summary \norder, giving them only a brief, one paragraph explanation as to why. \nMoreover, in the course of doing so, she dramatically expanded the \nSupreme Court's controversial 2005 decision in Kelo v. New London. In \nKelo, the Supreme Court broadened the meaning of ``public purpose'' \nthat allows the government to take someone's private property. Judge \nSotomayor, in the case of Didden v. Village of Port Chester, broadened \nthe government's power even further.\n  Her panel's ruling in Didden now makes it easier for a person's \nprivate property to be taken for the purpose of conferring a private \nbenefit on another private party. This result is at odds with both the \nplain language of the fifth amendment's takings clause, and with the \nSupreme Court's statements in Kelo. And, as in Ricci, she did it \nwithout providing a thorough analysis of the law. Her panel devoted \njust one paragraph to analyzing the plaintiffs' important Fifth \nAmendment claims. It is no wonder then that property law expert \nProfessor Ilya Somin at George Mason University Law School called it \n``one of the worst property rights decisions in recent years.'' \nProfessor Richard Epstein at the University of Chicago College of Law \ncalled it not only ``wrong'' and ``ill thought out,'' but ``about as \nnaked an abuse of government power as could be imagined.''\n  There is more. Judge Sotomayor has twice ruled that the second \namendment\n\n[[Page S7379]]\n\nis not a fundamental right and thus does not protect Americans from \nactions by states and localities that prevent them from lawfully \nexercising their ability to bear arms. As with the Ricci and Didden \ncases, Judge Sotomayor gave the losing party's claims in these cases \nshort shrift and did not thoroughly explain her analysis. In one case, \nshe disposed of the party's second amendment claim in a mere one-\nsentence footnote. In the other case, which was argued after the \nSupreme Court's seminal second amendment decision in District of \nColumbia v. Heller, she gave this important precedent cursory \ntreatment, devoting only one paragraph in an unsigned opinion to this \nimportant issue, which is unusual for a case of this significance.\n  The losing parties in these cases might not have belonged to the \ngroups that the President had in mind when he was articulating his \n``empathy'' standard. But they certainly underscore the hazards of such \na standard. They had important constitutional claims, and they deserved \nto have their claims treated seriously and adjudicated fairly under the \nlaw, regardless of what Judge Sotomayor's personal and political \nagendas might be. Yet it strikes me that the losing parties in these \ncases did not in fact get the fair treatment they deserved.\n  Indeed, taken together, these cases strongly suggest a pattern of \nunequal treatment in Judge Sotomayor's judicial record, particularly in \nhigh-profile cases. This pattern is particularly disturbing in light of \nJudge Sotomayor's numerous comments about her view of the role of a \njudge, such as questioning a judge's ability to be impartial ``even in \nmost cases,'' asserting that appellate courts ``are where policy is \nmade,'' and concluding that her experiences and views affect the facts \nthat she ``chooses to see'' in deciding cases.\n  Republicans take very seriously our obligation to review anyone who \nis nominated to a lifetime position on our Nation's highest court. That \nis why Senators have taken time to review Judge Sotomayor's record to \nmake sure she has the same basic qualities we look for in any Federal \njudge: superb legal ability, personal integrity, sound temperament, \nand, most importantly, a commitment to read the law evenhandedly. At \nthe beginning of this process, I noted that some of Judge Sotomayor's \npast statements and decisions raised concerns. As we begin the \nconfirmation hearings, those concerns have only multiplied.\n  Boiled down, my concern is this: that Judge Sotomayor's record \nsuggests a history of allowing her personal and political beliefs to \nseep into her judgments on the bench, which has repeatedly resulted in \nunequal treatment for those who stand before her.\n  But that is what these hearings are all about: giving nominees an \nopportunity to address the concerns that Senators might have about a \nnominee's record. In this case, the list is long.\n  So we welcome Judge Sotomayor as she comes before the Judiciary \nCommittee today. And we look forward to a full and thorough hearing on \nher record and her views.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7379-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of S. 1390, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1390) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2010 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Armed Services Committee, \nI am pleased to bring S. 1390, the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2010, to the Senate floor. This bill will fully fund \nthe year 2010 budget request of $680 billion for national security \nactivities in the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has a long tradition of setting \naside partisanship and working together in the interest of the national \ndefense. This year follows that tradition. I am pleased that S. 1390 \nwas reported to the Senate on a unanimous 26-to-nothing vote of the \ncommittee. This vote stands as a testament to the common commitment of \nall of our Members to supporting our men and women in uniform. I \nparticularly thank Senator McCain, our ranking minority member, for his \nstrong support throughout the committee process and, of course, for the \ndedication he has shown to national defense throughout his Senate \ncareer.\n  Earlier this year, the Armed Services Committee reported out the \nWeapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 with similar bipartisan \nsupport. In less than 2 months, we were able to get the bill passed by \nthe Senate, complete conference with the House, and have the President \nsign it into law. It is my hope that we will be able to move with \nsimilar dispatch on the bill now before us.\n  This bill contains many important provisions that will improve the \nquality of life of our men and women in uniform, provide needed support \nand assistance to our troops on the battlefields in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, make the investments we need to meet the challenges of the \n21st century, and require needed reforms in the management of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  First and foremost, the bill before us continues the increases in \ncompensation and quality of life that our service men and women and \ntheir families deserve as they face the hardships imposed by continuing \nmilitary operations around the world. For example, the bill contains \nprovisions that would, first, authorize a 3.4-percent across-the-board \npay raise for all uniformed military personnel, and that represents \nhalf a percent more than the budget request and the annual rate of \ninflation. The bill authorizes a 30,000 increase in the Army's Active-\nDuty end strength during fiscal years 2011 and 2012 in order to \nincrease dwell time and reduce the stress created by repeated \ndeployments. The bill authorizes payment of over 25 types of bonuses \nand special pays aimed at encouraging enlistment, reenlistment, and \ncontinued service by Active-Duty and Reserve military personnel. We \nincrease the authorization for the Homeowners' Assistance Program by \n$350 million in order to provide relief to homeowners in the Armed \nForces who are required to relocate because of base closures or change \nof station orders. And we increase the maximum amount of supplemental \nsubsistence allowance from $500 to $1,100 per month to ensure that \nservicemembers and their families do not have to be dependent on food \nstamps.\n  The bill also includes important funding and authorities needed to \nprovide our troops the equipment and support they will continue to need \nas long as they remain on the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan. For \nexample, the bill contains provisions that would provide $6.7 billion \nfor the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, MRAP, vehicle fund, including \nan increase of $1.2 billion above the President's budget request for \nMRAP all-terrain vehicles which will be deployed in Afghanistan. The \nbill fully funds the President's budget request for U.S. Special \nOperations Command and adds $131 million for unfunded requirements \nidentified by the commander of Special Operations Command. The bill \nprovides full funding for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat \nOrganization to continue the development and deployment of technologies \nto defeat these attacks. And we provide nearly $7.5 billion to train \nand equip the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police so \nthey can carry more of the burden of defending their own country \nagainst the Taliban.\n  The bill would also implement most of the budget recommendations made \nby the Secretary of Defense to terminate troubled programs and apply \nthe savings to higher priority activities of the Department. For \nexample, the bill will terminate the Air Force Combat Search and \nRescue-X helicopter program, CSAR-X. It will terminate the VH-71 \nPresidential helicopter. It would cancel and restructure the manned \nground vehicle portion of the Army's\n\n[[Page S7380]]\n\nFuture Combat System Program. It would stop the growth of the Army \nbrigade combat teams, the BCTs, at 45 instead of 48, while maintaining \nthe planned increase in end strength. It would end production of the C-\n17 Program. It would terminate the Multiple Kill Vehicle Program, \ncancel the kinetic energy interceptor, cancel the second airborne laser \nprototype aircraft, and it would authorize $900 million of additional \nfunding in the budget request to field more theater missile defense \nsystems, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, the THAAD, and the \nstandard missile-3 interceptors, and converting additional AEGIS ships \nfor missile defense to defend our forward-deployed forces and allies \nagainst the many short- and medium-range missiles held by countries \nsuch as North Korea and Iran.\n  The bill supports the decision of Secretary Gates to stop deployment \nof the ground-based interceptors at 30 missiles and to focus on \nimproving the capability of this system to be more reliable and \neffective than the current system against the limited threat of long-\nrange missiles.\n  The bill also supports the decision to continue production of those \nground-based interceptors that are on contract and to use them as test \nmissiles and as spares. By fielding the most modern version of the \ninterceptor, using modern silos and conducting operationally realistic \ntesting with the additional missiles instead of putting them in silos, \nthe system will provide, in Secretary Gates' words, a ``robust \ncapability'' that is ``fully adequate to protect us against a North \nKorean threat for a number of years.'' According to testimony to the \ncommittee, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the combatant commanders \nagreed that their highest priority for the GMD--ground missile \ndefense--system was to have 30 interceptors with improved reliability, \navailability, and effectiveness. The bill before us again supports \nSecretary Gates' decision to field that improved capability.\n  I am disappointed that the committee voted on a very close vote not \nto terminate the F-22 aircraft production program, as requested by the \nSecretary of Defense and as supported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I \nplan to join with Senator McCain in seeking to overturn that decision \nduring floor consideration of this bill.\n  Finally, the bill contains a number of provisions that will help \nimprove the management of the Department of Defense and other Federal \nagencies. For example, the bill contains provisions that would, first, \nimprove Department of Defense financial management by requiring the \nDepartment to engage in business process reengineering before acquiring \nnew information technology systems and to submit regular reports on its \nprogress toward auditable financial statements.\n  Second, it requires the Department of Defense to develop a \ncomprehensive plan to address longstanding problems in its inventory \nmanagement systems which lead it to acquire and store hundreds of \nmillions of dollars worth of unneeded items.\n  Third, it places a moratorium on public-private competitions under \nOMB circular A-76 until the Department complies with an existing \nstatutory requirement to develop information needed to manage its \nservice contractors, plan for its civilian employee workforce, and \nidentify functions that would be subject to public-private competition.\n  Fourth, we would authorize the Secretary to establish a new defense \ncivilian leadership program to help recruit, train, and retain highly \nqualified civilian employees to help lead the Department of Defense \nover the next 20 years.\n  A very important provision in this bill is section 1031, which would \naddress the problems that exist with military commissions. The military \ncommissions provisions we have in law today do not provide basic \nguarantees of fairness identified by our Supreme Court. The existing \nprovisions place a cloud, therefore, over military commissions and have \nled some to conclude that the use of military commissions can never be \nfair, credible, or consistent with our basic principles of justice.\n  Earlier this year, the President stated that military commissions can \nbe reformed to meet basic standards of fairness needed for them to play \na legitimate role in prosecuting violations of the law of war. In his \nMay 21, 2009, speech at the National Archives, President Obama stated \nthat:\n\n       Military commissions have a history in the United States \n     dating back to George Washington and the Revolutionary War. \n     They are an appropriate venue for trying detainees for \n     violations of the laws of war. They allow for the protection \n     of sensitive sources and methods of intelligence-gathering; \n     they allow for the safety and security of participants; and \n     for the presentation of evidence gathered from the \n     battlefield that cannot always be effectively presented in \n     federal courts.\n\n  The President continued:\n\n       . . . Instead of using the flawed commissions of the last \n     seven years, my administration is bringing our commissions in \n     line with the rule of law. . . . [W]e will make our military \n     commissions a more credible and effective means of \n     administering justice, and I will work with Congress and \n     members of both parties, as well as legal authorities across \n     the political spectrum, on legislation to ensure that these \n     commissions are fair, legitimate, and effective.\n\n  We agree with the President, and section 1031 reflects our \ndetermination to reform the commissions. In its 2006 decision in the \nHamdan case, the Supreme Court held that Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions requires that the trial of detainees for violations of the \nlaw of war be conducted in a manner consistent with the procedures \napplicable in trials by courts-martial and that any deviation from \nthose procedures be justified by ``evident practical need.'' The \nSupreme Court said that the ``uniformity principle is not an inflexible \none; it does not preclude all departures from the procedures dictated \nfor use by courts martial. But any departure must be tailored to the \nexigency that necessitates it.'' That is the standard the Armed \nServices Committee has tried to apply in adopting the procedures for \nmilitary commissions that we have included in our bill.\n  This new language addresses a long series of problems with the \nprocedures currently in law. For example, relative to the admissibility \nof coerced testimony, the provision in our bill would eliminate the \ndouble standard in existing law under which coerced statements are \nadmissible if they were obtained prior to December 30, 2005. They would \nbe inadmissible regardless of when the coercion occurred. Relative to \nthe use of hearsay evidence, the provision in our bill would eliminate \nthe extraordinary language in the existing law which places the burden \non detainees to prove that hearsay evidence introduced against them is \nnot reliable and probative. Relative to the issue of access to \nclassified evidence and exculpatory evidence, the provision in our bill \nwould eliminate the unique procedures and requirements which have \nhampered the ability of defense teams to obtain information and which \nhave led to so much litigation. We would substitute more established \nprocedures based on the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the UCMJ, \nwith modest changes to ensure that the government cannot be required to \ndisclose classified information to unauthorized persons.\n  Even if we are able to enact new legislation that successfully \naddresses the problems in existing law, we will have a ways to go to \nrestore public confidence in military commissions and the justice they \nproduce. However, we will not be able to restore confidence in military \ncommissions at all unless we first substitute new procedures and \nlanguage to address the problems with the existing statute.\n  As of today, we have almost 130,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines on the ground in Iraq. Over the course of the next fiscal \nyear, we will undertake the difficult task of drawing down these Iraqi \nnumbers while maintaining security and stability on the ground. At the \nsame time, we have increased our forces in Afghanistan, with close to \n60,000 troops engaged in increasingly active combat and combat support \noperations, and more are on the way.\n  While there are many issues where there may not be a consensus, we \nall know--and there is a consensus on this--that we must provide our \ntroops the support they need as long as they remain in harm's way. \nSenate action on the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2010 will improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform. \nIt will give them the tools they need to remain the most effective \nfighting force in the world. And very importantly, it will send an \nimportant\n\n[[Page S7381]]\n\nmessage that we, as a nation, stand behind them and are deeply grateful \nfor their service.\n  So we look forward to working with colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation. Again, I thank Senator McCain for all he and his staff \nhave done to bring this bill to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Levin, and I share his \ngratitude in thanking our subcommittee chairmen and ranking members who \ncontributed so much to writing this bill. They held numerous hearings \non many important issues, and I thank them all for their hard work. And \nthey were ably assisted by our extremely competent committee staff. \nBringing this bill to the floor each year is a tremendous undertaking, \nand it would not be possible without the hard work of our outstanding \nprofessional staff who ensure that the process goes smoothly.\n  I also extend my special thanks to Chairman Levin, with whom I have \nworked for many years now. I commend him on his leadership, grace, and \nintegrity in shepherding this bill. It is not easy managing the \ncompeting interests, views, and opinions of 26 Senators, but Chairman \nLevin does an outstanding job at ensuring we all feel heard and \nunderstood, even if we do not always agree. I continue to admire his \nsteadfast dedication to the committee's long tradition of bipartisan \ncooperation.\n  Chairman Levin, you are a friend and great colleague, and I \nappreciate your support in both regards.\n  Consistent with the longstanding, bipartisan practice of the Armed \nServices Committee, this bill reflects our committee's continued strong \nsupport for the brave men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces. It is, \nfor the most part, an excellent bill, and I believe the committee has \nmade informed decisions regarding the authorization of over $680 \nbillion in base and overseas contingency operations funding for fiscal \nyear 2010. To a great extent, it reflects the priorities laid out by \nthe Secretary of Defense and the administration. It also reflects his \ndecision to end troubled programs and focus our limited resources on \ntoday's threats and the lessons we have learned after more than 8 years \nof war.\n  While the provisions in the bill demonstrate our commitment to \nprovide our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines the very best \navailable equipment, training, and support in order to provide them \nwith the best possible tools to undertake their missions, I believe we \ncan and should improve the bill in certain respects, and I will offer \namendments during our floor debate to do so.\n  The bill takes care of our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies by providing military members with a 3.4-percent pay raise. It \nexpands care for wounded warriors, supports families, and improves \nmilitary health care. It fully funds the growth of the Army and Marine \nCorps. Indeed, it authorizes further growth of the Army should that be \nnecessary to sustain our combat operations and further reduce the \nstrain on our forces.\n  The bill retains a balanced capability to deter aggression by \nincreasing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, \ninvesting in tactical aircraft and ships, and accelerating the purchase \nof mine-resistant all-terrain vehicles for our troops in Afghanistan.\n  This bill acknowledges that the United States has a vital national \nsecurity interest in ensuring that Afghanistan does not once again \nbecome a safe haven for terrorists. It supports a comprehensive \ncounterinsurgency strategy that is adequately resourced and funded by \nCongress based on identified needs to date and calls on the President \nto provide our U.S. military commanders with the military forces they \nrequire in order to succeed.\n  In Iraq, the committee ensures that the Congress will support the \nPresident's plan to redeploy combat forces while providing our \ncommanders the flexibility to hold hard-fought security gains and \nensure the safety of our forces.\n  One of the toughest issues this committee has taken a leading role \nin--both in past years and in this bill--is detainee policy. Since \n2005, this committee has developed legislation on detainee matters--\nsometimes in cooperation with the White House and sometimes over its \nstrong objections--because it is critical to our national security and \nthe preservation of our democratic principles.\n  This bill makes changes to the Military Commissions Act of 2006. We \nhave all--Senator Levin, Senator Graham, and others--worked closely \ntogether to address some of these difficult issues.\n  We have not resolved all of the challenges military commissions and \nother aspects of detainee policy present, but I believe we have made \nsubstantial progress that will strengthen the military commissions \nsystem during appellate review, provide a careful balance between \nprotection of national security and American values, and allow the \ntrials to move forward with greater efficiency toward a just and fair \nresult.\n  The committee also had a healthy debate on the future of missile \ndefense and our strategic deterrence capabilities. I welcome and share \nPresident Obama's aspirations, hope for a nuclear-free world. However, \nI believe we must also be prudent and practical in our reductions and \nremain vigilant about the global proliferation of advance missile \nand nuclear technology. While recently much of our national defense \nposture supports combating terrorists, we cannot grow complacent to the \ndanger that rogue nations such as North Korea and Iran pose to us--\nwhether it is missile launches within range of Hawaii or transferring \nweapons to Hezbollah or Hamas.\n\n  We must strengthen our commitment to enforcing the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty and the existing inspections regime. We must lead an \ninternational effort to interdict and prevent the world's most \ndangerous weapons from getting into the hands of the world's worst \nactors. I know there are varying views on the future of missile defense \nand our long-term strategic force posture, and I look forward to those \ndebates.\n  The bipartisan nature of our committee allows for candid discussion, \nlively debate, and, at times, disagreement. In that spirit, there are \nsome items in the bill I do not support and were not in the President's \nbudget request, such as continuation of the F-22 aircraft production \nline, funding for the Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine, and \nearmarks totaling approximately $6.4 billion. I was disappointed that, \nin spite of a veto threat from the White House, our committee chose to \nadd $1.75 billion for seven F-22 aircraft and at least $439 million for \nan alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. Neither the President \nnor the Pentagon asked for F-22s or the alternate engine in the budget \nrequest, nor were they part of the Service's Unfunded Priority List. \nSecretary Gates has consistently opposed the need for additional F-22 \naircraft and has indicated on a number of occasions that additional F-\n22 aircraft are not required to meet potential threats posed by near-\nterm adversaries. I strongly support Secretary Gates' decision to end \nthe F-22 production line at 187 aircraft and his commitment--and the \nPresident's commitment--to building a fifth-generation tactical fighter \ncapability by focusing on the timely delivery of the F-35 Joint Strike \nFighter to the Air Force, Navy, and Marines.\n  I look forward to lively debates on these and other important issues \nover the next few days.\n  I want to make very clear to my colleagues, the reason Senator Levin \nand I support the administration's and Secretary Gates' proposal to \nterminate at 187 the F-22 fighter aircraft is not because we believe we \nare going to leave the Nation undefended. We need the next-generation \nF-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Our armed services are counting on them. We \nwant to increase funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, an aircraft \nand weapon system that in the view of many experts--including my view--\nwould be far more capable of meeting the emerging threats of the \nfuture. So I want my colleagues to understand this debate is not just \nabout cutting a weapon system or bringing to an end, frankly, the line \nof a fighter aircraft; it is bringing to the end the line of one \nfighter aircraft and moving forward with another generation-- for all \nthree services, a very capable weapons system, one that meets the \nthreats of the 21st century.\n\n  So I think it is important that we look at the argument that will \ncome forward about jobs created or jobs lost.\n\n[[Page S7382]]\n\nThere will be jobs created, but the rationale for defense weapons \nsystems should never be the creation of jobs. It should only be about \nthe best way to defend this Nation in a very dangerous world.\n  So it is my understanding it is the wish of the chairman--and I join \nhim--that the first amendment for debate will be the administration \nproposal to finish the F-22 aircraft production line, saving some $1.75 \nbillion. So I look forward to that debate. I look forward to my \ncolleagues coming to the floor who would oppose that amendment. I hope \nmy colleagues understand we would like to get this done this week, if \npossible.\n  One more comment about the F-22 and the alternate engine for the \nJoint Strike Fighter: The President of the United States, I am told, \nand the Secretary of Defense have made it very clear a veto is very \nlikely if the Congress does not act to end production of the F-22 line. \nI would strongly recommend the President of the United States go ahead \nand veto this bill if the F-22 is included. At some point, with \nunemployment at 9.5 percent, with people not being able to stay in \ntheir jobs, with health care being less available and less affordable \nin America, we cannot afford to spend $1.7 billion additional taxpayer \ndollars for a system that can be replaced by a more capable weapons \nsystem and one that can defend our Nation with greater efficiency and \nless cost.\n  So I believe, frankly, there is more at stake than just whether we \nadopt the Levin-McCain amendment to terminate production of the F-22 as \noriginally scheduled. I think this is a much larger issue, and I hope \nmy colleagues understand the importance of it. I hope, if the Levin-\nMcCain amendment is defeated--I hope it is not because I believe \nSenator Levin and I can make a convincing argument on behalf of the \nadministration and the Secretary of Defense--but if it is, that there \nbe no doubt that the President of the United States would veto this \nbill.\n  I say that with great reluctance. I say it with almost a sense of \ndeep regret because there are so many things in this bill that are \nimportant to the defense of our Nation, whether it be the care and pay \nraises and hospitalization and care of our wounded warriors, along with \nmany other issues. But at some point this Congress and this Nation have \nto exercise the fiscal discipline the economic crisis we are in today \ndemands.\n  I again wish to thank Senator Levin for the long and close \nrelationship and work we have done together. Sometimes we have had very \nspirited but very informative discussions, and I know those will \ncontinue as we address this very important legislation before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nmaterial in support of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     July 8, 2009.\n       Dear Senator, The undersigned groups urge you to eliminate \n     funding for seven unneeded F-22 Raptor fighter jets from the \n     National Defense Authorization Act of 2010.\n       The addition of these F-22s demonstrates not only wasteful \n     spending that serves parochial interests but irresponsible, \n     smoke and mirrors budgeting. Just as our national security \n     strategy is based upon anticipating probable threats, our \n     defense budget must also rely upon realistic sources of \n     future income.\n       We are particularly concerned by recent media reports \n     indicating that funding for the F-22 will rely on anticipated \n     savings from defense procurement reform, even though the \n     Congressional Budget Office has said there is no basis for \n     determining these savings. Other sources report that the \n     money will also take hundreds of millions from operations and \n     maintenance accounts, a common budgeting gimmick that \n     directly impacts our soldiers in the field.\n       Additionally, we are dismayed by proposals to pay for F-22s \n     by taking $146 million from the Joint Strike Fighter's \n     management reserve fund. This fund, which has historically \n     experienced shortfalls, is needed to address any unexpected \n     issues in the program, and removing money may disrupt the \n     Joint Strike Fighter's development. Both the Secretary of \n     Defense and the Secretary of the Air Force have stressed that \n     the Joint Strike Fighter program is critical to our national \n     security, and both support ending F-22 procurement at 187 \n     planes.\n       In a June 24 Statement of Administration Policy, the \n     President's advisers said they would be forced to recommend a \n     veto if the National Defense Authorization Act includes \n     advance procurement of the F-22 or spending that would \n     seriously disrupt the Joint Strike Fighter program. \n     Procurement of additional F-22s does not serve our national \n     security needs and jeopardizes the Department of Defense's \n     higher priorities. We ask you to take a stand against \n     wasteful and irresponsible spending and support amendments \n     that will delete this funding from the 2010 defense \n     authorization bill.\n     Danielle Brian,\n       Project On Government Oversight.\n     Ryan Alexander,\n       Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Project On Government Oversight,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2009.\n     Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Armed Services Committee, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators, The Project On Government Oversight (POGO) \n     is writing to express our serious concerns about the \n     integrity of the process to add seven unneeded F-22s to the \n     Senate's version of the National Defense Authorization Act of \n     2010.\n       Numerous congressional hearings and press reports have \n     demonstrated that Air Force leadership supports Defense \n     Secretary Robert Gates' decision to end production of the F-\n     22 at 187 aircraft. But it appears that even after Air Force \n     leadership informed Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) of their \n     support of the Secretary's decision to end production of the \n     F-22, the Senator continued to pursue funding for the \n     program--made in Mariettta, Georgia--by soliciting a request \n     from Air National Guard Director Lieutenant General Harry M. \n     Wyatt III, which the Director not surprisingly provided.\n       The Director's request flies directly in the face of the \n     overarching strategic needs expressed by the Secretary of \n     Defense and repeated by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff as recently as this morning.\n       Beyond the appalling nature of this solicitation, POGO is \n     concerned by the ``Additional Views of Senator Chambliss'' \n     section of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2010 that encourages the Air Force to position F-22s in \n     Massachusetts, California, Oregon, Louisiana, Florida, \n     Alaska, and Hawaii. It appears that the specificity of this \n     request may have been a politically motivated decision to \n     garner support from the Senators and Governors of these \n     states.\n       National security spending should be based solely upon \n     strategic needs. Parochial interests have no place in our \n     national defense. Both the Secretary of Defense and Air Force \n     leadership have made it clear that continued procurement of \n     the F-22 does not support our national security. To sell our \n     national security as part of a horse-trade calls the \n     integrity of Congress's procurement process into question.\n       We would welcome an opportunity to share our concerns. \n     Sincerely,\n     Danielle Brian.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, July 9, 2009]\n\n                  A Jet Even the Military Doesn't Want\n\n                 (By Lawrence Korb and Krisila Benson)\n\n       Congress decided to end production of the costly F-22 \n     Raptor fighter jet at 187 planes after a debate on the 2009 \n     supplemental war budget last month. But the very next day, \n     the House Armed Services Committee stripped $369 million for \n     environmental cleanup from the fiscal 2010 budget to fund an \n     additional 12 F-22s. The Senate Armed Services Committee went \n     a step further, providing $1.75 billion for seven more F-22s \n     without clearly identifying the source of funds.\n       The F-22 costs nearly $150 million per plane--twice what \n     was projected at the outset of the program. Factoring in \n     development costs, the price tag increases to about $350 \n     million per plane for the current fleet of 187.\n       It may look as if the House Armed Services Committee has \n     added ``only'' $369 million. But given that it would provide \n     funds for 12 additional F-22s, each with a price tag of $150 \n     million (excluding development costs), the real cost to \n     American taxpayers would be about $2 billion.\n       The F-22 is the most capable air-to-air fighter in the Air \n     Force inventory. Yet it has only limited air-to-ground attack \n     capabilities, which makes it unsuitable for today's counter-\n     insurgency operations. In fact, the F-22 has never been used \n     in either Iraq or Afghanistan. It was designed to fight next-\n     generation Soviet fighters that never materialized, and, as \n     Defense Secretary Robert Gates has noted, it is nearly \n     useless for irregular warfare.\n       The F-22 has no known enemy. It is the most advanced \n     fighter plane in the world, and there are no other planes \n     that could threaten its supremacy in air-to-air combat. The \n     United States already has 187 F-22s on hand or on order--a \n     silver-bullet force that is more than adequate to deal with \n     any likely\n\n[[Page S7383]]\n\n     contingency. In fact, Gates said that even if he had $50 \n     billion more to spend, he would not buy any more F-22s.\n       The Air Force leadership itself no longer supports \n     continued production of the F-22. Air Force Secretary Michael \n     Donley and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz have \n     publicly said they would prefer to move on. The plane is not \n     in the Defense Department's proposed budget for fiscal 2010 \n     (which begins in October). It's not even on the Air Force's \n     list of unfunded requests, which consists of items excluded \n     from the budget for which it would nevertheless like \n     funding--a wish list of sorts.\n       Why are congressional committees willing to override the \n     military and civilian leadership of the Pentagon on the F-22? \n     The latest in a string of arguments offered by proponents in \n     Congress is the need to protect our industrial base--as if \n     our technical capacity to develop and produce fighter planes \n     is in immediate, grave danger. This argument overlooks the \n     fact that the Obama administration's fiscal 2010 budget \n     includes 28 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters--planes better suited \n     for air-to-ground combat.\n       Moreover, as has been noted by the chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, the era of producing \n     manned aircraft is coming to an end. Mullen correctly points \n     out that there will be a shift toward unmanned aircraft.\n       The F-22 is not an isolated case of unnecessary \n     congressional equipment purchases. Congress has added $2.7 \n     billion to the 2009 supplemental budget to buy more C-17 and \n     C-130 aircraft--planes neither requested nor needed by the \n     Defense Department. It also added $600 million to the 2010 \n     budget for an unneeded alternate engine for the F-35, which \n     will mean buying 50 fewer aircraft.\n       An administration policy statement issued on June 24 said \n     the president's senior advisers would recommend a veto of a \n     bill containing funding for more F-22s. If the entire \n     Congress approves either of the armed services committees' \n     recommendations on the F-22, President Obama should indeed \n     veto the bill. Only then will Congress get the message that \n     in this era of exploding national debt, we cannot waste \n     billions on unnecessary military equipment.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

ELIMINATION OF F-22A AIRCRAFT PROCUREMENT FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Elimination of Funding.--The amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 103(1) for procurement for the Air \n     Force for aircraft procurement is hereby decreased by \n     $1,750,000,000, with the amount of the decrease to be derived \n     from amounts available for F-22A aircraft procurement.\n       (b) Restored Funding.--\n       (1) Operation and maintenance, army.--The amount authorized \n     to be appropriated by section 301(1) for operation and \n     maintenance for the Army is hereby increased by $350,000,000.\n       (2) Operation and maintenance, navy.--The amount authorized \n     to be appropriated by section 301(2) for operation and \n     maintenance for the Navy is hereby increased by $100,000,000.\n       (3) Operation and maintenance, air force.--The amount \n     authorized to be appropriated by section 301(4) for operation \n     and maintenance for the Air Force is hereby increased by \n     $250,000,000.\n       (4) Operation and maintenance, defense-wide.--The amount \n     authorized to be appropriated by section 301(5) for operation \n     and maintenance for Defense-wide activities is hereby \n     increased by $150,000,000.\n       (5) Military personnel.--The amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 421(a)(1) for military personnel is \n     hereby increased by $400,000,000.\n       (6) Division a and division b generally.--In addition to \n     the amounts specified in paragraphs (1) through (5), the \n     total amount authorized to be appropriated for the Department \n     of Defense by divisions A and B is hereby increased by \n     $500,000,000.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment is the F-22 amendment, which \nwould delete the $1.75 billion in the bill that was added in a very \nclose vote in the Armed Services Committee, with strong opposition of \nthe administration.\n  I may say that this is not the first administration that has \nattempted to end the F-22 line. President Bush also attempted to end \nthis line at 183 planes.\n  Unless my friend from Arizona wants to speak, I will ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate recess until 1 p.m.\n  Mr. McCAIN. No, I will not speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7383-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Madam President, the pending amendment Senator McCain and \nI have offered would strike the $1.75 billion that was added to the \nbill by a very close vote in committee to purchase additional F-22 \naircraft that the military does not want, that the Secretary of Defense \ndoes not want, that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and all the Joint \nChiefs do not want, that President Bush did not want, that the prior \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs did not want, and they all say the same \nthing: The expenditure of these funds jeopardizes other programs which \nare important, and they provide aircraft we do not need.\n  These are fairly powerful statements from our leaders, both civilian \nand military leaders, in this country. I hope the Senate will heed them \nand reverse the action that was taken on a very close vote in the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  We received a few minutes ago a letter from the Secretary of Defense \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A letter is on its way \nalso from the President. When I get that letter, I will, of course, \nread the President's letter. But for the time being, let me start with \nthe letter we have received from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, as \nwell as the Secretary of Defense, because it is succinct. It is to the \npoint. It states the case for not adding additional F-22s as well as \nanything I have seen.\n\n       Dear Senators Levin and McCain: We are writing to express \n     our strong objection to the provisions in the Fiscal Year \n     2010 National Defense Authorization Act allocating $1.75 \n     billion for seven additional F-22s. I believe it is \n     critically important to complete the F-22 buy at 187--the \n     program of record since 2005, plus four additional aircraft.\n       There is no doubt that the F-22 is an important capability \n     for our Nation's defense. To meet future scenarios, however, \n     the Department of Defense has determined that 187 aircraft \n     are sufficient, especially considering the future roles of \n     Unmanned Aerial Systems and the significant number of 5th \n     generation Stealth F-35s coming on-line in our combat air \n     portfolio.\n       It is important to note that the F-35 is a half generation \n     newer aircraft than the F-22, and more capable in a number of \n     areas such as electronic warfare and combating enemy air \n     defenses. To sustain U.S. overall air dominance, the \n     Department's plan is to buy roughly 500 F-35s over the next \n     five years and more than 2,400 over the life of the program.\n       Furthermore, under this plan, the U.S. by 2020 is projected \n     to have some 2,500 manned fighter aircraft. Almost 1,100 of \n     them will be 5th generation F-35s and F-22s. China, by \n     contrast, is expected to have only slightly more than half as \n     many manned fighter aircraft by 2010, none of them 5th \n     generation.\n       The F-22 program proposed in the President's budget \n     reflects the judgment of two different Presidents, two \n     different Secretaries of Defense, three chairmen of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, and the current secretary and chief of staff \n     of the Air Force.\n       If the Air Force is forced to buy additional F-22s beyond \n     what has been requested, it will\n\n[[Page S7384]]\n\n     come at the expense of other Air Force and Department of \n     Defense priorities--and require deferring capabilities in \n     areas we believe are much more critical for our Nation's \n     defense.\n\n  The letter concludes with the following very pointed paragraph:\n\n       For all these reasons, we strongly believe that the time \n     has come to close the F-22 production line. If the Congress \n     sends legislation to the President that requires the \n     acquisition of additional F-22 aircraft beyond Fiscal Year \n     2009, the Secretary of Defense will strongly recommend he \n     veto it.\n\n  It is signed by Secretary of Defense Gates and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff Mullen.\n  The determination of the Department of Defense to end the production \nof the F-22 is not new. Secretary Rumsfeld, President Bush, as well as \nthe current President and Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, are recommending the same thing. We have testimony on the \nrecord at the Armed Services Committee from the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, both urging us \nstrongly to end the production of the F-22.\n  Let me read, first, Secretary Gates's testimony on May 14 of this \nyear:\n\n       . . . [T]he fact is that the F-22 is not going to be the \n     only aircraft in the TACAIR arsenal, and it does not include \n     the fact that, for example, we are going to be building, \n     ramping up to 48 Reapers unmanned aerial vehicles in this \n     budget.\n\n  The F-35, he said, is critically important to take into account.\n\n     . . . and the fact is that based on the information given to \n     me before these hearings, the first training squadron for the \n     F-35 at Eglin Air Force Base is on track for 2011. The \n     additional money for the F-35 in this budget is to provide \n     for a more robust developmental and test program over the \n     next few years to ensure that the program does stay on the \n     anticipated budget.\n       You can say irrespective of previous administrations, but \n     the fact remains two Presidents, two Secretaries of Defense, \n     and three Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have \n     supported the 183 build when you look at the entire TACAIR \n     inventory of the United States.\n       And when you look at potential threats, for example, in \n     2020, the United States will have 2,700 TACAIR. . . .\n\n  The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Cartwright, just a few \ndays ago, on July 9, told the Senate Armed Services Committee the \nfollowing:\n\n       I was probably one of the more vocal and ardent supporters \n     for the termination of the F-22 production. The reason's \n     twofold. First, there is a study in the Joint Staff that we \n     just completed and partnered with the Air Force on that, \n     number one, said that proliferating within the United States \n     military fifth-generation fighters to all three services was \n     going to be more significant than having them based solidly \n     in just one service, because of the way we deploy and because \n     of the diversity of our deployments.\n       Point number two is, in the production of the F-35 Joint \n     Strike Fighter, the first aircraft variant will support the \n     Air Force replacement of their F-16s and F-15s. It is a very \n     capable aircraft. It is 10 years newer--\n\n  He is referring here to the F-35--\n\n       It is 10 years newer in advancement in avionics and \n     capabilities in comparison to the F-22. It is a better, more \n     rounded, capable fighter.\n\n  He goes on relative to point No. 2:\n\n     . . . the second variant is the variant that goes to the \n     Marine Corps. The Marine Corps made a conscious decision to \n     forgo buying the F-18E/F in order to wait for the F-35. So \n     the F-35 variant that has the VSTOL capability, which goes to \n     the Marine Corps, is number two coming off the line. And the \n     third variant coming off the line is the Navy variant, the \n     carrier-suitable variant.\n       Another thing that weighed heavily, and certainly my \n     calculus, was the input of the combatant commanders. And one \n     of the highest issues of concern from the combatant \n     commanders is our ability to conduct electronic warfare. That \n     electronic warfare is carried on board the F-18. And so \n     looking at the lines we would have in hot production, number \n     one priority was to get fifth-generation fighters to all of \n     the services; number two priority was to ensure that we had a \n     hot-production line in case there was a problem; and number \n     three was to have that hot-production line producing the F-18 \n     Gs which support the electronic-warfare fight.\n\n  General Cartwright concluded:\n\n       So those issues stacked up to a solid position . . . that \n     it was time to terminate the F-22. It is a good airplane. It \n     is a fifth-generation fighter. But we needed to proliferate \n     those fifth-generation fighters to all of the services. And \n     we need to ensure that we were capable of continuing to \n     produce aircraft for the electronic-warfare capability. And \n     that was the F-18. In the F-18 we can also produce front-line \n     fighters that are more than capable of addressing any threat \n     that we'll face for the next five to 10 years.\n\n  The letter to which I referred from President Obama has now been \nreceived. I know Senator McCain has received a similar letter. I will \nread the one I have just received:\n\n       Dear Senator Levin: I share with you a deep commitment to \n     protecting our Nation and the men and women who serve it in \n     the Armed Forces. Your leadership on national security is \n     unrivaled, and I value your counsel on these matters.\n       It is with this in mind that I am writing to you about S. \n     1390, the Senate Armed Services Committee-reported National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, and in \n     particular to convey my strong support for terminating \n     procurement of additional F-22 fighter aircraft when the \n     current multiyear procurement contract ends. As Secretary \n     Gates and the military leadership have determined, we do not \n     need these planes. That is why I will veto any bill that \n     supports acquisition of F-22s beyond the 187 already funded \n     by Congress.\n       In December 2004, the Department of Defense determined that \n     183 F-22s would be sufficient to meet its military needs. \n     This determination was not made casually. The Department \n     conducted several analyses which support this position based \n     on the length and type of wars that the Department thinks it \n     might have to fight in the future, and an estimate of the \n     future capabilities of likely adversaries. To continue to \n     procure additional F-22s would be to waste valuable resources \n     that should be more usefully employed to provide our troops \n     with the weapons that they actually do need.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       I urge you to approve our request to end the production of \n     the F-22.\n\n  This is no longer a simple recommendation of the President's staff \nthat they would make to the President should we add additional F-\n22s. This is now clear. It is crystal clear, and there is no way a \nPresident of the United States can say more directly than President \nObama has said this afternoon that he will veto any bill that supports \nacquisition of F-22s beyond the 187 already funded by Congress. That \nshould clear the air on a very important issue, and that is would the \nPresident veto this bill if it contained the extra F-22s the military \ndoesn't want or wouldn't he. That speculation is no longer out there. \nIt is now resolved, and it ought to be resolved in our minds, and we \nought to realize then that those who support the added F-22s are \nsupporting a provision which, if it is included, will result in the \nveto of a bill which is critically important to the men and women of \nour military and to their missions and operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n\n  Madam President, not only does the amendment which was adopted by the \ncommittee on a very close vote add planes which our uniform--our \nmilitary--and civilian leaders do not want, and say we do not need, but \nthe amendment also pays for these additional F-22s in the following \nways:\n  No. 1, it cuts operation and maintenance. No. 2, it cuts civilian pay \nfunds that need to be available. No. 3, it also reduces the balances \nthat have to be kept available for military personnel. And No. 4, it \nassumes that there are going to be near-term savings in fiscal year \n2010 from the acquisition reform legislation that we recently adopted \nand the business process reengineering provision that is in the bill \nthat was adopted by the Armed Services Committee.\n  Each of those places cannot afford those cuts. We are talking here \nabout operations and maintenance. This is the readiness accounts of our \nArmed Forces. These are the pay accounts of our Armed Forces. And in \nthe case of at least one of the four sources, the assumption is \nunwarranted that we are going to make savings this year from the \nacquisition reform legislation, the very focus of which was to make \nchanges in acquisition reform in the short term, which may actually \ncost us money to save money--significant money--in the long term. But \nthere is no assessment I know of that says we are going to make savings \nin 2010 from our acquisition reform legislation.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, because she was a strong supporter of \nthis acquisition reform, as were all of us on the Armed Services \nCommittee, we believed very strongly that we had to make these changes \nin the way in which we acquire equipment and weapons. Senator McCain \nhas been fighting this battle for as long as I can remember--change \nthese acquisition reform procedures--and I have been involved for about \nas long as I can remember as well in these efforts. The Armed Services \nCommittee put a lot of energy in the acquisition reform that we adopted\n\n[[Page S7385]]\n\nunanimously and was ultimately passed and signed by the President. But \nto say we can't make savings this year in no way knocks the importance \nof that acquisition reform or minimizes the importance of that \nacquisition reform. The fact is, as we said at the time, there are \ngoing to be major savings, we believe, from that reform, but they are \nnot going to come in the short term. They are surely not coming in \n2010. Yet the amendment which added the F-22s made an assumption that \nthere are going to be savings in 2010 from the acquisition reform \nlegislation.\n  Let me spend a minute on some of the other sources of funds for the \nF-22, unobligated balances for operations and maintenance--O We \nalready reduced by $100 million the funds in those accounts, and we did \nso consistent with the report and assessment of the Government \nAccountability Office. So we acted in a way that would not affect \nreadiness, would not affect O, and we had the guidance there of the \nGovernment Accountability Office. But what the amendment did that added \nthe F-22s is reduced by $700 million more those O accounts.\n  The original bill we adopted avoided cutting O funds from the Army \nand from the Marines because readiness rates across the board have \ncontinued to suffer after several years in combat. Yet half of the \nreduction made by the amendment which added the F-22s was assessed \nagainst O Army. It is a dangerous thing to do. It is an unwise thing \nto do.\n  We also now face an increase in the price of oil--an increase above \nwhat the accounts assumed would be the cost of energy. So we have an \nadditional challenge to those O accounts which would be made far more \ndifficult and those reductions far more problematic in that regard as \nwell.\n  Another source of funds which was used to add the F-22s was in the \ncivilian pay accounts. Civilian pay had already been reduced by almost \n$400 million in the Air Force, and we did that consistent with, again, \nthe assessments of the Government Accountability Office. Further, \ncivilian pay reductions of $150 million to help fund the F-22s can have \na negative effect on readiness, and we simply cannot take that risk. \nAlso, that cut does not take into effect the likely additional civilian \npay raise that we will have to absorb in these budgets if, as is \nlikely, using historical acts, Congress increases the civilian pay \nraise to match the increased military pay raise.\n  Deep cuts in funds available for civilian pay will have that effect, \nbut also these cuts will undermine the Secretary's efforts and our \nefforts to hire significant numbers of new employees for the \nacquisition workforce, it is going to set back our effort to implement \nacquisition reform, and it is going to cost us a lot more money in the \nlong run.\n  Another source of the money for the additional F-22s came from the \nmilitary personnel accounts. Our bill already has taken $400 million in \nunobligated balances from the military personnel accounts in order to \npay for additional personnel pay and benefits, and we did that, again, \nin line with the recommendation of the Government Accountability \nOffice. The Department's top line, so called, for military personnel \nwas intact until the committee adopted the F-22 increase amendment. And \nif we reduce military personnel accounts for nonpersonnel matters, it \nis going to result in a military personnel authorization that is less \nthan was requested, and it is going to hinder the Department's ability \nto execute its military personnel funding in the year 2010. That is \ngoing to be particularly problematic this year, because the Army and \nMarine Corps have moved their increased end strengths to the base \nbudget. They did that because we urged them to do that.\n  So the cost of personnel continues to rise, and yet one of the \nsources of the funding for the F-22 increase came from that very \nmilitary personnel account.\n  There is another impact of the amendment--which was barely adopted in \nthe Armed Services Committee--and that is it is going to cause the \nDepartment of Defense to cut back in so-called nondirect pay areas, \nsuch as bonuses or other personnel support measures, which could have a \nvery significant impact--a negative impact--on the long-term management \nof the all-volunteer force. It is very likely that the Department will \nthen have to either seek a reprogramming during the next fiscal year to \ncover personnel costs or they may even have to file a supplemental \nrequest.\n  We have worked hard as a Congress to get the administration--any \nadministration, as we tried during the Bush years and we try again \nduring the Obama years--to make sure that its budget request is solid; \nthat it will not require reprogramming; that it will not require a \nsupplemental request. With this amendment--which was again adopted by \njust two votes in the Armed Services Committee--we are jeopardizing \nthat longstanding effort on the part of Congress to make sure that the \nbudget request of the administration in fact is a realistic request \nwhen it comes to the various accounts. And particularly this year, as \nthe Army and Marine Corps have moved their increased end strengths to \nthe base budget, as we have pressed them to do for many years, it is a \nmistake for us to be taking funds from that account.\n  I have talked about acquisition reform and the fact that the \namendment which was adopted in committee assumed savings from \nacquisition reform. I have pointed out, and will not repeat, that while \nthe acquisition reform, strongly supported obviously by our committee \nand by the Congress, is likely to result in major savings, it cannot be \nassumed to produce savings in the short term.\n  I hope this body is going to adopt the Levin-McCain amendment. Two \nadministrations now have made an effort to end the F-22 line. This is \nnot a partisan issue. This is a Republican and a Democratic \nadministration that have made this effort. Our top civilian leaders and \nour top uniform leaders are unanimous. The Secretary of Defense, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs have \njoined in supporting the President's request, just as they did \nPresident Bush's determination to end the F-22 line. We have to make \nsome choices in this budget and in other budgets, and this is a choice \nwhich our military is urging us to make.\n  We all know the effect that this has on jobs in many of our States, \nand that varies from State to State, but probably a majority of our \nStates will have some jobs impacted by a termination of the F-22 line. \nBut we cannot continue to produce weapon systems forever. They have a \npurpose. They have a mission. And those missions and those purposes can \nbe carried out by 187 F-22s. That is not me speaking as Chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, that is not Senator McCain speaking as the \nranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, that is both of us \nsaying that we must make difficult choices and we have to build the \nsystems we need. The F-35 is a system which all of the services \nneed. It cuts across the services. It has greater capabilities in \nelectronics than does the F-22. It is a half of a generation advance on \nthe F-22. This is not to minimize the importance of the F-22. We have \nand will have 187 in our inventory. While not minimizing the importance \nof the F-22, it points out how important it is that we modernize, and \nin order to do that--and that means the F-35--we have to at some point \nsay we have enough F-22s. We tried it last year. We could not succeed \nlast year. But this year, not only does the President oppose the \nincrease, as did President Bush, President Obama has now said in \nwriting today that he will veto a bill that contains the unneeded F-\n22s.\n\n  Our men and women in the military deserve a defense authorization \nbill. This has a pay increase even larger than that requested. It has \nbenefits that are essential. It has bonuses and other programs to help \nrecruitment and retention. It helps our families. It modernizes our \nweapon systems. At some point, we have to acknowledge that a weapon \nsystem production, extremely valuable, has come to a logical end and \nthat it is time to then pick up its continuity with a different plane, \na different weapon system which will benefit our military and support \nthe men and women in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senator Levin for his eloquent statement and \ncomments concerning this amendment. I thank him for his leadership on \nit.\n\n[[Page S7386]]\n\n  I have been for many years engaged in the Senate consideration of the \nDefense authorization bill. This is probably one of the most \ninteresting--I think my colleague will agree--because we are beginning \nwith a measure that, if not passed, will result in a veto by the \nPresident of the United States of America.\n  I appreciate this letter the President of the United States sent to \nSenator Levin and to me and to the entire Senate. I appreciate the \nPresident's courage because right now the votes are not there. Right \nnow I think my friend from Michigan would agree the votes are not there \nto pass this amendment.\n  What the President has said, not only do we need to stop the \nproduction of the F-22, of which we have already constructed 187, but \nwe need to do business differently. We need to have a change in the way \nwe do business in order to save the taxpayers billions of dollars spent \nunnecessarily. So this will be kind of an interesting moment in the \nhistory of a new Presidency and a new administration and, frankly, an \nold Secretary of Defense. I say ``old'' in the respect that he \nobviously covers both administrations. I do not know of a Secretary of \nDefense who has had more appreciation and admiration from both sides of \nthe aisle than Secretary Gates. I appreciate very much Secretary Gates' \nletter, also, where he describes in some detail, as does the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs, why we need to have this amendment passed to \nremove the additional F-22s. I want to emphasize ``additional.''\n  I wish to pay special appreciation to President Obama for taking a \nvery courageous step in making it very clear, as he says:\n\n       As Secretary Gates and the military leadership have \n     determined, we do not need these planes. That is why I will \n     veto any acquisition of F-22s beyond the 187 already funded \n     by Congress.\n\n  The statement is very clear. I appreciate it. I hope it has a \nsignificant impact on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Again, my appreciation to President Obama and my appreciation to the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as the Secretary of \nDefense, who lay out in more detail why it is that we need to eliminate \nthis unneeded $1.75 billion for seven additional F-22s.\n  I emphasize to my colleagues that these funds will go to the \nacquisition of the F-35, the Joint Strike Fighter, which when produced \nwill provide a careful balance between the air superiority provided by \nthe F-22 and the other capabilities of the Joint Strike Fighter, which \nis also badly needed. This argument is not about the capability of the \nF-22, although that will be brought to the floor and I intend to talk a \nlittle bit about many of the difficulties the F-22 has had. But I would \nalso like to point out that the F-22 has never flown in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. That is a remarkable statement. It has been in production \nsince December 2005. We are in July of 2009, and the F-22 has yet to \nfly in combat in the two wars in which we are engaged. It has been \nplagued with some significant maintenance problems, not to mention \ndramatic cost overruns.\n  This is not an argument about whether the F-22 is an important \ncapability for our Nation's defense. It is. The question is, When do we \nstop buying them?\n  I quote from the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff letter:\n\n       It is important to note that the F-35 is a half generation \n     newer aircraft than the F-22, and more capable in a number of \n     areas such as electronic warfare and combating enemy air \n     defenses. To sustain U.S. overall air dominance, the \n     Department's plan is to buy roughly 500 F-35s over the next \n     five years and more than 2,400 over the life of the program.\n\n  So I think arguments that may be made on the floor that somehow we \nare curtailing or inhibiting the ability of the U.S. Air Force to carry \nout its responsibilities to defend this Nation are contradicted at \nleast by the views of the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and \nliterally every other individual or position that is involved in this \ndebate.\n  The Secretary of Defense goes on to say:\n\n       Furthermore, under this plan the United States by 2020 is \n     projected to have some 2,500 manned fighter aircraft. Almost \n     1,100 of them will be fifth generation F-35s and F-22s.\n\n  There is going to be a lot of debate and discussion about China and \nits emerging capabilities.\n  The Secretary of Defense goes on to say:\n\n       China, by contrast, is expected to have only slightly more \n     than half as many manned fighter aircraft by 2020, none of \n     them fifth generation.\n\n  I am concerned about the rising military capabilities of China. They \nare increasing their naval and maritime capabilities. They are \nincreasing the efficiency of their army and their entire overall \ninventories, and it is of great concern. But with the combination of \nthe F-35 and the F-22, we will clearly have a significant advantage \nover the Chinese for some period of time. That is not to in any way \ndenigrate the long-term aspect of the Chinese military buildup. But in \nthe short term, this is the best way to make sure we maintain complete \nsuperiority with a mixture of the F-35 and the F-22.\n  The Secretary goes on to say:\n\n       The F-22 program proposed in the President's budget \n     reflects the judgment of two different Presidents, two \n     different Secretaries of Defense, three chairmen of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, and the current secretary and chief of staff \n     of the Air Force.\n\n  My colleagues are going to come to the floor and say the Chairman of \nthe Air National Guard says we need additional F-22s. We do not \ndisregard that opinion, but we do weigh that opinion as opposed to the \nopinion and judgment of the individuals whom I just cited.\n\n       If the Air Force is forced to buy additional F-22s beyond \n     what has been requested, it will come at the expense of other \n     Air Force and Department of Defense priorities--and require \n     deferring capabilities in areas we believe are much more \n     critical for our Nation's defense.\n\n  There is no free lunch. There is no free $1.75 billion. There is no \nfree money. Here we are with a projected $1.8 trillion deficit, a \ndecrease overall in some defense areas that is coming sooner or later, \nand we cannot afford a $1.75 billion procurement that is not absolutely \nneeded.\n  Again, I wish to state very clearly, F-22 is a good airplane. The \nfact that it has not flown in Iraq or Afghanistan is telling, and some \nof the issues I will mention later on are telling. But this is not an \nattack on the F-22. What it is is an assessment of the Nation's \nnational security needs and what we need in its inventory to maintain \nour superiority over all other nations and meet various threats ranging \nfrom radical Islamic extremism to the conventional capabilities of a \nrising power in the east.\n  Again, I wish to say thanks for the great leadership of our Secretary \nof Defense and Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, and the importance they place on this amendment.\n  I would like to refer my colleagues to an article that appeared last \nFriday in the Washington Post. It was entitled ``Premier U.S. Fighter \nJet Has Major Shortcomings.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n            Premier U.S. Fighter Jet Has Major Shortcomings\n\n                         (By R. Jeffrey Smith)\n\n       The United States' top fighter jet, the Lockheed Martin F-\n     22, has recently required more than 30 hours of maintenance \n     for every hour in the skies, pushing its hourly cost of \n     flying to more than $44,000, a far higher figure than for the \n     warplane it replaces, confidential Pentagon test results \n     show.\n       The aircraft's radar-absorbing metallic skin is the \n     principal cause of its maintenance troubles, with unexpected \n     shortcomings--such as vulnerability to rain and other \n     abrasion--challenging Air Force and contractor technicians \n     since the mid-1990s, according to Pentagon officials, \n     internal documents and a former engineer.\n       While most aircraft fleets become easier and less costly to \n     repair as they mature, key maintenance trends for the F-22 \n     have been negative in recent years, and on average from \n     October last year to this May, just 55 percent of the \n     deployed F-22 fleet has been available to fulfill missions \n     guarding U.S. airspace, the Defense Department acknowledged \n     this week. The F-22 has never been flown over Iraq or \n     Afghanistan.\n       Sensitive information about troubles with the nation's \n     foremost air-defense fighter is emerging in the midst of a \n     fight between the Obama administration and the Democrat-\n     controlled Congress over whether the program should be halted \n     next year at 187\n\n[[Page S7387]]\n\n     planes, far short of what the Air Force and the F-22's \n     contractors around the country had anticipated.\n       ``It is a disgrace that you can fly a plane [an average of] \n     only 1.7 hours before it gets a critical failure'' that \n     jeopardizes success of the aircraft's mission, said a Defense \n     Department critic of the plane who is not authorized to speak \n     on the record. Other skeptics inside the Pentagon note that \n     the planes, designed 30 years ago to combat a Cold War \n     adversary, have cost an average of $350 million apiece and \n     say they are not a priority in the age of small wars and \n     terrorist threats.\n       But other defense officials--reflecting sharp divisions \n     inside the Pentagon about the wisdom of ending one of the \n     largest arms programs in U.S. history--emphasize the plane's \n     unsurpassed flying abilities, express renewed optimism that \n     the troubles will abate and say the plane is worth the \n     unexpected costs.\n       Votes by the House and Senate armed services committees \n     last month to spend $369 million to $1.75 billion more to \n     keep the F-22 production line open were propelled by mixed \n     messages from the Air Force--including a quiet campaign for \n     the plane that includes snazzy new Lockheed videos for key \n     lawmakers--and intense political support from states where \n     the F-22's components are made. The full House ratified the \n     vote on June 25, and the Senate is scheduled to begin \n     consideration of F-22 spending Monday.\n       After deciding to cancel the program, Defense Secretary \n     Robert M. Gates called the $65 billion fleet a ``niche \n     silver-bullet solution'' to a major aerial war threat that \n     remains distant. He described the House's decision as ``a big \n     problem'' and has promised to urge President Obama to veto \n     the military spending bill if the full Senate retains F-22 \n     funding.\n       The administration's position is supported by military \n     reform groups that have long criticized what they consider to \n     be poor procurement practices surrounding the F-22, and by \n     former senior Pentagon officials such as Thomas Christie, the \n     top weapons testing expert from 2001 to 2005. Christie says \n     that because of the plane's huge costs, the Air Force lacks \n     money to modernize its other forces adequately and has \n     ``embarked on what we used to call unilateral disarmament.''\n       David G. Ahern, a senior Pentagon procurement official who \n     helps oversee the F-22 program, said in an interview that ``I \n     think we've executed very well,'' and attributed its troubles \n     mostly to the challenge of meeting ambitious goals with \n     unstable funding.\n       A spokeswoman for Lockheed added that the F-22 has \n     ``unmatched capabilities, sustainability and affordability'' \n     and that any problems are being resolved in close \n     coordination with the Air Force.\n       Designed during the early 1980s to ensure long-term \n     American military dominance of the skies, the F-22 was \n     conceived to win dogfights with advanced Soviet fighters that \n     Russia is still trying to develop.\n       Lt. Gen. Harry M. Wyatt III, director of the Air National \n     Guard, said in a letter this week to Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-\n     Ga.) that he likes the F-22 because its speed and electronics \n     enable it to handle ``a full spectrum of threats'' that \n     current defensive aircraft ``are not capable of addressing.''\n       ``There is really no comparison to the F-22,'' said Air \n     Force Maj. David Skalicky, a 32-year-old former F-15 pilot \n     who now shows off the F-22's impressive maneuverability at \n     air shows. Citing the critical help provided by its computers \n     in flying radical angles of attack and tight turns, he said \n     ``it is one of the easiest planes to fly, from the pilot's \n     perspective.''\n       Its troubles have been detailed in dozens of Government \n     Accountability Office reports and Pentagon audits. But Pierre \n     Sprey, a key designer in the 1970s and 1980s of the F-16 and \n     A-10 warplanes, said that from the beginning, the Air Force \n     designed it to be ``too big to fail, that is, to be \n     cancellation-proof.''\n       Lockheed farmed out more than 1,000 subcontracts to vendors \n     in more than 40 states, and Sprey--now a prominent critic of \n     the plane--said that by the time skeptics ``could point out \n     the failed tests, the combat flaws, and the exploding costs, \n     most congressmen were already defending their subcontractors' \n     '' revenues.\n       John Hamre, the Pentagon's comptroller from 1993 to 1997, \n     says the department approved the plane with a budget it knew \n     was too low because projecting the real costs would have been \n     politically unpalatable on Capitol Hill.\n       ``We knew that the F-22 was going to cost more than the Air \n     Force thought it was going to cost and we budgeted the lower \n     number, and I was there,'' Hamre told the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee in April. ``I'm not proud of it,'' Hamre \n     added in a recent interview.\n       When limited production began in 2001, the plane was \n     ``substantially behind its plan to achieve reliability \n     goals,'' the GAO said in a report the following year. \n     Structural problems that turned up in subsequent testing \n     forced retrofits to the frame and changes in the fuel flow. \n     Computer flaws, combined with defective software diagnostics, \n     forced the frequent retesting of millions of lines of code, \n     said two Defense officials with access to internal reports.\n       Skin problems--often requiring re-gluing small surfaces \n     that can take more than a day to dry--helped force more \n     frequent and time-consuming repairs, according to the \n     confidential data drawn from tests conducted by the \n     Pentagon's independent Office of Operational Test and \n     Evaluation between 2004 and 2008.\n       Over the four-year period, the F-22's average maintenance \n     time per hour of flight grew from 20 hours to 34, with skin \n     repairs accounting for more than half of that time--and more \n     than half the hourly flying costs--last year, according to \n     the test and evaluation office.\n       The Air Force says the F-22 cost $44,259 per flying hour in \n     2008; the Office of the Secretary of Defense said the figure \n     was $49,808. The F-15, the F-22's predecessor, has a fleet \n     average cost of $30,818.\n       Darrol Olsen, a specialist in stealth coatings who worked \n     at Lockheed's testing laboratory in Marietta, Ga., from 1995 \n     to 1999, said the current troubles are unsurprising. In a \n     lawsuit filed under seal in 2007, he charged the company with \n     violating the False Claims Act for ordering and using \n     coatings that it knew were defective while hiding the \n     failings from the Air Force.\n       He has cited a July 1998 report that said test results \n     ``yield the same problems as documented previously'' in the \n     skin's quality and durability, and another in December that \n     year saying, ``Baseline coatings failed.'' A Lockheed \n     briefing that September assured the Air Force that the effort \n     was ``meeting requirements with optimized products.''\n       ``When I got into this thing . . . I could not believe the \n     compromises'' made by Lockheed to meet the Air Force's \n     request for quick results, said Olsen, who had a top-secret \n     clearance. ``I suggested we go to the Air Force and tell them \n     we had some difficulties . . . and they would not do that. I \n     was squashed. I knew from the get-go that this material was \n     bad, that this correcting it in the field was never going to \n     work.''\n       Olsen, who said Lockheed fired him over a medical leave, \n     heard from colleagues as recently as 2005 that problems \n     persisted with coatings and radar absorbing materials in the \n     plane's skin, including what one described as vulnerability \n     to rain. Invited to join his lawsuit, the Justice Department \n     filed a court notice last month saying it was not doing so \n     ``at this time''--a term that means it is still investigating \n     the matter, according to a department spokesman.\n       Ahern said the Pentagon could not comment on the \n     allegations. Lockheed spokeswoman Mary Jo Polidore said that \n     ``the issues raised in the complaint are at least 10 years \n     old,'' and that the plane meets or exceeds requirements \n     established by the Air Force. ``We deny Mr. Olsen's \n     allegations and will vigorously defend this matter.''\n       There have been other legal complications. In late 2005, \n     Boeing learned of defects in titanium booms connecting the \n     wings to the plane, which the company, in a subsequent \n     lawsuit against its supplier, said posed the risk of \n     ``catastrophic loss of the aircraft.'' But rather than shut \n     down the production line--an act that would have incurred \n     large Air Force penalties--Boeing reached an accord with the \n     Air Force to resolve the problem through increased \n     inspections over the life of the fleet, with expenses to be \n     mostly paid by the Air Force.\n       Sprey said engineers who worked on it told him that because \n     of Lockheed's use of hundreds of subcontractors, quality \n     control was so poor that workers had to create a ``shim \n     line'' at the Georgia plant where they retooled badly \n     designed or poorly manufactured components. ``Each plane \n     wound up with all these hand-fitted parts that caused huge \n     fits in maintenance,'' he said. ``They were not \n     interchangeable.''\n       Polidore confirmed that some early parts required \n     modifications but denied that such a shim line existed and \n     said ``our supplier base is the best in the industry.''\n       The plane's million-dollar radar-absorbing canopy has also \n     caused problems, with a stuck hatch imprisoning a pilot for \n     hours in 2006 and engineers unable to extend the canopy's \n     lifespan beyond about 18 months of flying time. It \n     delaminates, ``loses its strength and finish,'' said an \n     official privy to Air Force data.\n       In the interview, Ahern and Air Force Gen. C.D. Moore \n     confirmed that canopy visibility has been declining more \n     rapidly than expected, with brown spots and peeling forcing \n     $120,000 refurbishments at 331 hours of flying time, on \n     average, instead of the stipulated 800 hours.\n       There has been some gradual progress. At the plane's first \n     operational flight test in September 2004, it fully met two \n     of 22 key requirements and had a total of 351 deficiencies; \n     in 2006, it fully met five; in 2008, when squadrons were \n     deployed at six U.S. bases, it fully met seven.\n       ``It flunked on suitability measures--availability, \n     reliability, and maintenance,'' said Christie about the first \n     of those tests. ``There was no consequence. It did not faze \n     anybody who was in the decision loop'' for approving the \n     plane's full production. This outcome was hardly unique, \n     Christie adds. During his tenure in the job from 2001 to \n     2005, ``16 or 17 major weapons systems flunked'' during \n     initial operational tests, and ``not one was stopped as a \n     result.''\n       ``I don't accept that this is still early in the program,'' \n     Christie said, explaining that he does not recall a plane \n     with such a low capability to fulfill its mission due to \n     maintenance problems at this point in its tenure as the F-22. \n     The Pentagon said 64 percent of the fleet is currently \n     ``mission capable.'' After four years of rigorous testing and \n     operations, ``the trends are not good,'' he added.\n       Pentagon officials respond that measuring hourly flying \n     costs for aircraft fleets that have not reached 100,000 \n     flying hours is problematic, because sorties become more \n     frequent after that point; Ahern also said some\n\n[[Page S7388]]\n\n     improvements have been made since the 2008 testing, and \n     added: ``We're going to get better.'' He said the F-22s are \n     on track to meet all of what the Air Force calls its KPP--key \n     performance parameters--by next year.\n       But last Nov. 20, John J. Young Jr., who was then \n     undersecretary of defense and Ahern's boss, said that \n     officials continue to struggle with the F-22's skin. \n     ``There's clearly work that needs to be done there to make \n     that airplane both capable and affordable to operate,'' he \n     said.\n       When Gates decided this spring to spend $785 million on \n     four more planes and then end production of the F-22, he also \n     kept alive an $8 billion improvement effort. It will, among \n     other things, give F-22 pilots the ability to communicate \n     with other types of warplanes; it currently is the only such \n     warplane to lack that capability.\n       The cancellation decision got public support from the Air \n     Force's top two civilian and military leaders, who said the \n     F-22 was not a top priority in a constrained budget. But the \n     leaders' message was muddied in a June 9 letter from Air \n     Combat Cmdr. John D.W. Corley to Chambliss that said halting \n     production would put ``execution of our current national \n     military strategy at high risk in the near to mid-term.'' The \n     right size for the fleet, he said, is 381.\n       One of the last four planes Gates supported buying is meant \n     to replace an F-22 that crashed during a test flight north of \n     Los Angeles on March 25, during his review of the program. \n     The Air Force has declined to discuss the cause, but a \n     classified internal accident report completed the following \n     month states that the plane flew into the ground after poorly \n     executing a high-speed run with its weapons-bay doors open, \n     according to three government officials familiar with its \n     contents. The Lockheed test pilot died.\n       Several sources said the flight was part of a bid to make \n     the F-22 relevant to current conflicts by giving it a \n     capability to conduct precision bombing raids, not just \n     aerial dogfights. The Air Force is still probing who should \n     be held accountable for the accident.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will quote in part from this article, which I think is \nworthy of my colleagues' examination. It is by Mr. R. Jeffrey Smith, a \nperson who is widely respected on defense issues. He says:\n\n       The United States' top fighter jet, the Lockheed Martin F-\n     22, has recently required more than 30 hours of maintenance \n     for every hour in the skies, pushing its hourly cost of \n     flying to more than $44,000, a far higher figure than for the \n     warplane it replaces, confidential Pentagon test results \n     show.\n\n  It goes on to talk about some of the problems it has experienced. It \ngoes on to say:\n\n       While most aircraft fleets become easier and less costly to \n     repair as they mature, key maintenance trends for the F-22 \n     have been negative in recent years, and on average from \n     October last year to this May, just 55 percent of the \n     deployed F-22 fleet has been available to fulfill missions \n     guarding U.S. airspace, the Defense Department acknowledged \n     this week. The F-22 has never been flown over Iraq or \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  I point out that the cost per aircraft is around $350 million, \ndepending on how you calculate it. We have a $350 million airplane \ninvestment by the taxpayers of America that has never been flown over \nIraq or Afghanistan, the two conflicts in which we are engaged. We know \nfor a fact that much older aircraft--the A-10, the F-18, many of the \nolder aircraft are flying routine missions, plus our newest kinds of \ntechnology in drone and predator aircraft.\n\n       Sensitive information about troubles with the nation's \n     foremost air-defense fighter is emerging in the midst of a \n     fight between the Obama administration and the Democrat-\n     controlled Congress--\n\n  I point out to my colleagues, the Democrat-controlled Congress--\n\n     over whether the program should be halted next year at 187 \n     planes, far short of what the Air Force and the F-22's \n     contractors around the country had anticipated.\n\n  There are divisions over in the Pentagon.\n  It says:\n\n       Votes by the House and Senate armed services committees \n     last month to spend $369 million to $1.75 billion more to \n     keep the F-22 production line open were propelled by mixed \n     messages from the Air Force--including a quiet campaign for \n     the plane that includes snazzy new Lockheed videos for \n     lawmakers--\n\n  I do not think that the chairman or I received the snazzy new \nLockheed video--\n\n     and intense political support for States where the F-22's \n     components are made. The full House ratified the vote on June \n     25, and the Senate is scheduled to begin consideration.\n       After deciding to cancel the program, Defense Secretary \n     Robert Gates called the $65 billion fleet a ``niche'' silver-\n     bullet solution to a major aerial war threat that remains \n     distant. He described the House's decision as ``a big \n     problem,'' and has promised to urge President Obama to veto \n     the bill.\n       The administration's position is supported by military \n     reform groups.\n\n  In the article it talks about pilots who have flown the aircraft who \ntalk about its impressive capability. I do not disagree with those \nassessments at all. Its troubles have been detailed in dozens of \nGovernment Accountability Office reports and Pentagon audits. But \nPierre Sprey, a key designer in the 1970s and 1980s of the F-16 and A-\n10 warplanes, said that from the beginning, the Air Force designed it \nto be ``too big to fail, that is, to be cancelation proof.''\n  Lockheed farmed out more than 1,000 subcontracts to vendors in more \nthan 40 States. I would like to repeat that. Lockheed farmed out more \nthan 1,000 subcontracts to vendors in more than 40 States. And Sprey, \nnow a prominent critic of the plane, said that by the time skeptics \n``could point out the failed tests, the combat flaws, and the exploding \ncosts, most Congressmen were already defending their contractors' \nrevenues.''\n  John Hamre--this is an individual known to all of us--a very capable \nindividual, who was on the Senate Armed Service Committee staff and \nserved in previous administrations, was the Pentagon Comptroller from \n1993 to 1997. He says the Department approved the plane with a budget \nit knew was too low because projecting the real costs would have been \npolitically unpalatable on Capitol Hill.\n\n       We knew that the F-22 was going to cost more than the Air \n     Force thought it was going to cost and we budgeted the lower \n     number, and I was there [Hamre told the Senate Armed Services \n     committee in April.]\n\n  ``I am not proud of it,'' Hamre added in a recent interview, which I \nthink is a mark of the quality of the individual, that he admits he \nmade a mistake, as we all do from some time to another.\n  So I do not want to quote and spend too much time on this article \nbecause it is a long one. But it is an important item for our \ncolleagues to consider when we consider the vote on this amendment.\n\n       The cancellation decision got public support from the Air \n     Force's top two civilian and military leaders who said the F-\n     22 was not a top priority in a constrained budget. But the \n     leaders' message was muddied in a June 9 letter from Air \n     Combat Commander John D. W. Corley to Chambliss [that is \n     Senator Chambliss, the Senator from Georgia] that said \n     halting production would put ``execution of our national \n     military strategy at high risk in the near to mid-term.'' The \n     right size of the fleet, he said, is 381.\n\n  So it is enough to say that given our overall joint capability to \nobtain air superiority, stopping the F-22 at 187 fighters is vital to \nachieving the correct balance.\n  I have discussed already the importance of a fifth-generation \naircraft. I discussed earlier the importance of us making these tough \ndecisions. Not irrelevant to this debate is the view of the Vice \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Cartwright. He is a \nMarine General aviator. He is the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, and he serves as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs' most senior \nadviser on joint operational requirements.\n  In recent testimony before the Armed Services Committee, General \nCartwright outlined why, in his best military judgment, the F-22 \nprogram should be terminated. He said:\n\n       Looking at the lines in hot production, the number one \n     priority was to get fifth generation fighters to all of the \n     services. Number-two priority was to ensure that we had a hot \n     production line in case there was a problem. And, number \n     three, was to have that hot production line producing F-18Gs, \n     which support the electronic warfare fight.\n\n  In General Cartwright's view:\n\n       Those issues stacked up to a solid position that it was \n     time to terminate the F-22. It is a good airplane. It is a \n     fifth-generation fighter. But we needed to proliferate those \n     fifth-generation fighters to all of the services, and we \n     needed to ensure that we were capable of continuing to \n     produce aircraft for the electronic warfare capability. In \n     the F-18, we can also produce front-line fighters that are \n     more capable of addressing any threat that we'll face for the \n     next 5 to 10 years.\n\n  Interesting comment. He is saying, in the F-18, we can also produce \nfrontline fighters that are more capable of addressing any threat we \nwill face for the next 5 to 10 years.\n  In any case, let me clear up the record on some discussions about the \nrisk the Air Force is taking on by ending the F-22 line at 187 \naircraft. References to some of that discussion appear to have been \ntaken out of context. The Air Force's acceptance of risk by\n\n[[Page S7389]]\n\ndiscontinuing the program needs to be understood in the context of the \nAir Force's overall combat Air Force restructure plan, a plan that is \nintended to bridge the Air Force's current fleet to the predominantly \nfifth-generation force of the future. Basically, that plan works by \nrestructuring the Air Force's current fleet of fighters now and \ndirecting the results and savings to fund modifying newer or more \nreliable fighters in the legacy fleet, weapons procurement, and joint \nenablers.\n  Under this plan, those investments will help create a more capable \nfleet that can bridge the Air Force to a future fleet with a smaller, \nmore capable force. As you can imagine, the effectiveness of the plan \ndepends on a lot of moving parts, perhaps most importantly stopping the \nF-22 program at 187 fighters now.\n  While some short-term risks in the Air Force's fighter force may \narise from stopping the program at 187 aircraft, the Combat Air Force \nRestructure Plan is designed to accept that risk to ensure a more \ncapable fleet in the long term. I believe this strategy is sound and \nneeds the support of this body. Please do not be deluded by references \nto risk associated with ending the F-22 program.\n  Given the strength of the reasons cited by the National Command \nAuthority, the best professional military advice by the Chairman and \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the considered \nrecommendations of the service Secretaries, I can find no good reason \nwhy I should replace their judgment on this critical national defense \nissue with my own and call for funding for the continuation of the F-22 \nprogram. I, respectfully, suggest the Members of this body do the same \nand support the amendment under consideration.\n  I understand where votes are. I understand that right now, probably \nthis morning, anyway, and I hope that the very forceful letter by the \nSecretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nthe very strong letter from the President of the United States will \nmove my colleagues in support of this amendment.\n  But I have no illusions about the influence of the military \nindustrial complex in this town. Long ago, President Eisenhower, when \nhe left office--probably the most noted military leader or certainly \none of the most noted military leaders ever to occupy the White House--\nwarned America about the military industrial complex and the power and \nthe increasing influence he saw that military industrial complex having \nover the decisionmaking made in the Congress and in the administration \nand in the funding of different programs and the expenditure of the \ntaxpayers' hard-earned dollars.\n  We are at a very interesting moment, if not a seminal one, in the \nhistory of this administration. If we accept the threat of the \nPresident of the United States to veto and overcome the individual \nconcerns, I think it will be a great step forward to providing the \ntaxpayer with a far better usage of their hard-earned dollars.\n  These are difficult and terrible economic times for America. We \ncannot afford business as usual. We cannot afford to continue to \npurchase weapons systems that are not absolutely vital to this Nation's \nsecurity. I would point out, again, and maybe it is not appropriate to \nkeep mentioning, this plane has never been flown over Iraq or \nAfghanistan. It is never part of the two wars we have been in. It is a \ngood airplane. It will probably be important, the 187 of them we are \nprocuring, to the security of the Nation.\n\n  But to continue production and procurement at some $350 million a \ncopy, when in the judgment of the people we give the responsibility to \nmake the judgment in the strongest possible terms have told us: We need \nto move on to another aircraft. We need the Joint Strike Fighter, and \nwe do not need any more of the F-22 aircraft, it is a very interesting \ntime. I look forward to the debate and vote on this amendment as soon \nas possible. I respect the views of my colleagues who feel very \nstrongly that we need to continue the production of this aircraft. But \nI think it is wrong. I hope we can have an enlightened and respected \ndebate on this issue.\n  I understand the passion that some of my colleagues have about it and \nthe importance it is to jobs in their States and communities. I would \npoint out, again, defending this Nation and expenditures of the \ntaxpayers' dollars for its defense should not be based on jobs. It \nshould be based on our national security needs. There are not unlimited \namounts of money.\n  I wish to thank my colleague, the distinguished chairman again. I am \nsure that both those letters have been included in the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first, let me thank Senator McCain for \nhis strong and very powerful statement about this amendment. I cannot \nremember a President ever saying in advance that if a specific \nprovision in the Defense bill is included, he will veto it. Now, there \nmay be such precedent. But this is what the stakes are here now. This \nis whether we are going to be supporting a bill that has essential \nprovisions in it for the men and women of the military, including a \nsignificant pay raise and other important benefits, including support \nfor our wounded warriors, including support for weapons systems they \nneed.\n  I would hope that even those Senators who have indicated they would \nsupport the additional F-22s might reconsider their position in terms \nof what is involved in this bill for our men and women, given the \nPresident's statement that he will veto this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague, the distinguished chairman.\n  Can I ask the distinguished chairman what he thinks is going to be \nthe situation as regarding the disposition of this amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Arizona. The answer is, it will \ndepend, I guess, on how many people wish to speak either in support of \nour amendment or in opposition to it and how long they want to speak. I \ndo not have yet an indication of that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I say to my friend, the distinguished chairman, \nfrom our past experience, there will be at least a couple hundred \npending other amendments. I do not mean to diminish the importance of \nthis one. But I would hope we could spend whatever time in debate that \nanyone might want to talk about the amendment today and into tomorrow \nand at least have a target to have a final disposition on this \namendment tomorrow, since we will have many other amendments. Would \nthat be the desire of the chairman?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be a little more optimistic even in the question. \nI am optimistic, and I would hope we would have a vote on this \namendment by noon tomorrow.\n  I understand there will not be votes in the afternoon as previously \nagreed to. I hope prior to noon tomorrow we can have a vote on our \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we encourage colleagues to come to the \nSenate floor so we can debate this important amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are two or three things for which we hope our \ncolleagues will come to the Chamber: One is to speak on this amendment; \nsecondly, to speak generally about the bill. We have a number of \ncolleagues on the committee who have worked so hard on this bill who do \nwant to speak on it. I hope they will do that this afternoon. Third, we \ncan begin to receive amendments that we might want to consider during \nthis week. I hope we can finish this bill this week. That may be an \noptimistic goal, but it would be achievable if everybody cooperates and \nbrings to us and our staffs amendments they are thinking about \noffering.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman. I hope all colleagues will bring \ntheir amendments as well as debate on the pending amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7390]]\n\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, as more and more Americans become familiar \nwith the details of the Democrats' proposal for a Washington takeover \nof the health care system, the wheels are beginning to fall off, and \nfor good reason. It is no longer just the Republicans who are sounding \nthe alarm. It is Independents and centrist Democrats who are showing \ngenuine concern. We still do not have a good answer about the cost of \nthe two major Senate proposals--one from the Finance Committee and the \nother from the HELP Committee--but we do know they will be enormously \nexpensive once they are finally scored. There is also the House \nproposal from Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Waxman which is believed to \ncost $1 trillion over a 10-year period.\n  One great aspect of a representative democracy is elected officials \nstill listen to the people who sent them here. Even Senators with 6-\nyear terms go back to their respective States often and have their \nfingers on the pulse of public opinion. What they heard over the recent \nIndependence Day break was alarm over the amount of money the Federal \nGovernment is spending in such a short period and over the monstrous \ndebt we are incurring. We also heard from the voters. We heard from \ntaxpayers that they are concerned over the direction health care \nlegislation is heading.\n  A recent CNN poll found that a broad majority of Americans have \nconcluded that their health care costs would go up, not down, under the \nDemocrats' plan. The poll found that 54 percent say their medical \ninsurance costs will increase if the Democratic plan is adopted, while \nonly 17 percent of Americans believe their costs will decrease. Only \none out of five said their family would be better off if the Democrats' \nreforms are enacted.\n  This lack of enthusiasm for the Democrats' plan is not just driven by \npartisan opposition. A recent Rasmussen survey found skepticism high \namong independent voters, with a plurality, some 39 percent of those \nnot affiliated with either party, strongly opposed to the Democrats' \nplan.\n  I want health care reform enacted this year. As a matter of fact, I \nwanted health care reform enacted in the last Congress. But I want a \nplan that is closer to President Obama's campaign promise of last year, \none that allows Americans to keep their insurance plans, if they are \nsatisfied with them, and one that actually saves money for the American \neconomy.\n  Last year candidate Obama stated that the United States is spending \ntoo much money on medical care. He vowed to put forth a plan to save \nmoney. I want to see that proposal. I want to see a proposal that would \nsave money, not one that would spend another $1, $2, or $3 trillion we \ndon't have and for which we will have to borrow from our grandchildren \nand great-grandchildren.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not \ncharacterize these legitimate concerns as scare tactics. The figures \nthat have the Americans frightened were ones published from the \nCongressional Budget Office, not from some right-of-center think tank \nin Washington. In addition, suggestions about how to pay for this \ngigantic scheme for a Federal takeover are just as troubling.\n  The Kennedy bill, for example, includes a $58 billion tax on workers \nthat would be imposed to create a government insurance program for \nlong-term care. The bill also includes an additional $36 billion in \npenalties on individuals for not purchasing a government-approved \nhealth coverage policy. Another $52 billion would come from new taxes \non employers. The House is considering a $540 billion proposal to put a \n1- to 3-percent surtax on small businesses. There are also plans to tax \nbeverages that contain sugar and proposals to place payroll taxes on \ncapital gains earnings.\n  All of these tax increases would come during a recession and would \nstill not be enough. There would have to be hundreds of billions of \ndollars in cuts to the Medicare Program. In essence, to finance this \nscheme we will have to agree to tax workers and job creators and to cut \nbenefits for senior citizens.\n  Two opinion pieces from the Washington Post last Friday provide clear \nevidence of honest concerns over the way the Democratic legislation is \nheading. In its own editorial, the Washington Post, hardly a rightwing \npublication, noted discouraging developments on Capitol Hill. Among \nother things, the Washington Post expressed disagreement over the \nDemocrats' continued insistence on a public option. The editorial went \non to say:\n\n       Restructuring the health care system is risky enough that \n     the Democrats would be wise not to try to accomplish it \n     entirely on their own.\n\n  This is sound advice from a leading newspaper that endorsed Senator \nObama when he was running for President last year.\n  In another op-ed on the same topic, columnist Michael Kinsley points \nout:\n\n       People, even liberals, are starting to get unnerved by the \n     cost of all this.\n\n  He cites two risks for health care reform. One is that it would not \npass and an opportunity will be lost. The second is that if it passes, \nit would not work. I ask my colleagues: If we pass a $1 trillion or $3 \ntrillion plan that does not work, how will we ever reverse that \nmistake? How will we ever get the genie back in the bottle?\n  Mr. Kinsley rightly urges the President to slow things down on health \ncare reform in order to get it right. Then Mr. Kinsley goes on to \nsuggest that the President not try for a total overhaul of health care \nbut, instead, seek smaller successes or low-hanging fruit. He advocates \nmedical malpractice reform, outcomes research, and eliminating \npaperwork and waste as a starting position. I believe such an approach \nis sound and could be on the President's desk by the end of September.\n  When Michael Kinsley and the Washington Post editorial board begin \nasking advocates of an enormous Washington takeover to pause and \nreflect, it is time for all Americans--from the left, from the right, \nand from the political center--to sit up and take notice.\n  The good news from these developments is this: We now have a better \nopportunity for health care reform that does not break the bank. I hope \nthe congressional leadership will go back to the drawing board and \nwrite a targeted bill that addresses the real problems, such as \ncoverage for the uninsured.\n  Congress should listen to Michael Kinsley. Congress should listen to \nthe Washington Post editorial board and the growing chorus of concerns \nand develop a plan that makes health care more portable, more \naffordable, and more accessible.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week and again this morning, my \ngood friend, the majority leader, came to the floor and said he wants \nto work with Republicans on health care reform. I welcome his comments. \nAs a step in that direction, I would point out one of the major \nconcerns Americans have about health care reform is the pricetag.\n  Last week, we learned the Federal deficit is now more than $1 \ntrillion so far this year for the first time in our Nation's history. \nTo give people an idea of how dramatically the Federal deficit has \ngrown in just the last several months, I would note the current deficit \nfor this year is $800 billion more than it was at this point last \nyear--$800 billion more than at this point last year. So the need for \nfiscal discipline could not be greater than at the current moment. Yet \nall the Democratic proposals we are hearing on health care would only \nincrease our Nation's already staggering debt without even addressing \nthe full extent of the problems we all agree should be addressed as \npart of a comprehensive reform. Americans do, indeed, want health care \nreform, but they don't want to see their\n\n[[Page S7391]]\n\nchildren and their grandchildren buried deeper and deeper in debt \nwithout even solving the problem.\n  Every proposal we have seen would cost a fortune by any standard. \nEven worse, some of these estimates are totally misleading. In some \ncases 10-year estimates are based on proposals that wouldn't even go \ninto effect for 4 years. In other words, what is being sold as a 10-\nyear cost would actually cost that much over 6 years.\n  We also know from our experience with Medicare that cost estimates on \nhealth care often prove to be wildly inaccurate. When Medicare Part A \nwas enacted in 1965, it was projected that in 1990 it would spend $9.1 \nbillion on hospital services and related administration. As it turned \nout, spending in 1990 totaled almost $67 billion, more than seven times \nthe original prediction.\n  Today, Medicare is already paying out more than it is taking in and \nwill soon go bankrupt. So if history is any guide, the actual cost of \nreform could be far greater than the estimates we are getting now--\nestimates that are already giving Americans serious sticker shock.\n  Also troubling are some of the proposals we have heard to pay for \nthese so-called reforms. The advocates of government-run health care \nhave been searching frantically for a way to cover costs, and they seem \nto have settled on two groups: the elderly and small business owners in \nthe form of Medicare cuts and higher taxes.\n  As for Medicare, it is my view any savings from Medicare should be \nused to strengthen and protect Medicare, not fund another government-\nrun system that is all but certain to have the same fiscal problems \ndown the road Medicare does. Raiding one insolvent government-run \nprogram to create another is not reform; it is using an outdated model \nto solve a problem that will require a fresh approach and new ideas.\n  As for higher taxes, advocates of the government takeover of health \ncare have set their sights on small business owners to help pay for the \nproposals. It should go without saying that this is precisely the wrong \napproach in the middle of a recession. Small businesses are the engine \nof our economy, and they have created approximately two-thirds of all \nnew jobs in the last decade. At a time when the unemployment rate is \napproaching 10 percent, we need to help small businesses not hurt them. \nYet according to news reports, Democrats in Congress are considering \ndoing just that.\n  In recent congressional testimony, the President of the National \nFederation of Independent Business said some of these proposals could \ndestroy more than 1.5 million jobs. Aside from killing jobs, these so-\ncalled reforms could actually cause millions to end up with worse care \nthan they already have, and they could come at a higher cost to \nindividuals and families in the form of higher premiums.\n  Some have also proposed raising income taxes and limiting tax \ndeductions for charitable giving. Others are reportedly considering an \nincrease on the employee Medicare tax which would take money out of the \npaychecks of American workers, a new national sales tax, and taxes on \nsoda and juice boxes. These proposals would hit low-income Americans \nespecially hard. All of these are bad ideas, but it is unlikely they \nwould cover the long-term cost of the proposal we have seen so far in \nany event. The rest would simply be added to the national debt.\n  In his comments last week, the majority leader said health care \nreform is not a partisan issue. That is why some of us have for weeks \nput forward ideas that should be pretty easy for everybody to support, \nsuch as reforming medical malpractice laws to get rid of junk lawsuits, \nencouraging wellness and prevention programs such as the programs that \nhelp people quit smoking or overcome obesity that have been shown to \ncut costs, and increasing competition in the private market.\n  Americans would like for the two parties to work together to reform \nhealth care--to cut costs without sacrificing the things Americans like \nabout our current health care system. Embracing the ideas I have \nmentioned and finding responsible ways to pay for health care reform is \nan obvious and commonsense place to start.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this week, the Health, Education, Labor, \nPension Committee is planning to finish marking up our health care \nreform legislation. A vital part of this legislation is ensuring that \nAmericans have access to affordable generic versions of brandname \nbiologic drugs. These medicines are crucial to those suffering from \nParkinson's, from multiple sclerosis, from arthritis, from diabetes, \nfrom cancer, and from all kinds of debilitating and deadly diseases. \nYet for countless Americans, these drugs are simply too expensive.\n  More than 190,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in \nAmerican women in 2009. To treat these cases using the biologic drug \nHerceptin costs approximately $48,000 a year. That is almost $1,000 a \nweek to treat breast cancer with this drug. Each year, more than 1.3 \nmillion Americans are afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis. To treat \nthese cases using the brandname biologic drug Remicade costs more than \n$20,000 a year. And here is another number. Between 350,000 and 500,000 \npeople in the United States suffer from multiple sclerosis. To treat \nthese cases using brandname biologic drugs, either Avonex or Betaseron, \ncosts more than $24,000 a year.\n  To put these numbers in perspective, the average annual household \nincome in my State of Ohio--whether you live in Dayton, in Cleveland, \nin Akron, Cincinnati, or Youngstown--is $46,000. For far too long, \nOhioans such as Jerrold, from Miami County, have had to choose between \npaying for their medication or their mortgage.\n  Jerrold, who served in the Marines, had to retire early because he \nwas experiencing severe seizures. Soon after, his wife had to retire \nearly because she was diagnosed with leukemia and was battling other \nmedical problems. Between the expensive medications needed to treat \ntheir conditions, Jerrold and his wife were forced to put their house \nup for sale. Jerrold wrote to me saying he didn't expect his golden \nyears would be losing his home because of unaffordable health care \ncosts.\n  Health care reform must include an FDA approval process for generic \nbiologics comparable to the process that ensures access to traditional \ngeneric drugs. Remember that only 15 years ago the most effective, best \nknown cancer drug was a chemical drug, with ingredients that were not \nconsidered live ingredients, but was a chemical drug known as Taxol. \nTaxol cost about $4,000 a year. We thought that was outrageously \nexpensive. But because of Hatch-Waxman, because of the generic approval \nprocess, because we can bring generic drugs to market, we have been \nable to get those costs under control.\n  But $4,000 for a drug for cancer only 15 years ago--Taxol--today, a \ndrug for cancer costs upwards of $40,000, and there is no Hatch-Waxman, \nthere is no generic process, there is no road to keep those prices in \ncheck. The companies that make those drugs can charge whatever they \nwant.\n\n  Absent that generic process, there is no free market exerting \ndownward pressure on biologic prices, so prices remain high for \nfamilies such as Kimberly's, also from Miami County. Kimberly wrote to \nme explaining how her brother depends on Remicade infusions every 6 to \n8 weeks to treat ulcerative colitis. The annual cost of Remicade can \ntop $31,000 a year. Again, there is no competition, there is no generic \nequivalent allowed to be developed under U.S. law. Kimberly is worried \nif her parents lose their insurance her brother will no longer be able \nto get his infusions and his conditions would not be covered by a new \ninsurer.\n  Biotechnology is a high-risk and high-cost business, but we cannot \ngive companies open-ended protection from generic competition. With no \nprotection from generics, pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed profits \nof the tens of billions of dollars after they recoup their R costs.\n\n[[Page S7392]]\n\n  I say absolutely they should recoup their R costs. They should have \na generous profit for the risks they undertook and the investment they \nmade and even for the opportunity costs of their investment. But when \nyou look at the kind of returns they are making, the number of years \nthey can continue to charge these high prices, what good is it to \ndevelop these wonderful drugs, these wonderful biologic drugs, if \npeople such as Kimberly and Jerrold and others can't afford them?\n  If you divide the total R budget of a typical biotech by the number \nof biotechs that actually make it to market--the number of biologics \nthat make it to market, the R cost per successful drug is about $1.2 \nbillion. That counts all the drugs including the ones that do not make \nit to market, including the ones that are failures, including the ones \nwhere the research is dead end--$1.2 billion.\n  The top biologic companies are able to make up their costs in as \nlittle as a year and a half and go on to make profits worth billions, \nyear after year--after decade, for that matter--because there is no \ngeneric path. There is no path to follow in biologics.\n  Why should there be--under the proposals of some people in this \nbody--why should there be a 13-year monopoly period, as some of my \ncolleagues want? That is a good question. President Obama has said 7 \nyears is enough and the FTC has directly stated that 12 years or more \nof exclusivity would--counterintuitively, perhaps--actually harm new \ninnovation by discouraging biotechs from searching for new sources of \nrevenue. Why should they, when they are raking in dollars from their \ncurrent monopolies, giving them exclusivity for far more years than \neither the FTC or the President or the AARP or the bipartisan \nlegislation sponsored by Senators Martinez, Vitter, Schumer and me--why \nshould these companies, with that kind of long exclusivity period, even \nbother to do innovation? That is what the FTC says. That is clearly \ntrue.\n  AARP says 12 years, much less 13 years, is too long. Insurance \ncompanies say it, patient advocates say it, disease groups say it, \nmajor consumer groups say it--that 12 years is much too long. The only \ngroup advocating for 12 years or greater is, no surprise, the drug \nindustry.\n  With their army of lobbyists and their deep pockets that produce \nspectacular campaign contributions, the drug industry is all over \nCapitol Hill, trying to convince Members of Congress that drug \ncompanies are different from other companies. The drug companies want \nus to believe that they deserve something special, they deserve \ndecades-long monopolies for their products. No one else has that in the \nentire consumer market, even if those monopolies leave patients without \naccess to the lifesaving medicines.\n  I might add that much of the research that these companies have done, \nmuch of the research they build upon, is taxpayer funded through the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  I know in the State of the Presiding Officer, as in mine, there are \nall kinds of NIH dollars spent by startup companies, by universities, \nby people developing spectacular drugs. That is a good thing. But, \nunderstand, taxpayer money goes into a lot of this at the beginning. \nTaxpayers at least deserve competitive prices after the product has \nbeen developed.\n  A biotech industry group called the Biotech Industry Association, a \nlobbying group, spent nearly $2 million in the first quarter alone \nlobbying on this issue that prevents generic drugs from making their \nway to people in Gallipolis and Zanesville and Springfield and Xenia \nand Findlay and Lima, OH. The drug industry is a profit-making \nenterprise, of course. It is going to lobby Congress to do whatever is \nin the drug industry's best interests, of course. There is no reason to \nbelieve it would selflessly advocate for patients. It never has, it \nnever will. It is all about the bottom line, which it should be. It is \ntheir responsibility to argue for the bottom line. It is their \nresponsibility to maximize profits. But it is our responsibility in \nthis institution--in the House of Representatives, in the Senate--it is \nour responsibility to bring in competition to restrain costs so that \nthrough competition--not through rules but through competition--\nAmerican consumers have the opportunity to buy these drugs that our tax \ndollars helped to develop.\n  I want to tell you about a letter I received recently from one of my \nconstituents. A registered nurse from Cleveland, Mary, wrote to me that \nshe works with families who often must decide between visiting a doctor \nand buying their child's medication to manage seizures or other \ndiseases. Mary is a nurse, as I said. Mary writes that drug costs keep \nmany parents from doing what they know is right. Safe and effective \ngeneric biologic drugs will bring billions of dollars of savings to \nconsumers, the health care community, and to our economy.\n  It will help Ohioans such as Brynna, from Cleveland, who wrote to me \nhow, after being diagnosed with a rare immunological disorder, she lost \nher job and lost her insurance.\n  After receiving Social Security disability, Brynna had to rely on \nsample medications from her doctor--a doctor who obviously cared about \nher patient because Brynna cannot afford the expensive medications she \nneeds to stay healthy and stay strong.\n  Get this. Brynna juggles her medications depending on which part of \nher immune system is the weakest and what she can afford.\n  Why should that happen? That only happens because this institution \nhas abdicated its responsibility. The drug industry, of course, is \ngoing to maximize its profits. It is up to us--100 Members of the \nSenate, 435 Members of the House of Representatives and President Obama \nto inject competition, to allow competition so these prices come down.\n  Of course it would be irresponsible not to pursue a safe and \nefficient path to generic versions of name-brand biologic drugs. It \nwould be irresponsible to pursue a pathway that gives biologic \nmanufacturers more than a decade of monopoly rights over a market that \nprovides lifesaving products to American patients.\n  That is how high the stakes are. Every year we give to highly \nprofitable drug companies inflates taxpayer costs for health care, \ncauses businesses struggling with paying for health care for their \nemployees more onerous, burdensome costs, and prevents Americans from \nobtaining medicines that can treat disabling and life-threatening \nconditions.\n  We must not kowtow to the drug industry. We can and we must stand up \nfor patients. We must and we have an opportunity to do what is right on \nthe follow-on biologics issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 1390.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, moments ago I left the Judiciary Committee \nhearing room where we are considering the nomination of Judge Sotomayor \nto be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. In considering this \nhistoric and well-qualified nominee, many Americans may believe our \ncountry has completely turned the corner in terms of equality and civil \nrights. While I certainly hope Judge Sotomayor's nomination will unite \nus as a nation, I am aware that there is a lot more that still has to \nbe done to protect the civil rights of all Americans.\n  I plan to offer the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of \n2009 as an amendment to the pending National Defense authorization \nbill. I thank Senator Collins, Senator Snowe, and a number of other \nbipartisan cosponsors for their support. This measure has long been a \npriority bill for Senator Ted Kennedy. I commend him for his steadfast \nleadership over the last decade in working to expand our Federal hate \ncrime laws.\n  The amendment I will offer aims to address the serious and growing \nproblem of hate crimes. We all saw the recent event at the Holocaust \nMuseum here in Washington which made it clear that these vicious crimes \ncontinue to haunt our country. This bipartisan legislation is carefully \ndesigned to help law enforcement most effectively respond to this \nproblem. It has been stalled for far too long. The time to act is now.\n  The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act has been pending for \nmore than a decade and has actually\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\npassed the Senate several times. Despite its long history in the \nSenate, and despite the fact that it is cosponsored by both Democratic \nand Republican Senators, it continues to draw the same tired, old \nattacks. Less than 2 years ago the Senate passed a hate crimes bill as \nan amendment to the Defense Authorization Act. It also passed the \nSenate in 2004, in 2000, and 1999.\n  Last month, at the request of the ranking Republican on the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Sessions, and all Republican members of the \ncommittee, I chaired a hearing on this bill to assure that this \nlegislation has been adequately discussed and considered, and to allow \nan opportunity to explore the minor changes that were made to the bill \nin this Congress.\n  It is no doubt a testament to the urgency of this legislation that \nthe Attorney General of the United States returned to the Judiciary \nCommittee to testify in support of the bill. I say it reflects the \nurgency of it because the Attorney General had been before the \ncommittee less than a week before in an oversight hearing. Normally we \nwould not see him before the committee for another 6 to 10 months. Yet, \nhe came back within 6 days so he could testify in support of this \nimportant legislation. I commend Attorney General Holder for that. We \nhave also heard from State and local law enforcement organizations, all \nsupportive of the measure, and our committee record includes support \nletters from dozens of leaders of the faith community and the civil \nrights community.\n  I agreed with Senator Sessions when he commented at the end of the \nhearing that it was a good hearing with a good exchange of views. We \nhave now had more than enough process and consideration of this bill, \nand it is time to bring it to another Senate vote.\n  The hate crimes amendment will improve existing law by making it \neasier for Federal authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes of \nracial, ethnic, or religious violence. Victims will no longer have to \nengage in a narrow range of activities, such as serving as a juror, to \nbe protected under Federal law. It also focuses the attention and \nresources of the Federal Government on the problem of crimes committed \nagainst people because of their sexual orientation, gender, gender \nidentity, or disability, which is a long overdue protection. In \naddition, the hate crimes amendment will provide assistance and \nresources to State and local and tribal law enforcement to address hate \ncrimes.\n  Last Congress this legislation was attached to the Department of \nDefense authorization bill and had the bipartisan support of 60 \nSenators, and I expect we will have even more support today.\n  President Obama supports the immediate passage of hate crime \nlegislation. In his first few months in office, he has acted to ensure \nthat Federal benefits are awarded more equitably, regardless of sexual \norientation. He has shown through his selection of a nominee for the \nSupreme Court that he understands the greatest talent and experience \nand the highest devotion to law exists across lines of gender and \nethnicity. Unlike in previous years, our bipartisan hate crimes bill \ndoes not face a veto threat because we have a President who understands \nthat crimes motivated by bias are particularly pernicious crimes that \naffect more than just their victims and those victims' families.\n  I know. In a previous career, I prosecuted crimes that were committed \nbased solely or primarily on bias against the victims. It is a hateful, \nterrible thing. It is hateful to the victim, to the victim's family, \nthe victim's friends.\n  Hate crimes instill fear in those who have no connection to the \nvictim other than a shared characteristic such as race or sexual \norientation. If you feel somebody with whom you share that connection \nmay have been the victim of a hate crime, you may fear that you will be \nnext.\n  For nearly 150 years, we have responded as a nation to deter and \npunish violent denials of civil rights by enacting Federal laws to \nprotect the civil rights of all of our citizens. The Matthew Shepard \nHate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 continues that great and honorable \ntradition. That is why so many law enforcement--State and local, \nFederal--support this legislation. Adoption of this amendment will \nshow, once again, that America values tolerance and protects all of its \npeople. I urge the opponents of this measure to consider the message it \nsends when, year after year, we have been prevented from enacting this \nbroadly supported legislation. The victims of hate deserve better, and \nthose who fear they may be the next victim of a hate crime deserve \nbetter. So I hope all Senators will join me in support of this \nimportant amendment.\n  At the appropriate point, I will call up the amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letters in support of this amendment from \nthe Human Rights Campaign dated July 14, 2009, and the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights dated July 9, 2009, be printed in the \nRecord. I also ask unanimous consent that the list of supporters for \nthe legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Human Rights Campaign,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2009.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Human Rights Campaign and \n     our more than 750,000 members and supporters nationwide, we \n     are writing today to urge you to support the Leahy/Collins/\n     Kennedy/Snowe Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act \n     amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2010 (S. 1391) and to reject any secondary \n     amendments. These will be key votes for the Human Rights \n     Campaign.\n       The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act has strong \n     bipartisan support. On April 29, 2009 the House of \n     Representatives passed a virtually identical bill (H.R. 1913) \n     by a vote of 249-175. The Senate has previously supported \n     substantially similar legislation on four separate occasions \n     by wide bipartisan margins, most recently as an amendment to \n     the 2008 Department of Defense Authorization bill by a vote \n     of 60 to 39. In addition to public opinion polling that \n     consistently finds an overwhelming majority of Americans in \n     support of such legislation, the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \n     Prevention Act has the support of more than 300 law \n     enforcement, civil rights, civic and religious organizations.\n       Since the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began \n     collecting hate crimes statistics in 1991, reported bias-\n     motivated crimes based on sexual orientation more than \n     tripled; yet the federal government has no jurisdiction to \n     assist states and localities in dealing with even the most \n     violent hate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual and \n     transgender Americans. The FBI's 2007 Uniform Crime Reports--\n     the most recent year for which we have statistics--showed \n     that reported violent crimes based on sexual orientation \n     constituted 16.6 percent of all hate crimes in 2007, with \n     1,265 reported for the year.\n       By passing this common sense anti-hate crime measure, we \n     would bring our nation's laws into the 21st century. The \n     Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a logical \n     extension of existing federal law. Since 1969, 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 245 has permitted federal prosecution of a hate crime if \n     the crime was motivated by bias based on race, religion, \n     national origin, or color, and because the victim was \n     exercising a ``federally protected right'' (e.g. voting, \n     attending school, etc.). After forty years, it has become \n     clear that the statute needs to be amended.\n       This bill adds actual or perceived sexual orientation, \n     gender, disability and gender-identity to the list of covered \n     categories and removes the federally protected activity \n     requirement, thus bringing a much needed comprehensiveness to \n     federal law. Removing the outdated intent requirement, would \n     untie the federal government's hands and allow them to \n     partner with state and local officials in combating serious \n     hate crimes that involve death and bodily injury.\n       We urge you to vote for this historic piece of legislation. \n     For more information, please contact Allison Herwitt, \n     Legislative Director, or David Stacy, Senior Public Policy \n     Advocate. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Joe Solmonese,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         Leadership Conference on Civil Rights,\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the Leadership Conference on \n     Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest, largest, and most \n     diverse civil and human rights coalition, with more than 200 \n     member organizations, we thank you for your support and \n     leadership of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act \n     (S. 909) (HCPA) and applaud your commitment to pass it before \n     the August recess.\n       LCCR appreciates your continued support for this bill, and \n     we are grateful for Senator Levin's willingness to allow an \n     attempt to attach HCPA to the Department of Defense (DOD) \n     Authorization, and for Senator Leahy's leadership in offering \n     the amendment on\n\n[[Page S7394]]\n\n     the Senate floor. As you know, due to pressure from outside \n     of the Senate, we have tried but failed to find an \n     appropriate vehicle on which to attach the HCPA. We recognize \n     and appreciate that the DOD Authorization bill is the best \n     and only option to ensure passage before the August recess.\n       We know that you understand well the importance of S. 909. \n     The testimony of Attorney General Holder at the Senate \n     Judiciary Hearing on June 25th, indicating the \n     administration's strong support for this bill, is an \n     encouraging reminder that after eleven years of efforts, we \n     will finally be able to pass the law necessary to protect \n     victims of violent, bias-motivated attacks. The HCPA would \n     enhance the federal response to hate crime violence by \n     covering all violent crimes based on race, color, religion, \n     or national origin. In addition, the HCPA would permit \n     federal involvement in the prosecution of bias-motivated \n     crimes based on the victim's gender, gender identity, sexual \n     orientation, or disability. This expansion is critical in \n     order to protect Americans from this most egregious form of \n     discrimination.\n       While LCCR recognizes that bigotry cannot be legislated out \n     of existence, a forceful, moral response to hate violence is \n     required of us all. This legislation passed the House of \n     Representatives with a strong bipartisan majority (249-175) \n     and has the support of more than 300 law enforcement, civil \n     rights, civic, and religious organizations. We know that you \n     strongly believe, as we do, that Congress must do everything \n     possible to empower the federal government to assist in local \n     hate crime prosecutions and, where appropriate, expand \n     existing federal authority to permit a wider range of \n     investigations and prosecutions. We sincerely appreciate your \n     efforts and leadership in making this happen.\n       Please contact Rob Randhava, LCCR Counsel, Lisa Bornstein, \n     LCCR Senior Counsel, or Nancy Zirkin with any questions. \n     Thank you again for your support and leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wade Henderson,\n       President & CEO.\n     Nancy Zirkin,\n       Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          Support Letter List\n\n       9to5 Bay Area (CA); 9to5 Colorado; 9to5 Milwaukee; 9to5 \n     National Association of Working Women; A.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of S. 1390. \nBut before I do, let me thank Senator Leahy for his leadership in \nintroducing this anti-hate crime amendment. I am honored to be one of \nits cosponsors. I hope the Senate works its will and, in the interests \nof justice, adopts the amendment in due course.\n  As I said, I rise to support S. 1390, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2010, the matter before the Senate \ntoday and this week. I wish to begin by commending Chairman Levin, the \nchairman of our Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator McCain, \nthe ranking Republican member, for their leadership and for the \nbipartisan example they have set in drafting and reporting out this \nbill.\n  This bill will keep our Nation safe and provide our troops with the \nsupport they deserve, and that is exactly what it ought to do. The bill \nwill establish new programs to support the fiscal and mental well-being \nof our troops and their families. It will provide our fighting men and \nwomen a 3.4-percent increase in compensation. The fact is, nothing is \nmore important than taking care of this extraordinary, gifted, brave \ngeneration of men and women who have volunteered to defend our country \nat a time of war.\n  I am also very pleased this bill will authorize the Secretary of \nDefense to grow the size of the Army in 2011 and 2012, a period when \nour soldiers will still be under stress, real stress, as the Army \nshifts its focus from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but the \noverall level of deployment will probably rise. There is so much we can \ndo to reduce the stress on those who serve us in the military and on \ntheir families. One critical thing we can do is to simply increase the \nnumber of men and women in uniform, particularly in the Army, because \nthe more supply there is of troops, no matter what the demand, the \namount of time every soldier can look forward to being back at base, \nback with families, not deployed in a battle zone, will decrease the \nstress they are under.\n  The additional troops--``end strength,'' as it is called in the \nvocabulary of this legislation--that are provided for in 2011 and 2012 \nwill ease the strain on our soldiers who have already been asked to do \nso much on our behalf. I intend to work with my colleagues in the \nSenate this week to amend this bill to extend the application of the \nmethod to increase end strength from 547,000 to 577,000 so it can begin \nin the next fiscal year, the year 2010, because that is probably when \nit will be most needed, as we are reducing our presence in Iraq but in \na slightly more accelerated way increasing our presence in Afghanistan.\n  Let me focus, if I may, on the parts of this legislation that have \ncome out of our Airland Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, a subcommittee which I have the honor of chairing.\n  I wish to start by thanking Senator John Thune for his service as \nranking member of the subcommittee. It is a pleasure to work with \nSenator Thune on behalf of our Army and Air Force and all involved in \nair and land programs. We work closely together in a completely \nbipartisan manner to carry out our responsibilities concerning the \nmatters in the jurisdiction of our subcommittee.\n  The Airland Subcommittee has broad responsibility for policy \noversight over substantial parts of the Army and Air Force budgets but \nalso, to a lesser extent, to a real extent, the Navy and the Marine \nCorps. So the subcommittee's portion of this year's National Defense \nAuthorization Act is a large one. Our goal was direct: to promote and \nimprove the current and, as best we can, the future readiness of our \nground and air forces, while at the same time ensuring the most \nefficient and effective use of taxpayer dollars.\n  This year, the portion of the budget request falling under the \nAirland Subcommittee's jurisdiction included a total of $71.1 billion. \nThat is made up of $55.4 billion in procurement and $15.7 billion in \nall-important research and development. As it stands right now, the \nfull committee's recommendation is a net addition to the President's \nbudget request of $2.9 billion to support activities under the Airland \nSubcommittee's jurisdiction.\n  In the past, the Armed Services Committee and the Senate have \nsupported stability and funding levels as requested for Army readiness \nand modernization programs. This has been particularly true for the \nArmy's Future Combat Systems, which has been the major modernization \nprogram of the Army.\n  However, the Army was forced to make some tough decisions in these \ntough budget times and decided in April to restructure the Future \nCombat Systems Program, including termination of the manned ground \nvehicle portion of that program. The Department has reoriented the Army \nmodernization plans that have been in place for the last 6 years. That \nis the necessity the Army felt both for budgetary reasons and I believe \nfor reasons of effectiveness. So the bill before us today supports the \nDepartment's decision, the Army's decision, with respect to the \nrestructuring of the Future Combat Systems Program and recommends full \nfunding for the ``spin out'' portions, the network portions of that \nprogram that will be carried forward.\n  This is a remarkable application of modern technology to the \nbattlefield. The history of warfare shows, generally speaking, that any \ndevelopments, any technological advances that have occurred over \nhistory, from the first fires that were made, to the wheel, and on to \nthe railroad, et cetera, have found their way--obviously the ability to \nfly--into military use. And so it is with the remarkable capability to \ncommunicate with one another, to use telecommunications, and the \ncomputer particularly, that has found its way into applications in \ncombat which greatly expand the capabilities of our solders, each and \nevery one of them, to see the battlefield beyond what they can see with \ntheir eyes and to conduct the most effective warfare on our behalf.\n  The bill also requires and recommends full funding for a new ground\n\n[[Page S7396]]\n\ncombat vehicle research and development program, as the Secretary of \nDefense agreed the Army needs.\n  In addition, this bill will direct the Department to establish a \ndevelopment program for a next-generation, self-propelled howitzer to \ntake advantage of technologies already matured as part of the Future \nCombat System non-line of sight cannon program.\n  In other words, what we are trying to do, in the aftermath of \nSecretary Gates' decision to terminate the series of programs under the \nFuture Combat Systems Program, is to harvest technological advances \nthat were made as part of those now terminated programs.\n  To support our forces in Afghanistan, this bill also recommends a \nlarge sum for an important purpose, $6.7 billion for the Mine Resistant \nAmbush Protected vehicle fund, which is an increase of $1.2 billion \nabove the President's budget request for what is normally known as the \nMRAP--in this case, the MRAP all-terrain vehicles, a later version of \nthe MRAPs, a more agile version of the MRAPs that have done so much to \nprotect the lives and well-being of our soldiers in Iraq from the \nimpact of IEDs and of bombs our enemies have set off. These MRAP ATVs \nwill now be of tremendous assistance to the growing number of troops we \nare sending to Afghanistan. This is a version of the MRAP made \nparticularly for our troops now fighting for us in Afghanistan.\n  In addition, in response to the Army Chief of Staff's unfunded \npriorities list, the bill also recommends adding $179 million to \nprocure additional Force XXI Battlefield Command Brigade and Below \nsystems to enhance the operational effectiveness of small units \nfighting on our behalf in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  When it comes to air power, the bill also recommends an additional \n$560 million to buy FA-18E/F aircraft in fiscal year 2010 as originally \nplanned in the program of record, rather than the nine aircraft \nrequested by the President's budget. Our subcommittee believes these \nadded aircraft are a sensible investment to make against a looming \ndangerous shortfall in our Nation's tactical aviation aircraft \ninventory. In other words, the new generation of tactical airfighters \ncoming on will not be there early enough to help the Navy overcome the \nrunning out of the lifespan of the series of tactical aircraft they \nhave now. That will put them way below what the Navy believes it needs \nin the years ahead.\n  The subcommittee has also recommended an additional $1.75 billion to \nbuy seven F-22A Raptor aircraft rather than terminating the production \nprogram as requested by the Department. This was a judgment made by the \nfull committee when it received our subcommittee report. Although this \nwas a hard decision, the continued production of the Raptor will \nguarantee that we have balanced combat air forces in the future and \nsupport the transition between F-22A and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter \nprograms.\n  The bill also includes an additional $20.4 million to support 12 \nadditional Blackhawk A-to-L model conversions to accelerate \nmodernization of the Army's Active and Reserve component fleets.\n  In the area of efficiencies, the bill recommends making adjustments \nor reductions as follows: a decrease of $209.5 million for the C-130 \nAvionics Modernization Program because of the delays in beginning the \nproduction program and a decrease of $90 million for the CSAR-X, the \nsearch and rescue helicopter program, because of the availability of \nprior year funds to cover fiscal year 2010 requirements.\n  There is one provision of this bill about which I myself have grave \nreservations. The full committee overturned the recommendation of our \nsubcommittee that concerns the development of the alternate engine for \nthe Joint Strike Fighter, a second engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. \nPresident Obama, as President Bush before him, concluded, after the \ncompetition was held, the one engine met the needs of our military for \nthe Joint Strike Fighter Program without the additional cost required \nfor a second engine development program.\n  The full committee overturned the judgment of the subcommittee and \nprovided $439 million in the coming fiscal year for the second engine. \nThe President, incidentally, has singled out that engine as an example \nof one that he says ``do[es] nothing to keep us safe'' and has said if \nthe second engine is included in the bill, he will consider vetoing the \nbill. I intend to work with my colleagues this week to hopefully remove \nthe funding for the alternative engine and restore it to where it was \nintended, which was to fund the development of the Joint Strike Fighter \nand to pay for 10 UH-1Y helicopters, familiarly known as Hueys, that \nwere cut to pay for this program that otherwise would go to the \nMarines. Both the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Vice Chairman \nof Joint Chiefs of Staff have described this as critical for our \nMarines fighting in Afghanistan. They need those 10 Hueys.\n  Despite that one reservation, the legislation and funding in the bill \nwould end the Airland Subcommittee's jurisdiction. Indeed, the bill in \ngeneral strongly supports our Armed Forces in a time of war and \nsupports the flexibility the Department, under Secretary Gates, has \nrequested as it charts a path to military modernization. I praised \nChairman Levin in his absence. I don't want to miss the opportunity to \npraise him in his presence, along with Senator McCain, for the \nleadership both have brought to this committee and the extraordinary \nexample of bipartisanship in the interest of national security that \nthey together have demonstrated through their work on the committee.\n  There will be a lot of amendments and some will be controversial. But \nwhen it is all over and we come to adoption of the legislation, I hope, \nwith confidence, that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \ngive the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010 the \nresounding bipartisan support it and our military deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me thank Senator Lieberman for all \nthe work he has done on our committee, for coming to the Chamber and \nsetting out the parts of the bill he not only strongly supports but had \na great deal of effort he put forth, with colleagues on the committee, \nto make happen. We are grateful for that. He also indicated where the \ndifferences are so we can begin to focus on some of the amendments we \nwill need to consider this week. I hope other colleagues will follow \nhis lead and come to the floor to indicate where they may be wanting to \noffer amendments so we can make progress. We are waiting for those \nnotifications, and we very much appreciate it.\n  I thank him.\n  I see Senator Nelson on the Senate floor. I know he will be \nrecognized next. Senator Nelson has a very important subcommittee into \nwhich he has put a huge amount of time. He is an invaluable member of \nour committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I am happy to be here to \nsupport our committee work product. We had a full complement of \nhearings and briefings for the Members in a very complicated area: the \nstrategic defense systems of our national defense policy. I have the \nprivilege of chairing the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. I wish to give \na few examples.\n  On the whole question of missile defense, which has been so \ncontroversial over the course of the last two and half decades, we had \na good bit of consensus when we got down to the end. It is funded at \nthe amount of the budget request by the President. We did a little bit \nof rearranging from what the President had recommended but stuck \nbasically with the theory that we will have 44 ground-based \ninterceptors, and 30 of them will be in the actual silos so that they \nwill be reliable, available, and effective.\n  This has been a system where we are absolutely insisting that there \nis robust testing, testing not only of a missile that would be fired at \nan incoming threat but that there would be a volley of them, that there \nwould be a missile that would shoot at a target. It would assess that \ntarget, and it would shoot a second missile at that target to make \nsure, if that were an inbound ICBM coming into the United States, that \nwe would be sure we could hit it before it ever reached its target in \nthe United States.\n\n[[Page S7397]]\n\n  Part of this was, we adopted an amendment that would be part of the \nQuadrennial Defense Review and the Ballistic Missile Defense Review \nwhich are now both underway. It would give a detailed assessment of the \nground-based midcourse defense system. That report would also require a \ndetailed plan for how the Department of Defense is going to sustain the \nplanned ground-based missile deployment capability. The Department \nwould provide that assessment and the plan to Congress with the \nsubmission of next year's budget.\n  At the end of the day, what we are looking for is that we have a \nmissile defense system that works and that we know it works in case \nsome rogue state, such as North Korea or Iran, were to try to pull off \nan attack on the United States so we could knock that attack down.\n  We have a lot of other systems in place besides the ground-based \ninterceptors. For example, we have our Aegis system of ships. We have \nthe standard missile 3 that is land based that, on a lot of these \nthreats coming, as I suggested, if it were from Iran or North Korea, we \ncould get them in the boost phase of their threatening missile. But \nthis missile defense system we are talking about, the ground-based \ninterceptors in the silos in Alaska and California right now, this \nwould get them in midcourse so that when an ICBM would be launched \nagainst us, if we did not get it in its initial phase, the boost phase, \nwe would get it in its midcourse phase before it comes in to its \nterminal phase. The terminal phase would be the last part coming into \nthe target.\n  We are going to have a layered system that is going to give us a lot \nof capability to protect ourselves in the future from anybody who wants \nto try to threaten us with an ICBM. That is a part of what we have \ndone.\n  The Secretary of Defense has said he wants 44 of these missiles. We \nare planning for that. But at any one time, 30 of them would be in the \nsilos in the ground, ready to go, knowing that if the balloon went up \nand that we had to strike, we would strike with accuracy and with \nredundancy in order to knock those threats out of the sky before they \never got to us.\n  In other strategic systems, we want to look at the bombers. We want \nto make sure we have the future technologies that, if it is the \ndecision of the United States Government to develop a future bomber, in \naddition to what we have now, which is the B-52s, the B-1s, and the B-\n2s, we would have that capability by developing the technologies.\n  Part of our strategic systems are also our space systems; that is, \nthe satellites in orbit that watch and listen in order to protect our \nnational security. We have funded something called operationally \nresponsive space. It includes funds for a new satellite which was not \nin the Air Force budget. It was on what they called their unfunded \npriority list. Our recommendation is to develop that satellite, an ORS-\n1 satellite.\n  Then we are looking to the future to go out for competition on \ndeveloping a next generation kind of satellite that would be a very \nsmall satellite that would be to observe but would be a lot more \neconomical and quicker to launch. We want the Air Force to have space \nsituational awareness information at all times, including from our \ncommercial operators. We have a lot of commercial satellites up there. \nThey take a lot of pictures. That is of a value to us in the \ngovernment, to utilize those pictures in addition to the others we \nreceive.\n  We also have added funding to look at a new low cost imaging \nsatellite for future application. In our Strategic Force Subcommittee \nwe also deal in intelligence. We have asked the Department of Defense \nto look at some of these commercial imaging satellites to utilize that \ninformation, maybe even a new kind of commercial imaging satellite that \nwould be capable and would give us information on how to disseminate \nthat information.\n  We also, being concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons, have \nrequested a report on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and \nmaterials. The Department of Energy is a part of our Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee. That is the part that is involved in weapons activity. We \ndecided to increase their budget by $106 million to a total of $6.4 \nbillion. It is focused on making sure that the stockpile we have is \neffective and that it is safe and that we continue the process, under \nthe treaties, of dismantling.\n  There is a provision that directs the Department of Energy to carry \nout a stockpile life extension program, to do what I had said, which is \nto modernize and maintain the stockpile and to make it even safer, and \nto do all of that without testing. We have added additional funds for \nnuclear weapons laboratories to provide technical support and analysis \nto the intelligence community.\n  So there is another issue; that is, what we are going to do with some \nof the pensions at the Department of Energy contractor-operated sites. \nThere is another real issue which we have addressed, which is what are \nwe going to do with some of this nuclear waste--the waste from the \nweapons processing plants? And how do you go about making sure that \nwaste is safe? And, ultimately, how is it disposed of?\n  So the Strategic Forces Subcommittee was quite active. It has been my \nprivilege to work with the chairman of the committee, Senator Levin. \nWhat could have been a very contentious part of the Defense \nauthorization bill ended up being where we got very wide and very \nconsiderable bipartisan support. It is my privilege to have been a part \nof that process.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, when the Senator from Florida says the \nsubcommittee has been active, it is a true understatement. It has been \nextremely active. It has been very creative. It has operated on a \nbipartisan basis under Senator Nelson's leadership. It is a very \nchallenging position he holds as that subcommittee chair because of the \nsubject matter, and I wish to thank him and commend him for all the \ngreat work he does.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7397-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7397-S7402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      NOMINATION OF ROBERT M. GROVES TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE CENSUS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Robert M. Groves, of \nMichigan, to be Director of the Census.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 1 \nhour of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to oppose cloture on the \nnomination of Robert Groves to be Census Director.\n  As we all know, the 2010 Census is right around the corner. This is a \nvery important process that should not be taken lightly. The census, of \ncourse, is an official count of the country's population mandated by \nthe U.S. Constitution, and it is used to determine distribution of \ntaxpayer money through grants and appropriations and the apportionment \nof the 435 seats in the House of Representatives.\n  Every U.S. household unit, including those occupied by noncitizens \nand illegal immigrants, must be counted. We must take every effort to \nmake this a fair and accurate census that is not skewed in any way by \npolitical influence or using poor statistical material. With that in \nmind, I have very serious concerns about some of the administration's \nplans for the census, particularly with regard to ACORN, the \nAssociation of Community Organizations for Reform Now.\n  ACORN signed up in February 2009 to assist the U.S. Census Bureau as \na national partner, and they signed up specifically to help recruit 1.4 \nmillion temporary workers needed to go door-to-door to count every \nperson in the\n\n[[Page S7398]]\n\nUnited States. So they are a ``2010 census partner''--an official \ncensus partner given this delineation by the U.S. Census Bureau. There \nwas a very full report on this by the Wall Street Journal just last \nmonth, in June of this year. I have very serious concerns about this.\n  As did Senator Shelby, I wrote the administration asking for \nassurances that ACORN would have no role whatsoever in the Census. I \nbelieve Senator Shelby originally wrote his letter in March. I sent my \nletter in early June. Today we have gotten absolutely no response.\n  Let me remind my colleagues why this should be a very serious concern \nfor all of us. And we don't have to look far in terms of history to \nunderstand these concerns; the last election cycle will do. In May \n2009, Nevada filed charges against ACORN. The complaint includes 26 \ncounts of voter fraud and 13 counts for compensating those registering \nvoters, both felonies. From July 27 through October 2 of 2008, ACORN in \nNevada also provided additional compensation under a bonus program \ncalled Blackjack or 21-Plus that was based on the total number of \nvoters a person registered. A canvasser who brought in 21 or more \ncompleted voter registration forms per shift would be paid a bonus of \n$5.\n  There are other serious complaints that have been made against ACORN. \nIn March 2008, an ACORN worker in Pennsylvania was sentenced for making \n29 phony voter registration forms. In 2007, Washington State filed \nfelony charges against several paid ACORN employees and supervisors for \nmore than 1,700 fraudulent voter registrations.\n  I think it is fair to say the American public does have strong \nconcerns about ACORN because of this long history of voter registration \nand voter fraud. So why should this organization be signed up as an \nofficial 2010 census partner to do exactly the sort of activity of \nlisting people, signing up people as they did fraudulently with regard \nto voter registration?\n  Again, this is very worrisome. What is even more worrisome is that \nfor months, these clear concerns have been brought before the Obama \nadministration, and the administration has done absolutely nothing to \ndispel these very deep and very legitimate concerns. Again, my \ncolleague, Senator Shelby, who will be speaking in a moment, sent his \nletter in March of this year outlining these strong concerns, asking \nthe administration to state categorically that ACORN would have nothing \nto do with the census. I sent a similar followup letter in June of this \nyear. To date, we have gotten no response.\n  As it stands now, we are going to sign up ACORN to do exactly the \nsort of activity they have done over and over and over again \nfraudulently, illegally, with regard to voter registration. It is \noutrageous when so much is on the line with this next very important \ncensus.\n  For these reasons, I will strongly oppose this cloture vote for the \ncensus nominee. I continue to urge the administration to assure us that \nACORN will have nothing to do with the process, after they have built \nup a long and storied record, unfortunately, of fraud with regard to \nsimilar activity in terms of voter registration.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise with concern regarding the \nnomination of Mr. Robert Groves to serve as Director of the Census. I \nhave some of the same concerns my colleague from Louisiana has.\n  Conducting the census is a vital constitutional obligation. Under the \nU.S. Constitution, the country conducts a census every 10 years to \ndetermine apportionment to Congress. Article I, section 2 of the \nConstitution mandates ``enumeration'' to determine the allocation of \nseats for each State in the U.S. House of Representatives, as the Chair \nwell knows. By extension, the census also determines the composition of \nthe electoral college which chooses the President of the United States. \nThe information collected from the census has a significant impact on \nthe distribution of political power in this country.\n  The results of this process are a major factor in deciding where \ncongressional district lines are drawn within each State. Through \nredistricting, political parties can maximize their own party's clout, \nwhile minimizing the opposition. If the census were politicized, the \nparty in control could arguably perpetuate its hold on political power.\n  The results of the census are also enormously important in another \nway--the allocation of Federal funds. Theoretically, if the census were \nto become politicized, the political party controlling the census \nprocess could disproportionately steer Federal funding to areas \ndominated by its own Members through a skewing of census numbers. This \ncould shift billions of Federal dollars for roads, schools, and \nhospitals over the next 10 years from some parts of the country to \nothers because of the population-driven financing formula.\n\n  The census is vastly important and must proceed in as reliable and \naccurate a manner as possible.\n  On March 20 of this year, I wrote to President Obama regarding \nreports that the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now \nknown as ACORN--that is what they go by--has signed as a national \npartner with the U.S. Census Bureau to assist with recruiting temporary \ncensus workers. I wish to say this again because it was disturbing to \nme: On March 20, I wrote to President Obama regarding reports that the \nAssociation of Community Organizations for Reform Now--ACORN--had \nsigned as a national partner with the U.S. Census Bureau to assist the \ncensus with recruiting temporary Census workers. That letter remains \nunanswered.\n  I cannot support the nomination of Mr. Groves when the administration \nhe works for would partner with such a questionable organization as \nACORN.\n  Further, I am dismayed that Mr. Groves, the nominee to head the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, would not denounce ACORN's role in the census. Let me \ntell my colleagues a little about ACORN, as I understand it.\n  ACORN has had numerous allegations of fraud which should raise great \nconcern about the accuracy of the data it would provide to the census. \nFor example, Washington State filed felony charges in 2007 against \nseveral paid ACORN employees and supervisors for falsifying 1,700 \nfraudulent voter registration cards. An ACORN worker in the State of \nPennsylvania was sentenced in 2008 for fabricating 29 falsified voter \nregistration forms. In Ohio, in 2004, a worker for one affiliate of \nACORN was given crack cocaine in exchange for fraudulent registrations \nthat included underaged as well as dead voters. ACORN has been \nimplicated in similar voter registration schemes around the country, \nand its activities were frequently questioned throughout the 2008 \nPresidential election.\n  I believe the census must be nonpartisan. It must be totally above \nreproach. It must be honest. We cannot allow a biased, politically \nactive organization to take any type of official role in the process, \nlet alone recruit workers for the census. While overcounting here and \nundercounting there, manipulation could take place solely for political \ngain. Using ACORN to mobilize hundreds of thousands of temporary \nworkers can surely lead to abuses for those who want to gain political \nadvantage, as we saw with the voter registration issues in past \nelections.\n  The laws that govern voter fraud were not enough to dissuade those \nwith the intent to throw an election. It is doubtful the laws governing \nfraud in the census will be any more effective against such deceitful \nintents.\n  The people of this Nation deserve a census that is conducted in a \nfair and accurate manner, using the best methods to determine the \noutcome, and that is free from political tampering. Given ACORN's \nhistory and political connections, the U.S. Census Bureau should not \npartner with an organization that has systemic problems with both \naccuracy and legitimacy.\n  While I cannot support Mr. Groves' nomination, I hope he will \ncarefully review this issue and terminate ACORN's role in the 2010 \ncensus. It would be a big first step for him. We must not let the \ncensus become a blatant political tool in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, this is not about ACORN. ACORN is not \ngoing to be hired or out there recruiting folks to go door-to-door to \ndo the\n\n[[Page S7399]]\n\nenumeration for the census. ACORN isn't going to be out there getting \nany money or grants. In fact, no Census Bureau partners are receiving \nmoney or grants, and ACORN is no exception. As the Census Bureau has \nreiterated, ACORN is actually one of thousands of organizations whose \npurpose in this whole matter is to try to encourage people to respond \nto the census. That is what they are about, trying to make sure people \nrespond to the census.\n  Right here is a copy of the Constitution that lays out one of the few \nresponsibilities we have as a Federal Government. It is actually \nspelled out in the Constitution and says we are expected to do this. \nEvery 10 years, we are supposed to conduct the census. It says we are \nsupposed to count everybody. We are supposed to count everybody. Just \nas a ship needs a good captain, a school needs a good principal, the \ncountry needs a good President, the Census Bureau needs a good \nDirector.\n  We have been 7 months without a Census Bureau Director. The Census \nBureau is supposed to turn a light switch on next April 1 and do the \ncensus. It is a big deal. Hundreds of thousands of people are involved, \nyears of effort, in making sure we count everybody as closely or as \nnearly as we can and in a cost-effective way. It is a constitutional \nrequirement.\n  Gary Locke, Governor of Washington, was nominated to be Secretary of \nCommerce, and the census falls within the Commerce Department. I ran \ninto him the day after, I think, his name was put out for nominee from \nCommerce, and I said: I have three things I want you to think about: \n(1) the Census Bureau Director; (2) the Census Bureau Director; and (3) \nthe Census Bureau Director. I told him: We don't have anybody, and if \nyou have any names of folks you think would be good, let us have them.\n  Ironically, a week or so later, I held a subcommittee hearing focused \non the census, getting ready for April of 2010--without a Bureau \nDirector. We had before us that day folks who were involved in the \ncensus in 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. At the end of the hearing, I said \nwe need somebody really good to run this operation. Dr. Murdock had \nbeen the Census Bureau Director the previous year. He was only with us \nfor a year, but I said we need somebody that good or even better. I \nsaid: By the close of this week, I want each of you to give me one or \ntwo names of who you think would be a terrific Director for the Census \nBureau. Guess whose name I got back from almost every one of the \nwitnesses. Robert Groves.\n  Dr. Groves, in my view, is an inspired choice for this position. His \nextensive expertise in statistics, social research and survey \nmethodology, and the administration of large-scale surveys makes him \nideally suited for this position. He served once as the Associate \nDirector for the Census Bureau, I think about 10 years ago. Dr. Groves \nknows how it operates. He has been involved in the census. He knows \nwhat the employees need, and he will be able to successfully implement \nthe census and other programs. Those experiences have prepared him \nextraordinarily well to lead the census at a time when rapid changes \nare occurring.\n  He elevated the University of Michigan's survey research \norganization. I am an Ohio State undergraduate, and I am raising the \nflag and promoting a fellow from Michigan, so you know he has to be \ngood for me to do that. I said to my colleagues on this floor that we \nare lucky to have somebody this good and willing at this late stage to \nlead us into doing a great job on the census. Numerous Federal and \nState agencies and policymakers have sought his expertise on survey \ndesign and response.\n  Dr. Groves has been accessible to Senators and our staffs throughout \nthis process. Requests to meet with Dr. Groves were extended to every \nmember of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in \nthe Senate. He also met with every Senator, as far as I know, who \nrequested a meeting, regardless of committee assignment. Dr. Groves \nreceived two questions for the record after his hearing. They were \nanswered within hours--not days or weeks--of the hearing's end. Every \nSenator who agreed to meet with Dr. Groves, Republican and Democrat \nalike, decided to support him.\n  Dr. Groves--or whoever will be our next Census Bureau Director, and I \nhope it will be he--will undoubtedly face a host of operational and \nmanagement challenges as we move closer to the 2010 census. I am \nconfident he is extraordinarily well equipped to understand the \nagency's inner workings, to lead his staff, and to be a national \nspokesman for the 2010 census and the agency's other equally ongoing \nsurvey programs.\n  Somewhere here, I have some questions that were asked of him at our \nhearing. Let's see if I can find one of them. I know this has been \nmentioned on the floor.\n  I see Senator Collins, who is the ranking Republican on the \ncommittee. I think it might have been Senator Collins who actually \nquestioned Dr. Groves about sampling and whether we are going to just \nsample as opposed to actually counting people and making sure things \nare right. The Census Bureau has been very clear that it will not \nadjust the 2010 census counts. The plans and designs for the 2010 \ncensus have been in place for nearly a decade. The operations are \nalready underway. The Bureau began to address canvassing this spring, \nwhich is finding out all of the addresses--not necessarily who lives \nthere but the addresses--and try to automate that. The Secretary of \nCommerce reiterated that sampling is not included in the design for the \n2010 census. It couldn't be even if we wanted it to be. At this late \nstage of the game, not only do we not want it to be, but it couldn't \nbe.\n  As to what 2020 will bring or need, it is too early to tell. First, \nuntil we know how we are going to perform in 2010, what works best, and \nwhere we can improve, we cannot begin to dictate the design of the 2020 \ncensus; neither should we attempt to prescribe for the future in the \nCongress and in the scientific community that which we cannot, frankly, \nforesee.\n  How much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 7 minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. I will reserve the remainder of my time. I thank the \nChair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nDr. Robert Groves to be the next Director of the Census Bureau. Our \ncommittee, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \nscrutinized this nominee very carefully. First, I wish to give some \nbackground on why it is so critical that we have a well-qualified \nindividual heading the Census Bureau as quickly as possible and then \ntalk to my colleagues about why I believe Dr. Groves is, indeed, the \nright person for that critical position.\n  With the 2010 census fast approaching, the Director of the Census \nBureau will need to quickly take action to ensure an accurate, actual \nenumeration of all those residing in the United States, as set forth \nand required by our Constitution.\n  The decennial census is a complex and extensive operation. The \ninformation collected has significant impact on the distribution of \npolitical power because, after all, it governs the allocation of seats \nin the House of Representatives and it also affects the allocation of \nmore than $300 billion in Federal resources. With so much at stake, it \nis essential that the results of the census be accurate, objective, \ncredible, and free from even the appearance of political influence.\n  The Census Bureau, unfortunately, faces significant operational and \norganizational challenges. Bureau officials acknowledged in 2008 that \nthey were experiencing critical problems in the management and testing \nof key information technology systems.\n  Due to the leadership and investigative work of Senator Carper and \nSenator Coburn, our committee held numerous hearings looking at the \nfailed procurements of the Census Bureau. Believe me, it has not been a \npretty picture. These problems have resulted in a dramatic increase in \nthe cost of the 2010 census, and it is particularly alarming in this \nday and age of technology that millions of dollars invested by the \nCensus Bureau in handheld computers have gone to waste. The Bureau,\n\n[[Page S7400]]\n\nin fact, has once again returned to the use of paper and pencil to \ngather important data. Isn't that extraordinary in this day and age? It \nis clear there are woefully inadequate and wasteful procurement \npractices and even gross mismanagement at the Bureau. We simply cannot \nafford to waste time and money on critical programs that do not produce \nresults, particularly when it comes to a constitutionally mandated task \nsuch as the census.\n  The next Director of the Census Bureau must take steps right now to \naddress the current shortcomings and to prepare for the current and \nfuture census challenges. He will be responsible for ensuring that the \nBureau fulfills its mission in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, \nwithout undue political influence and with careful management of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  I have concluded that Dr. Groves is superbly well qualified for this \nimportant position. That is why our committee unanimously voted, by a \nvoice vote, to confirm him. Our committee spans the political spectrum, \nand all of us felt Dr. Groves was well qualified for this critical \nposition.\n  Madam President, personally, I have had the opportunity to meet with \nDr. Groves, to scrutinize his qualifications and background, and to \nquestion him intensely about the issues that have caused a few of my \ncolleagues concern. I say to my colleagues, look at the hearing record, \nlook at Dr. Groves' responses. I pressed him, as Senator Carper has \npointed out, about the need to conduct the census free of any political \ninfluence, and I specifically asked him about the use of sampling for \nthe 2010 census and the 2020 census. Dr. Groves not only committed to \nkeeping politics out of the population count but also said he would \nresign and actively work to stop any action to improperly influence the \ncensus for political gain. He further stated, under oath, that he had \nno intention of seeking an adjustment of either the 2010 census or the \n2020 census.\n  Let me read from the committee transcript because I, too, am very \nconcerned about this problem. There were some initial indications that \nthis White House might, in fact, be looking to influence the census in \nan improper way. That is why I wanted to get Dr. Groves on the record, \nunder oath, on this important issue.\n  Here is what I asked him:\n\n       Dr. Groves, would you be prepared to resign if you were \n     asked or pressured to do something or take some action to \n     satisfy a political concern?\n\n  Doctor Groves responded to me:\n\n       More than that, Senator. If I resign, I promise you today \n     that after I resign, I would be active in stopping the abuse \n     from outside the system.\n\n  In other words, Dr. Groves told me that if political pressure were \nput on him, he would not only resign, he would go public and he would \nlead the fight to protect the census from undue political influence. He \ncommitted to a transparent census process, stating:\n\n       Sunshine, doing one's work in an open environment, having \n     an ongoing dialog with all of the stakeholders is one way to \n     insulate the Census Bureau from that political partisanship.\n\n  He went on to add:\n\n       Transparency is a very powerful antidote to attempts for \n     partisan influence.\n\n  What could be clearer than that? Here we have a nominee who has \npledged that he would resign if political influence were brought to \nbear on his office. I don't know what more you could ask, and this is \nthe commitment given at a public hearing, under oath, as well as \nprivately to me when we met in my office.\n  Let me go on to the second issue that has been raised. Again, an \nimportant issue. I agree with my colleagues on my side of the aisle who \nhave been concerned about whether sampling would be used rather than \nthe actual count mandated by the Constitution. On this issue of \nsampling, I asked Dr. Groves:\n\n       Will you advocate for the statistical adjustment or use of \n     sampling for the 2010 census?\n\n  Dr. Groves's response:\n\n       No, Senator.\n\n  That is an unqualified response: ``No, Senator.''\n  I then asked him a further question: ``Will you advocate for the \nstatistical adjustment of the 2020 census,'' since, after all, maybe \nthere is not time to adjust the 2010 census to have sampling or a \nstatistical adjustment, given how close we are to the 2010 census. So I \nasked him about the 2020 census.\n  Dr. Groves's response:\n\n       I have no plans to do that for 2020.\n\n  Dr. Groves's record of service and leadership and scientific research \nspans the academic, government, and private sectors, both within the \nUnited States and internationally. As the director of the University of \nMichigan Survey Research Center, a very well-known prestigious research \ncenter; as the former director of the Joint Program in Service \nMethodology; and the former associate director of Statistical Design \nStandards and Methodology at the Census Bureau, he is considered to be \none of a half dozen most highly regarded service research experts in \nthe world.\n  He is extraordinarily well qualified. He is not a political person. \nHe is a scientist, a researcher, a statistician. That is why it is not \nsurprising that Dr. Groves's nomination has received strong support \nfrom a number of organizations, including the American Statistical \nAssociation. I will concede, I did not know that such an organization \nexisted prior to this nominee. But they have endorsed him, as well as \nsome, perhaps, groups better known to us, such as the U.S. Conference \nof Mayors, the National League of Cities, and the Population Reference \nBureau.\n  But here is what is more telling. Six former Census Directors from \nboth Democratic and Republican administrations have also endorsed Mr. \nGroves's nomination. Six from both parties, from both sides of the \naisle, from Democratic and Republican administrations. This is a \ntestament to the respect that Dr. Groves's peers have for his work.\n  Dr. Groves has the leadership and professional experience that is \nneeded to lead the Bureau through the 2010 census to plan for the 2020 \ncensus and to direct the Bureau's other vital programs. I would be the \nfirst to be here in opposition if I believed he was going to use \nsampling or if I believed he was going to be susceptible to political \npressure. There is nothing in the record or in his testimony that \nsuggests that.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support this nomination and to \nlet us get on with the critical work that needs to be done at this \nBureau which, regrettably, has been so poorly managed in the last few \nyears.\n  I look forward to working with Dr. Groves. I urge our colleagues to \nsupport his nomination.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe nomination of Robert M. Groves to serve as the Director of the U.S. \nBureau of the Census. I believe that he is extremely qualified to serve \nin this position. Dr. Groves is highly recognized by the academic \ncommunity for his extraordinary work in survey methodology. He has \npreviously held positions at the Census Bureau, including Associate \nDirector and visiting researcher. His extensive academic and \nprofessional background makes him well suited for the responsibilities \nand challenges he will face as U.S. Census Director.\n  As the year 2010 draws near, the Census Bureau is preparing to \nconduct the 23rd census of the United States. This national decennial \ncensus, as mandated by our Constitution, will yield results that will \naffect each and every citizen. The census serves to determine the \napportionment of legislative seats, the distribution of Federal \nfunding, and it provides important data as to what community resources \nare needed and how these resources should be allocated. Additionally, \ncensus data can offer a better understanding of the changing dynamics \nof our country. Thus, it is imperative that the census count be \naccurate. The Census Bureau must be led by a Director who understands \nthe challenges presented by this daunting task. Mr. Groves is ready to \nface these challenges with the help of a comprehensive technology \nstrategy and a dedicated workforce.\n  I am proud to say that many members of this dedicated staff are based \nat the U.S. Census Bureau Headquarters in Suitland, MD. Since 1942, the \nU.S. Census Bureau has been headquartered in Suitland. Currently, \napproximately 4,300 individuals are employed there, working hard to \nensure that we have the data necessary to make important decisions \naffecting the lives of all Americans. I commend each of them for their \nvaluable work.\n  Coordinating the census is a herculean task. To compile socio-\neconomic\n\n[[Page S7401]]\n\ndata on each and every individual in this country is a daunting, mind-\nboggling task. The timeliness, relevancy, and quality of the data \ncollected and services provided by the men and women at the Census \nBureau Headquarters with Dr. Groves at the helm will ensure the \nsuccessful completion of the upcoming decennial census and the future \nof the Census Bureau.\n  I am pleased to support the nomination of Robert M. Groves as \nDirector of the U.S. Census Bureau and encourage my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am very pleased to support the \nnomination of Bob Groves to be Director of the U.S. Census Bureau. Dr. \nGroves is not just a well-qualified candidate; he may be the best \nqualified candidate ever nominated for this position.\n  Dr. Groves has been endorsed by many scientific and professional \nassociations, including the American Statistical Association, the \nAmerican Sociological Association, and the Council of American Survey \nResearch Organizations. He has also been endorsed by six former \nDirectors of the U.S. Census Bureau who were appointed by both \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of \nendorsement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                           The Census Project,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 2009.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman: We, the undersigned former \n     Directors of the U.S. Census Bureau who are familiar with the \n     career of Robert M. Groves, want to endorse his nomination as \n     the next Director and urge his speedy confirmation.\n       It is a plus that Dr. Groves has had experience at the \n     Census Bureau, where he was brought in to reinvigorate the \n     Statistical Methods Division. He built a strong research team \n     who did much of the early research for improving the 2000 \n     census. He came to the Census Bureau under the condition that \n     the Bureau would provide positions in his division for him to \n     recruit a small number of research specialists from academic \n     institutions, other federal statistical agencies, and from \n     within the Census Bureau for his team. Everyone he asked to \n     join that team considered it a career plus to join him.\n       Dr. Groves is a nonpartisan, academic researcher who has \n     focused much of his research on non-response to household \n     surveys and survey error, has published three of the most-\n     cited textbooks and numerous journal articles on survey \n     research, and has mentored many graduate students who now \n     staff most of the major academic and private sector survey \n     organizations in the field. As Director of the University of \n     Michigan's prestigious Survey Research Center/Institute of \n     Social Research, he is one of the half dozen most highly \n     regarded survey research methodologists not only in the \n     United States but in the world.\n       As you know, time is short, and his speedy confirmation can \n     help achieve a 2010 census that is as accurate as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles Louis Kincannon\n       (2002-2008);\n     Kenneth Prewitt\n       (1998-2001);\n     Martha Farnsworth Riche\n       (1994-1998);\n     Barbara Everitt Bryant\n       (1989-1993);\n     John G. Keane\n       (1984-1989);\n     Vincent Barabba\n       (1973-1976; 1979-1981).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. In 2001, Dr. Groves was elected by his peers to lead the \nInstitute for Social Research and the Survey Research Center at the \nUniversity of Michigan. This is the largest academic-based research \ninstitute of its kind in the world. It has educated many of our \nNation's scientific leaders in the field of survey statistics. We \nsometimes talk about peer review. Well, he has been peer reviewed, and \nhe was selected by his peers to lead that prestigious institution.\n  Dr. Groves is a longtime Michigan resident. He has been part of the \nUniversity of Michigan community since he began his master's studies in \nAnn Arbor in 1970. He graduated summa cum laude from Dartmouth College \nwith a degree in sociology and earned master's degrees in statistics \nand sociology and a doctorate in sociology from the University of \nMichigan.\n  He is truly a highly respected expert in survey methodology and \nstatistics, and he will bring greatly needed leadership to the Census \nBureau as it continues to prepare for and execute the 2010 census. Dr. \nGroves deserves the overwhelming support of the Senate.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I think we are going to vote in about 12 \nminutes or so, but I just wanted to reiterate a couple of things that \nhave been said.\n  First of all, our Constitution doesn't talk about a lot of the things \nwe do to run our government in this country, but one of the things it \ntalks about at some length is the census. It says to do it every 10 \nyears. We have tried to do that and do it well. It has gotten more \ndifficult. We have a lot more people, and far flung. We have a lot more \npeople to count next year than we did 10 years ago. People have \nconcerns about privacy, and folks in this country speak a lot of \ndifferent languages, just like they did when the first census was done.\n  We are going to use technology. We are not going to use the \ntechnology we ought to. We need a Director who understands that and is \nin a position to make sure the technology we do plan to use in 2010 we \nuse well, and when 2020 rolls around, we will use it a whole lot more \neffectively.\n  It would be great to have a Census Director who was well schooled, \nwell educated in doing the kind of work that is called on in conducting \na census--counting large numbers of people. This fellow's credentials \nare superb. It would be great if we had someone who had actually worked \nat a high level in the census and demonstrated by his work his ability \nto run a large organization. He has done that, and at the University of \nMichigan he has headed up a very large organization of some of the \nsmartest people in this country who work on these sorts of issues and \nhas done so, from everyone we have heard, with great aplomb and great \nability.\n  As I said earlier, at the hearing I conducted several months ago with \nsome of our colleagues on the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, we reached out to people who have run the census in \nthe last 30 or 40 years. We asked some of these folks to tell us who \nthey thought would be good, and virtually everyone who has been \ninvolved in the census in a high leadership position has said not only \nwould we be lucky to get a fellow with Dr. Groves's reputation, his \nleadership and ability, but we would be lucky to have somebody with \nthis kind of experience.\n  For me, and I know for my colleagues, an important issue is what is \nthe character and the integrity of the person taking this position. I \nthink it was Senator Collins who asked the question: If you believe \npolitical influence is being used in the conduct of the 2010 census, \nwould you be willing to look into resigning as a form of protest \nagainst any kind of political involvement?\n  And he said: Not only would I be willing to resign, I will resign. I \nwould use whatever ability I could to bring to light the kind of \nbehavior that led to my resignation, to discredit that behavior, and \nmake it clear that is what I think we should not do, and that, \nliterally, that behavior caused me to resign as the Census Director.\n  I think it would be great if we had somebody who is interested in \nthis job, willing to do the job, is well qualified, and who was willing \nto meet with anybody who wanted to meet with him whether they were on \nthe committee of\n\n[[Page S7402]]\n\njurisdiction--Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs--or not; \nwhether they were a Democrat or not. To my knowledge, he has met with \nall of us who wanted to spend time with him.\n  The last thing I would say--and one of the things I found so \nrefreshing--is that he is not a political guy. This is someone who is a \nscientist. He is a statistician. He is good at leading a large \norganization. He gets this stuff. He enjoys this stuff. How lucky we \nare to get someone who wants to take on this challenge for us in our \nNation's history.\n  For these reasons and others that Senator Collins and I have \nmentioned, he deserves our support. I hope in 10 minutes or so, when we \nhave the opportunity to vote, we will vote for him in very large, \noverwhelming numbers.\n  Madam President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty seconds remain.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination of \n     Robert M.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise this evening to express my \nopposition to the Levin-McCain amendment which would cut short the \nproduction of the F-22 fighter. I understand my position on this puts \nme at odds with our President, President Obama, as well as the chairman \nand ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, both fine \npublic servants for whom I have a tremendous amount of respect and with \nwhom I have worked on numerous occasions, and I look forward to doing \nso in the future once we get beyond this.\n  I also think I have a duty to stand up for an airplane built by \nconstituents of mine. I wouldn't make the case strictly on job loss in \nan individual State. That is not a legitimate argument to make to 99 of \nmy colleagues from around the country. If we made the case that job \nlosses would occur in our own respective districts or States, obviously \nit would lead to chaos and we wouldn't have a situation like that.\n  My argument in support of this F-22 goes far beyond the potential job \nlosses in my State, although that is not insignificant. Some 2,000 jobs \ncould be lost potentially in Connecticut. More important than the job \nloss, as important as that is, is the potential loss of the industrial \nbase that is absolutely critical to maintaining the ability to produce \nthe superior engines that we historically have been able to produce at \nthe Pratt & Whitney Division of United Technologies, a corporation in \nmy home State. The work being done by machinists and engineers and \ntechnicians in my State and others all across the country not only \nproduce quality work but also make a significant difference in saving \nlives and in giving us the superior ability to deal with potential \nthreats that our Nation faces. That has been a hallmark of every \ngeneration that has come before us, not to achieve parity with \npotential adversaries but to be in a superior position to potential \nadversaries.\n  So let me begin with my concerns over this amendment's potential \nimpact on our national security. Since the advent of modern warfare, \nmilitary strategists have sought the highest\n\n[[Page S7403]]\n\nground on the battlefield to gain technical advantage. In the age of \nthe fighter jet, that means commanding the skies. In a modern era, air \nsuperiority has become a cornerstone of American strategy. The F-22 is \nthe reason we can lay claim to this superiority at this critical time. \nIt is a fast plane, reaching speeds of mach 1.5 in 90 seconds. That is \nwithout thrusters. It is stealthy. It also has the ability to engage \ntargets before it can be detected. It is highly equipped with advanced \nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tools.\n  As an instrument of air superiority, the F-22 Raptor is unmatched by \nany foreign competitor, including the much heralded MiG-29, the \nRussian-built MiG-29 flown by various militaries around the world.\n  I am going to point to this particular chart I have, which is rather \ndifficult to read even from where the Presiding Officer is, given it is \na map, obviously, of the world, and there are a series of color-coded \ndots on this map. Let me explain what the dots are, and then I will \nexplain what we are looking at in existing technologies in the fourth \ngeneration of development of aircraft technology and what is being done \non a fifth generation by nation states, particularly the Russians and \nthe Chinese.\n  The countries in red on this chart indicate those nations that \nalready operate or have ordered fourth generation fighters, and there \nare a number of countries around the world in that category. The yellow \ncoded areas are expected to order by the year 2010, these fourth \ngeneration fighters. You get an idea in the Middle East, some of the \nNorth African States, and some out in the Far East as well. The red \ndots themselves operate or have ordered advanced surface-to-air \nmissiles. Again, this is critical technology that has the capacity to \ntake out our aircraft. Then the yellow dots, the round dots, they are \nordering or are considering advanced surface-to-air missiles.\n  So we get some idea of what is occurring.\n  This over here: Air dominance is not guaranteed, is the point I \nwanted to make with this chart. According to the information on this \nmap sanctioned by the Air Force, there are Russian-made aircraft known \nas SU-27s, which have air-to-air capability, more of the dogfight kind \nof capability. Those planes are operated already by Algeria, Belarus, \nChina, Eritrea, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, \nMexico, Russia, the Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, and Vietnam. And \nthen there is the MiG-29, which is both an air-to-air and an air-to-\nground fighter. It is also a Russian-built aircraft, and is capable of \nchallenging our current fleet of F-15s and F-16s. The MiG-29 is \noperated by the militaries of Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, \nBelarus, Bulgaria, Cuba, Eritrea, Hungary, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, \nMalaysia, Myanmar, North Korea, Peru, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, \nSudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Yemen. Again, \nwidespread globally, that air-to-ground capability and air-to-air \ncapability.\n  Today, there is a fifth generation being developed that will be \nhighly competitive with the F-22 and the F-35. That fifth generation \nfighter is currently being developed by Russia and China to challenge \nthe F-22 and the F-35. So that gives us some sense of where we are \ntoday. These are very sophisticated aircraft operating today. The \nsurface-to-air missiles are very sophisticated and in countries today \nthat can take out, in fact, our existing technology in many areas.\n  Of course, the fifth generation is what we are talking about being \nready for the midpart of this century. Our air superiority has not gone \nunnoticed by others in many ways, as identified by this map. All the \ncountries in red, as I have pointed out, have an air capability \ncomparable to the MiG. That means they are all on a par with our \ncurrent aircraft technology; specifically, the F-15 and F-16 fighters \nknown as the fourth generation of jets.\n  So our F-15 and F-16 are very competent, very good, and they are on \nparity--they are not superior but on parity--with these aircraft.\n  To give my colleagues some idea of what I mean by the comparison of \ngenerations, an exercise was conducted in January 2007, in which the F-\n22 was matched up against the F-15 and F/A-18, to demonstrate how each \naircraft would fare in actual dogfights with one another. The F-22 in \ncomparative battles beat the F-15 and F/A-18, 144 to 0--144 to 0--to \ngive my colleagues an idea of how much more superior the F-22 can be in \ncommand of the airspace as opposed to what is comparable to the F-15 \ntoday. So the F-22 is a very important piece of technology when it \ncomes to regaining the superior capabilities that are absolutely \nessential.\n  According to the Air Force, what is more, this map shows that 30 \nnations are at parity with or exceeding the capabilities of the F-15 \nand F-16, and that puts our missions and the lives of our pilots at \nrisk. On top of that, Russia and China are currently both developing \ntheir own fifth generation of fighter to counter the F-22 and the F-35. \nThere are a dozen nations around the world, marked by these red dots, \nthat are today operating surface-to-air missile launchers capable of \nshooting down the F-15 Strike Eagles that the F-22 would replace.\n  The yellow dots indicate other countries considering the purchase of \nsuch weapons, and I pointed those out as well.\n  Our current fourth generation fighter jets are vulnerable to these \nthreats because they don't have the stealth technology found in the F-\n22. Regrettably, we witnessed this danger during Operation Desert Storm \nwhen 37 of our nonstealthy aircraft were shot down and 40 more were \ndamaged, and an early stealth fighter, the F-117, as well as the F-16, \nwere brought down during the 1999 Kosovo operations by rudimentary \nSerbian surface-to-air missiles. These are risks that we shouldn't have \nto take and don't have to take. These are risks we don't have to force \nupon our pilots. These are risks that are entirely preventable if we \narm ourselves with the next generation, and that is why the F-22 is so \ncritically important.\n  If this amendment is being offered to strike and eliminate the F-22, \nthen we cannot guarantee America's continuing air dominance. Our allies \nwill not always look like those we faced in Afghanistan in 2001 or Iraq \nin 2003, enemies whose air defenses were in tatters. We do not always \nchoose when and where our battles are going to be fought. We must be \nprepared and we must retain our competitive edge for the sake of our \nnational security and the lives, obviously, of our troops.\n  If the pending amendment is approved, our F-22 fleet will be limited \nto 187 aircraft. According to military officials, such a figure is \nsimply not enough to address the current capabilities of our military's \ncompetitors.\n  I have a letter dated June 9 of this year from GEN John Corley who is \ncurrently in charge of Air Combat Command for the Air Force. In this \nletter he reiterated his perception. I think my colleagues will \nunderstand as well that when we have a general serving in charge of air \ncombat and command missions for the Air Force who disagrees with the \nSecretary of Defense in a public way, we get some idea of the depth of \nfeeling that occurs with a matter like this.\n  Let me quote:\n\n       At Air Combat Command, we have held the need for 381 F-22s. \n     . . . In my opinion, a fleet of 187 F-22s puts execution of \n     our current national security strategy at high risk in the \n     near to mid term. To my knowledge, there are no studies that \n     demonstrate 187 F-22s are adequate to support our national \n     military strategy. Air Combat Command analysis, done in \n     concert with Headquarters Air Force, shows a moderate risk \n     force can be obtained with an F-22 fleet of approximately 250 \n     aircraft.\n\n  General Corley, responsible for the aircraft readiness of the U.S. \nAir Force, says we will incur moderate risk with even 250 aircraft, and \nthe command needs 381 aircraft to be fully capable. Yet we insist on \ngiving them only 187.\n  That is deeply troubling. I think we owe to it our troops to give \nthem what they need to protect our Nation as well.\n  Our security also depends on a robust manufacturing base, and the \nproposed amendment could be devastating to our critical aerospace \nindustrial capabilities.\n  If this amendment we are talking about passes, the F-22 assembly will \nhalt at 2011, and fighter jet production lines will run down until \n2014, when the F-35 manufacturing begins in earnest.\n  What does this mean for the aerospace industry in this Nation?\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\n  In Connecticut, we are blessed to have a large contingent of skilled \naerospace workers who keep our country safe and produce, of course, \nmagnificent engines. They are highly skilled engineers, machinists, and \ntechnicians and, on average, they are in their mid to late forties. \nThey may retire, obviously, they may pack up and relocate, they may \nleave the trade entirely; but they won't sit idle for 3 years. Our \nNation cannot afford to lose them.\n  That is represented by this area here on the chart. To lay these \npeople off and then to once again rehire them--in many cases, they will \nbe in their midfifties--is unrealistic. That synergy that is critically \nimportant is going to be lost.\n  The Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry recently \nrecommended ``that the Nation immediately reverse the decline in and \npromote the growth of a scientifically and technologically trained U.S. \naerospace workforce . . .'' adding that ``the breakdown of America's \nintellectual and industrial capacity is a threat to national security \nand our capability to continue as a world leader.''\n  The Commission also stated that resolving the crisis will require \ngovernment, industry, labor, and academia to work together to reverse \nthis trend.\n  I am afraid this amendment does the opposite of what we are being \nwarned to try to stop. According to the Aerospace Industry Association, \nthe industry faces impending retirements and a shortage of trained \ntechnical graduates, a situation already expected to worsen within the \ndecade.\n  Some companies address this issue by outsourcing work around the \nglobe. In aerospace and defense, however, security requirements dictate \nthat most design work on military systems must be done by U.S. \ncitizens. Thus, the need for U.S.-developed technical talent is \nparticularly acute if we want to ensure a world-class aerospace \nworkforce ready to lead in a global economy of the 21st century.\n  On this chart, this is the F-22 production, which ends in 2011, \nmarked by this point here. This is the F-35 production, which begins in \n2014. This gap represents hundreds of jobs at Pratt & Whitney--as many \nas 2,000 in Connecticut--and it represents tens of thousands of jobs \nacross the nation. You can take those numbers--and I cannot speak for \nother places around the Nation, but you end up with that kind of loss \nin an economy that our people are already struggling with. That is not \nthe only argument that I make, but we ought to keep people working on a \nnew defense system. The most important issue is our national security. \nYou ought to understand that even if you decide to ramp up F-35 \nproduction after 2014, because F-22 production will prematurely end \nunder this amendment, you will lose a workforce that is critical, and \nit gets harder and harder to reconstitute.\n  In fact, the Defense Department recognized this gap years ago. In the \n2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, published by the military to identify \nthe needs and strategy of our Armed Forces, they stated that F-22 \nproduction should be extended ``through fiscal year 2010 with a \nmultiyear acquisition contract, to ensure the Department does not have \na gap in fifth generation stealth capabilities.''\n  That is a direct quote from the Quadrennial Defense review report in \n2006.\n  The military identified in 2006, the most recent published report of \nthis type, that our Nation would suffer a loss in aerospace \nmanufacturing capabilities if fighter production doesn't have a \nseamless transition.\n  Yet, for some reason, we find ourselves in the very position the \nmilitary had, only 3 years ago, realized we should avoid.\n  In addition to our national security and the readiness of our \naerospace production industry, this amendment would have a negative \nimpact on jobs. Our unemployment rate is at 9.5 percent, and we \ncontinue to face the worst economic conditions in decades.\n  That is why the administration and this Congress have taken \nunprecedented steps to put Americans back to work. It is why the \ngovernment has stepped in to save critical manufacturing sectors, such \nas the domestic automobile industry.\n  This amendment suggests that the same government doesn't believe our \ntactical aircraft manufacturing sector warrants similar treatment.\n  In my State, where the impact of the Recovery Act is just beginning \nto be felt, the success of this amendment would be a devastating blow. \nI am determined to do everything I can to see that we can avoid it. I \ndon't want to see America's aerospace workers--among the finest workers \nin the world--remain under assault.\n  Allow me to introduce two such workers, Frank Lentini and Rocco \nMarone. They are workers at the Pratt & Whitney plant in Middletown, \nCT, which manufactures the engine for the F-22. They are both engine \ntest mechanics.\n  In this picture, the two of them are preparing an F-22 engine for \ntesting by attaching instrumentation used to collect data as the engine \ngoes through a series of computerized tests. The highly advanced nature \nof this engine requires countless hours of testing and retesting, \ninspection and reinspection, to ensure that when it is shipped to the \nassembly plant, it operates flawlessly.\n  These workers understand that a mistake on their part could cost the \nlives of our American forces. That is why it is so important that these \ngentlemen have years of experience to ensure that only the best quality \nengines are put on these aircraft.\n  These are the same workers who will build the F-35 Joint Strike \nFighter's engine--but only if the F-22 production is allowed to \ncontinue for the next 4 years.\n  Frank, the one in the blue shirt, has worked in the Middletown plant \nfor 31 years, starting on the assembly line, finally rising to his \ncurrent job on the test line for the plant's most advanced engine, the \nF-22. He is married, with two sons, ages 17 and 12, whom he hopes to \nsend off to college.\n  The prospect of cutting the F-22 production makes him worry every day \nabout his sons' futures, not only about whether he will be able to send \nthem to college but also whether there will be any jobs for the next \ngeneration of children in Connecticut's aerospace industry.\n  Rocco Marone--known as Rocky--has worked at the Pratt & Whitney \nengine facility in Middletown for 34 years. Like Frank, he is an engine \ntest mechanic. He trains and works with the younger mechanics and \nimparts his experience to them, both from his time on the assembly line \nand working in the test cell.\n  It is workers such as these two men at the Middletown plant in \nMiddletown CT--with a combined 65 years, taking that knowledge they \nhave acquired and building the finest engines in the world for the past \n80 years--the plant has. It is these seasoned workers who, by training \nthe next generation, will ensure that the trade secrets of engine \nbuilding are never lost. This amendment puts all of that at risk.\n  As I mentioned, if the F-22 is canceled in 2011 at 187 aircraft--the \nnumbers we are now talking about--then these two individuals and tens \nof thousands of others in our country will face very difficult odds. \nThese highly skilled, quality control experts will be left wondering \nwhat lies ahead for them and their families. Will they retain their \njobs? How many of their colleagues will be signing on to the \nunemployment rolls? What other opportunities exist for workers with \nsuch highly refined but specialized skill sets?\n\n  If we end the F-22 before 2014, we will all be wondering something as \nwell: When these gentlemen walk out the door, and take decades of \nexperience and skills with them, will we ever get them back again?\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment being offered by the \nchairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. I have \ntremendous respect for both these individuals, but I think it is \nimportant not just on a parochial basis--I couldn't stand here and ask \nmy colleagues merely to vote for this program because of jobs in my \nState. I also want them to understand what happens to people. This \nisn't just numbers we are talk about. There are lives, skill sets, and \nthere is a valuable resource at risk when we cast our votes on whether \nto continue this program and allow for that seamless transition that \nwill maintain the superiority and effectiveness necessary for our \naircraft in the 21st century.\n  On the chart I showed you of these nations around the world--others \nare not sitting idly by. They are developing surface-to-air missiles \nand the\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\nfifth generation of fighters to challenge us. We find ourselves in a \nsituation where we might be taking a backseat at a time when I think we \ncan least afford it. This is not inexpensive to do this. Senator \nChambliss provided an offset in committee for the cost of continuing \nthis program until 2014. That is an important consideration.\n  I respect the members of the committee who wrestle with these issues. \nI wished to share with my colleagues this information, and particularly \nwhat it means in a State such as mine that has an 80-year history of \nproducing these terrific engines, and workers such as the two \nindividuals I have introduced to you this evening, whose talents and \nabilities we will potentially lose as a result of this decision. It is \none of great importance to our country, to our national security, and \nto the people who provide the wonderful skill sets that give us these \nremarkable engines.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes and that Senator Thune be recognized \nimmediately thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise to affirm everything the Senator \nfrom Connecticut said. He made an articulate, detailed case for the F-\n22, in opposition to the amendment. I commend him.\n  I wish to add three thoughts, three good reasons, for the F-22 and \nnot to adopt the amendment: No. 1, when the U.S. Air Force wrote the \nRFP for the weapon system of the 21st century to replace three \nexisting, aging aircraft, the F-22 met and exceeded every single part \nof the RFP. No. 2, for those who say the cost is some $2,000 an hour \nmore for maintenance, you have to quantify that. Look what you are \nbuying. You are buying stealth technology that exists nowhere else in \nthe world and the ability to deliver munitions and leave without ever \nhaving been seen. Most recently, in Alaska, the F-22, in a mock battle, \ndestroyed 144 aircraft before it lost its first one.\n  Lastly, and most importantly, while it may not be the plane exactly \nfor Afghanistan and Iraq today, what about North Korea? What about \nIran? What about what happened to us in the Balkans in the late 1990s, \nwhen President Clinton deployed our air strength to put together what \nwas a terrible situation? We must be prepared for whatever will come in \nthe 21st century. If there is anything we have learned, you cannot \nunderestimate what may come. I commend the Senator for his articulate \nstatement and affirm everything he said in support of not adopting the \namendment and to continue to purchase the F-22 beyond the 187 currently \nbeing capped--or asked to be capped at. I commend the Senator for his \nremarks.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. That number of 144, I suspect people \nwon't believe that number, but that is a real number. Pilots don't \nalways necessarily comment on these matters. I am told by those who \nhave been interviewed, pilots who fly the F-22 use superlatives to \ndescribe that aircraft they have never used about any other aircraft, \nincluding the ability to reach the speed of Mach 1.5 in 90 seconds, the \nstealthy quality, the maneuverability, and the agility exceeds anything \nelse that exists anywhere else in the world.\n  There is a generation coming along in nations with whom we have \npretty good relationships, but we can never predict what is going to \nhappen. We have seen what happened with the SU-27 and the MiG 29, where \nthose are widely disseminated worldwide now. They pose a parity with \nthe aircraft we have. We need to have that superior quality.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank, first of all, my friend from South \nDakota for yielding to me for just a moment. He was to be next \nrecognized. This will take just a moment.\n  We have been attempting to work out a unanimous consent agreement so \nwe could first vote tomorrow. That was not convenient for a number of \nSenators. We then tried to work out a unanimous consent agreement for \nfirst thing on Wednesday morning to vote on the Levin-McCain amendment. \nWe have so far been unsuccessful in getting that agreement. We will \ncontinue to work tomorrow to see if we cannot get such an agreement. In \nthe meantime, that is where it stands.\n  Again, I thank my friend from South Dakota for yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7405-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I wish to pause for a second and tell \neverybody in the Senate that on the 1st day of August of this coming \nmonth, in Waynesboro, GA, there is going to be birthday party for a 96-\nyear-old lady, Emily Cox. She is not just another 96-year-old lady.\n  Emily Cox was the mother of Jackson Elliot Cox, my best friend in \ncollege. When he graduated from college, he left to join the U.S. \nMarine Corps, went through OCS, went to Vietnam, and he died on behalf \nof his country. Miss Emily was saddened, obviously, by the tragedy, as \nwas her husband Sidney.\n  When Alex Crumbley, myself, and Pierre Howard went to be at the wake \nand to wait for the body to return and to try to soothe Miss Emily, she \nsoothed us for the loss of our best friend. Since that day, Miss Emily \nCox has traveled our State on behalf of veterans, on behalf of the U.S. \nMarine Corps, and on behalf of our country. She is a living legend in \nGeorgia for her sweetness, for her strength, for her love of country, \nand for her sacrifice.\n\n  While I will not be able to be in Waynesboro, GA, on August 1 to \ncelebrate her 96th birthday, from the floor of the Senate, I send her \nmy greetings and my thanks. She has been a rock for me, a rock for her \ncommunity.\n  Miss Emily, we love you, and happy birthday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week we work on the Defense \nauthorization bill. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, that \nis something in which I have a keen interest. Many of the discussions \nyou heard already and we will hear throughout the course of the week \nwill deal fundamentally with our Nation's national security interests, \nmaking sure we continue to fund our troops at the appropriate level; \nmaking sure, in terms of pay and benefits, recruiting and retaining the \nfinest men and women in uniform in the world, that they have the very \nbest of technology to use when it comes to doing their jobs. You \nalready heard a discussion about some of those various technologies, \nplatforms--the F-22s and F-35s. I am very interested in the next \ngeneration of bombers and the importance of having long-range strike \ncapability so we are able to continue to penetrate some of the more \nsophisticated air defense systems that are being developed by our \nadversaries and potential adversaries around the world. It is a great \ndebate to have. It is one we have annually. I look forward to engaging \nin some of the discussions on these very important and critical \nnational security issues.\n  I wish to speak this evening to some of the things going on on the \ndomestic front. I always believe if we do not get national security \nright, the rest is conversation, which is why this Defense \nauthorization bill is so important. But when we do get past the Defense \nauthorization bill, I think we have a couple of big, epic battles that \nare going to be waged in the Senate coming up perhaps this month; if \nnot, I suggest certainly in the fall. One deals with a bill that passed \nthe House a little over a week ago now, the cap-and-trade legislation. \nThe other deals with the issue of health care reform, which is one-\nsixth of America's economy. We are\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\ntalking about an enormous amount of money that is spent in this country \nevery single year on health care.\n  There is legislation that is moving through the House, and there are \ndiscussions in the Senate. The markup has been going on several days \nnow in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the \nSenate to report out a health care reform bill that at some point will \ncome to the floor of the Senate and be debated. But these are huge \nissues of consequence for the American people.\n  I think the American people need to be engaged. What struck me about \nthe debate that was held in the House of Representatives a couple of \nweeks ago--which, incidentally, the cap-and-trade legislation passed in \nthe House of Representatives by a 219-to-212 margin. It was hurried \nthrough. It was done very quickly. It was a 1,200-some page bill. There \nwas a 309-page amendment that was offered on the floor. I submit that \nvery few, if any, Members of the House of Representatives had an \nopportunity to read the entire bill, let alone the amendment that was \noffered to it. It moved very quickly. And this has dramatic \nconsequences for the American economy.\n  When you start talking about a cap-and-trade bill that will impose \nessentially what is a tax on carbon that supposedly is directed at \npolluters but ultimately is going to be paid by consumers in this \ncountry, it is very clear that this is going to drive up the cost of \nenergy in this country, whether that is electricity, whether that is \nfuels, whether that is natural gas, home heating oil. All those things \nthe American people use every single day in their daily lives, they are \ngoing to see the costs go up. You can talk about how much, and we have \nlots of varying estimates about what it would cost. The CBO recently \ncame out with an estimate--and this was highly touted by proponents of \nthe legislation--that it was only going to cost each household $175 a \nyear. CBO also said that in the year 2020, the average cost on a per-\nhousehold basis would be considerably higher than that; that it would \nbe $890 per household in 2020, with the top quintile paying an average \nof $1,380.\n  After some generous assumptions about the enormous government-run \nwealth redistribution scheme that would be conducted via auction and \nthe free allowances, the CBO came back to this number of $175 per \nhousehold on average, with the middle quintile facing the highest net \ncost of $340. However, the figure is only the budgetary cost per \nhousehold, not a comprehensive economic analysis, and moreover it \nexamines only 1 year of the program, a year that CBO optimistically \nassumes is relatively low cost and after the expensive transition \nyears. As a result, CBO's estimate really only captures some of the \ncost of cap and trade, as the report acknowledges. But even at that, \nthe CBO average estimate gross cost by 2020 is $890 additional per \nhousehold per year in energy costs and with the top quintile paying an \naverage of $1,380.\n  What is interesting about that is that study did not take into \nconsideration different regions of the country or different demographic \ngroups, different sectors of the economy, different income brackets. \nAll of those are issues that have not been contemplated fully to date \nand what some of these impacts would make.\n  I suggest there are going to be significant regional disparities \nbecause there are going to be certain areas of the country that are \ngoing to pay much more in additional power costs than other parts of \nthe country. I think the transition is going to be particularly \ndifficult for those areas of the country that are employed in industry, \nsuch as coal, or living in areas that produce coal or rely heavily on \ncoal-fired power for their electricity generation, and the costs are \ngoing to be borne much more significantly by those areas of the \ncountry. So the regional differences are going to be especially \ndramatic when it comes to the electricity sector of the economy. I \nsuggest places such as my home area of South Dakota and the upper \nMidwest are going to disproportionately pay way more of this burden \nthan are other parts of the country.\n  A lot of this data, a lot of this information has yet to make it out \ninto the hands of the American people. When the American people find \nout what is actually happening here in Washington with this cap-and-\ntrade proposal, they get very exercised about it, as I think most \nMembers of Congress found out during the Fourth of July holidays. They \nwent out and traveled across their respective States. They heard, I \nsuspect, what I did--that people are very upset about the notion that \nwe are going to see energy costs go up significantly and they are going \nto be paying the bill. They have not, I don't think, determined at this \npoint that there is any benefit they are going to derive from it.\n  The argument is going to be made by proponents of the legislation \nthat this is going to be a good thing because we are going to see \nsignificant reductions in CO2 emissions and therefore that \nis good for the global climate. Frankly, as we heard last week at the \nG-8 meeting, there are other countries around the world that do not \nhave a real concern about doing anything quickly, and they have no \nintention of following the lead of the United States in that regard. As \na consequence, we are not going to see anywhere close to the reductions \nthat have been promised. So we have what is pretty clearly a minimal \nenvironmental benefit as a result of a gargantuan cost increase--tax, \nif you will--on the American economy in the form of higher energy \ncosts.\n  I submit that the cap-and-trade legislation is going to have a \nprofound impact on the economy, and it is something that should not be \nhurried through. I hope the Senate, if and when it comes to the floor--\nfrankly, I hope it doesn't because I don't think right now this is an \nissue that ought to be occupying the time of the Senate when we are \ntrying to get the economy growing again. We are talking about with this \ncap-and-trade legislation actually putting a new tax on the American \neconomy at a time when we ought to be trying to get small businesses \ninvested again, reducing the overall tax and regulatory burden they \nface, and trying to create jobs and expand the economy, rather than \nputting a new crushing mandate, top-down, heavy-handed bureaucratic \nmandate, cap-and-trade program on top of an economy that is already \nstruggling and, as we saw last week, unemployment rates now topping 9.5 \npercent, perhaps going higher before it is all said and done.\n\n  What is interesting to me is there does not seem to be any debate \nthat this is going to raise energy costs. When people get into this \nargument, it is not a question of if, it is a question of how much.\n  There are even some on the House side--Representative John Dingell, \nfor many years the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in the \nHouse of Representatives, said:\n\n       Cap and trade is a tax and it's a great big one.\n\n  Representative Charlie Rangel said:\n\n       Whether you call it a tax, every one agrees that it is \n     going to increase the cost to the consumer.\n\n  I could go on and on. Secretary Geithner. The President himself, when \nhe talked about this particular idea, indicated that costs would \nnecessarily skyrocket. So there is no question but this is going to \nincrease costs to the American consumer. At a time when we can least \nafford it and at a time when we are trying to get our economy on a \npathway of recovery, we ought to be lessening the burden on Americans, \nnot increasing it.\n  There is a better way. If we look at some of the alternatives that \nare out there, to me it makes more sense if you can incentivize a \ncertain type of investment as opposed to trying to mandate some \nregulatory regime. That is a much better way of doing business.\n  If we want to do something legislatively when it comes to lowering \nthe cost of energy in this country, we ought to focus on reducing \nemissions by lowering the cost of renewables, by aggressively investing \nin research and supporting an increased role for types of power that \nhave not been used in this country. We are way underutilizing nuclear \npower. France gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. In \nthe United States, we are about 20 percent. We can do better than that. \nThere is no reason the United States cannot be a leader when it comes \nto clean green energy. One of the things we need to do is build more \nnuclear plants. That is one of the items on our agenda that we would \nlike to see as part of an energy bill.\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\n  I also think there are things we can do in investing in non-carbon-\nemitting types of technology. I come from a part of the country where \nwe have vast amounts of wind. Some people argue South Dakota is the \nSaudi Arabia of wind. If we can figure out a way to harness that wind \nenergy, I think we are going to see an increase in economic activity in \nthe upper Midwest. South Dakota would be a great place for that. I hope \nwe can see more investment in wind. We need to make sure we are \nproviding the necessary and appropriate incentives and policy \nincentives for investment in wind energy.\n  Solar is something, obviously, where we have a lot of room to grow. \nConservation, carbon storage, infusion--all kinds of technologies that \nare carbon-free sources of energy. But I believe the way we get more of \nthose is to incentivize investments in those areas. It seems to me that \nwould be a much preferable outcome and, frankly, one in which we could \nget our global partners a lot more interested in and participating in. \nIn fact, it has been suggested--Bjorn Lomborg suggested countries \naround the world devote a portion of their GDP to these types of non-\ncarbon-emitting energy technologies in research and investing in those \nso that the burdens are shared equally. I would suggest every country \nmight do it a little differently.\n\n  If I were going to put a plan together like that for South Dakota, I \nwould make it very wind heavy. Other parts of the country might make it \nnuclear heavy. There are clean green renewable sources of energy \navailable in this country, but trying to impose a heavy tax that will \nbe paid by the American consumer ultimately, to me, seems like a \nwrongheaded approach, especially at a time when the economy is \nstruggling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7407-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7407-S7408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I think that sort of segues into the other big issue, the \nbig epic battles we are going to face in the Congress, and that is what \nto do to reform our health care system so that we can make the cost \nmore affordable for American families and consumers. I don't think \nanybody argues that we don't need to reform our health care system; \nthat there aren't things we can do better, more efficiently, more cost \neffectively.\n  I certainly would not for a minute suggest--as some have suggested \nabout Republicans--that Republicans in the Senate don't want to do \nanything. We all believe we need to do something. We all believe there \nis much that can be done that will help improve coverage and lower \ncosts for people in this country. But it can be done in a way that \ndoesn't turn everything over--the keys of the health care system--to \nthe Federal Government.\n  Much of what we are seeing right now in terms of the plans that are \nmoving through the Congress is that the House of Representatives will \npass a bill, perhaps first, which will come over to the Senate. What is \nbeing debated--at least at the committee level in the Senate--consists \nof what they call a public plan option which, in effect, is a \ngovernment plan. It is a--I would characterize it--government takeover \nof the health care system in this country because when the government \ngoes into competition with the private sector, I think it will be very \ndifficult for the private sector to compete.\n  There are many, obviously, already competing plans out there. In \nfact, George Will noted there are 1,300 entities offering health care \nplans in this country. Another one isn't going to change that. But the \nlarger problem we have when the Federal Government gets into \ncompetition with private business is that the Federal Government \nbecomes not a competitor but a predator. I think the government plan is \nnot going to compete with the private market, but rather it will \ndestroy the private market. A lot of studies bear that out.\n  If you look at the independent estimates--and in fact the Lewin Group \nstudied this very carefully--they suggest that nearly 6 out of 10 \nAmericans with private coverage, or about 118 million Americans, would \nlose their current health care coverage and be forced into a \ngovernment-run health care plan. In fact, John Shields of the Lewin \nGroup said:\n\n       If we created this public plan which is priced so much \n     lower than private insurance, that will draw a lot of people \n     in. Then you will wake up one morning and say: Wow, there is \n     only one payer.\n\n  Essentially, what would happen, Mr. President, in my view, is we \nwould see the private companies that are offering insurance, or small \nbusinesses that are offering coverage to their employees who would say: \nI can't compete with the Federal Government. I am just going to have \nall my employees move over into the government-run program. So that \nessentially, by default, we would see this government takeover of our \nhealth care system, and the government plan would become the plan in \nthe country. Eventually, over time, I would argue, it would evolve into \na single-payer system.\n  We are talking about one-sixth of the American economy. Certainly \nthere are shortcomings in our current way of doing things. When we \nspend 17 percent or one-sixth of our entire GDP on health care, the \nassumption is that we are not spending enough money on health care. It \nis probably that we are not spending it wisely enough or not spending \nit smarter. We have lots of ideas about how to spend smarter that don't \ninvolve putting another $1 trillion or $2 trillion in tax burden on \nAmericans in order to pay for this new system or, perhaps even worse \nyet, borrowing it from future generations, which is what we have been \ndoing routinely around here for the past several months to fund many of \nthese new initiatives. But those are both bad solutions.\n  A $1 trillion tax or upwards of that, depending on which estimate we \nlook at, up to $2 trillion in additional cost for the plan that is \nbeing proposed by Democrats in the House and the Senate--we have to \nfinance it somehow. It is going to be paid for. It is either going to \nbe paid for in the form of higher taxes on the American economy or \nborrowing from future generations, neither of which, in my view, is an \noption we ought to pursue.\n  On the other hand, we ought to look at how we can make the current \nsystem--the 17 percent of our economy or the $2.5 trillion we spend \nannually on health care--more efficient and more effective. How can we \nemphasize wellness? How can we emphasize prevention? How can we allow \nindividuals and small businesses to join larger groups to get the \nbenefit of group purchasing power and buying in volume? How can we \ncreate competition by allowing people to buy across State lines? How do \nwe get the cost of defensive medicine down by reforming our medical \nmalpractice laws so the doctors aren't in fear of being sued or in fear \nof liability, overutilizing and therefore practicing defensive \nmedicine, which has been suggested by the Health and Human Services \nDepartment in a study they did in 2003.\n  If we put it in today's dollars, it suggests we could save about $180 \nbillion a year in health care costs by doing something about medical \nmalpractice reform.\n  So these are all things that we are for. We have lots of ideas about \nhow to improve health care in this country or improve at least the \ndelivery of health care and drive down the cost of health care but do \nit in a way that doesn't impede upon that important relationship \nbetween a physician and a patient; in a way that prevents the \ngovernment from imposing itself into that situation and the government \nthen making a decision about which procedures are going to be covered, \nhow much is going to be paid for each procedure, and essentially \nbecoming the decider when it comes to health care in this country.\n  We think the decisions that are made with respect to people's health \ncare ought to be made by patients, by providers, and not having the \ngovernment dictating and getting in the way of that basic fundamental \nrelationship.\n  The CBO has said about the Kennedy-Dodd bill, which is the only one \nwe know of right now that is moving its way through the committee \nprocess and that is currently being marked up, the government plan was \nnot projected to have premiums lower than those charged by private \ninsurance plans. But how, then, is the government going to offer any \nbenefit?\n  The government plan is going to be, in my view, redundant to what is \nalready out there unless it comes in and tries to undercut private \ninsurance,\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\nwhich would put private insurance options out of business and force, as \nI said before, many small businesses offering coverage to push those \nemployees into the government-run program.\n  So, Mr. President, these are both, just as I said before, in terms of \nsize, scope, scale, and magnitude, enormous issues in terms of our \ndomestic economy, and we shouldn't be hurrying these issues through. \nThere is some suggestion that the health care bill, as it comes over \nfrom the House, might be returned to the floor of the Senate, put on \nthe floor under rule XIV, and an attempt made to get it passed before \nthe August recess. That is not the way to conduct the business of the \nSenate. That is not the way to deal with one-sixth of the American \neconomy. It is not the way, certainly, to deal with something as \ncomplex as the American health care system.\n  To allow the government takeover of that system, it seems to me, is \nsomething most Americans, if they were aware was happening, would not \nbe for. I think the survey numbers bear that out. I think, as is true \nwith cap and trade, the more the American people are engaged in this \ndebate, the more they hear about it, the more objections they are going \nto have to the government takeover of health care in this country.\n  So these are both issues which need to be done thoughtfully and \ncarefully and, frankly, they shouldn't be rushed out of here. We \nshouldn't be trying to pass health care out of the Senate before the \nAugust break. We shouldn't be talking about doing cap and trade--\nalthough I think that is now being pushed back into the fall.\n  These both have huge impacts on America's economy and get at the \nheart of the issue of how we are going to retain and create new jobs \nand expand our economy. These are very consequential issues and \nshouldn't be rushed. So I hope the Senate will take its time. I hope it \nwill allow for full debate and that we will have an opportunity to put \nsome of our ideas out there, some of the alternatives we think, in \nfact, would improve health care in this country and make it more \naffordable for more Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7408-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GROWTH ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to urge my \ncolleagues to join me in addressing challenges facing women in the \ndeveloping world. Senator Hutchison and I introduced the GROWTH Act to \nfocus U.S. developmental assistance and strengthen the role of women in \ndeveloping countries.\n  Families, particularly in the developing world, would not survive \nwere it not for the critical contributions of women. Rural women \nproduce 50 percent of the world's total food, 60-80 percent of the food \nin the developing world, and most of the staples, such as rice, wheat, \nand maize, that provide up to 90 percent of the rural poor's food \nintake.\n  Yet these women often bear the brunt of economic, legal, and social \ninequality.\n  For example, because of the inequality in inheritance laws or the \nlack of enforcement of such laws, women are often dispossessed of their \nproperty when their husbands die. In fact, even though they \noverwhelmingly tend the fields and produce the food that keep their \nfamilies alive, women in the developing world own less than 15 percent \nof land and in many African countries less than 1 percent.\n  Economic, legal, and social inequalities have had a measureable \nimpact on the ability of women in the developing world to earn an \nadequate living and support their families. The statistics are \nsobering--women make up 60 percent of the world's working poor, 70 \npercent of the hungry, and 67 percent of the illiterate.\n  Thus, improving the economic conditions of women is key to improving \neconomic conditions in the developing world. Even more importantly, \nimproving the economic conditions of women is key to the future of the \nchildren in these countries.\n  Study after study shows that women in developing countries are more \nlikely to use their income for food, health care and education for \ntheir children. As a result, greater economic opportunities for women \nmeans that their babies are more likely to survive infancy, their \nchildren, especially their daughters, are more likely to attend school, \nand their families are more likely to eat nutritious meals.\n  One way to improve economic opportunity is to expand women's access \nto microcredit programs. Microcredit is an economically viable model of \nextending very small loans, at competitive interest rates, to the very \npoor. These loans allow the recipients, who are overwhelmingly women, \nto open or expand businesses and often allow them to lift their family \nout of poverty.\n  When you talk about microcredit, you must talk about Dr. Muhammad \nYunus. Dr. Yunus is the recognized developer of the microcredit model. \nIn 1976, he launched what has become a global movement to create \neconomic and social development from below with a loan of just $27 from \nhis own pockets to 42 crafts persons in a small village in Bangladesh. \nToday, the Grameen Bank, which he founded to carry out his work, \noperates in more than 84,000 villages and has provided more than $8 \nbillion in low-interest loans to nearly 8 million people.\n  Over the past 30 years, his microcredit model has changed millions of \nlives, directly and indirectly positively affecting the lives of as \nmany as 155 million people.\n  In 2006, Dr. Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace prize for developing \nthis microcredit model.\n  The award of the Noble Peace Prize to Dr. Yunus recognized that \nlasting peace and prosperity cannot be achieved unless large numbers of \nthe world's poor have the means to break out of poverty.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Bennett and I offered the Dr. Muhammad \nYunus Gold Medal Act, S. 864, to honor Dr. Yunus's efforts. I thank my \n59 colleagues who have already agreed to cosponsor S. 864 and urge the \nrest of my colleagues to do the same.\n  Today I also urge my colleagues to support S. 1425, the Global \nResources and Opportunities for Women to Thrive, or GROWTH, Act of \n2009. Senator Hutchison and I offered the GROWTH Act on July 9 to \nexpand on Dr. Yunus's microcredit model and focus U.S. developmental \nassistance on tackling many of the obstacles to economic empowerment of \nwomen in the developing world.\n  The GROWTH Act would not only empower women by giving them the \nfinancial tools to start and grow their own businesses, it would create \nbroader opportunities through educational, legal, and community \nbuilding programs.\n  The GROWTH Act is comprehensive legislation that, among other \nefforts, increases women's ability to start and develop businesses \nthrough enhanced microfinance, microenterprise loans, and related \nfinancial tools. It also supports various efforts to enhance women's \nland and property rights, and increases women's employment \nopportunities and improves working conditions for women through \neducation, skills training, and advocacy programs.\n  The GROWTH Act is an important step forward in attacking the \nunderlying economic inequalities in the developing world that hold \nwomen back from their full potential.\n  I thank Senator Hutchison for again joining me in offering the GROWTH \nAct, as well as Senators Collins, Landrieu, Shaheen, Gillibrand, \nSanders, Casey, Whitehouse, and Johnson for joining the effort as \ncosponsors. I urge the rest of my colleagues to empower women in the \ndeveloping world by supporting S. 1425.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7408-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7408-S7410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n               MATTHEW SHEPARD HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to join in supporting the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act.\n  We need to pass this bill without further delay. The House passed a \nhate crimes bill with a vote of 249 to 175 in April. President Obama \nhas repeatedly stated that he supports swift enactment of hate crimes \nlegislation. The Department of Justice has expressed a need to \nstrengthen our Federal hate crimes law. And, over 300 law enforcement, \nreligious, civil rights, and community organizations have stated their\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\nsupport for this act. We need to make certain that every American is \nprotected from hate crimes. No one should be a victim of violence \nbecause of who they are.\n  In fact, hate crimes are domestic terrorism. Like all terrorist acts, \nthey seek to bring fear to whole communities through violence on a few. \nWe have committed ourselves to protecting our country from terrorists \nthat strike from abroad, so we must make the same commitment to \nprotecting Americans from homegrown terrorism.\n  Only weeks ago, a small distance from this Capitol, James von Brunn, \na formerly convicted criminal and a known anti-Semite, entered the DC \nHolocaust Memorial Museum and began firing a rifle. During the attack, \nvon Brunn shot and killed security guard Stephen Johns. As tragic as \nthis incident was, the heroism of Stephen Johns, and the heroism of \nother members of the museum's security team, prevented von Brunn from \nconducting a violent massacre of innocent men, women, and children. Von \nBrunn planned a hate crime, an act of domestic terrorism. Our society \nrecognizes that such a crime cannot be tolerated. Attacks like these \nsend shockwaves through American communities and must be prosecuted as \nterrorizing crimes.\n  The original hate crime statute, enacted in 1968, criminalized \nviolent acts based on a victim's race, color, religion, or national \norigin. Over the past 40 years, we have learned from experience that \nhate crime perpetrators often target communities unprotected by the \noriginal statute. This amendment strengthens that statute to protect \nvictims targeted with violence because of their gender, their sexual \norientation, their gender identity, or their disability.\n  In Boston on August 24, 2008, Jonathan Howard and three friends were \nviciously attacked by four men while walking home from a Boston \nnightclub. The assault began when a Honda pulled up beside the victims. \nThe four men in the vehicle began yelling obscenities and homophobic \nslurs at the group. The perpetrators told Howard to die and repeatedly \nkicked his head into the pavement. After the event, Howard stated that \n``the type of assault that we encountered was completely random, \nunprovoked, and unforgivable.'' This type of attack was just as much a \nhate crime as the attack by James von Brunn, and it needs to be \nrecognized as a Federal hate crime.\n  The victims did nothing to provoke their attack. They did not deserve \nto be the subjects of violence. No member of the LGBT community should \nbe terrified to walk down the street for fear of hateful violence. Hate \ncrimes perpetrators must not be allowed to place our communities in \nfear.\n  On May 11, the Boston Globe reported that the historic election of \nPresident Barack Obama spurred a wave of hate crime violence. The \narticle cites a study by the Southern Poverty Law Center that shows the \nnumber of White extremist groups in the United States has increased by \nnearly 50 percent since 2000, and that White extremist activity has \nsharply increased over the past several months.\n  Last November 5, following the election of President Barack Obama, \nfour men rampaged across Staten Island, assaulting African Americans in \nresponse to President Obama's victory. The attackers beat a 17-year-old \nboy with a pipe. They physically assaulted another man to the ground, \nverbally harassed individuals suspected of voting for President Obama, \nand slammed into a man with a car because they mistakenly believed he \nwas African American. None of these victims were known to their \nattackers. None of these victims could have prevented the attacks. The \nvictims were terrorized because their attackers wanted to send a \nviolent message of hate to the African American community.\n  Last July 12, in Shenandoah, PA, Luis Ramirez, a 25-year-old Mexican \nand father of two, was beaten by several drunken students from the \nlocal high school. Authorities said the teenagers yelled ethnic slurs \nas they punched and kicked Mr. Ramirez, causing him to lose \nconsciousness and begin to foam at the mouth. As a result of the \nattack, Mr. Ramirez died 2 days later. During the attack, one of the \nassailants reportedly yelled, ``tell your . . . Mexican friends to get \n. . . out of Shenandoah . . . .'' According to Pennsylvania Governor \nRendell, ``Luis Ramirez was targeted, beaten, and killed because he was \nMexican.'' Yet after a jury trial in State court, the killers were \nacquitted of the most serious charges and convicted of simple assault--\nyes, simple assault.\n  As the result of this case, the Justice Department is currently \ninvestigating civil rights violations with one hand tied behind their \nback. Because the incident occurred while the victim was walking by a \npark, and because walking by a park may not be considered a ``federally \nprotected activity,'' the Justice Department is not able to fully \ninvestigate and prosecute this crime. This legislation closes the \nflagrant loophole that prevents prosecution of a hate crime when a \nvictim is not engaged in a federally protected activity. It provides \nthat hate crime perpetrators may be prosecuted, regardless of where \ntheir victim was or what they were doing when he or she was attacked.\n  In addition, this bill authorizes the Justice Department to make \ngrants to State, local, and tribal authorities to combat, investigate, \nand prosecute hate crimes more effectively. During these times of \neconomic crisis, State and local authorities are cash-strapped to deal \nwith costly hate crime incidents. Investigations tend to be expensive. \nThey require considerable law enforcement effort and extensive use of \ngrand juries. To ease the extraordinary costs and complexity of such \ncases, the bill authorizes $5 million in Justice Department grants to \nState, local, and tribal law enforcement officials who have incurred \nextraordinary expenses associated with investigating and prosecuting \nhate crimes.\n  The legislation also authorizes the Justice Department to make grants \nfor State, local, and tribal programs that combat hate crimes committed \nby juveniles, including programs to train local law enforcement \nofficers in identifying, investigating, prosecuting, and preventing \nhate crimes. With hate crimes against Latinos on the rise, and hate \ncrimes against LGBT individuals on the rise, and hate group activity on \nthe rise, we must ensure that our State and local law enforcement \nauthorities have all the tools and resources they need to combat, \ninvestigate, and prosecute hate crimes.\n  I am proud to take this opportunity to recognize the work of the \nBoston Police Department as the only major police department to \nincorporate hate crimes training into its mandatory training program. \nUnfortunately, many police departments around the country do not have \nthe resources necessary to provide such training. This bill \nspecifically authorizes the Justice Department to allocate funds for \ntraining so that other police departments may follow the example set by \nthe Boston PD.\n  Violent attacks based on race, color, religion, national origin, \ngender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability deserve to \nbe criminalized by Federal law. Our Nation must show that it will not \npermit these communities to be terrorized--one victim at a time.\n  For the past 10 years, the Senate and the House of Representatives \nhave each passed this legislation on multiple occasions--only to face \npolitical setbacks that have prevented the measure from being enacted. \nNow, we must finish the job and send this legislation to the President \nfor his signature. By doing so, Congress will be reflecting the will of \nthe American people. We will be sending a strong message that hate \ncrime violence will not be tolerated--and that every citizen deserves \nFederal protection against such crimes.\n  Religious leaders across the country support the amendment. As my \ncolleagues know, the Golden Rule is recognized as one of the deepest \nprinciples in virtually every religious tradition. It is the simple \nprinciple that we ought to treat others as we ourselves would like to \nbe treated. In the book of Matthew, chapter 7, Jesus says, ``So \nwhatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for \nthis is the Law and the Prophets.'' This amendment embodies the Golden \nRule by extending protection to individuals in communities that are \nvulnerable to violence fueled by hatred.\n  Religious leader, Pastor Joel C. Hunter, has said, ``I would think \nthat\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\nthe followers of Jesus would be first in line to protect any group from \nhate crimes . . . This bill protects both the rights of conservative \nreligious people to voice passionately their interpretations of their \nscriptures and protects their fellow citizens from physical attack.''\n  Many religious groups have expressed their support for the bill, \nincluding the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of \nAmerica, the Interfaith Alliance, the Presbyterian Church, the United \nSynagogue of Conservative Judaism, the United Methodist Church, and the \nCongress of National Black Churches.\n  Over 10 years have passed since the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act was first introduced in the Senate. Over 10 years have \npassed since Matthew Shepard was robbed, pistol whipped, tortured, tied \nto a fence, and left to die because he was gay. I commend Matthew's \nmother, Judy Shepard, for her years of inspiring advocacy that have \nbrought us to this moment. Now is the time for the Senate to vote and \nshow that we will not allow domestic terrorism to tear apart the fabric \nof our Nation and take the lives of innocent Americans. I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to follow their hearts and minds and vote in \nfavor of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7410-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY SUBCOMMITTEES\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize a very special member of my staff who has recently been \nconfirmed by the Senate to take on a critical role in the Obama \nadministration.\n  Peter Rogoff has served on the Appropriations Committee staff for the \nlast 22 years and he has been the committee's senior transportation \nadviser for the majority of those years. For the past 9 years, as I \nhave served as either chairman or ranking member of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to work closely \nwith Peter.\n  Peter has been a trusted adviser to me and a dedicated public servant \nto the constituents of both my home State of Washington and the \nconstituents of every member of the subcommittee. I know that Peter's \ndrive, knowledge, and experience will be an outstanding asset to \nPresident Obama and Transportation Secretary LaHood's team.\n  Peter and I have worked together through many challenges over the \nyears, none greater than the events of September 11 and the \ntransportation security issues that we were confronted with after. \nPeter's efforts weren't just limited to aviation security but also \nincluded initiatives to strengthen security in passenger rail, transit \nsystems, our ports and all the systems that connect them. During those \ndifficult times, Peter's understanding of our transportation safety \nsystems was fully evident.\n  It is a knowledge that comes with experience. And not just the kind \nof experience you gain from studying policy at your desk, although I \ncan attest that Peter has done a lot of that. It is the kind of \nexperience you get from traveling out to accident sites, talking with \ninspectors, meeting with families, and working hands-on to ensure that \nwe are taking steps to ensure that accidents are not repeated.\n  In the time that I have worked with Peter, he has regularly traveled \nacross the country to participate in aviation, rail and ship \ninspections, and he has voluntarily gone to many accident sites. The \nexpertise gained from these experiences has served this Congress and \nour country well in some very critical situations.\n  In fact, I still remember clearly the evening 2 years ago when we all \nwatched in horror as the 1-35 bridge collapsed in Minneapolis. \nImmediately after that tragedy, I dispatched Peter to accompany Senator \nKlobuchar to the scene, because I knew that he could help her identify \nthe core issues and how the Federal Government could help.\n  Now I know that as FTA Administrator, Peter will face a set of wide-\nranging challenges. But I also know that he has the transit know-how to \nhit the ground running. Peter will bring over two decades of working \nknowledge on financing, building, and safeguarding our country's \ntransit systems.\n  I thank Peter for the guidance, enthusiasm, and expertise he has \nshown in the years he has led my efforts on addressing our country's \ntransportation, housing and urban development needs. I also wish him \nluck as he takes on this tremendous responsibility and opportunity.\n  While his departure represents a big loss for our Appropriations \nCommittee and my appropriations subcommittee, I respect and commend \nPresident Obama's decision to put Peter's expertise to work on \naddressing our country's transit future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7410-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7410-S7411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMENDING CAPTAIN B. HARL ROMINE JR.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators \nSnowe, Ensign, DeMint, Thune, Wicker, Isakson, Vitter, Brownback, \nMartinez, and Johanns, we would like to thank Captain Harl Romine for \nhis service to the Nation and the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  Captain Romine has a long and distinguished career with the Coast \nGuard. From his enrollment in the U.S. Coast Guard Academy though his \nretirement later this month, Captain Romine has spent the better part \nof the last three decades serving his countrymen and protecting our \nNation in the U.S. Coast Guard. During his service in the Coast Guard \nCaptain Romine has exhibited the best characteristics of a Coast Guard \nofficer: a deep dedication to duty, unsurpassed professionalism,\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\nsuperior technical and operational expertise, and compassion as a \npilot, leader, mentor, and friend.\n  Captain Romine has a distinguished career that is worthy of \nrecognition by this Senate. Harl Romine--the son of a career Coast \nGuard officer--attended high school in Chantilly, VA, and graduated \nfrom the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in 1985 with a bachelor of science \ndegree in government. Immediately following graduation he joined the \nfleet and served as a deck watch officer, law enforcement boarding \nofficer, and weapons officer aboard the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter \nCHEROKEE. Upon completing his tour on the CHEROKEE, Captain Romine \nattended Navy Flight School to begin his career as a Coast Guard \naviator a role in which he would truly distinguish himself. Upon \nreceiving his ``wings of gold'' at flight school in Pensacola, Captain \nRomine began a career of service that would take him from the warm \nwaters of the Gulf of Mexico to frigid seas of the Gulf of Alaska.\n  His first aviation assignment was to the Coast Guard's largest and \nbusiest air station--Air Station Clearwater, FL, where he served as a \nduty standing pilot in the HH-3F ``Pelican'' helicopter performing a \nwide range of missions in the Atlantic and Caribbean regions, including \nSearch and Rescue and drug enforcement operations.\n  In 1991 he was assigned to Air Station Kodiak where he continued to \nfly the HH-3F and then transitioned to the HH-60J ``Jayhawk.'' Four \nyears later, he was transferred to Coast Guard Group Astoria, OR, where \nhe served as the administration officer, supervising the administrative \nand personnel support for over 300 Coast Guard personnel.\n  In 1998, Captain Romine was assigned as the HH-60J standardization \nbranch chief at the Coast Guard's Aviation Training Center in Mobile, \nAL. The young pilots trained under the tutelage of Captain Romine were \na large part of the impressive Coast Guard Team that performed so \nheroically in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  In 2001, Captain Romine qualified in the HC-130H ``Hercules'' and \nreturned to Kodiak, AK, where he served as the operations officer for \nCoast Guard Air Station Kodiak. During this tour he maintained a \nqualification in both the HH-60J ``Jayhawk'' and the HC-130 \n``Hercules'' airframes and has the unique distinction of standing duty \nin both airframes during the same week and successfully executing a \nsearch and rescue case in both airframes during that week.\n  In 2004, Captain Romine received the ultimate honor and demonstration \nof the Coast Guard's trust in his abilities, when he received orders to \nserve as the commanding officer of Coast Guard Air Station Sitka, AK.\n  At the heart of his career of distinguished service is commitment to \nrescuing those in distress. Over his career Captain Romine has \npersonally flown, coordinated or supervised over 800 search and rescue \ncases resulting in over 600 lives saved. When Americans watch with \npride as an orange helicopter plucks shipwrecked mariners from an icy \nsea or pulls stranded men and women off of roof tops in a flooded city, \nthey should all know that it is men and women like Harl Romine who are \npiloting the aircraft risking their lives to save someone else's.\n  Captain Romine's service has not gone unrecognized by his commanders. \nFor his distinguished and heroic service, he has been awarded the \nMeritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal, four Coast Guard Commendation \nMedals and three Coast Guard Achievement Medals.\n  Finally, for the last 3 years, Captain Romine has distinguished \nhimself while serving as a Coast Guard fellow on the Senate Commerce \nCommittee's Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard Subcommittee. \nWith the same technical expertise and devotion to duty demonstrated \nthroughout his career as an aviator, Captain Romine earned the respect \nof all who have worked with him and has been an invaluable member of \nthe Commerce Committee staff and will be sorely missed.\n  On July 17, Captain Romine will be retiring from the Coast Guard and \nwill be bringing his impressive and distinguished career in the Coast \nGuard to an end. We would be remiss if we did not thank his family for \n``loaning'' Harl to the Coast Guard for so many years. Life in the \nCoast Guard places great stress on families as well as servicemen. We \nwant to thank Harl's wife Laura, and his sons Hank, Carson, and Sonny \nfor all the sacrifices they have made.\n  Throughout his service to our Nation, whether standing the watch, \nteaching the next generation of pilots who now stand the watch, or \ncommanding those who protected our Nation's mariners, Captain Romine \nhas upheld the highest traditions of the Coast Guard. We would like to \ntake this opportunity to personally commend Captain Romine for his \nservice to our Nation, the Coast Guard and the Senate and thank him for \nall he has done in service to his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7411-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               REMEMBERING MAJOR GENERAL ROGER W.

I would like to express my condolences to Major General \nGilbert's family, in particular his wife of 58 years, Ruthie, his two \ndaughters Carol and Marilee, his three granddaughters Brooke, Britni, \nand Allison, and his sister Beverly. They are in my thoughts and \nprayers.\n  Major General Gilbert led an honorable and extensive career which \nbegan upon his enlistment in the Army Air Corps in 1943 while he was a \nstudent at Drake University. After his pilot training, he courageously \ntook two combat tours in Europe during World War II. He flew 50 \nmissions in B-17s and Mosquitoes and upon his accomplishment he was \nawarded with the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with five \nclusters and five battle stars.\n  In 1946, he joined the Air National Guard and flew another 50 combat \nmissions in B-26 bombers during the Korean war. He then became squadron \nand later on wing commander of the Air Guard units and accumulated \n7,200 hours of pilot time, 4,000 of which were served as a jet pilot. \nMajor General Gilbert amassed a large amount of medals throughout his \nservice career, including the Legion of Merit with one oak leaf cluster \nand another 38 awards.\n  Major General Gilbert retired from his career of 42 years of service \nin the Air Force and Air Guard. He previously was the adjutant general \nof the Iowa National Guard, as well as the former commander of the \n132nd Fighter Wing of the Iowa National Guard, which was given three \nnational recognitions as being an outstanding unit of the Air Force. \nAfter retirement, he spent his time hunting, skeet shooting, and taking \nhis golden retriever, Major, out to the field.\n  The career of Major General Gilbert was a distinguished one and his \n42-year commitment to serving the people of the United States and the \nState of Iowa is worthy of much admiration and honor. I am grateful for \nhis service and pay tribute to his patriotism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/13/senate-section/article/S7411-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7411-S7412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING JACK EBERSPACHER\n\n Mr. JOHANNS.

He had been courageously fighting cancer since April.\n  Jack was a dynamic leader and was admired throughout the industry as \na strong and effective advocate for agriculture.\n  Jack was born in Seward, NE, in 1954. He earned an animal science \ndegree at the University of Nebraska and completed coursework toward a \nmaster's degree in business administration at Texas Tech University.\n  After several years working in various agribusiness positions \nthroughout the United States, Jack was named the chief executive \nofficer of the National Grain Sorghum Producers Association in 1989. \nHis colleagues there remember him as a creative man who loved pushing \nthe envelope and emphasizing new ideas. He focused the Association's \nefforts on the needs of the producers and bringing stakeholders \ntogether.\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\n  In 1998, Jack accepted a new challenge as the chief executive officer \nof the National Association of Wheat Growers in Washington, DC. With \nhis leadership, the association achieved a positive financial \nturnaround.\n  In 2001, Jack was appointed president and chief executive officer of \nthe Agricultural Retailers Association, where he served until his \ndeath. He worked tirelessly to build the association into a strong \nvoice for agricultural retailers and distributors in the Nation's \nCapital.\n  Jack was an active member of the Bennett Roundtable of the Farm \nFoundation of Chicago, Illinois, and recipient of the Alpha Gamma Rho \nFraternity Brother of the Century Award. He also served as a member of \nthe Bush-Cheney Agricultural Transition Team.\n  Jack is survived by his wife Jinger and their two children Sam and \nMaggie; his parents Max and Lois Eberspacher; his sister and brother, \nas well as nieces, nephews, relatives and friends.\n  I am personally thankful for his contributions and service to \nAmerican agriculture.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the \nmeaning of ``combat with the enemy'' for purposes of service-connection \nof disabilities; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in order to reduce a 400,000 case backlog \nin disability claims, I am introducing legislation to make it easier \nfor our veterans to enroll in Department of Veteran Affairs', VA, \ndisability programs. Specifically, the Compensation Owed for Mental \nHealth Based on Activities in Theater Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \nAct or COMBAT PTSD Act will change the definition of ``combat with the \nenemy'' so veterans can more easily be enrolled in PTSD programs.\n  It has become apparent that the nature of modern warfare is vastly \ndifferent than it was in previous generations. In the past veterans \nwere confronted with an identifiable enemy, on a battlefield that was \nmuch more easily discernible. This is no longer the case forcing our \nmilitary to adapt to the changes of the battlefield. They have done so \nadmirably--their ability to shift from a force designed to deliver \nquick decisive blows to a full spectrum force has been extremely \nimpressive. Every American can agree that the men and women in uniform \ntoday deserve nothing but the best resources available to them.\n  Unfortunately, when our veterans return home they too often find a \nwait of approximately six months for their claims to the VA to be \nfiled. This is unacceptable. It most certainly does not reflect the \nlevel of sacrifice and commitment that they have given to this nation. \nI know we can do better.\n  During previous conflicts the definition of ``combat with the enemy'' \nwas simply determined by an individual's appearance on the front lines. \nHowever, today's battlefields may not include a front line as they have \nin past conflicts. We are using a 20th century model to diagnose and \ntreat individuals returning from a 21st century conflict.\n  My legislation reflects these changes in conflict to ensure that our \nmen and women in the military gain access to VA programs as soon as \npossible. It changes the VA's definition of ``combat with the enemy'' \nto include those that have served in a theater of operations, or in \ncombat against a hostile force during a period of hostilities. This \nwill more accurately reflect the current face of conflict.\n  President Obama's recent increase in the number of VA claim \nprocessors is certainly a good start, but those of us in Congress need \nto do our part to support this effort. With nearly 400,000 claims \nunprocessed it is time that we expedite this process. The men and women \nwho have served honorably in our Nation's military who need our help \ncannot return to a bureaucratic maze.\n  I ask all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Lugar) (by request):\n  S.J.

PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO CIVILIANS FOR LOSSES \n                   INCIDENT TO COMBAT ACTIVITIES OF THE ARMED \n                   FORCES IN OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All armed conflicts result in civilian casualties. \n     While the United States military makes extensive efforts to \n     minimize civilian casualties, civilians continue to be \n     injured or killed, and to suffer property damage, during \n     United State combat activities in overseas contingency \n     operations.\n       (2) Civilians harmed as a result of United States combat \n     activities may suffer injury and loss that continues long \n     after the incident. Their capacity to provide for their \n     family or to live a fulfilling life may be severely limited. \n     They may also harbor resentment and anger towards the United \n     States and its military personnel when no recognition or \n     assistance is promptly provided for their loss.\n       (3) In most armed conflicts since Vietnam, the United \n     States Armed Forces has carried out programs to provide \n     payments to civilians harmed by United States military \n     personnel in combat operations. Military lawyers and \n     commanders have consistently recognized the need to assist \n     victims in rebuilding their lives and communities. Military \n     strategists have also recognized the need to compensate or \n     provide assistance to such victims in order to win the hearts \n     and minds of the people, promote stability, and enhance the \n     safety of United States personnel.\n       (4) Such programs implemented by the United States with \n     respect to its combat operations have been ad hoc, hastily \n     formulated, and applied differently in each operational \n     setting, limiting their effectiveness and producing \n     inconsistent and inequitable results for civilian victims. \n     Each ad hoc program has also limited the capabilities of \n     United States military officers to provide victims with \n     adequate compensation.\n       (5) A uniform assistance program is needed in overseas \n     contingency operations. Such a program would provide the \n     United States Armed Forces the authority and discretion to \n     offer civilians harmed with equitable and prompt assistance, \n     without the problems of improvised efforts by local military \n     commanders and their legal advisors.\n       (6) In the event such a program is considered to be \n     appropriate by the United States Armed Forces, victims would \n     receive an amount commensurate with their losses suffered as \n     a result of United States combat operations, as determined \n     pursuant to regulations formulated by the Department of \n     Defense and based on an assessment of cultural \n     appropriateness and prevailing economic conditions.\n       (7) A uniform assistance program would help to promote and \n     maintain friendly relations with civilian populations in \n     combat zones, thereby helping the United States Armed Forces \n     to successfully complete its mission and demonstrating that \n     the United States is a compassionate Nation that highly \n     values innocent life.\n       (b) Determination of Assistance.--\n       (1) In general.--To promote and maintain friendly relations \n     through the prompt administration of assistance to civilian \n     casualties, the Secretary concerned, or an officer or \n     employee designated by the Secretary, may appoint, under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, local military \n     commanders to provide monetary assistance in an amount \n     commensurate with the loss suffered for--\n       (A) damage to, or loss of, real property of the inhabitant, \n     including damage or loss incident to use and occupancy;\n       (B) damage to, or loss of, personal property of any \n     inhabitant of a foreign country; or\n       (C) personal injury to, or death of, any inhabitant of a \n     foreign country;\n     if the damage, loss, personal injury, or death occurs outside \n     the United States, or the Commonwealths or possessions, and \n     is\n\n[[Page S7419]]\n\n     caused by, or is otherwise incident to, combat activities in \n     foreign contingency operations of the Armed Forces under the \n     local military commander's command, or is caused by a member \n     thereof or by a civilian employee of the military department \n     concerned or the Coast Guard, as the case may be. A commander \n     will provide assistance under regulations of the Department \n     of Defense.\n       (2) Conditions.--Assistance authorized by this section may \n     be allowed only if--\n       (A) an application therefor is presented within two years \n     after the occurrence of the incident concerned;\n       (B) the applicant is determined by the local military \n     commander to be friendly to the United States;\n       (C) the incident results directly or indirectly from an act \n     of the Armed Forces in combat, an act of the Armed Forces \n     indirectly related to combat, or an act of the Armed Forces \n     occurring while preparing for, going to, or returning from a \n     combat mission; and\n       (D) the incident does not arise directly from action by an \n     enemy, unless the local military commander determines that it \n     in the best military interest to offer assistance in such \n     case.\n       (c) Terms of Assistance.--Except as provided in subsection \n     (d), no assistance may be paid under this section unless the \n     amount tendered is accepted by the applicant in full \n     satisfaction.\n       (d) Type of Assistance.--Satisfaction under this section \n     shall be made through payment in local currency when \n     possible. However, satisfaction under this section may be \n     made through the provision of services or in-kind \n     compensation if such satisfaction is considered appropriate \n     by the legal advisor and the local military commander \n     concerned and accepted by the claimant.\n       (e) Legal Advice Requirement.--Local military commanders \n     shall receive legal advice before authorizing assistance. The \n     legal advisor, under regulations of the Department of \n     Defense, shall determine whether the applicant for assistance \n     is properly an applicant, whether the facts support the \n     provision of assistance, and what amount is commensurate with \n     the loss suffered.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support passage \nof S. 1233, the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2009, with an \namendment from Dr. Coburn and Senator Feingold.\n  This legislation is important because it reauthorizes two extremely \nsuccessful programs--the Small Business Innovation Research and Small \nBusiness Technology Transfer programs--otherwise known as SBIR and \nSTTR. These programs foster partnerships between small businesses and \nthe Federal Government to develop cutting-edge products and \ntechnologies important to our country. The bill makes improvements to \nthese programs that will allow them to work better for small \nbusinesses, while contributing to our economy, fulfilling the priority \nresearch needs of the Nation, and expanding and diversifying our \nmilitary's supply base.\n  The SBIR program expires on July 31, 2009, so time is of the essence \nfor Congress to pass this legislation and get it to President Obama's \ndesk. While we need to act fast, we have not acted in haste. We have \ngiven these programs full deliberation with numerous hearings, \nroundtables, and meetings since 2006, including a hearing on July 12, \n2006, a roundtable on August 1, 2007, a roundtable on October 18, 2007, \nand a roundtable on June 4, 2009. We have also reviewed the nine \nstudies by the National Research Council, and studies by the Government \nAccountability Office, on the SBIR program since it was last authorized \nin 2000 to help guide the committee in drafting not only this bill, S. \n1233, but also the SBIR and STTR reauthorization bills that the \ncommittee adopted unanimously in the 109th Congress, S. 3778, and in \nthe 110th Congress, S. 3362.\n  The SBIR and STTR programs are two of the very few Federal programs \nthat tap into the scientific and technical community found in America's \nsmall businesses. As I noted earlier, these programs foster government-\nindustry partnerships by making competitive awards to firms with the \nbest scientific proposals in response to the research needs of our \nagencies and by helping to move technologies from the lab to the \nmarketplace or from the lab to insertion in a government program or \nsystem.\n  The SBIR program was designed in 1982 to harness the innovative \ncapacity of America's small businesses to meet the needs of our Federal \nagencies and\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\nto help grow small, high-tech firms that, in turn, grow local economies \nall across the Nation. The STTR program was originally created as a \npilot program in 1992 to stimulate partnerships between small \nbusinesses and nonprofit research institutions, such as universities \nlike LSU and Louisiana Tech.\n  Since their inception, both programs have exceeded all expectations, \nplaying an unprecedented role in stimulating technological innovation, \nin allowing small business to meet Federal research and development \nneeds, and in providing seed capital for small business to develop \nideas until they are able to attract outside investment.\n  The SBIR program has awarded more than $24 billion to more than \n100,000 projects since it started. Recipients of SBIR and STTR awards \nhave produced more than 85,000 patents and have generated millions of \nwell-paying jobs across all 50 States. Both programs have garnered high \npraise from well-respected sources, and governments around the world \nare increasingly adopting SBIR-type programs to encourage innovation in \ntheir countries.\n  In drafting this bill, we had many policy goals and interests to \nbalance. We wanted to improve the diversity of the programs, \ngeographically and otherwise, so that more States and individuals could \nparticipate in Federal research and development for our country. We \nalso wanted to maintain a fair playing field so true small businesses \ncould continue to compete for this very small percent of the overall \nFederal R budget. We wanted to encourage exploration of high-risk, \ncutting-edge research. These goals, along with many others, were taken \ninto consideration in forging this bill. We made a number of important \ncompromises in this legislation--and the result is a fair bill that \nwill maintain the strength of these programs.\n  To keep these innovation programs strong, the bill reauthorizes the \nprograms for 8 years, as reflected in the amendment by Dr. Coburn, \ninstead of 14 years as adopted by the committee; increases the SBIR \nprogram allocation by 1 percent, from 2.5 to 3.5 percent, at all \nagencies, including the NIH, spread out over 10 years; increases the \nSTTR program allocation from .3 percent to .6 percent spread out over 6 \nyears; makes firms majority owned and controlled by multiple venture \ncapital firms eligible for up to 18 percent of the SBIR funds at NIH \nand up to 8 percent of the funds at the other agencies; and increases \nthe award guidelines for SBIR and STTR awards from $100,000 to $150,000 \nfor Phase I and from $750,000 to $1 million for Phase II.\n  The bill also reauthorizes and enhances the Federal and State \nTechnology Partnership Program, or FAST Program, that was created by \nSenator Bond in 2000, and the Rural Outreach Program, programs that \nhave been very effective in States such as Louisiana and Missouri in \nincreasing the participation of small business in Federal research and \ndevelopment and the start-up of high-tech firms; strengthens the Office \nof Technology at the SBA so that it has the authority and resources to \ncarry out its duty to oversee the SBIR and STTR programs across the \ngovernment; streamlines and improves data collection and reporting \nrequirements for the SBIR and STTR programs, including developing \nmetrics for annual evaluations by each participating agency, as \nreflected in the amendment by Dr. Coburn; helps SBIR and STTR companies \nmove their technologies across the ``valley of death'' between the lab \nand the marketplace and into products and technologies for the \nagencies; and addresses ``jumbo'' awards, those awards that have \ngreatly exceeded the $100,000 and $750,000 guidelines for Phase I and \nPhase II and cut out other businesses.\n  Reauthorizing these programs will ensure that small businesses \ncontinue to play a part in our Federal research and development. \nCurrently, small businesses receive only about 4 percent of Federal \nresearch and development dollars despite the fact that they employ \nnearly 40 percent of America's scientists and engineers, produce more \nthan 14 times more patents than large businesses and universities, and \nproduce patents that are of higher quality and are more than twice as \nlikely to be cited. This legislation will help maintain and improve the \nrole of small businesses in our Federal research and development.\n  The SBIR and STTR programs have spurred so many amazing technologies. \nI would just like to share a few of them with you here today. Among the \ntechnologies pioneered by SBIR-funded small businesses are a machine \nthat uses lasers and computer cameras to sort and inspect bullets at a \nmuch finer level than the human eye can manage, the technology that \ncreates the ``invisible'' condensation trail of the B-2 bomber, a \ntherapeutic drug to treat chronic inflammatory disease, and a nerve gas \nprotection system.\n  With regard to the bullet sorting technology, developed by CyberNet \nSystems, a small, women-owned business located in Ann Arbor, MI, and \ncurrently in use in Iraq and Afghanistan, that SBIR technology is \nestimated to have saved taxpayers more than $300 million. Those are \nreal cost savings and tangible technological improvement.\n  In Louisiana, one company that has had great success in recent years \nis Network Foundation Technologies, known as NiFTy. I visited this \ncompany in Ruston, LA, a rural part of the State, in August 2008 and \nwas extremely impressed. NiFTy used an SBIR grant from the National \nScience Foundation to develop technology that permits live streaming \nvideo over the Internet without using large amounts of bandwidth. They \nhave been particularly successful bringing sporting events live over \nthe Internet. NiFTy has grown to more than 40 employees, many drawn \nfrom the ranks of the Louisiana Tech science and engineering programs. \nThese are new, high-paying jobs that have been a strong asset to north \nLouisiana's economy.\n  SBIR is a program that helps spur technology research and innovation \nin areas you would not normally think of as high-tech corridors. Folks \nthink of California or Massachusetts, but not our growing high-tech \ncorridor in rural north Louisiana. LA Tech, UL-Monroe, Grambling \nUniversity, LSU-Shreveport, and Centenary College are all in that \ncorridor. For those who don't know, Ruston is between Monroe and \nShreveport, and LA Tech helps attract good companies because we have \ngood scientists and engineers. With SBIR and STTR, those entrepreneurs \nstarted a company.\n  It is stories such as these that make the SBIR and STTR programs so \nspecial to the economic and technological growth of this country. I \nwant to once again thank all those involved for their hard work on this \nlegislation, particularly our ranking member, Senator Snowe, and her \nstaff, as well as Senator Levin and his staff on the Committee on Armed \nServices, Senator Durbin and his Appropriations staff, and Dr. Coburn \nand Senator Feingold on the final amendment to the bill. It is my hope \nthat we can now pass this bill in the Senate and work expeditiously \nwith the House to get a bill on President Obama's desk before July 31.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senators Coburn and Feingold have an \namendment at the desk, and I ask unanimous consent for its \nconsideration; that the amendment be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that the committee-reported \nsubstitute, as amended, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
