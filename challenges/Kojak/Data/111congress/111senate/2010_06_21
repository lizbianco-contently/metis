Mr. President, what we do on the Senate floor has \nconsequences far beyond this building. We know our work has real world \ncosts, far beyond the beltway. But it is not just what we do that \ntouches our constituents' lives and livelihoods, it is also what we do \nnot do. When the Senate refuses to pass good bills, the people in our \nStates pay the price. I hope we can avoid more of that this week and we \ncan come together and work productively.\n  Right now, loopholes reward corporations for shipping jobs out of \nAmerica, putting them out of reach of the many unemployed workers in \neach of our States. Every day we do not act, the loopholes remain wide \nopen, those jobs vanish, and those we represent get hurt.\n  Right now, small businesses are desperate for tax incentives to \ncreate jobs at home. Every day we don't act, those small businesses \nhave a harder time hiring, and the unemployment rate has a harder time \nfalling.\n  Right now, Nevada's unemployment rate is the highest in the country. \nVictims of the recession who have been\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\nout of work for a long time are struggling to make ends meet while they \nare looking for a job. This bill extends the emergency unemployment \nassistance they need, critical help that, for many, has expired or \ndried up.\n  Every day we don't act, those families in Nevada and across the \nNation continue to suffer unnecessary pain. This will be the eighth \nweek since March the Senate has debated the tax-cutting, job-creating \nbill currently on the Senate floor. That is 2 full months, 2 full \nmonths we have been waiting and they have been waiting--the people in \nour States--for us to respond to an emergency. That is unacceptable.\n  The richest corporations continue to get richer while the unemployed \nremain out of work. Every minute we waste, it gets worse. It is our job \nto debate and not to delay. It is our job to legislate; it is our job \nto do something about the plight of the people in America. We need to \nlegislate relief.\n  As we serve our citizens, it would serve the Senate well to remember \nthe consequences of decisions that are driven by politics, purely, and \nthe consequences of our actions and our inaction alike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5164-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it should be perfectly clear by now \nthat Democrats here in Washington have no intention of being encumbered \nby the will of the American people. Whether it is health care, \nfinancial reform, creating private sector jobs, spending, debt, or even \nthe oilspill, Americans say they want one thing and Democrats do \nanother.\n  And we are seeing the same thing in the ongoing debate over the \ndeficit extenders bill that is on the floor. Americans are anxious in a \nway they have never been about our monstrous national debt. Yet for \nnearly 3 weeks now, Democrats in Congress have been arguing among \nthemselves not about how much they should cut the debt down but about \nhow much they should increase it.\n  So we can add this to the list of crises Americans are begging \nCongress to address but which Democrats are either ignoring or \nexploiting to advance their agenda. The White House likes to talk about \ninflection points. Well, for most Americans, a $13 trillion debt should \nhave marked an inflection point for Democrats on the issue of debt. But \nthe debate over this extenders bill has shown Democrats to be oblivious \nto the gravity of this crisis.\n  At a moment when certain European countries appear to be coming apart \nbecause of their own debt, Democrats in Washington still can't break \nthe habit. Economists are warning us every day to get the debt under \ncontrol. Just today, in fact, it was reported that Germany's Economy \nMinister is pleading with the Obama administration to cut spending and \nto restore fiscal balance or risk instability.\n  Yet nearly 3 weeks into the debate over the extenders bill, Democrats \nstill can't agree to pass it without borrowing more money to pay for \nit. Republicans offered a fully offset 30-day extension of this bill \nthat didn't just cover its cost but actually reduced the deficit in the \nprocess. Democrats rejected it. We offered an amendment that would have \nprovided a long term extension of the expired provisions and lowered \nthe deficit by $55 billion over 10 years. Democrats rejected that too.\n  This should be an easy one, but Democrats are making it difficult \nbecause they just can't seem to bring themselves to pay for \nlegislation.\n  But the American people aren't conflicted on this issue. And they \nwant us to show we are serious, that we are willing to make the same \nkinds of tough choices they themselves have been forced to make in this \nrecession. So I say to my friend from Nevada I am going to ask, now, a \nunanimous consent.\n  I again ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 411, S. 3421; further, that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table. Before the chair rules, for clarity, this is a paid-for 30-\nday extension of the extenders bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I realize \nvery much the financial situation our country finds itself in today. \nEveryone on this side of the aisle recognizes that. We also recognize \nthe fact that the problems dealing with the economy were not created by \nthe Democrats or even President Obama. The problems were created by \nvirtue of 8 years of wild spending by a prior administration, a war \ncosting $1 trillion that was unpaid for, and tax cuts amounting to more \nthan $1 trillion, unpaid for, that caused this huge recession.\n  President Obama has been doing his best, working with us to get our \nway out of that financial situation in which we find ourselves. I am \nvery amazed at the logic of my friends on the other side of the aisle \nsuddenly seeing fiscal austerity as the way to go when the wild \nspending went on for 8 years without a word having been spoken.\n  We are doing everything we can to make sure the country continues on \nan upward scale. It has now. We have a long ways to go. But as \neconomists say, the hemorrhaging has stopped, and we are trying to work \nour way into a vibrant economy. We are a long ways from that, and I \nrecognize that.\n  In today's newspaper a number of columnists are talking about being \nvery careful what we do. We are very aware of the pain people are \nfeeling out there; for example, those people who are unemployed, long-\nterm unemployed. As I have said on this floor before, Mark Zandi--John \nMcCain's financial adviser when he ran for President--has said the most \nimportant thing we can do is give those people unemployment benefits \nbecause it goes right back into the economy and helps the economy.\n  A Nobel Prize-winning economist writes a column several times a week \nin the New York Times. Today he talks about the fact that we have to be \nvery careful how we rein in spending. We know we have to do it, but we \nhave to be very careful doing it.\n  In 1937, after we had pulled our way out of the economic crisis we \nfound ourselves in, spending was reined in too quickly and it caused \nthe country to go back into, not a depression but a recession. World \nWar II saved our country financially in that regard.\n  I know my friend's heart is in the right place, but his logic is in \nthe wrong place, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our good friends on the other side \nstill do not seem to get it. They are twisting and turning, not in an \neffort to cut the debt but to borrow as much as they can with the \nminimum votes they need to pass this bill. And the best part of all is \ntheir justification. You guessed it. They want to blame President Bush \nfor their own unwillingness to pay for this bill. They say that because \nthe debt grew during his administration they are immune to any \ncriticism for dramatically increasing it themselves.\n  Well, I have some news for our friends on the other side: Nobody is \nbuying that anymore, because there is not any comparison here. When \nPresident Obama took office, the deficits he inherited were projected \nto $4.3 trillion over the next 10 years. One year later, one year after \nPresident Bush left office, the Congressional Budget Office had to put \nout a revised estimate: After 1 year of Democrats controlling \nWashington, estimated deficits just over the next decade had nearly \ndoubled to $8.1 trillion, in the middle of a recession; in other words, \nat a time when projected revenues coming in are actually decreasing.\n  Or consider this: The largest annual deficit ever accumulated by the \nprevious administration was $455 billion.\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\nThe largest annual deficit ever accumulated by the previous \nadministration was $455 billion. So what did President Obama do when he \ntook office? He wrote a budget that guarantees average annual deficits \nof more than double that every year for the next 10 years. More than \ndoubles the largest deficit we had during the Bush years and \nanticipates that for every year for the next decade.\n  So the kind of spending and debt Democrats are engaged in and which \nthey are committed to continue year after year is like nothing this \ncountry has ever seen. We have never seen anything like this. It \nthreatens not only the livelihoods of our children, it threatens our \nnational security and the very safety net Democrats claim they want to \nprotect.\n  The fact is, the longer we wait to address this debt in a serious \nmanner, the more that safety net actually frays and the harder this \ncrisis will be to address. At some point a choice has to be made, and \nthat point is now.\n  I noticed that the President's Chief of Staff had some ideas over the \nweekend about how to frame up the November elections. I cannot think of \na better example of how detached the Democrats seem to be at this \nmoment from the concerns of the American people. Americans want to know \nwhat is being done to fix a broken pipe at the bottom of the Gulf, not \nwhat is being done to fix the election. The White House might view the \nupcoming election as its biggest crisis at the moment, but the American \npeople are focused on fixing this pipe and cleaning up this mess. Two \nmonths of delays and bureaucratic redtape have done nothing to solve \nthe crisis, but they have done a lot to discredit the kind of big-\ngovernment solutions that Democrats continue to promote. Every day the \noil continues to flow is a day Americans' faith in government ends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend says he has never seen anything \nlike this. Well, I have never seen anything like this reasoning. \nEveryone knows that President Obama did not cause the oil gushing into \nthe ocean, and he has done his utmost to try to alleviate the pain and \nsuffering of the people in the gulf. He had the good fortune of getting \nthe company responsible for this oil gushing out of the ocean to come \nup with a $20 billion trust fund to pay the people who suffered. There \nwere some Republicans last week who said they thought it was wrong for \nthe President to do that. But that was a very small minority who \nbelieved that. I have never seen anything like this. So President Obama \nis not responsible for the oil gushing out of the Earth into the ocean, \nand President Obama is not responsible for the severe recession that \nhit this country in the last few months of the Bush administration.\n  I cannot imagine anyone thinking we should not have taken the \nmeasures we did to help bolster the economy. The economic recovery \npackage created millions of jobs. There is still money in the pipeline \nto create more jobs. And as it says in this one op-ed piece in the New \nYork Times today:\n\n       And some of the most vocal deficit scolds in Congress are \n     working hard to reduce taxes for the handful of lucky \n     Americans who are heirs to multimillion-dollar estates. This \n     would do nothing for the economy now, but it will reduce \n     revenue by billions of dollars a year, permanently.\n\n  It will be interesting to see in the next few weeks how these same \nbudget hawks feel about the estate taxes that we have to address. I \nwould hope we can all be calm and deliberate here. We have a few weeks \nleft. We have 2 weeks in this week period, 4 or 5 the next work period \nto get some things done here.\n  We have appropriations bills we have to do. We have these tax \nextenders we have been working on, as I indicated, for 8 weeks. We have \nthe unemployment benefits we need to extend. People are now desperate \nfor that money. We have also something to help States called FMAP, \nwhich helps for Medicaid, which has been such a drain on the States \nbecause of the tremendous problems we have had with people being out of \nwork and needing to go on Medicaid because there is no place else for \nthem to go for health care.\n  I would hope we can move forward on the legislation that we tried try \nto finish last week. I am grateful we were able to finally get the \nshort-term fix on the patients who are Medicare recipients. Now if we \ncan get something done in the House there, doctors will be able to be \nreimbursed not at the fat and sassy rate, but at least it will be \nbetter than the 21-percent cut that was going to go into effect today \nor tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5165-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak briefly today about some \nbroken promises related to the health care bill, specifically, \nPresident Obama's promise that if Americans liked their current \ncoverage, they would be able to keep it.\n  Remember that promise. Last June, the President promised on national \ntelevision that:\n\n       Government is not going to make you change plans under \n     health reform.\n\n  In his September address to Congress, he reassured Americans:\n\n       If you have health insurance through your job, nothing in \n     our plan requires you to change what you have.\n\n  Well, those two statements are true as far as they go. The law does \nnot require. The problem is, everything written into the law will, \nnevertheless, result in that happening.\n  What we are seeing is new developments every week that prove that \nwhat we had said would happen will, in fact, happen. Many Americans are \nnot going to be able to keep the coverage they have, even though they \nlike it. That includes many who have employer-based coverage in \naddition to many seniors who rely on private Medicare plans known as \nMedicare Advantage.\n  So how does this happen? First, with regard to the 170 million \nAmericans who have employer-based coverage, regulations are being \nwritten right now by the administration, specifically by the Labor and \nHealth and Human Services Departments and the IRS that will have a \ndirect impact on people not being able to keep their plans. These \nregulations deal with existing plans called ``grandfathered plans.'' \nGrandfathered status was supposed to allow employers to continue \noffering their current plans even if they did not meet all of the \ngovernment's new cost-increasing mandates and requirements, such as \nminimum standards for what a plan must offer. That was the whole point \nof grandfathering.\n\n  It was also intended to protect Americans enrolled in their plans \nfrom ``rate shock'' or significant premium increases as a result of the \nnew government mandates. But according to the administration's own \nreport, new regulations could mean that two-thirds of all workers at \nsmall businesses would have to relinquish their grandfathered status, \nexposing them to these new mandates and requirements.\n  The worst-case scenario, according to the report, is that a whopping \n80 percent of small firms' plans would lose their grandfathered status. \nBy 2013, the report concludes, more than half of all workers' plans, 51 \npercent, will be subject to new Federal requirements. So much for the \nidea that if you like your plan you get to keep it.\n  These requirements drive up the cost of insurance, impede an \nemployer's ability to adjust to rising health care costs, and \nultimately provide an incentive to employers to drop their coverage \naltogether and instead pay a fine or, to put it another way, it creates \na disincentive to keeping your coverage and an incentive to dropping \ntheir coverage and forcing them to buy the coverage through the so-\ncalled exchange.\n  The individual mandate provision in the bill would then require these \nworkers whose coverage has been dropped to purchase the government-\napproved insurance from the new government-dictated exchange, replete \nwith the highest costs, more mandates, and so on.\n  Of the new regulations, James Gelfand, who is health policy director\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\nat the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said:\n\n       These rules are extremely strict. Almost no plan is going \n     to be able to maintain grandfathered status.\n\n  So what has happened? The President said: If you like your plan, you \nget to keep it. We will grandfather it in.\n  Now the rules and regulations are being written in such a way that \nvirtually none of the plans will be grandfathered so that the employers \nall have an incentive to send their employees to the new health \nexchange and therefore to drop the coverage they currently have and \nlike.\n  This frankly validates concerns that we voiced throughout the debate, \nthat despite the President's claims, his health care bill will force \nAmericans to accept unwanted health care coverage changes and that, in \nfact, therefore it amounts to a government takeover of health care.\n  I mentioned American seniors. This is the second area in which they \nwill not get to keep their plans even though they like them. The White \nHouse recently sent out a promotional mailer to seniors, saying:\n\n       Your guaranteed Medicare benefits won't change--whether you \n     get them through original Medicare or a Medicare Advantage \n     plan. Instead, you will see new benefits and cost savings.\n\n  Wrong. Seniors are normally skeptical about such a claim, given the \nPresident's bill is funded by $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts. \nRepublicans brought this up repeatedly during the health care debate. \nDemocrats assured seniors not to worry, that if they liked their plan \nthey could keep it. They were promised the law would strengthen \nMedicare. Yet now we are seeing and hearing from the experts that \nmillions of seniors too will lose their Medicare Advantage benefits.\n  In fact, the White House's claims to the contrary are flatly \ncontradicted by the administration's own expert, Richard Foster. He is \nthe CMS Actuary, and he says:\n\n       The new provisions [in the health care law] will generally \n     reduce [Medicare Advantage] rebates to plans and thereby \n     result in less generous benefits packages.\n\n  That is the administration's own actuary telling us that seniors who \nhave Medicare Advantage will not get to keep what they have. Here is \nhow a Wall Street Journal op-ed summed up the expert's conclusions:\n\n       In an April memo, Richard Foster estimated that the $206 \n     billion hole in Advantage will reduce benefits, cause \n     insurers to withdraw from the program, and reduce overall \n     enrollment by half. Doug Elmendorf and his team at the \n     Congressional Budget Office came to the same conclusion, as \n     did every other honest expert.\n\n  In conclusion, we have a number of experts, not partisans, on the \nrecord saying that seniors who use Medicare Advantage will see their \nbenefits eliminated and their coverage changed.\n  The administration is trying to soften the blow by sending some \nseniors a $250 rebate check. I am sure people are happy to get the \ncheck. But it is not much of a gain for those seniors who face \nskyrocketing premiums and may not have access to the same Medicare \nAdvantage plans they now enjoy.\n  These developments are consistent with a pattern. It is a pattern \never since the bill was passed and signed into law by the President of \nbroken promises. Americans never liked or wanted this bill, and they \nare continually reminded why they opposed it in the first place. The \nfact is, it turns out they will not get to keep what they have even if \nthey like it. That is just one of the reasons why a strong majority of \nAmericans want to see it repealed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I listened to the leaders today. I was \nthinking about Will Rogers, who once said: You could call me a hick or \ncall me a rube, but the fact is, I would sooner be the person who buys \nthe Brooklyn Bridge than the person who sells it. I was thinking of the \nfiction in that clever Will Rogers quote and some of the fiction I hear \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Everybody here understands--if not, they better understand quickly--\nthe dilemma of the unbelievable growth of deficits or debt for this \ncountry. It is unsustainable. There is no question about that. But it \nis interesting to me that just recently we have had the minority side \nof the aisle decide this is their life's calling despite the fact that \nthis President, the day he was inaugurated and walked across the door \ninto the White House, had this President done nothing but sleep for the \nnext year, he inherited a Federal deficit of $1.3 trillion. This stuff \nabout he said, we said, she said, they said, the American people aren't \nvery interested in all that. What they are interested in is what caused \nthis problem and who is going to step up and fix it.\n  Let's talk about what caused this problem. What ran this country into \nthe ditch and what has caused this unbelievable runup in debt? No. 1, \nearly on in 2001, I and others stood on the floor when President Bush--\nyes, President Bush; and I am not here just to tarnish his Presidency, \nI am here to talk about his record--said: We now have 10 years of \nexpected budget surpluses. Let's do something with that money. \nPresident Bush had inherited a record budget surplus from the Clinton \nAdministration. The new President took over and said: We have to have \nvery big tax cuts to get rid of these surpluses.\n  I stood on this floor and said: These surpluses don't exist yet. \nLet's be a little conservative.\n  He said: ``Katy, bar the door,'' we are going to give this money \naway.\n  Very big tax cuts, the largest benefits went to the highest income \nearners in the country. Then what did we experience? Very quickly, a \nrecession, an attack against our country on 9/11, wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Then we sent soldiers off to war and didn't pay for one \npenny of it. Everybody in this Chamber knows better than that. You \ndon't fight a war by asking people to go risk their lives but we won't \nrisk anything by asking the American people to pay for the cost of the \nwar. We will just put it on the debt.\n  As all this was going on, we had a bunch of new regulators who came \nto town from the new administration who said: It is a new day. We are \ngoing to have business-friendly regulation in this town. We won't look. \nWe won't watch. We don't care what you do.\n  As a result, we had an unbelievable outpouring of greed that ran this \ncountry into the ditch by some of the biggest financial enterprises in \nthe country.\n  I am not sure either side is much of a bargain for the American \npeople these days. I understand that. But I don't think we ought to \nrewrite history. This President inherited the biggest mess since \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt came to the Presidency. That is a fact. Now \nwe have to try to work together to figure out what we do about it. How \ndo we deal with this? How do we respond to the burgeoning Federal \nbudget deficits?\n  By the way, some say: Let's make our stand by shutting down \nunemployment insurance for folks at the bottom, the folks who don't \nhave a job, those people who have been told: Your job doesn't exist \nanymore; you are done; you are out of here. And we have about 20 \nmillion fewer jobs than we need in this country. In the last 9 years, \nwe lost more than 5 million jobs of people who work in the factories.\n  Will Rogers also once said: I see where Congress passed a bill to \nhelp bankers' mistakes. You can always count on us helping those who \nhave lost part of their fortune, but the whole history records nary a \ncase where the loan was for the person who had absolutely nothing.\n  And so it is in this Congress--hundreds of billions here and there in \ntax cuts and bailouts. But now it is about helping people with \nunemployment. That is where we make our stand, according to some. It is \npretty unbelievable. We need to start working together to find common \nsolutions. Describing where the other side is wrong is hardly a \nproductive enterprise. It is pretty easy to do, in fact.\n  That is not why I came to talk, but it does get tiresome trying to \nrewrite history here on the floor of the Senate. I am not suggesting \none Presidency is good or bad. I am saying this President\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\ninherited a $1.3 trillion deficit. That is a fact. That doesn't come \nfrom me; that comes from the Congressional Budget Office. I understand, \nat least in part, why that happened. Some of us on the floor of the \nSenate did not support giving away tax revenues we didn't have. Some of \nus didn't support going to war without paying for it. I had that \ndiscussion. How about paying for some of this? The previous President \nsaid: You try to pay for it, I will veto the bill. Is it surprising, \nthen, that we are deep in debt? Not particularly surprising to me. \nThose are not very thoughtful decisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5167-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FINANCIAL REFORM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 16 years ago I wrote a cover article for \nthe Washington Monthly magazine. The title was ``Very Risky Business,'' \nthe subtitle, ``If we don't watch out, a new kind of Wall Street \ngambling--exotic derivatives trading--could shake the market and put \ntaxpayers on the line for another bailout.'' I talked about $35 \ntrillion in derivatives. That is now a fraction of what is out there. I \ntalked about banks that were trading on derivatives on their own \nproprietary accounts. I said they might just as well have a roulette \nwheel or a craps table in their lobby. It is just flatout gambling, and \nit ought to be stopped.\n  It is not surprising to me because I made the same point 5 years \nafter that, when they tried to repeal Glass-Steagall--and did \nsuccessfully--in order for us to compete with the Europeans. That took \napart the protections that existed after the Great Depression. It was \ndecided that we don't need those protections anymore. They took it \napart. I was one of eight Senators to vote no. I warned on the floor \nthen that another taxpayer bailout would come within a decade. It did, \nregrettably.\n  Now the question is, as we put together a piece of legislation to \naddress these issues, what do we do that doesn't have us just having a \npress conference to say: Look at what we did. What is it we have to do \nto make sure this doesn't happen again? Have we really tightened the \nregulations?\n  Let me go through a couple things. Will we have dealt with too big to \nfail? The answer is no, not really. Too big to fail means there are \nsome businesses in this country in the financial services industry, \nsome of the biggest financial institutions, that are determined ``too \nbig to fail,'' and their failure would cause grievous harm to the \neconomy, perhaps bring the entire economy down. Therefore, if they are \ntoo big to fail, they are, by definition, going to be bailed out.\n  I happen to believe that if you are too big to fail, you are simply \ntoo big. You ought to be pared back, trimmed down until you are not too \nbig to fail. That is not what is happening here. We are going to pass a \npiece of legislation in which the biggest financial institutions are \nbigger than they were before we got into this mess. Too big to fail \ndoesn't mean you are too big. In fact, you can get bigger with the kind \nof legislation that is being considered in conference.\n\n  Proprietary trading. Will they still allow banks to trade on their \nown proprietary accounts? Will they put a restriction, finally, on \nbanks' ability to make speculative bets using their own capital in \ntheir own lobby? We will see. It doesn't look like it.\n  What about the issue of naked credit default swaps, CDSs? They have \nno insurable interest on any side of them, just flatout betting. No, \nthis isn't going on in Atlantic City or Las Vegas; it is going on \nacross the country with financial institutions. Will this be trimmed \ndown? It doesn't look like it.\n  How about the ratings agencies, the agencies that gave AAA ratings to \nfundamentally worthless securities, had a bunch of people left with bad \nsecurities in the bowels of financial balance sheets? What about that? \nThere was an amendment on the floor of the Senate to deal with that. \nThat has now been watered down. Or capital standards.\n  I won't go on except to say that I hope the sum total of this \nconference between the House and Senate on financial reform is about \nworking for the American people and not the interests that helped \ncreate this mess. I hope this is a time to suck it up and do the right \nthing. I hope the conferees understand that if this bill is excessively \nweakened--and it wasn't strong leaving here--they should not assume \nthey will have the votes to automatically pass that kind of legislation \nback in the Senate and perhaps the House.\n  This is very important. This is not some other issue. This is about \nwhether the economy will continue to provide strength and expand and \npromote hiring. It will be what our children and grandchildren \nexperience in terms of opportunities for the future in our great \ncountry.\n  It is a conference that is pushed by all sides to do various things \nfor various interests. I hope they understand that this is something \nthat will revisit us again in 2 years, 5 years, 10 years from now \nunless we do the right thing and make certain we address the key \nissues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5167-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5167-S5169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about energy legislation. I \nhave been reading today all the stories in the newspapers about the \ncaucus we had last week in which we described energy legislation and \nclimate change legislation and what we should or should not do.\n  There are two challenges for this country at this point: No. 1, we \nare far too dependent on foreign oil. Over 60 percent of the oil we \nreceive comes from outside of our country; 70 percent of the oil we use \ngoes into the transportation sector. We are far too dependent on \nforeign oil. If something should happen to shut off the supply of \nforeign oil to our country, our economy will be flat on its back for a \nlong while. We need to be less dependent on foreign oil. No. 2, there \nis something happening to our climate. We are not completely sure what \nthat is, but I don't think there is any question that there is a wide \nscientific consensus that something is happening to the global climate.\n  We should work on both, no question about that. But there is a \npractical limitation of what we will be able to consider and do between \nnow and the end of this year. I have said previously that I support a \ncap on carbon. I support pricing carbon. I have said I will not support \nwhat is called classic cap and trade, which would serve the interests \nof Wall Street by creating a $1 trillion carbon securities market so \nthey can trade carbon securities on Monday and Tuesday and tell us what \nthe cost of our energy is going to be on Thursday and Friday. I have no \ninterest in doing that, nor would I support it. But there are ways for \nus to price carbon and to restrict carbon. I understand that.\n  The question has lingered now about a piece of legislation that came \nout of the Energy Committee 1 year ago this month. We had 12 weeks of \nmarkup. It was a very difficult markup. We passed, at the conclusion of \nthe markup, a bipartisan piece of energy legislation that advances our \ncountry's energy interests and will make us less dependent on foreign \noil. It will substantially reduce carbon emissions because it will \ndramatically change the amount of production that comes from renewable \nenergy, wind, solar, biomass, and so on.\n  For a year we have now waited for that legislation to come to the \nfloor. It has not come to the floor because some say: If we can't do \ncomprehensive climate change legislation, then we don't want to do any \nlegislation. Even that which would reduce carbon, even that which would \nsubstantially increase production from sources of energy where the wind \nblows and the Sun shines so we can collect this energy and put it on a \ngrid.\n  It does not make any sense, that we would not consider a bipartisan \nenergy bill and end this year having failed to address something that, \nA, was bipartisan, and B, will in fact reduce carbon and will give us \nan opportunity to be less dependent on foreign oil. That makes no \nsense, not to be able to take advantage of that kind of success.\n  It seems to me there are not 60 votes in the Senate to bring up a \ncomprehensive climate change bill in June or July of this year. I know \nsome people will have heartburn when I say that. I just think that is \nthe case. If that is the case, let's not block a bipartisan energy bill \nthat does address production, efficiency, and a lower carbon future.\n  We need to produce more in this country. We need to save more, that \nis, conserve more. Even as we do that, we\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\nneed to produce more energy in a different way--wind energy, solar \nenergy, the biofuels, obviously, that are renewable and, generally \nspeaking, reduce carbon.\n  Building an interstate highway of transmission capability is \nessential because it is not the case that all people live in areas \nwhere they get the best sunshine or the most significant amount of \nwind. If we are going to get the most energy available from wind and \nsolar, we need the kind of transmission that is capable of getting the \nwind energy and solar energy and then moving it to where it is needed.\n  The building efficiency plan that contains the best and quickest \ncapability for saving energy is also in the bill we have written.\n  We will and we should produce more domestic oil. We are doing \nunbelievable things in new kinds of horizontal drilling. The Bakken \nshale in my State is the largest assessed reserve of recoverable oil \never registered in the history of the lower 48--just in the last 2 \nyears--up to 4.3 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil.\n  Coal development, including carbon capture and sequestration, an \nespecially beneficial use of carbon--all of that is capable of being \ndone; and, yes, some nuclear energy. I support loan guarantees for \nnuclear plants, like requested by the Administration.\n  I think all of this is capable of being done in a way that reduces \nour dependence on foreign oil and is good for our economy. I understand \nchange is hard and that is never demonstrated more concretely than in \nthis Chamber. Change is very hard. I mentioned some while ago that a \nman named Rudolf Diesel showed up at the World's Fair in Europe about \n110 years ago. Rudolf Diesel showed up with a new engine which we now \nknow as the diesel engine. He was very proud of the engine he had \ndeveloped, and it ran on vegetable oil. Yes, that was 110 years ago. \nRudolf Diesel's new engine ran on vegetable oil. Most of what we can \nand should and I hope will do, does not need to represent a new idea.\n  Ninety-seven percent of our transportation sector runs on oil. So \nSenator Alexander, myself, and Senator Merkley have just introduced the \nelectric drive transportation bill. We are moving toward electric drive \nvehicles, and we are establishing the capability of demonstration \ncities for infrastructure and all the things that are necessary, \nincluding battery investment and so on. I think ultimately we will have \na 400- or 500-mile battery in vehicles that are electric drive \nvehicles.\n  Think of the changes in transportation, and it is pretty \nunbelievable. Nobody knows exactly what the future is going to hold, \nbut we either decide to make that future or we just let it happen. I am \na big believer in making it happen. In 1935, it took 3 weeks to go from \nChicago to New York. Twenty-five years later, it took 3 days by \nrailroad, then the cars, and then the jet airplanes, and all of a \nsudden things changed dramatically.\n  From the Roman legions time until when Lewis and Clark came and spent \nthe winter in North Dakota on their wonderful expedition, there was no \nchange to speak of in travel. One could travel as fast as a horse or a \nriver stream could take them, and that was it. All of a sudden, in the \nlast century, century and a half, things have exploded. But it has \nrequired a great deal of energy.\n  So the question is, What kind of energy? How do we produce it? What \nmakes us less dependent, for example on foreign oil, so we do not find \nourselves, at some point, tipped over in an economy that cannot work \nbecause we do not have the energy? How do we address the energy issue, \nstill paying attention to the issue of climate change? Those are the \nissues.\n  As I indicated, very few people can see the future. In fact, most \npeople are skeptical about anything. They say Fulton, when he developed \nthe steam engine--he apparently was with Napoleon, talking to Napoleon \nabout his idea--and Napoleon said: Are you kidding me?\n  He probably did not quite say it that way. He said: You are saying \nyou are going to make a boat sail against the wind by putting a fire \nunder its deck? I don't think so. That was Napoleon's response to \nFulton.\n  Or Einstein said: There is no evidence whatsoever that nuclear energy \nwill ever be achievable. I do not know, has anybody ever said Einstein \nlacked clarity about the future?\n  David Sarnoff once famously said about the wireless music box, which \nwe now call the radio: Who on Earth would pay for someone to send a \nmessage that goes to no one in particular? Or Harry Warner who said: \nWho would pay to hear actors talk? So much for prognosis. Watson, at \nIBM, said he thought there was a market worldwide for about five \ncomputers. That was his assessment.\n  So it is very hard to predict the future. No one can see very far. \nThe question, it seems to me is: Are we going to decide reasonably what \nwe want our future to be, with new technology--perhaps using old \ntechnology--and move there, or are we just going to sit around and let \nthings happen?\n  That is why this Energy bill is so important. We are charting a new \npath. RES--we say we want 15 percent, and if we can get the bill to the \nfloor, I am going to offer an amendment for 20 percent. We want 20 \npercent of all electricity produced in America coming from renewable \nsources. Driving renewable energy will make us less dependent on \nforeign oil.\n  I also support domestic production of oil and gas and domestic \nproduction of coal. By the way, coal is one of the most significant \nquantities of resources in our country for energy, and there is great \nconcern because it produces carbon when you burn it, and that is tough \nfor the environment and goes against the issue of the global climate \nchange matter. So what do we do about that? Well, one of the things I \nam convinced we can do is understand that carbon is a product, not just \na problem.\n  What can we do with carbon? Well, we can produce fuel with carbon. We \nhave work going on at Sandia National Laboratories that uses a heat \nengine. You put CO2 in one side and water in the other side, \nand you fracture the molecules and chemically recombine them, and you \nproduce fuel. So take carbon and air and produce fuel, along with some \nwater.\n  I do not think these problems are unsolvable. But in order to get \nthere, we have to get this Energy bill to the floor of the Senate, and \nit has now been 1 year. I noticed this morning there were 15 or 20 of \nmy colleagues who said: If a bill does not contain climate change, we \nwould not support any bill coming to the floor.\n  Well, do you know what? Climate change means you want to reduce \ncarbon to try to protect our environment. How do you reduce carbon? \nWith the very kinds of policies that exist in this Energy bill, and we \nhave done it on a bipartisan basis.\n  So my hope is, in the next couple of weeks or so, that we might \nfinally, at last--at long, long last--get to the point where we are \nbringing up a piece of legislation that is out of the committee, that \nis bipartisan, that will protect our environment but, most importantly, \nwill invest in virtually every form of energy production and \nconservation and make us less dependent--much less dependent--on \nforeign oil.\n  That ought to be the goal of all Americans. We do not think much of \nit, we do not talk much about it because we just assume energy is going \nto be a part of our lives beginning tomorrow morning. We get up in the \nmorning, we turn off the alarm--that was electricity--we turn on the \nlight--that is electricity--make a piece of toast--that is \nelectricity--get a cup of coffee--that is electricity--take a shower--\nthat is electricity to heat the water. We get in the car and turn the \nkey to start the engine--that is oil.\n  The fact is, we use energy in a prodigious way all day long and never \nthink much about it. But if, God forbid, tomorrow morning something \nhappens that shuts off the supply of foreign oil to this country, our \neconomy would be in deep, desperate trouble. We would be smart, we \nwould be wise, to understand that over dependence, that excessive \ndependence on foreign oil, is a detriment to this county's future. We \nbetter get about the business of trying to address it. There is a way \nto do that, and a way to do that at the same time that is very helpful \nto this country's environment by restricting and limiting \nCO2 emissions because we are going more and more toward the \ndevelopment of renewable sources of energy for the future.\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just want to make some brief remarks \nthis afternoon concerning the ongoing tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico and \nthe Deepwater Horizon response.\n  Sixty-one days ago is when the tragedy started. We are here, 61 days \nlater, and we still have this tremendous pouring of oil from the bottom \nof the sea floor into the Gulf of Mexico. In fact, the amount of oil \nthat is coming into the gulf now equals the size of the Exxon Valdez \noilspill every 2\\1/2\\ days.\n  Yet while this oil continues to gush, and while we have hope that the \ncontainment dome will capture more and more of this oil as it comes \nfrom the bottom of the ocean, we are still seeing a weak, at best, \nresponse from the Federal Government in trying to keep this oil from \ncoming ashore.\n  Last week--a week ago tomorrow--I met with the President of the \nUnited States and Admiral Allen in Pensacola. At the same time, I \nraised the issue of skimmers. Why are there so few skimmers in the Gulf \nof Mexico? Why were there only, at that time, 32 skimmers off the coast \nof Florida? The President and Admiral Allen told me they were making \nevery effort they could to get more skimmers to the gulf and that they \nwere welcoming skimmers from foreign countries coming to our country to \naid in the effort.\n  I told them at that time there was a State Department report saying \nthat 21 offers of assistance have been made from 17 foreign countries, \nand they had been refused. I was informed back that, no; that is not \nthe case and in fact we are using skimmers from foreign countries. I \ncame to find out, through discussions with my office, there are still \noffers and there have been offers from foreign countries for skimmers \nand, in fact, those offers were refused.\n  I will come to the floor tomorrow to talk about that in more detail.\n  But the state of affairs is there are now only 20 skimmers off the \ncoast of Florida, when there were 32 last week. There are now just 20, \nwhile there are 2,000 skimmers available in the United States alone. \nThat number comes from Admiral Allen. I spoke to Admiral Allen last \nweek, along with my colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, and we \nsaid: Where are the skimmers?\n  I showed him information like I have today, which is the Deepwater \nHorizon response report from the incident command in the State of \nFlorida. Then it showed 20 skimmers. Today it still shows 20 skimmers.\n  I asked him to reconcile this for me. If we are asking for all these \nskimmers, if we are calling for all of them to come here, where are \nthey? The response is anemic at best. So today I have sent a letter to \nAdmiral Allen asking for an inventory of the 2,000 skimmers that he has \nsaid are available in the United States of America.\n  When I talked to the President and Admiral Allen about this last \nweek, they said: Look, some of these skimmers are not available because \nwe may need them for an oilspill. Well, we have an oilspill. Just \nbecause they may be required to stand on watch somewhere in case an \noilspill happens someplace else, that is like saying to the people of \nPensacola: Your home is on fire, but we can't send the fire engine \nbecause there may be a fire someplace else. It does not make any sense.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be \nprinted in the Record, as well as this report from the State of Florida \nabout the 20 skimmers off the coast of Florida.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2010.\n     Admiral Thad W. Allen,\n     Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard,\n     Washington, DC.\n       I am tremendously concerned over the lack of skimmer \n     vessels responding to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the \n     Gulf of Mexico. It is clear that we are facing a disaster of \n     unprecedented size that requires a response with an \n     unprecedented scope. As a result, every available skimming \n     resource should be responding to the Gulf to combat the \n     encroaching oil that is befouling Gulf beaches--including \n     Florida's.\n       As of June 20, there were only 20 skimmers responding to \n     the oil spill in the waters off Florida's coast, yet you have \n     stated that there are approximately 2,000 skimmers in the \n     United States alone. For Floridians, these numbers do not add \n     up.\n       I respectfully request that you provide me with a current \n     inventory of all domestic skimmer vessels, including their \n     current locations and operational responsibilities. Also, \n     please detail whether each of these skimmers has been \n     solicited by the Unified Command to assist in the ongoing oil \n     response.\n       Also, I am troubled by the apparent lack of communication \n     between the Unified Command and elected officials regarding \n     the actual location of skimmers responding in the Gulf on a \n     daily basis. As a result, I respectfully request a daily \n     update via e-mail as to the number and location of skimmers \n     throughout the Gulf region and specifically off Florida's \n     shores.\n       More and more environmental and economic damage is being \n     wrought on the Gulf with each passing day. These damages \n     should not be further exacerbated by a lack of appropriate \n     response vessels or poor communication between response \n     leaders. I appreciate your continued leadership in this \n     unprecedented effort and look forward to your prompt \n     response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                George S. LeMieux,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS21JN10.001\n     \n\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I again call for the fact that every skimmer in the \nworld that is available should be welcomed by this government. They \nshould be steaming toward the Gulf of Mexico, and we should be doing \neverything we can to make sure we are cleaning up this oil before it \ngets on our beaches, before it gets into our estuaries and our coastal \nwaterways. It is beyond belief we are not doing more. It is beyond \nbelief this administration has no sense of urgency about stopping the \noil from coming ashore.\n  I ask, Mr. President--and I will continue to come every day to the \nfloor to ask the question--where are the skimmers? Where is the help? \nWhere are the domestic skimmers? Why aren't we doing the job we should \nfor the American people to protect our beaches, our waterways, and our \nestuaries?\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I see our distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania on the Senate floor, and I know he expects to speak for a \nlittle more extended time. He has graciously allowed me to go first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5171-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ELENA KAGAN\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on the nomination \nof Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court. Of course, this vacancy is \nbeing left by the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens.\n  The President has the constitutional prerogative to nominate \nwhosoever he chooses, but it is important to recognize the Constitution \ndoes not stop there. It also provides a second constitutional \nobligation or responsibility, in this case upon the Senate, when it \ncomes to the duty of advice and consent.\n  We know there are only nine Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court and \nthat each has that job for life. It goes without saying--or it should, \nI would add--that the process in the Senate must be fair and dignified. \nI wish I could tell you it has always been that way, but I believe the \nconfirmation process of Judge Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court was \nconducted in that way, and I certainly believe so will this \nconfirmation process as well. But in addition to being fair and \ndignified, it must also be careful, thorough, and comprehensive.\n  Our job is particularly difficult because of the fact that Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan has never been a judge. She is a blank slate in that \nregard. We do not have any prior opinions to study. While that is not \nunprecedented, it is somewhat unusual for someone to come to the U.S. \nSupreme Court without ever having served as a judge. In addition, we \nknow General Kagan has practiced law only very briefly. She was an \nentry level lawyer in a Washington law firm for about 2 years and then, \nof course, last year she was chosen by the President to be Solicitor \nGeneral at the Justice Department. But that brief experience tells us \nvirtually nothing about how she would approach cases as a member of the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n\n  What we do know about Elena Kagan begins, and largely ends, with her \nresume. We know the jobs she has held. We know the positions she has \noccupied and the employers she has chosen to work for. A review of her \nresume shows us two things. First, Ms. Kagan is very smart. Her \nacademic records are impressive. Second, we know Ms. Kagan has been a \npolitical strategist for a quarter of a century, but she has never been \na judge. We know she has served extensively and repeatedly as a \npolitical operative, adviser, and a policymaker--quite a different job \nthan that she would assume should she be confirmed.\n  We know General Kagan's political causes date back to at least \ncollege, when she volunteered to help a Senate candidate in her native \nState of New York.\n  We know that after law school, she worked for two of the most \nactivist Federal judges in the 20th century, Abner Mikva and Thurgood \nMarshall. Justice Marshall often described his judicial philosophy as \n``do what you think is right.'' I wish he had mentioned something about \napplying the law, but he said to do whatever you think is right. Elena \nKagan has called Justice Marshall her judicial hero.\n  We know that Solicitor General Kagan volunteered for a time in the \nMichael Dukakis campaign for President in 1988, where she did \nopposition research.\n  We know that a few years later, Ms. Kagan advised then-Senator Joe \nBiden during the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n  We know General Kagan gave up her teaching job to work at the Clinton \nWhite House where she was a leading policy adviser on many of the hot \nbutton issues of the day. She was a deputy assistant to the President \non domestic policy. She was a deputy director of the Domestic Policy \nCouncil. During that time, she was a leading policy adviser on a number \nof controversial issues regarding abortion, gun rights, and affirmative \naction.\n  After she left the Clinton White House, Ms. Kagan's political skills \nhelped her become dean of the Harvard Law School and, by all accounts, \nshe was successful in that job as an administrator and as a fundraiser. \nThe one clear legal position she took as dean was her position against \nmilitary recruiters that the Supreme Court rejected 9 to 0.\n  Solicitor General Kagan returned to government a year ago when she \nbecame Solicitor General following the election of her friend Barack \nObama.\n  Ms. Kagan's resume shows that she is very comfortable in the world of \npolitics and political campaigns. She has worked hard as a policy and \npolitical strategist in some very intense political environments. As a \npolicy and political adviser, her record indicates she has been \nsuccessful.\n  The question raised by this nomination, though, is whether Elena \nKagan can step outside of her past role as political adviser and policy \nstrategist in order to become a Federal judge. I have had the honor of \nbeing a State court judge and I know firsthand that being a judge is \nmuch different from being a political strategist. The job of a \npolitical strategist is to help enact policies. The job of a judge is \nto apply the law wherever it takes them.\n  The goal of a political adviser is to try to win for your team. On \nthe other hand, a good judge doesn't root for or fight for a team but, \nrather, is impartial or, as sometimes stated, is disinterested in \nresults, in winners and in losers.\n  The important question is whether Solicitor General Kagan can and \nwill set aside her considerable skills as a political adviser to take \non a very different job as a neutral judge. Will she apply the law \nfairly, regardless of the politics involved? Will Solicitor General \nKagan appreciate the traditionally narrow role of a judge who must \napply the law rather than the activist role of a judge who thinks it is \nproper to make up the law? Can she make the transition from political \nstrategist to judge?\n  The hearings on Ms. Kagan's nomination are 1 week from today. I hope \nthe hearings will be a substantive and meaningful opportunity for Elena \nKagan to explain how she plans to make that shift from political \nstrategist to judge. Because she has never been a judge, the hearings \nwill be a chance to learn about what she expects her judicial \nphilosophy and approach will be.\n  Every candidate for the Supreme Court has the burden of proof to show \nthey are qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. Most nominees have a \nmuch longer record, including a record of judicial service, which could \nhelp satisfy that burden of proof, but not so in Ms. Kagan's case. \nGiven Ms. Kagan's sparse record, however, the hearings themselves must \nbe particularly substantive.\n  In 1995, then-Professor Kagan gave advice in a Law Review article to \nthe U.S. Senate on how to scrutinize a Supreme Court nominee. She wrote \nthat the ``critical inquiry'' must be ``the perspective [the nominee] \nwould add'' and ``the direction in which she would move the \ninstitution.''\n  I agree. Given Solicitor General Kagan's sparse record and her lack \nof judicial experience, it is important that the hearings be an \nopportunity to fill in the blank slate that is Elena Kagan.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5171-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5171-S5177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SEPARATION OF POWERS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to again alert \nmy\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\ncolleagues to what I consider to be a very important matter, and that \nis that the Supreme Court of the United States is materially changing \nthe traditional separation of powers and that, as a result, the \nCongress of the United States continues to lose very substantial power \nin the Federal scheme under the Constitution of the United States. This \nis a theme I have submitted over the course of the last 30 years, since \n1981, with the confirmation proceedings of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. \nAnd in now the 12th proceeding that I will personally have participated \nin, I raise this issue again to urge my colleagues to take a stand.\n  The only opportunity we have to influence the process is through the \nconfirmation of Supreme Court Justices. But we have witnessed a series \nof cases where instead of the traditional doctrine of separation of \npower, there has been a very material concentration of power which has \ngone principally through the Court and secondarily to the executive \nbranch.\n  The Framers put the Congress under Article I. It was thought at the \ntime the Constitution was adopted that Congress would be the foremost \nbranch representing the people. The executive branch is Article II, and \nthe judiciary branch is Article III. Were the Constitution to be \nwritten today, I think we would find the course inverted. But what we \nhave seen here is that recent decisions of the Supreme Court have \nabrogated the traditional deference given by the judicial branch to \nfindings of fact and the determination of public policy arising from \nwhat Congress finds in its extensive legislative hearings, with the \nCourt substituting its judgment with a variety of judicial doctrines. \nDuring the confirmation process where we examine the nominees, we \ncontinue to receive lip service about congressional authority but, once \nconfirmed, we find that the nominees have a very different attitude and \nengage in very substantial jolts to the constitutional law in effect.\n  The generalized standard for what would be the basis for upholding an \nact of Congress was articulated by Justice Harlan in Maryland v. Wirtz \nin 1968 interpreting the commerce clause, saying:\n\n       Where we find that the legislation as a rational basis for \n     finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the \n     protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end.\n\n  That is the general legislative standard which had been adopted by \nthe Court in reviewing acts of Congress until the case of City of \nBoerne v. Flores in 1997. There, the Supreme Court adopted a new \nstandard. They articulated it as congruence and proportionality, with \nthe Supreme Court of the United States reviewing the act of Congress to \ndecide whether it was congruent and proportional to what the Congress \nsought to achieve, and that entailed an analysis of the record, giving \nvery little deference to what Congress had found.\n  On its face, the standard of congruence and proportionality suggests \nthat the Court can come out anywhere it chooses. That was the view of a \nvery strong dissent by Justice Scalia in a subsequent case, where he \nsaid:\n\n       The congruence and proportionality standard, like all such \n     flabby tests, is a standing invitation to judicial \n     arbitrariness and policy-driven decisionmaking.\n\n  So that when you take a standard of that sort and undercut the \ntraditional deference to congressional fact-finding, you end up with \nthe Court making law instead of interpreting law. Under that decision, \nwe have seen a whole torrent of Supreme Court decisions declaring acts \nof Congress unconstitutional. Illustrative are the Morrison case, \ninvolving the Violence Against Women Act, the Garrett case under the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act, and repeatedly the issue was undercut.\n  As a result, in the confirmation hearings, many of us--this Senator \nincluded--sought to establish an understanding of a nominee's approach \nto giving the deference to congressional findings. Illustratively--and \nI have spoken on this subject before--Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \nAlito used all the right language, but when we find the application of \nthe language, they have done a reverse course. Justice Roberts spoke \neloquently about the need for modesty and for the Court not to jolt the \nsystem, but to follow stare decisis. With respect to fact-finding, this \nis what Chief Justice Roberts had to say in his confirmation hearing:\n\n       I appreciate very much the differences in institutional \n     competence between the judiciary and the Congress when it \n     comes to basic questions of fact finding, development of a \n     record, and also the authority to make the policy decisions \n     about how to act on the basis of a particular record. It's \n     not just disagreement over a record. It's a question of whose \n     job it is to make a determination based on the record. . . . \n     [A]s a judge, you may be beginning to transgress into the \n     area of making a law . . . when you are in a position of re-\n     evaluating legislative findings, because that doesn't look \n     like a judicial function.\n\n  So there you have a very flat statement by the nominee saying that it \nis not the Court's role to transgress into the area of lawmaking, which \nis what does happen in reevaluating legislative findings.\n  Justice Alito said about the same thing. This is his testimony in his \nconfirmation hearing:\n\n       I think that the judiciary should have great respect for \n     findings of fact that are made by Congress. The judiciary is \n     not equipped at all to make findings about what is going on \n     in the real world--not these sort of legislative findings. \n     And Congress, of course, is in the best position to do that. \n     Congress can have hearings and examine complex social issues, \n     receive statistical data, hear testimony from experts, \n     analyze that and synthesize that, and reduce that to \n     findings. And when Congress makes findings on questions that \n     have a bearing on the constitutionality of legislation, I \n     think they are entitled to great respect.\n\n  The decision in Citizens United found the Court reversing recent \ndecisions in the Austin and McConnell cases. Instead of giving the \ndeference to the congressional findings, which was articulated by Chief \nJustice Roberts and Justice Alito, they did an about-face.\n  In raising this consideration, I do not challenge the good faith of \nChief Justice Roberts or Justice Alito. I recognize and acknowledge the \ndifference between testifying in a confirmation hearing and what \nhappens during the course of a decision when deciding a specific case \nin controversy. But when we take a look at what happened in Citizens \nUnited--and again, this is a matter of the illustration--we have the \nenormous record that was created by the Congress in enacting McCain-\nFeingold and the findings of fact there to support what the Congress \ndid, which was invalidated by the Supreme Court of the United States in \nCitizens United, which upset 100 years of precedent in allowing \ncorporations to engage in political advertising.\n  The scope and detail of the congressional findings were outlined by \nJustice Stevens in his dissenting opinion in Citizens United. The \nstatement of facts by Justice Stevens on commenting on the record is \nnot a matter of disagreeing on opinions. People are entitled to their \nown opinions but not to their own facts, as has been reiterated so \nfrequently. This is what Justice Stevens noted on the congressional \nfact-finding:\n\n       Congress crafted in the McCain-Feingold legislation ``in \n     response to a virtual mountain of research on the corruption \n     that previous legislation failed to avert.'' The Court now \n     negates Congress's efforts without a shred of evidence on how \n     section 203 or its State law counterparts have been affecting \n     any entity other than Citizens United.\n\n  Justice Stevens said this to emphasize not only that the Court's \nholding ran counter to outstanding congressional judgment but also \n``the common sense of the American people,'' who have recognized a need \nto prevent corruption from undermining self governing since the \nfounding and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting \npotential of corrupt electioneering since the days of Theodore \nRoosevelt.\n  Justice Stevens went on to point out that the record compiled in the \ncontext of the congressional legislation was more than 100,000 pages \nlong. He noted that judicial deference is particularly warranted, \nwhereas here we deal with the congressional judgment that has remained \nessentially unchanged throughout a century of legislative adjustment.\n  Now, as a result of what happened in Citizens United, we found that, \nillustratively, Chief Justice Roberts did substantially differently \nwhen on the Court in contrast with what he did in his confirmation \nhearing. In the confirmation hearing, Chief Justice Roberts did \nacknowledge that the act was a product of an ``extraordinarily \nextensive legislative record.''\n  ``My reading of the Court's opinion,'' Chief Justice Roberts went on, \n``is that\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\nwas the case where the Court's decision was driven in large part by the \nrecord that had been compiled by Congress. The determination there was \nbased on the extensive record carrying a lot of weight with the \njustices.''\n  The matter was particularly problemsome. As Justice Stevens noted:\n\n       The Congress relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court \n     in the Austin case.\n\n  Stevens noted that overruling Austin was especially significant \nbecause Congress had specifically relied on that decision in drafting \nthe McCain-Feingold Act.\n  So essentially what you have here is relatively recent decisions by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States in Austin and McConnell. You \nhave a very extensive congressional record, which sets forth the \nfactors about the need to avoid corrupt practices and electioneering \nbrought about by money and, beyond the actual corrupt practices, the \nappearance of corruption, and the legislative effort to set this kind \nof a factual basis. And you have Justices in confirmation hearings \ncommitting to respecting and being deferential to congressional \nfindings. But when the decision comes, 100 years of precedent is \noverturned. You don't have a modest decision; you have a decision which \njolts the system.\n  It is a difficult matter where we proceed candidly as to where we go \nbeyond getting the most positive assurances we can from the nominees. I \nsuggest to my colleagues that when we begin the confirmation process \nwith Solicitor General Kagan next week, this should be a focus of \nattention because what is happening is that the power of Congress is \nbeing diluted. If you have legislative findings that go for 100,000 \npages and then you have Justices who have under oath said that they \nwill give deference to congressional findings; you have Congress \nenacting the McCain-Feingold law based upon the standards set by the \nSupreme Court of the United States in the Austin case; you have the \nrelatively recent precedents of Austin and McConnell, for instance, the \nFederal Election Commission; and then you have a case like Citizens \nUnited coming down, that ought to be a sharp focus of attention.\n  My sense is that the reality is that this body and our counterpart \nacross the Rotunda pay relatively little attention to what the Supreme \nCourt of the United States does. They have the final say. It is often \nnoted that they are right only because they are final. When we have an \nopportunity, through the confirmation process, to focus on these \nissues, I suggest to my colleagues that it is high time we do so.\n  There is a second area where the authority of Congress has been very \nmaterially undermined. It has been where the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States declines to decide cases. We have a situation where the \nCourt hears and decides relatively few cases. This is against the \nbackdrop where, historically, the Supreme Court of the United States \ndecided many more cases. Going back to 1886, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States had on its docket 1,396 cases and decided 451 cases. In \n1987, the Supreme Court issued 146 majority opinions. In 2006, less \nthan 20 years later, the Supreme Court heard arguments in only 78 cases \nand handed down opinions in only 68 cases. A year later, 2007, the \nSupreme Court heard arguments in 75 cases and handed down opinions in \nonly 67 cases. In 2008, arguments in 78 cases, decisions in 65 cases. \nThis is in a context where Chief Justice Roberts testified in his \nconfirmation hearing that he thought the Court ought to hear more \ncases.\n  In a letter I will submit for the Record, there is a detailing of the \ntremendous number of important circuit splits where the Supreme Court \nof the United States does not decide which circuit is correct or you \nhave one circuit deciding a case one way or another circuit deciding a \ncase another way, and then the situation arises in yet a third circuit, \nand there is no guiding precedent. There is confusion, and I suggest \nthat the Court really has the duty to take up these circuit splits and \nmake a definitive decision so that the law is clarified, so that \nlitigants and lawyers can know where the law stands on a specific case. \nStated simply and directly, the Court is not too busy to take up these \ncircuit splits.\n  There are other major cases where the Court declines to hear cases, \nwhich I respectfully submit that the Court ought to hear. Illustrative \nof one of the major constitutional conflicts in the history of the \nUnited States has been the controversy over warrantless wiretaps. You \nhave the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which in very \nemphatic terms says the exclusive way a wiretap may be obtained would \nbe through a warrant, where the Federal investigative authorities filed \nan affidavit of probable cause with a Federal judge or a Federal \nmagistrate, and only after that permission is granted may the wiretap \nbe activated. That is to protect the very basis of privacy and the very \nstrong interdiction of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, \nwhich prohibits unreasonable search and seizure.\n\n  It has been 5 years since it was disclosed that the executive branch, \nunder the so-called Terrorist Surveillance Program, was undertaking \nwarrantless wiretapping. The activity was being undertaken under the \ncontention that the President had power as Commander-in-Chief, \nexecutive authority under Article II to disregard the act of Congress.\n  It is standard hornbook law. The Congress cannot legislate in \nviolation of the Constitution. But if, in fact, the President of the \nUnited States, under certain circumstances, has the authority as \nCommander-in-Chief to engage in conduct, Congress may not proscribe it, \nmay not eliminate it, may not limit the power of the President that the \nPresident has under constitutional authority.\n  But 5 years have passed and there has been no decision in the case. A \nFederal district court judge in Detroit declared the act \nunconstitutional. The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the \nSixth Circuit, and in a 2-to-1 decision the court decided that there \nwas no standing, which is a popular doctrine for declining to hear a \ncase and ducking the issue.\n  I believe any fair analysis of the opinion of the court of the \ndissenting opinion gave much additional weight to the dissenters or, in \nany event, a very close question, one of paramount importance that \nought to have been decided by the Sixth Circuit.\n  The case was then taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, \nwhich denied certiorari. Those issues are still very much in play.\n  In a case in the U.S. district court in San Francisco, Judge Vaughn \nWalker has declared the act unconstitutional. It is questionable \nwhether that is a final ruling in the case. But the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, with as many law clerks as they have--four and five \neach; many more than they have had in earlier days--and with the very \nlight docket they have, there is no reason that a case such as the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program should not be adjudicated by the Supreme \nCourt so we would know what the law was on that subject.\n  Another case which I have spoken about on the floor of the Senate \ninvolves the litigation brought by survivors of the September 11 \nattacks on the United States where some 3,000 people were killed. A \nlawsuit was begun to get damages from the Government of Saudi Arabia, \nfrom five Saudi princes, from a Saudi charitable organization which was \nan instrumentality of the government, and other defendants.\n  The Congress of the United States in the sovereign immunity law \nspecifically decided that the sovereign should not have immunity in any \ncase where there was a domestic tort involved, such as the conduct \ninvolved in 9/11.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided the legislation \ndid not apply because it applied only in situations where a nation had \nbeen declared a terrorist state. That exception is nowhere in the \nstatute. It had no place in the decision.\n  When application was made for certiorari to have the case considered \nby the Supreme Court, the Solicitor General's Office, headed by \nSolicitor General Kagan, took the position that the Second Circuit was \nwrong but urged the Court not to take the case on the ground that there \nwere important foreign policy questions involved. Solicitor General \nKagan took the position that where no acts occurred within the United \nStates, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act did not apply.\n  Again, this reading was pulled literally out of thin air. Nothing in \nlegislative history or background would\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\nsuggest that the victims of 9/11 ought not have a case against the \nGovernment of Saudi Arabia and the princes and the charitable \norganization, an instrumentality of the state. Under those \ncircumstances, no distinction between the acts occurred, but there was \nplenty of repercussion and plenty of consequence from that tortious \nconduct when America was attacked. Here the Supreme Court of the United \nStates has denied to hear the case, which leaves the Congress \nsubservient to the executive branch.\n  The business about being deferential to foreign powers, in my \njudgment, is not an adequate basis for disregarding the legitimate \nclaims of the people who were killed on 9/11, not sufficient to \ndisregard the congressional enactment which held that there ought not \nto be sovereign immunity where there is tortious conduct involved; that \nthe doctrine of sovereign immunity ought to apply to commercial \ntransactions but not to conduct such as was evidenced on 9/11.\n  Again, we have as an adjunct of what happens when the Court \ndisregards congressional findings. You have the action of the Court in \ndeclining to hear cases such as the Terrorist Surveillance Program, \nsuch as the litigation brought by the survivors of the victims of 9/11 \nwhere the authority of Congress is materially undercut.\n  There has been other action taken by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. It is hard to pick the description which is sufficiently \nforceful, whether it is surprising or whether it is astounding. But \nlitigation was brought in a case captioned McComish v. Bennett where \nthe district court in Arizona held that Arizona's Citizens Clean \nElections Act was unconstitutional.\n  In that case, the State of Arizona had decided to provide for \nmatching funds in order to deal with the problems of campaign \nfinancing, trying to deal with the issues of corrupting influence of \nmoney, both the fact of corruption and the appearance of corruption.\n  I am not going to take the time now to go through the long list of \ncases where Members of Congress have been convicted of illegal campaign \ncontributions which rose to the level of being a quid pro quo and a \nbribe. But the Federal district court in Arizona said the Arizona \nlegislation, captioned the Citizens Clean Elections Act, was not \nsupported by a compelling State interest, not narrowly tailored, and \nnot the least restrictive alternative and, therefore, was \nunconstitutional under the First Amendment.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed saying there was \nan ample record to support the legislative enactment.\n  On June 1 of this year, 20 days ago, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates denied an application to vacate the stay. The Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit had stayed the decision of the district court so \nthat the Arizona elections could go forward pursuant to the Arizona \nCitizens Clean Elections Act.\n  When the Ninth Circuit heard the case, the Ninth Circuit issued a \nstay that stopped the carrying out of the district court decision on \nunconstitutionality so that the elections in Arizona this year could \nproceed under that act. The losing parties in the Ninth Circuit \ndecision then applied to the Supreme Court to eliminate the stay so the \ndistrict court opinion would remain in effect.\n  The Supreme Court, on June 1, denied the application to vacate the \nstay ``without prejudice to a renewed application if the parties \nrepresent that they intend to file a timely petition for a writ of \ncertiorari.''\n  A week later, the Court reversed course and granted the application \nto vacate the stay on the district court's injunction ``pending filing \nand disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari.''\n  This is complex legalese, but what it does is reinstate the \nconclusion of the Federal district court in Arizona that the Arizona \nlaw is unconstitutional and may not be enforced.\n  It is a little hard to fathom how the Court can do that without even \nthe filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari.\n  What we essentially have is the Supreme Court was deciding the \nArizona case without the submission of a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari, without following the rules of the Supreme Court for the \nfiling of briefs, or without an argument before a decision was made. It \nhas all the earmarks of a flagrant denial of due process of law.\n  It is true technically that the Supreme Court may reverse and remand \nand enter judgment as they choose. But in a contest where the \nprocedures are established, in case after case the practice of the \nCourt--you want to have the Supreme Court of the United States review a \ncase? File a petition for writ of certiorari. Then you have to prepare \na brief, then you appear before the Court for argument, and then the \nCourt makes a determination, after hearing the case, what ought to be \ndone.\n  Here we have the Arizona elections disrupted by a conclusion of the \nSupreme Court of the United States. It is not even a judgment. It is a \nreinstatement of a stay.\n  We have the Supreme Court of the United States today on issues of \nenormous importance--the election of Federal, State, and local \nofficials, an Arizona law trying to deal in a sensible way with the \nproblems of having candidates spend so much of their time on \nelectioneering. A recent study showed those of us in Congress spent \nabout 25 percent of our time on raising money. I think that is a fairly \nrealistic estimate. I think I saw an affirmative nod from the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Virginia.\n  I would say that is not much off the mark from my own experiences. My \nfirst campaign cost less than $2 million, and the last campaign cost \nsome $23 million. We all have offices away from our office so we comply \nwith the law which prohibits us from making telephone calls to raise \nmoney or undertaking any of it on Federal property. It takes a lot of \ntime.\n  We have a number of former Members of Congress who are in jail today \nacross this land, and we have a lot of public skepticism about the \ninfluence of money on congressional decisions. We had eight Members of \nthe House of Representatives in one of the Hill newspapers last week \nabout an investigation of a House Ethics Committee where there was an \nappearance of some issue where votes were changed in the wake of \ncampaign contributions.\n  Here we have the Supreme Court eliminating the Arizona law without \neven having a hearing in the case but reinstating the stay. That is a \nsubject I intend to ask Nominee Kagan about next week.\n  I have submitted a series of letters to Solicitor General Kagan, one \ndated May 25, one dated June 15, and I am sending another one today, \nand I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full text \nof these letters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2010.\n     Hon. Elena Kagan,\n     Solicitor General of the U.S.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Solicitor General Kagan: At our meeting on February 4, \n     2009, your confirmation for Solicitor General was pending \n     before the Senate. We discussed, among other things, two \n     cases that raise important questions about Executive-branch \n     incursions on Congress's law-making powers with respect to \n     the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts: Weiss v. \n     Assicurazioni Generali, S.P.A. (hereafter Generali), 529 F.3d \n     113 (2d Cir. 2010), and In re Terrorist Attacks on September \n     11, 2001, 538 F.3d 71 (2d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. \n     Ct. 2859 (2009) (hereafter 9/11 Litigation). I write to \n     notify you of the topics I intend to cover at your upcoming \n     confirmation hearing with respect to these and related cases.\n\n\n                     Holocaust Litigation (Generali)\n\n       This litigation was brought by victims of the Holocaust and \n     their heirs to recover on unpaid World War II-era insurance \n     policies issued by an Italian insurance company. Just a few \n     months ago, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \n     Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims on \n     the ground that they were preempted by an Executive-branch \n     foreign policy favoring the resolution of such claims through \n     an international commission. The Second Circuit did so in \n     reliance on the Supreme Court's decision in American \n     Insurance Association v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396 (2003). \n     There the Court held that this policy, though not formalized \n     in an executive agreement or treaty, preempted a state law \n     requiring insurers to disclose information about certain \n     Holocaust-era insurance policies. The Court relied on cases \n     addressing the preemptive effect of executive agreements \n     purporting to settle claims of private litigants in federal \n     courts. A post-Garamendi development of\n\n[[Page S5175]]\n\n     note is the Court's decision in Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. \n     491 (2008), where the Chief Justice suggested that the \n     executive branch could settle claims by executive agreement \n     only in the face of acquiescence by Congress.\n       I intend to ask you, among other questions:\n       (1) whether you understand the Supreme Court's case law to \n     require a finding of Congressional acquiescence as a \n     condition of giving preemptive effect to an executive \n     agreement;\n       (2) whether you agree with Justice Ginsburg's dissenting \n     opinion in Garamendi (joined by Justices Stevens, Scalia and \n     Thomas) that an Executive-branch foreign policy not \n     formalized in a treaty or an executive agreement cannot \n     preempt state law; and\n       (3) what considerations you would bring to bear in deciding \n     whether to vote to grant certiorari in this case, if \n     confirmed. (My office has been advised that a petition for \n     certiorari will be filed soon.)\n\n\n                            9/11 Litigation\n\n       This litigation was brought by over 6,000 victims of the \n     September 11 terrorist attacks against, among other \n     defendants, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and five Saudi \n     princes. The plaintiffs pleaded various claims arising from \n     their allegation that the defendants financed the attacks. \n     None of these defendants, though, ever had to defend the case \n     on the merits. The United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Second Circuit ruled that they were immune from suit under \n     the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). The plaintiffs \n     petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari. You filed a \n     brief on behalf of the United States urging the Supreme Court \n     to deny the petition. The New York Times reported that your \n     filing came less than a week before President Obama's trip to \n     the Middle East to meet with Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah. \n     See Eric Lichtblau, ``Justice Department Backs Saudi Royal \n     Family on 9/11 Lawsuit,'' New York Times, May 30, 2009. The \n     Court denied the petition.\n       One of the two key questions in the petition was whether, \n     as the Second Circuit had held, the FSIA addressed the \n     immunity of the Saudi officials. There is, as you \n     acknowledged in your brief, a circuit split on the question: \n     Some circuits have concluded that the FSIA governs the \n     immunity of foreign officials, as distinct from foreign \n     states. Others have concluded that their immunity is governed \n     by non-statutory principles articulated by the Executive \n     branch. The United States argued that the split was not \n     worthy of the Court's review because the ``disagreement \n     appears to be of little practical consequence.'' In earlier \n     cases, however, the United States argued repeatedly that the \n     distinction is indeed of practical consequence in numerous \n     respects. And you have since filed a brief on behalf of the \n     United States in Samantar v. Yousuf (No. 08-1555) urging the \n     Court to hold that the FSIA does not displace ``principles \n     adopted by the Executive branch'' governing the immunity of \n     foreign officials.\n       The second of the questions raised was whether the \n     defendants could be sued under the FSIA's domestic tort \n     exception. That exception permits suits against sovereigns \n     arising from injuries ``occurring in the United States and \n     caused by the tortuous act or omission of the foreign \n     state.'' 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(5). You argued in your brief that \n     the exception did not apply.\n       I intend to ask you, among other questions:\n       (1) whether you would have voted to grant certiorari in the \n     9/11 Litigation had you been sitting on the Court;\n       (2) whether the United States may have placed diplomatic \n     concerns above the rights of 9/11 victims in urging the Court \n     not to grant certiorari;\n       (3) whether the FSIA governs all questions of sovereign \n     immunity in the federal courts; and\n       (4) whether you believe that the FSIA's tort exception \n     should have been interpreted to confer immunity on the \n     defendants.\n       At our meeting on May 13, 2010, when we discussed your \n     confirmation for the Supreme Court, we discussed, among other \n     things, the constitutionality of the Terrorist Surveillance \n     Program (TSP), which brought into sharp conflict Congress's \n     authority under Article I to establish the `exclusive means' \n     for wiretaps under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n     with the President's authority under Article II as Commander-\n     in-Chief to order warrantless wiretaps.\n       The TSP operated secretly from shortly after 9/11 until a \n     New York Times article detailed the program in December 2005. \n     In August 2006, the United States District Court for the \n     Eastern District of Michigan found the program \n     unconstitutional. In July 2007, the Sixth Circuit reversed 2-\n     1, finding lack of standing. The Supreme Court then denied \n     certiorari.\n       The dissenting opinion in the Sixth Circuit demonstrated \n     the flexibility of the standing requirement to provide the \n     basis for a decision on the merits. As Judge Gilman noted, \n     ``the attorney-plaintiffs in the present case allege that the \n     government is listening in on private person-to-person \n     communications that are not open to the public. These are \n     communications that any reasonable person would understand to \n     be private.'' After analyzing the standing inquiry under a \n     recent Supreme Court decision, Judge Gilman would have held \n     that ``[the attorney-plaintiffs have thus identified concrete \n     harms to themselves flowing from their reasonable fear that \n     the TSP will intercept privileged communications between \n     themselves and their clients.''\n       I intend to ask you, among other questions, whether you \n     would have voted to grant certiorari in this case had you \n     been on the Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2010.\n     Hon. Elena Kagan,\n     Solicitor General of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Solicitor General Kagan: By letter dated May 25, 2010, \n     I identified three subjects that I intend to cover at your \n     confirmation hearing. I write to identify four additional \n     subjects that I intend to cover.\n     The Supreme Court's workload\n       The Supreme Court's workload has steadily declined. In \n     1870, the Court decided 280 of the 636 cases on its docket; \n     in 1880, 365 of the 1,202 cases on its docket; and in 1886, \n     451 of the 1,396 cases on its docket. In 1926, the year \n     Congress gave the Court nearly complete control of its docket \n     by passing the Judiciary Act of 1925, the Court issued 223 \n     signed opinions. The Court's output has declined \n     significantly ever since. In the first year of the Rehnquist \n     Court, the Court issued 146 opinions; in its last year, it \n     issued only 74.\n       Chief Justice Rehnquist's successor, John Roberts, \n     testified during his confirmation hearing that the Court \n     could and should take additional cases. But the Court has not \n     done so. During the 2005 Term, it heard argument in 87 cases \n     and issued 69 signed opinions; during the 2006 Term, it heard \n     argument in 78 cases and issued 68 signed opinions; during \n     the 2007 Term, it heard argument in 75 cases and issued 67 \n     signed opinions; and during the 2008 Term, the Court heard \n     argument in 78 cases and issued 75 signed opinions. The \n     figures for the pending 2009 term will likely be in accord.\n       The Court continues to leave important issues unresolved. \n     They include, as noted in my May 25 letter, the \n     constitutionality of the Bush administration Terrorist \n     Surveillance Program (TSP) and the contours of the Foreign \n     Sovereign Immunity Act's domestic tort exception as applied \n     to acts of terrorism.\n       Equally significant are unresolved circuit splits. Two \n     prominent academic commentators note that the Roberts Court \n     ``is unable to address even half'' of the circuit splits \n     ``identified by litigants.'' Tracey E. George & Christopher \n     Guthrie, Remaking the United States Supreme Court in the \n     Courts' of Appeals Image, 58 Duke L.J. 1439, 1449 (2009). \n     Questions on which the circuits have split include: May \n     jurors consult the Bible during their deliberations in a \n     criminal case and, if so, under what circumstances? Must a \n     civil lawsuit predicated on a ``state secret'' be dismissed? \n     When may a federal agency withhold information in response to \n     a FOIA request or subpoena on the ground that it would \n     disclose the agency's ``internal deliberations''? Do federal \n     district courts have jurisdiction over petitions to expunge \n     criminal records?\n       I intend to ask you, among other questions:\n       (1) Whether you agree with the Chief Justice Roberts's \n     statement at his confirmation hearing that the ``Court could \n     contribute more to clarity and uniformity of the law by \n     taking more cases;''\n       (2) Whether the Court has the capacity to hear \n     substantially more cases than it has in recent years;\n       (3) Whether you favor reducing the number of Justices \n     required to grant petitions for certiorari in cases involving \n     circuit splits or otherwise; and\n       (4) Whether, if you are confirmed, you will join the \n     Court's cert. pool or follow the practice of Justice Stevens \n     (and the Justice for whom you clerked, Justice Thurgood \n     Marshall) in reviewing petitions for certiorari yourself with \n     the assistance of your law clerks?\n     Deference to Congressional factfinding in reviewing the \n         constitutionality of federal legislation\n       The constitutionality of federal legislation often turns on \n     how much deference the Supreme Court gives to justificatory \n     factual findings made by Congress. Recent nominees to the \n     Court have emphasized that such findings are entitled to \n     substantial deference. Chief Justice Roberts was especially \n     emphatic on the point. He even testified that when a judge \n     finds himself ``in a position of re-evaluating legislative \n     findings,'' he or she ``may be beginning to transgress into \n     an area of making law. . . .''\n       In too many cases during the last decade, however, the \n     Court has disregarded Congressional findings of fact to an \n     unprecedented degree. The most recent example was Citizens \n     United v. Federal Election Commission, 130 S. Ct. 876 (2010), \n     where in striking down the federal ban on independent \n     campaign expenditures by corporations, the Court disregarded \n     what Justice Stevens called in dissent a ``virtual mountain \n     of evidence'' assembled by Congress establishing the \n     corrupting influence of such contributions on the political \n     process. And the Court did so, again in Justice Stevens' \n     words, ``without a shred of evidence'' as to how the \n     challenged provision ``have been affecting any entity'' other \n     than the petitioner in the case.\n       The Court's disregard of Congressional factfinding has been \n     especially pronounced in cases striking down laws enacted to \n     remediate civil rights violations (whether under\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\n     the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n     Constitution). These included two cases about which I have \n     questioned prior nominees to the Court: (1) United States v. \n     Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), which struck the provision of \n     the Violence Against Women Act providing a federal civil \n     remedy for victims of sex-based violence, despite \n     Congress's well-documented findings of relevant \n     constitutional violations nationwide; and (2) Board of \n     Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. \n     356 (2001), which struck the provision of the Americans \n     With Disabilities Act prohibiting disability-based \n     discrimination in employment by states, despite Congress's \n     compilation (in the dissenter's words) of ``a vast \n     legislative record,'' based on task force hearings \n     attended by more than 30,000 people, ``documenting \n     `massive, society-wide discrimination' against persons \n     with disabilities.'' As I noted in pre-confirmation-\n     hearing letters to Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \n     Sotomayor, the Court in Morrison even went out of its way \n     to disparage Congress's fact-finding competency. Justice \n     Souter noted in a dissent joined by three other Justices \n     that the Court had departed from its longstanding practice \n     of assessing no more than the ``rationality of the \n     congressional [factual] conclusion[s].''\n       Chief Justice Roberts's statements during oral argument in \n     Northwest Austin Municipal District v. Holder, 129 S. Ct. \n     2504 (2009), may portend even worse things to come. The case \n     concerned the constitutionality of a key section of the \n     Voting Rights Act that Congress extended (by a Senate vote of \n     98 to 0) for another 25 years during my chairmanship of the \n     Judiciary Committee. Ultimately the Court avoided the \n     constitutional question in Northwest Austin by deciding the \n     case on narrow statutory grounds. But during oral argument, \n     Chief Justice Roberts called into question the validity of \n     Congress's legislative findings as to the need for the \n     reauthorization. He said that, in extending the Act, \n     ``Congress was sweeping far more broadly than they need to.''\n       I intend to ask you, among other questions, whether you \n     think that the Court has been sufficiently deferential to \n     Congressional factfinding and whether you would go about \n     analyzing the sufficiency of the record underlying the \n     reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.\n     Television coverage of the Supreme Court\n       Although the public has the undisputed right to observe the \n     Court's proceedings, few Americans have any meaningful \n     opportunity to do so. Even those who are able to visit the \n     Court are not likely to see an argument in full. There are \n     not nearly enough seats. Most will be given just three \n     minutes to watch before they are shuffled out to make room \n     for others. In high-profile cases, most visitors will be \n     denied even a three-minute seating. As Justice Stevens \n     observed during an interview, ``literally thousands of people \n     have stood in line for hours in order to attend an oral \n     argument, only to be denied admission because the courtroom \n     was filled.'' Those who wish to follow the Court's \n     proceedings must content themselves with reading the \n     voluminous transcripts or listening to audiotapes released at \n     the end of the Court's term. (The Court regularly denies, \n     without explanation, requests to release the audiotapes of \n     oral argument on a same-day basis.) It should come as no \n     surprise that, according to a recent poll taken by C-SPAN, \n     nearly two-thirds of Americans favor television coverage of \n     the Supreme Court's proceedings.\n       In April 2010, the Senate Committee favorably reported both \n     my resolution (S. Res. 339) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the Court should permit television coverage and \n     my legislation (S. 446) requiring it to allow coverage. In \n     the last two Congresses, the Committee favorably reported \n     nearly identical legislation (S. 1768 in the 109th Congress \n     and S. 344 in the 110th Congress) that I introduced.\n       Statements made by the current Justices indicate that a \n     majority of them--Chief Justice Roberts, Justices Stevens, \n     Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor--are favorably \n     disposed toward allowing coverage or at least have an open \n     mind on the matter. Justice Stevens, whom you would replace, \n     has said that allowing cameras in the Supreme Court is \n     ``worth a try.''\n       Your past statements suggest that you are a proponent of \n     coverage. Soon after becoming Solicitor General, you told the \n     Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference that ``if cameras were in \n     the courtroom, the American public would see an extraordinary \n     event. . . . When C-SPAN first came on, they put cameras in \n     legislative chambers. And it was clear that nobody was there. \n     I think if you put cameras in the courtroom, people would \n     say, `wow.' They would see their government working at a \n     really high level--at a really high level. That is one \n     argument for doing so.''\n       I intend to ask you whether, if confirmed, you will support \n     television coverage and, if you will, whether you will try to \n     persuade your reluctant colleagues to do likewise.\n     Constitutionality of regulation of campaign finance\n       In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 130 S. \n     Ct. 876 (2010), the Supreme Court held unconstitutional \n     provisions of federal law prohibiting corporations and unions \n     from making certain independent campaign expenditures in \n     support of candidates for federal office, thereby putting \n     corporations on the same footing as individuals (including \n     citizens). Some organizations opposed to campaign-finance \n     reform have heralded Citizens United as the beginning of the \n     end of campaign finance regulation. The next step, according \n     to the policy briefs of these organizations, is to challenge \n     the prohibition on corporate campaign contributions and, in \n     doing, attempt to eliminate the remaining case-law \n     distinctions between the speech rights of individual natural \n     persons and of corporations. Under existing federal law, \n     corporations may not make campaign contributions. (They may \n     do so only through tightly regulated PACs.) The Supreme Court \n     has upheld this restriction against First Amendment \n     challenge.\n       Some organizations have even advocated an end to limits on \n     campaign contributions--as distinct from campaign-related \n     expenditures--by individuals. In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 \n     (1976), the Supreme Court upheld limits on contributions by \n     individuals, even as it struck down a provision of federal \n     law prohibiting independent expenditures in support of \n     candidates for office. The Court accepted Congress's finding \n     that allowing ``large individual financial contributions'' \n     threatens to corrupt the political process and undermine \n     public confidence in it. Buckley's holding on this point has \n     been well-settled law for nearly 35 years.\n       I intend to ask you, among other questions:\n       (1) Whether, under First Amendment law, there remains \n     anything left of the distinction between contributions from a \n     corporation and those from natural persons.\n       (2) What considerations would you bring to bear in deciding \n     whether to overrule the portion of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. \n     1 (1976), upholding limits on campaign contributions by \n     individuals?\n       Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 21, 2010.\n     Hon. Elena Kagan,\n     Solicitor General of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Solicitor General Kagan: By letters dated May 25, \n     2010, and June 15, 2010, I identified several subjects I \n     intend to cover at your nomination hearing. I write to \n     identify in advance an additional subject that I intend to \n     cover.\n     Constitutionality of State Provisions for Publicly Financed \n         Campaign Matching Funds\n       In the wake of Davis v. FEC, _ U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 876 \n     (2008), a district court in Arizona struck down that state's \n     provision, passed by popular voter referendum, to trigger \n     matching public funds when a candidate's opponent expended \n     certain threshold amounts in a primary election. In McComish \n     v. Brewer, 2010 WL 2292213, *1 (D. Ariz. 2010), the district \n     court held that Arizona's ``Citizens Clean Elections Act'' \n     was not supported by a compelling state interest, was not \n     narrowly tailored, and was not the least restrictive \n     alternative. Hence, the district court held the Act was \n     ``unconstitutional under the First Amendment.'' Id. at 10.\n       The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. In \n     McComish v. Bennett, 605 F.3d 720 (9th Cir. 2010), the \n     intermediate appellate court wrote, ``Plaintiffs bemoan that \n     matching funds deny them a competitive advantage in \n     elections. The essence of this claim is not that they have \n     been silenced, but that the speech of their opponents has \n     been enabled.'' The court noted that ``the burden that \n     Plaintiffs allege is merely a theoretical chilling effect on \n     donors who might dislike the statutory result of making a \n     contribution or candidates who may seek a tactical advantage \n     related to the release or timing of matching funds.'' \n     Describing this burden as ``minimal,'' the court applied \n     intermediate scrutiny to the Act. Thereafter, the court \n     considered whether Arizona's interest ``in eradicating the \n     appearance of quid pro quo corruption to restore the \n     electorate's confidence in its system of government'' was \n     compelling. Quoting the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley \n     v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 96 (1976) the Ninth Circuit recalled \n     that ``[i]t cannot be gainsaid that public financing as a \n     means of eliminating the improper influence of large private \n     contributions furthers a significant governmental interest.''\n       On June 1, 2010, the Supreme Court denied the application \n     to vacate the stay ``without prejudice to a renewed \n     application if the parties represent that they intend to file \n     a timely petition for writ of certiorari'' to the Court. _ \n     S.Ct. _, 2010 WL 2161754 (Jun 1, 2010). A week later, the \n     Court reversed course and granted the application to vacate \n     the stay on the District Court's injunction ``pending filing \n     and disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari.'' _ \n     S.Ct. _, 2010 WL 2265319 (Jun 8, 2010). The practical effect \n     of the Supreme Court vacating the appellate court's stay of \n     the district court's injunction is that Arizona's Citizens \n     Clean Elections Act is, for present purposes, struck down and \n     participating candidates are not going to receive matching \n     funds even if their opponents exceed the triggering \n     expenditures.\n       I intend to ask you, among other questions:\n       (1) Whether you would have voted to vacate the stay pending \n     disposition of a petition for certiorari, as five justices \n     appear to have voted in McComish v. Bennett; and\n       (2) Whether you think that reducing the appearance or \n     reality of quid pro quo corruption serves a compelling state \n     interest.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a good bit of the substance of the \nquestions\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\nwhich I have been directing toward Solicitor General Kagan involves the \nquestion as to whether she would have voted to grant cert. I believe \nthat is an appropriate question, whether she would agree that a case \nought to be heard. There is a view that questions ought not to be asked \nas to what a nominee would do once a case is pending before the Court. \nI think even that doctrine has some limitations. I think cases such as \nBrown v. Board of Education, cases such as McCulloch v. Maryland, cases \nwhich are well established in the law of the land, ought to be the \nsubject for commitment. But I think there is no doubt--in my opinion, \nthere is no doubt--we should ask her whether she would take a case such \nas the Terrorist Surveillance Program, or a case such as the litigation \ninvolving the claims brought by the survivors of victims of 9/11.\n  The hearings next week on Solicitor General Kagan will give us an \nopportunity to move deeply into a great many of these important \nsubjects. While it is true that in many instances we do not get a great \ndeal of information from the nominees, I think the hearings are very \nimportant to inform the public as to what goes on with the Court. This \nis in line with the efforts which I have made to provide for \nlegislation which would call for televising the Supreme Court. The \nJudiciary Committee has twice passed out of committee, by significant \nvotes--once 12 to 6 and once 13 to 6--legislation which would call for \nthe Supreme Court to be televised.\n  The Congress of the United States has the authority to make \ndirectives on administrative matters--things such as how many Justices \nconstitute a quorum, when they begin their term, how many members there \nare of the Supreme Court. Congress has the authority to mandate what \ncases the Supreme Court will hear, and--in the cases which I intend to \nask Solicitor General Kagan, such as the terrorist surveillance \nprogram--whether she would have granted cert.\n  There are underlying concerns, which I have raised today, of a \ncertain disrespect which characterizes a good many of the Supreme Court \nopinions. For example, the opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist in \nstriking down the legislation protecting women against violence, \nnotwithstanding a very voluminous record--a radical change in the \ninterpretation of the Commerce Clause--where the Court, through Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, said that the Court disagreed with Congress's \n``method of reasoning.''\n  It is a little hard to understand how the method of reasoning is so \nmuch improved when you move across the green from the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing room past confirmation; or where you have the \nlanguage used by Justice Scalia--and I have quoted some of it earlier--\nin the case of Tennessee v. Lane, where Justice Scalia had objected to \nthe congruence and proportionality standard, which he said was a flabby \ntest and a standing invitation to traditional arbitrariness and policy \ndecisionmaking.\n  Then he went on to criticize his colleagues for, as Justice Scalia \nsaid, inappropriate criticism of an equal branch. This is what he had \nto say about the proportionality and congruent standard\n\n       .Worse still, it casts this court in the role of Congress's \n     taskmaster. Under it, the courts--and ultimately this Court--\n     must regularly check Congress's homework to make sure that it \n     has identified sufficient constitutional violations to make \n     its remedy congruent and proportional. As a general matter, \n     we are ill-advised to adopt or adhere to constitutional rules \n     that bring us into constant conflict with the coequal branch \n     of government. And when such conflict is unavoidable, we \n     should not come to do battle with the United States Congress \n     armed only with a test of congruence and proportionality that \n     has no demonstrable basis in the text of the Constitution and \n     cannot objectively be shown to have been met or failed.\n\n  So that is fairly strong language in disagreeing with what the Court \nhas done in establishing the test. And Justice Stevens minced no words \nin his criticism of Citizens United in saying that the decision by the \nSupreme Court showed a disrespect for Congress. There the Court, in \nCitizens United, overruled both McConnell v. Federal Elections \nCommission and the Austin case. Overruling Austin was very significant, \nJustice Stevens noted, because Congress specifically relied on that \ndecision in drafting McCain-Feingold. Justice Stevens then said that \npulling out the rug beneath Congress in this matter ``shows great \ndisrespect for a coequal branch.''\n  Well, my colleagues, the Congress has an opportunity to assert \nitself, to demand the appropriate respect which the Constitution calls \nfor and has been implemented under the doctrine of separation of \npowers. We can find ways to make sure that commitments about respected \ncongressional fact-finding will be observed, or that the rule of stare \ndecisis will be respected; that when there are major decisions coming \nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States which involve the power \nof Congress vis-a-vis the executive branch, that those decisions will \nbe made.\n  So let's sharpen our lines of questioning, colleagues, as we move \nforward to the hearings on Solicitor General Kagan a week from today.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I had noticed my colleague standing there. I hope I haven't kept him \nwaiting too long.\n  Mr. BUNNING. The Senator can speak all he likes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5177-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5177-S5179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4380\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business on my \namendment to the extenders package, Bunning amendment No. 4380.\n  First, let me explain why this amendment is needed. When the Senate \npassed the first version of the extenders package in March, the bill \nextended all parts of the alternative fuel credit that expired at the \nend of last year. This included the coal-to-liquids portion of the \nalternative fuel credit.\n  I was pleased to hear President Obama mention coal to liquids as an \nimportant part of our energy strategy in his State of the Union Address \nearlier this year. That is why I am surprised to see coal to liquids \ndeliberately excluded from the extenders package, first in the Reid \nsubstitute and again in the Baucus substitute.\n  Let me be clear: The bill doesn't just omit or remain silent on the \ncoal-to-liquids credit. This bill specifically says that the coal-to-\nliquids credit expired on December 31, 2009, and isn't renewed. That is \nin the bill.\n  My colleagues probably know that I have many problems with the \nunderlying bill. It adds tens of billions to our national debt and it \ncontains job-killing tax increases. Options to pay fully for this bill \nby cutting spending have been offered and rejected, so our children and \nmy grandchildren will foot the bill. But I thought that one element \nboth parties could agree on is that expired tax provisions that \ntaxpayers count on--and have been extended routinely in the past--\nshould be extended.\n  My amendment is simple: It ensures that the coal-to-liquids portion \nof the alternative fuel credit will be extended until the end of the \nyear, just like the other expiring parts of the alternative fuel \ncredits included in this bill. The Senate already voted to extend all \nparts of the alternative fuel credit when it passed the extenders \npackage last March.\n  Many difficult innovative fuels qualify for the alternative fuel \ncredit, but coal to liquids is the only one that specifically requires \nreduced emissions. The reduction was originally 50 percent but was \nraised to 75 percent last year as a bipartisan agreement. I do not \nunderstand why the extenders package fails to extend the only part of \nthe alternative fuel credit that called for reduced emissions.\n  My colleagues who are deficit hawks will be glad to know that this \namendment will not add one dime to the deficit. This is because no \ncoal-to-liquids projects will come on line in 2010, so no tax credit \nwill be received. However, if the credit is allowed to remain expired \nand is not renewed, this will have a very damaging effect on \ninvestments in this extremely promising technology.\n  My amendment is also bipartisan. I am grateful to Senators \nRockefeller, Byrd, and Enzi, who are cosponsors. I know that the \nSenator from Montana, who is the manager of the extenders\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\npackage and the chairman of the Finance Committee, is familiar with the \ncoal to liquids because of its potential benefit to his home State.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from the Billings Gazette entitled ``Crow Coal-To-Liquids \nPlant Could Be Boon for Montana,'' at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BUNNING. The article describes the efforts of the Crow Nation to \nbuild a coal-to-liquids plant on a reservation in Montana in one of the \npoorest counties in the entire Nation. The project will be designed \nwith carbon capture and storage. The Crow Nation hopes to begin \nproducing the fuel 6 years from now, but losing the benefit of the \nalternative fuel credit would be a serious setback. The tribe is \nalready hearing about investors who are now reluctant to invest in the \nproject because of the uncertainty around coal to liquids.\n  Because the Senator from Montana has a reputation for fighting to \nkeep jobs in his home State, I hope he will support the Crow Nation's \nrequest to extend the coal-to- liquids credit in the extenders package.\n  Failing to extend the credit has the potential to destroy thousands \nof jobs that are planned in an extremely poor county in Montana.\n  This is not something that can wait for a yet-to-be determined energy \nbill. Almost all of the alternative fuel credit is already contained in \nthe extenders package.\n  It makes no sense to specifically exclude parts of the alternative \nfuel credit in this bill, with the promise that it will be looked at \nlater. It will only become more difficult, the longer the credit is \nexpired.\n  It will only make extending coal-to-liquids that much harder if it is \ndelayed to a bill that has not been written yet and will probably be \nfilled with controversial items.\n  I am certain the Senator from Montana understands the political \nreality that the extenders package is the last best opportunity to \nextend a provision that is very important to his home State.\n  I hope the Senator from Montana will support the Bunning-Rockefeller-\nByrd-Enzi amendment and include it in any new substitute he introduces \nto the extenders package.\n  Coal-to-liquids is an important part of our national energy strategy. \nPresident Obama has recognized this in his State of the Union Address.\n  We will never end our dependence on foreign oil until we develop \nalternative sources of fuel.\n  Coal is abundant and it is here in America. It is not owned and used \nas leverage against us by hostile nations.\n  American coal can be used in a way that both reduces emissions and \nfuels our energy needs.\n  It would be a tragic mistake to turn our backs on coal-to-liquids \nwhen it is a crucial part of America's strategy to end our dependence \non foreign oil.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Billings Gazette, Aug. 10, 2008]\n\n          Crow Coal-to-Liquids Plant Could Be Boon for Montana\n\n                           (By Matthew Brown)\n\n       Crow Agency, MT.--A $7 billion coal-to-liquids plant \n     proposed for southeastern Montana's Crow reservation promises \n     an economic boon for the region, but must first overcome \n     economic and political hurdles that have kept any such plant \n     from being built in the United States.\n       The Many Stars plant--a partnership between the tribe and \n     Australian-American Energy Co.--would convert the \n     reservation's sizable coal reserves into 50,000 barrels a day \n     of diesel and other fuels.\n       State officials said Friday it represents the most valuable \n     economic development project in Montana history.\n       ``We're talking about one of the most technologically \n     advanced, sophisticated energy projects on the planet,'' Gov. \n     Brian Schweitzer said at a news conference detailing the \n     project.\n       Covering the plant's $7 billion price tag will be a \n     challenge in the current economic slowdown. And environmental \n     groups have pledged to step in to oppose the plant if it does \n     not include measures to capture greenhouse gases.\n       Yet Australian-American Energy Chairman Allan Blood said he \n     was 90 percent certain the Crow project would be completed.\n       ``In my country we have a record of people who have visions \n     and dreams and make them happen,'' Blood said.\n       Over the next several years, the company plans to sink $100 \n     million into preliminary engineering and environmental work, \n     with a goal of starting construction on the plant by 2012. It \n     could begin producing fuel by 2016.\n       For Crow leaders, the project offers an opportunity to lift \n     the tribe out of poverty. Up to 4,000 people would be \n     employed during its construction. And up to 900 permanent \n     jobs would be created with the plant and a new mine on the \n     reservation that would supply the coal.\n       ``Our kids will have something to look forward to,'' said \n     tribal Chairman Carl Venne. ``Not the six or seven or eight \n     dollars an hour they are making now just to get by. You're \n     looking at $70,000, $80,000--even $100,000-a-year jobs.''\n       But representatives of several environmental groups said \n     they remained wary. An agreement between the tribe and \n     Australian-American Energy calls for the Crow to commit up to \n     50,000 acre-feet of water annually to the project. One acre-\n     foot is equal to nearly 326,000 gallons.\n       That prospect is raising flags for southeastern Montana's \n     ranching community, which is worried the project could \n     deplete precious water supplies.\n       Also, while the tribe and company have pledged to capture \n     95 percent of the plant's emissions of carbon dioxide--a main \n     contributor to global warming--environmentalists said living \n     up to that promise could be difficult.\n       Without capturing those emissions and storing the gas \n     underground, coal-based liquid fuels can churn out \n     significantly more greenhouse gases than conventional \n     petroleum, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n       ``(Coal-to-liquids) developers have been saying we'll do \n     something about carbon, but they've been unwilling to put it \n     into their permits. It's been a lot of empty promises,'' said \n     Bruce Nilles, director of the Sierra Club's national campaign \n     against coal plants.\n       Officials with Australian-American Energy said the Crow \n     plant would be built on the assumption that Congress, in the \n     next few years, will pass legislation compelling companies to \n     capture carbon dioxide. Such laws do not yet exist.\n       Working in the project's favor are high oil prices and the \n     idea of replacing imported oil with homegrown fuels derived \n     from coal. Despite a recent slide, crude prices closed above \n     $115 a barrel on Friday.\n       Still, industry officials said the economic downturn has \n     reduced investors' willingness to sink cash into large \n     projects such as the Many Stars plant. Meanwhile, costs have \n     soared due to rising global demand for construction materials \n     and skilled labor.\n       ``You have the optimum oil scenario playing out with prices \n     skyrocketing, but you have the bottom dropping out of Wall \n     Street,'' said Corey Henry with the Coal-to-Liquids \n     Coalition, a group funded by the mining industry. ``It's been \n     tough sledding to try to get the money to build these \n     plants.''\n       About a dozen coal-to-liquids plants are on the drawing \n     boards in the United States. Only two such plants exist \n     worldwide; both are in South Africa.\n       The biggest hurdle in the United States will be getting the \n     first few plants built, Henry said. Once those are \n     operational, he predicted investors would be more willing to \n     fund similar plants.\n       Blood said he was not concerned, noting he initiated one \n     coal-to-liquids project in Australia that was later sold for \n     $5 billion. In June, he announced a second project in \n     Australia, a $2 billion plant to convert coal into liquid \n     fertilizer.\n       ``You hear about the problems in the capital markets, but \n     what people don't hear is there are dozens and dozens of \n     projects, hundreds of projects, being funded,'' Blood said.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I note with great interest the comments of \nmy good friend from Kentucky, Senator Bunning, about the need for coal-\nto-liquids technology. I agree. I agree wholeheartedly. In fact, as the \nSenator from Kentucky undoubtedly knows, I have urged this technology. \nHe also knows regrettably the other body is opposed to this technology. \nWe have had some difficulty in finding a way to resolve coal to liquids \nin both the House and the Senate.\n  I might say to my friend from Kentucky, I am not sure that adding \nthis provision is going to speed the passage of the so-called extenders \nbill. In fact, I might tease my good friend from Kentucky by saying I \nthink my friend from Kentucky is opposed to passage of the extenders \nbill.\n  Maybe, if I could ask the Senator, if he would support passage of the \nextenders bill?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Most of them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Again, Mr. President, I am teasing. I ask my friend, \nsomewhat in jest, if he were to fully support passage of the extenders \nbill if this provision he mentioned were in the bill? The fact is, we \nare having a hard time passing the extenders bill. Anything we add to \nthe extenders bill is one more additional weight. I do not think that \nwould further the passage of the bill at\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\nthis time. Rather, I think the appropriate place for coal-to-liquids \ntechnology will be in the Energy bill and there will be an Energy bill, \nof that I am positive. There is a question of what will be contained in \nthat energy bill, but there will be one, I am sure, brought up on the \nfloor of this body to help make this country more secure in its \nnational energy position so we are less reliant on foreign countries to \nproduce energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5179-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MONTANA DISASTERS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I also rise to call attention to a pair of disasters that \nrecently struck Montana and pledge my support for the recovery effort. \nLast week the Big Sandy Creek spilled over its banks and flooded into \nthe Lower Box Elder Road and the surrounding area. The flooding \ndisplaced 30 families at the Rocky Point Boy's Indian Reservation in \nnorth central Montana.\n  As is the tradition in our States, folks with the Chippewa Creek \nTribe are pulling together to help one another. The Vo-Tech Center in \nBox Elder has been converted to a makeshift home for those left \nhomeless by the flooding. The American Red Cross of Montana is \nproviding beds and other services at that center. The area is still \nunder a stage two flood advisory. I just talked to the chairman of the \nRocky Boy's about half an hour ago, who told me there have been about 7 \ninches of rain there and he had an extremely difficult time with the \nwater problems and sewage problems. Homes have been displaced. He has \nnever seen anything like it.\n  Initial estimates exceed $1 million at this point. I will work with \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service to see that \nRocky Boy's receives the assistance they need. I might add I will work \nwith any agency that is relevant to make sure the people at Rocky Boy's \nIndian Reservation receive the assistance they need.\n  Just as folks at Rocky Boy's began assessing damage yesterday \nafternoon, another disaster beset Montana. A tornado with wind speeds \nbetween 111 and 135 miles an hour crashed into our State's largest \ncity--Billings. Folks in Yellowstone County have not seen such a \ndestructive twister since 1958.\n  The tornado hurled hail the size of golf balls, ripped the roof off \nour sports arena, the Metrapark--that is the largest facility, I might \nadd, in Billings, MT. After striking it, it tore through a number of \nnearby small businesses. The tornado left a path of destruction in its \nwake--power outages, flooding in some places up to 2 feet of water. The \nwinds damaged at least 10 businesses in Billings: the Main Street \nCasino, a laundromat, a dance studio, Reiter's Marina. The tornado also \nripped the roof from Fast-Break Auto Glass. The roof was later found in \na nearby creek. Witnesses saw big pieces of metal hanging from power \nlines near the arena. Insulation and metal debris was thrown far across \ntown. One look at these photos gives one a sense of the size of the \ndestruction.\n  I might add, if you look at the photo to my right, that is what is \nleft of the Metra arena, Billings' largest facility. You can see the \nMetra almost entirely destroyed, roof completely gone, walls \ncollapsing. I talked to two county commissioners and the mayor today \nand they explained the deep problems they have with reconstructing this \nfacility, to say nothing about all the bookings that have been made \nabout 2 years in advance that have to be dealt with because of this \ndestruction.\n  The Metra sports arena is part of the fabric of life in Billings. \nMontanans gathered at the Metra to cheer on the Billings Outlaws, for \nexample, an indoor football team. Fans say their home field advantage \nis recognized around the league. The arena also houses the Chase Hawks \nMemorial Rough Stock Rodeo. Lots of events take place in this arena. I \nwas there a couple of months ago for a high school graduation. Event \nafter event occurs, it seems, around the clock at this arena. It is \ntotally destroyed by the tornado.\n  The Metra was also visited by American Presidents--President Kennedy, \nPresident Reagan, President Clinton, and President Bush. It is part of \nour State's history. In Montana we work together to solve problems and \nwe will work together through this disaster as well. Yesterday, utility \ncrews worked to shut off a gas leak at a commercial strip mall near \nMain Street. Crews were also working to repair downed power lines.\n  Yellowstone County requested a state of emergency, requested that \ndeclaration from our Governor last night. They were given an oral \ndeclaration and clearly will receive a written declaration today.\n  The Montana National Guard has deployed to the area to help keep \nsecurity around the crumbling arena. I am committed to working with \nlocal officials, the Governor, as well as Senator Tester and \nCongressman Rehberg to coordinate any and all possible Federal \nassistance, coordinating with all Federal agencies to make sure all \nresources are available when requested.

Mr. President, I am appreciative that I am able to join \ntoday with my friend and colleague, Senator Cardin. I appreciate his \njoining me today to discuss an issue of great concern to both of us and \nto human rights advocates around the world. That is the ongoing trial \nin Russia of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon \nLebedev. In June of last year, Senator Cardin joined me in introducing \na resolution urging the Senate to recognize that Khodorkovsky and \nLebedev have been denied basic due process rights under international \nlaw for political reasons. It is particularly appropriate, I think, \nthat Senator Cardin and I be talking about this this afternoon because \nin a matter of days, Russian President Medvedev will be coming to the \nUnited States and meeting with President Obama. I think this would be a \nvery appropriate topic for the President of the United States to bring \nup to the President of the Russian Federation.\n  I can think of no greater statement that the Russian President could \nmake on behalf of the rule of law and a movement back toward human \nrights in Russia than to end the show trial of these two individuals \nand dismiss the false charges against them.\n  Since his conviction, Khodorkovsky has spent his time either in a \nSiberian prison camp or a Moscow jail cell. Currently, he spends his \ndays sitting in a glass cage enduring a daily farce of a trial that \ncould send him back to Siberia for more than 20 years. Amazingly, \nMikhail Khodorkovsky remains unbroken.\n  I think it appropriate that President Obama and Secretary of State \nClinton have committed to resetting relations with the country. I \nsupport them in this worthwhile goal. Clearly, our foreign relations \ncan always stand to be improved. I support strengthening our relations, \nparticularly with Russia. However, this strengthening must not be at \nthe expense of progress on the issue of the rule of law and an \nindependent judiciary. The United States cannot publicly extol the \nvirtues of rule of law and an independent judiciary and at the same \ntime turn a blind eye to what has happened to Khodorkovsky and Lebedev.\n  I urge President Obama and Secretary Clinton to put the release of \nthese two men high on the agenda as\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\nwe continue to engage with Russia, and high on the agenda for President \nMedvedev's upcoming meeting here in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Wicker for taking this \ntime for this colloquy. He has been a real champion on human rights \nissues and on bringing out the importance for Russia to move forward on \na path of democracy and respect for human rights. He has done that as a \nSenator from Mississippi. He has done that as a very active member of \nthe Helsinki Commission. I have the honor of chairing the Helsinki \nCommission, which I think is best known because of its fight on behalf \nof human rights for the people, particularly in those countries that \nwere behind the Iron Curtain--particularly before the fall of the \nSoviet Union, where we were regularly being the voices for those who \ncould not have their voices heard otherwise because of the oppressive \npolicies of the former Soviet Union.\n  So in the 1990s, there was great euphoria that at the end of the Cold \nWar, the reforms that were talked about in Russia--indeed, the \nprivatization of many of its industries--would at last bring the types \nof rights to the people of Russia that they so needed. But, \nunfortunately, there was a mixed message, and in the 1990s, I think \ncontrary to Western popular opinion at the time, Russia did not move \nforward as aggressively as we wanted with freedom and democracy.\n  It is interesting that Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was part of the \nCommunist elite, led the country into privatization in the right way. \nHe took a company, Yukos Oil Company, and truly made it transparent and \ntruly developed a model of corporate governance that was unheard of at \nthe time in the former Soviet Union and unheard of in the Russian \nFederation, and he used that as a poster child to try to help the \npeople of Russia. He started making contributions to the general \nwelfare of the country, which is what we would like to see from the \nbusiness and corporate community. He did that to help his own people. \nBut he ran into trouble in the midst of the shadowy and violent Russian \nmarket, and his problems were encouraged many times by the same people \nwho we thought were leading the reform within the Russian Federation.\n  By 1998, with the collapse of the ruble, the people of Russia were \ndisillusioned; they found their prosperity was only temporary. The cost \nof imports was going up. The spirit of nationalism, this nationalistic \nobsession, became much more prominent within the Russian Federation, \nand the move toward privatization lost a lot of its luster.\n  The rise of Mr. Putin to power also established what was known as \nvertical power, and independent companies were inconsistent with that \nmodel he was developing to try to keep control of his own country. \nTherefore, what he did under this new rubric was to encourage \nnationalization spirit, to the detriment of independent companies and \nto the detriment of the development of opposition opportunity, \ndemocracy, and personal freedom. We started to see the decline of the \nopen and free and independent media.\n  All of this came about, and a highly successful and independent \ncompany such as Yukos under the leadership of Mikhail Khodorkovsky was \ninconsistent with what Mr. Putin was trying to do in Russia. As a \nresult, there was a demise of the company, and the trials ensued. My \nfriend Senator Wicker talked about what happened in the trial. It was a \nmiscarriage of justice. It was wrong. We have expressed our views on \nit. And it is still continuing to this day. I thank Senator Wicker for \ncontinuing to bring this to the Members' attention and I hope to the \npeople of Russia so they will understand there is still time to correct \nthis miscarriage of justice.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank my colleague.\n  I will go on to point out that things started coming to a head when \nMr. Khodorkovsky started speaking out against the Russian Government, \nled by President Putin, and his company that he headed, Yukos, came \ninto the sights of the Russian Federation.\n  Mr. Khodorkovsky visited the United States less than a week before \nhis arrest. He was in Washington speaking to Congressman Tom Lantos, \nthe late Tom Lantos, a venerated human rights advocate from the House \nof Representatives, who had seen violations of human rights in his own \nrights. Mr. Khodorkovsky told Congressman Lantos that he had committed \nno crimes but he would not be driven into exile. He said: ``I would \nprefer to be a political prisoner rather than a political immigrant.'' \nAnd, of course, a political prisoner is what he is now.\n  Shortly after his arrest, government officials accused Yukos Oil of \nfailing to pay more than $300 billion in taxes. At the time, Yukos was \nRussia's largest taxpayer. Yet they were singled out for tax evasion. \nAnd PricewaterhouseCoopers had recently audited the books of Yukos, and \nthe government tax office had approved the 2002 to 2003 tax returns \njust months before this trumped-up case was filed.\n  The Russian Government took over Yukos, auctioned it off, and \nessentially renationalized the company, costing American stockholders \n$7 billion and stockholders all around the country who had believed \nRussia was liberalizing and becoming part of the market society. A \nSwiss court has ruled the auction illegal. A Dutch court has ruled the \nauction illegal. But even more so, they tried these two gentlemen and \nplaced them in prison. Mr. Khodorkovsky apparently had the mistaken \nimpression that he was entitled to freedom of speech, and we discovered \nthat in Russia, at the time of the trial and even today, he was not \nentitled, in the opinion of the government, to his freedom of speech.\n  A recent foreign policy magazine called Khodorkovsky the ``most \nprominent prisoner'' in Vladimir Putin's Russia and a symbol of the \nperil of challenging the Kremlin, which is what Mr. Khodorkovsky did.\n  I would quote a few paragraphs from a recent AP story by Gary Peach \nabout the testimony of a former Prime Minister who actually served \nduring the Putin years:\n\n       A former Russian prime minister turned fierce Kremlin \n     critic came to the defense of an imprisoned tycoon on \n     Monday--\n\n  This is a May 24 article--\n\n     telling a Moscow court that prosecutors' new charges of \n     massive crude oil embezzlement are absurd.\n\n  What we now find is that when Mr. Khodorkovsky is about to be \nreleased from his first sentence, new charges have arisen all of a \nsudden. After years and years of imprisonment in Siberia, new charges \nhave arisen.\n\n       Mikhail Kasyanov, who headed the government in 2000-2004, \n     told the court that the accusations against Khodorkovsky, a \n     former billionaire now serving an eight-year sentence in \n     prison, had no basis in reality.\n\n  This is a former Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.\n\n       Prosecutors claim that Khodorkovsky, along with his \n     business partner [who is also in prison] embezzled some 350 \n     million tons--or $25 billion worth--of crude oil while they \n     headed the Yukos Oil Company.\n       That's all the oil Yukos produced over six years, from 1998 \n     to 2003. I consider the accusation absurd.\n\n  He said that while Prime Minister, he received regular reports about \nRussia's oil companies and that Yukos consistently paid its taxes. \nKasyanov, who served as Prime Minister during most of President Putin's \nfirst term, said that both the current trial and the previous one, \nwhich ended with a conviction, were politically motivated. So I would \nsay this is indeed a damning accusation of the current trial going on, \neven as we speak, in Moscow.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Senator Wicker has pointed out in I think real detail how \nthe dismantling of the Yukos Oil Company was done illegally under any \ninternational law; it was returning to the Soviet days rather than \nmoving forward with democratic reform. As Senator Wicker has pointed \nout, the personal attack on its founders--imprisoning them on charges \nthat were inconsistent with the direction of the country after the fall \nof the Soviet Union--was another miscarriage of justice, and it is \ncertainly totally inconsistent with the statements made after the fall \nof the Soviet Union.\n  The early Putin years were clearly a return to nationalism in Russia \nand against what was perceived at that time by the popular Western view \nthat Russia was on a path toward democracy. It just did not happen. And \nit is clearly a theft of a company's assets by the government and \npersecution, not prosecution, of the individuals who led the company \ntoward privatization, which was a clear message given by the\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\nleaders after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n  This cannot be just left alone. I understand the individuals involved \nmay have been part of the elite at one time within the former Soviet \nUnion. I understand, in fact, there may have been mixed messages when \nyou have a country that is going through a transition. But clearly what \nwas done here was a violation of their commitments under the Helsinki \nCommission, under the Helsinki Final Act. It was a violation of \nRussia's statements about allowing democracy and democratic \ninstitutions. It was a violation of Russia's commitments to allow a \nfree market to develop within their own country. All of that was \nviolated by the manner in which they handled Mr. Khodorkovsky as well \nas his codefendant and the company itself. And it is something we need \nto continue to point out should never have happened.\n  The real tragedy here is that this is an ongoing matter. As Senator \nWicker pointed out, there is now, we believe, an effort to try him on \nadditional charges even though he has suffered so much. And it is a \nmatter that--particularly with the Russian leadership visiting the \nUnited States, with direct meetings between our leaders, between Russia \nand the United States--I hope can get some attention and a chance for \nthe Russian Federation to correct a miscarriage of justice.\n  Mr. WICKER. Indeed, the second show trial of Mr. Khodorkovsky has \nentered its second year. We have celebrated the anniversary of the \nsecond trial.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial by \nthe Washington Post dated June 9, 2010, at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 9, 2010]\n\n  Show Trial: Should Ties to Russia Be Linked to Its Record on Rights?\n\n       Russia's government has calculated that it needs better \n     relations with the West to attract more foreign investment \n     and modern technology, according to a paper by its foreign \n     ministry that leaked to the press last month. Prime Minister \n     Vladimir Putin has recently made conciliatory gestures to \n     Poland, while President Dmitry Medvedev sealed a nuclear arms \n     treaty with President Obama. At the United Nations, Russia \n     has agreed to join Western powers in supporting new sanctions \n     against Iran.\n       Moscow's new friendliness, however, hasn't led to any \n     change in its repressive domestic policies. The foreign \n     ministry paper says Russia needs to show itself as a \n     democracy with a market economy to gain Western favor. But \n     Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev have yet to take steps in that \n     direction. There have been no arrests in the more than a \n     dozen outstanding cases of murdered journalists and human \n     rights advocates; a former KGB operative accused by Scotland \n     Yard of assassinating a dissident in London still sits in the \n     Russian parliament.\n       Perhaps most significantly, the Russian leadership is \n     allowing the trial of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil \n     executive who has become the country's best-known political \n     prisoner, to go forward even though it has become a showcase \n     for the regime's cynicism, corruption and disregard for the \n     rule of law. Mr. Khodorkovsky, who angered Mr. Putin by \n     funding opposition political parties, was arrested in 2003 \n     and convicted on charges of tax evasion. His Yukos oil \n     company, then Russia's largest, was broken up and handed over \n     to state-controlled firms.\n       A second trial of Mr. Khodorkovsky is nearing its \n     completion in Moscow, nearly a year after it began. Its \n     purpose is transparent: to prevent the prisoner's release \n     when his first sentence expires next year. The new charges \n     are, as Mr. Putin's own former prime minister testified last \n     week, absurd: Mr. Khodorkovsky and an associate, Platon \n     Lebedev, are now accused of embezzling Yukos's oil \n     production, a crime that, had it occurred, would have made \n     their previously alleged crime of tax evasion impossible.\n       Mr. Khodorkovsky, who acquired his oil empire in the rough \n     and tumble of Russia's transition from communism, is no \n     saint, but neither is he his country's Al Capone, as Mr. \n     Putin has claimed. In fact, he is looking more and more like \n     the prisoners of conscience who have haunted previous Kremlin \n     regimes. In the past several years he has written numerous \n     articles critiquing Russia's corruption and lack of \n     democracy, including one on our op-ed page last month.\n       Mr. Obama raised the case of Mr. Khodorkovsky last year, \n     and the State Department's most recent human rights report \n     said the trial ``raised concerns about due process and the \n     rule of law.'' But the administration has not let this \n     obvious instance of persecution, or Mr. Putin's overall \n     failure to ease domestic repression, get in the way of its \n     ``reset'' of relations with Moscow. If the United States and \n     leading European governments would make clear that \n     improvements in human rights are necessary for Moscow to win \n     trade and other economic concessions, there is a chance Mr. \n     Putin would respond. If he does not, Western governments at \n     least would have a clearer understanding of where better \n     relations stand on the list of his true priorities.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. The editorial points out that Russia's Government is \ntrying to think of ways to attract more foreign investment, and it \njuxtaposes this desire for more Western openness and investment with \nthe Khodorkovsky matter and says that this trial has become a showcase \nfor the Russian regime's cynicism, corruption, and disregard for the \nrule of law.\n  It goes on to say: The new charges are, as Mr. Putin's own Prime \nMinister testified last week, absurd. Mr. Khodorkovsky and his \nassociate, Platon Lebedev, are now accused of embezzling Yukos Oil's \nproduction--a crime that, had it occurred, would have made their \npreviously alleged crime of tax evasion impossible.\n  So the cynicism of these charges is that they are inconsistent with \neach other. Yet, in its brazenness, the Russian Federation Government \nand its prosecutors proceed with these charges.\n  The article goes on to say: Mr. Khodorkovsky is looking more and more \nlike a prisoner of conscience who haunted the previous criminal regime.\n  It says:\n\n       Mr. Obama raised the case of Mr. Khodorkovsky last year, \n     and the State Department's most recent human rights report \n     said the trial ``raised concerns about due process and the \n     rule of law.''\n\n  I will say they raised concerns.\n  Let me say in conclusion of my portion--and then I will allow my good \nfriend from Maryland to close--this prosecution and violation of human \nrights and the rule of law of Lebedev and Khodorkovsky has brought the \ncensure of the European Court of Human Rights that ruled that Mr. \nKhodorkovsky's rights were violated. A Swiss court has condemned the \naction of the Russian Federation and ruled it illegal. A Dutch court \nhas said it is illegal. It has been denounced by such publications as \nForeign Policy magazine, the Washington Post, a former Prime Minister \nwho actually served under Mr. Putin. It has been denounced in actions \nand votes by the European Parliament, by other national parliaments, by \nnumerous human rights groups, and by the U.S. State Department.\n  I submit, for those within the sound of my voice--and I believe there \nare people on different continents listening to the sound of our voices \ntoday--it is time for the Russian President to step forward and put an \nend to this farce, admit that this trial has no merit in law, and it is \ntime for prosecutors in Moscow to cease and desist on this show trial \nand begin to repair the reputation of the Russian Federation when it \ncomes to human rights and the rule of law.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Wicker for bringing out \nthe details of this matter. It has clearly been recognized and \ncondemned by the international community as against international law. \nIt is clearly against the commitments Russia had made when the Soviet \nUnion fell. It is clearly of interest to all of the countries of the \nworld. Originally, when Yukos oil was taken over, investors outside of \nRussia also lost money. So there has been an illegal taking of assets \nof a private company which have affected investors throughout the \nworld, including in the United States. It has been offensive to all of \nus to see imprisoned two individuals who never should have been tried \nand certainly should not be in prison today. All that is offensive to \nall of us. But I would think it is most offensive to the Russian \npeople.\n  The Russian people believed their leaders, when the Soviet Union \ncollapsed, that there would be respect for the rule of law; that there \nwould be an independent judiciary, and their citizens could get a fair \ntrial.\n  We all know--and the international community has already spoken about \nthis--that Mikhail Khodorkovsky did not get a fair trial. So the \ncommitment the Russian leaders made to its own people of an independent \nand fair judiciary has not been adhered to. This is not an isolated \nexample within Russia. We know investigative reporters routinely are \narrested, sometimes arrested with violence against them. We know\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\nopposition parties have virtually no chance to participate in an open \nsystem, denying the people a real democracy. But here with justice, \nRussia has a chance to do so.\n  I find it remarkable that Mr. Khodorkovsky's spirits are still \nstrong, as Senator Wicker pointed out. Let me read a recent quote from \nMr. Khodorkovsky himself, who is in prison:\n\n       You know, I really do love my country, my Moscow. It seems \n     like one huge apathetic and indifferent anthill, but it's got \n     so much soul. . . . You know, inside I was sure about the \n     people, and they turned out to be even better than I'd \n     thought.\n\n  I think Senator Wicker and I both believe in the Russian people. We \nbelieve in the future of Russia. But the future of Russia must be a \nnation that embraces its commitments under the Helsinki Final Act. It \nhas to be a country that shows compassion for its citizens and shows \njustice. Russia can do that today by doing what is right for Mr. \nKhodorkovsky and his codefendant: release them from prison, respect the \nprivate rights and human rights of its citizens, and Russia then will \nbe a nation that will truly live up to its commitment to its people to \nrespect human rights and democratic principles.\n  Again, I thank Senator Wicker for bringing this matter to the \nattention of our colleagues. It is a matter that can be dealt with, \nthat should be dealt with, and we hope Russia will show justice in the \nway it handles this matter.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank my colleague and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleagues for their remarks. It is worthy \nof all of us giving most serious consideration. Perhaps we have been \ntoo silent in failing to criticize some of the activities of Russia. We \nwant to be friends with them, but good friends tell friends the truth. \nI believe my colleagues are speaking the truth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5182-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5182-S5184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ELENA KAGAN\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee is now reviewing \nthe record of Elena Kagan, President Obama's nominee to the Supreme \nCourt. The truth is, her legal record is thin. She has never been a \njudge and has very limited experience even in the practice of law. She \nhas never tried a case, never cross-examined a witness or made a \nclosing argument in a trial.\n  A lack of judicial experience is not a total disqualifier for the job \nof Supreme Court Justice, but it is true and fair to say this nominee \nhas less real legal experience than any nominee confirmed to the Court \nin the last 50 years. That fact concerns me and many Americans. Ms. \nKagan's lack of experience puts even greater emphasis on the central \nquestion in the nomination process: If confirmed, what kind of judge \nwill Elena Kagan be? Will she take the traditional view that judges are \nimpartial umpires who decide cases based on the rule of law under the \nConstitution? Or is she from the activist school, which teaches that \njudges may take sides and reinterpret the meaning of our laws to \nadvance certain political agendas the judge may find acceptable or \ndesirable or better? Are judges empowered to do that in the American \nsystem?\n  The American people have a right to know. This is no time for a \nstealth candidacy to the Court. We know one thing. We know her \npolitical views are leftist and progressive. That is clear from her \nrecord. She has a rather extensive political record. But with no \njudicial record and little legal record, clues to Ms. Kagan's judicial \nphilosophy can be found perhaps by looking at people she admires, her \nmentors, judges she thinks represent the best way of conducting their \noffice.\n  The three judges Ms. Kagan most often mentions are Judge Abner Mikva, \nJustice Thurgood Marshall, and former Israeli Judge Aharon Barak. \nTogether I think it is fair to say these three judges represent the \nvanguard of a judicial activist movement that has certain intellectual \nroots and is quite afoot in our law schools and some of our legal \ncommentators.\n  Each of these judges affirms the concept that a judge's own views, \ntheir personal views, may--sometimes even should--guide their \ninterpretations of the law. In effect, this philosophy argues that the \noutcome of the case is more important than the legal process that \nguides the decisions, more important than fidelity to the Constitution. \nThese Kagan heroes believe judges should have the power to make law. \nThis results-oriented philosophy raises questions about whether Ms. \nKagan may see judicial power as a way to advance her philosophy. It is \na liberal, big government agenda for America. She has been active in \nthat philosophy throughout her lifetime.\n  Let's look at some of her heroes in more detail. Judge Mikva is \nsomeone with whom she has been close. He was appointed to the bench by \nPresident Carter a number of years ago to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  She clerked for Judge Mikva in 1986 and 1987 and later worked for him \nin the Clinton White House. After he had resigned from the bench and \ncame into the Clinton White House, she was hired to work with him in \nthat office. On the day she accepted President Obama's nomination, Ms. \nKagan noted that Judge Mikva ``represented the best in public service'' \nand that working for him was part of the ``great good fortune'' that \nhad marked her career. He served five terms as a Congressman from \nChicago, where he earned the reputation as ``the darling of American \nliberals.'' He has advocated for strict gun control, reportedly \nreferring to the National Rifle Association as a ``street-crime \nlobby.'' He was a fierce opponent of the war in Vietnam and has said he \nsupports the results in Roe v. Wade. The results.\n  Regarding how to interpret the Constitution or statute, Mikva has \nsaid that for ``most law, there is no original intent.'' The general \nview is that one should find out what the law was intended to mean when \nit was passed.\n  Some people dismiss that and are cynical about that, think that is an \nimpossible goal. That is what Judge Mikva apparently believes. He has \ndefined judicial activism as ``the decisional process by which judges \nfill in the gaps'' in the law and the Constitution. That is similar to \nPresident Obama's theory--which I think is flawed--that for ``the five \npercent of the cases that are truly difficult,'' the judge's decision \ndepends on ``the depth and breadth of one's empathy.''\n  So the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in a judge's heart. \nWhatever a heart is, it is not the mind and it is not, therefore, \nobjective judgment. It is more akin to something else. I have said this \nkind of thinking is more akin to politics than law. It is certainly not \nlaw, not in the American tradition of law.\n  Ms. Kagan also clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall, whom she refers \nto as her hero. Indeed, Marshall is a historic figure. He was \ncourageous at a time when courage was definitely needed and an \neffective leader in the civil rights movement. He was a great attorney \nand a fierce advocate for his clients and his ideals. He could be a \nhero of anyone as an American advocate and a person who played a \nfundamental role in the breakdown of segregation in America. But he \nalso became one of the most active judges on the Court in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  In describing his own judicial philosophy, Marshall said that ``[y]ou \ndo what you think is right and let the law catch up.'' He dissented in \nall death penalty cases because he and Justice Brennan declared the \nprohibition of ``cruel and unusual'' punishment that is in the \nConstitution barred any death penalty.\n  That might sound plausible in one sense. But in truth, this can never \nbe a fair interpretation of the cruel and unusual clause in the \nConstitution, since there are multiple references in the Constitution \nto the death penalty and how it should be carried out.\n\n  How could you possibly construe the document as a whole to say that \n``cruel and unusual'' prevents the death penalty? Well, they did not \nlike the death penalty; Marshall and Brennan did not. They thought it \nwas wrong. They thought the world had developed and moved forward to a \n``higher land'' and they were just going to declare it and the law \nwould follow.\n  Well, according to Kagan, in Justice Marshall's view, \n``constitutional interpretation demanded . . . that the courts show a \nspecial solicitude for the despised and disadvantaged.'' Certainly the \ncourts should be sure that the despised or disadvantaged have a fair \nday\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\nin court. But the way this plays out, I believe, as suggested in the \nfull remarks, is that it untethers the judge from the rule of law. I \nthink it contradicts, in fact, the sworn oath of a judge, which reads \n``I do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to \npersons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I \nwill faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties \nincumbent upon me under the Constitution and laws of the United States, \nso help me God.'' Even so, Ms. Kagan said that showing ``a special \nsolicitude'' for certain groups was Marshall's ``vision of the Court \nand Constitution. And . . . it [was] a thing of glory.'' Well, it \ncertainly represents a great vision for an advocate, but I do think we \nneed to be sure that the judge who puts on the robe is going to follow \ntheir oath to be impartial and to decide matters based on the law and \nfacts.\n  But, interestingly, the judge Ms. Kagan praises the most happens to \nbe perhaps the most activist judge on Earth: Aharon Barak, the former \npresident--or chief justice--of the Israel Supreme Court. The respected \nFederal judge Richard Posner flatly described Barak as a ``judicial \nactivist.'' Elena Kagan described him as her ``judicial hero.''\n  To judicial activists around the world, Aharon Barak is an icon. \nAfter inviting him to Harvard, Ms. Kagan called him ``a great, great \njudge'' who ``presided over the development of one of the most \nprincipled legal systems in the world.'' Her comments are troubling to \nanyone who believes in limited government and democracy and a limited \nrole for judges. Under Barak, the Israeli court assumed extraordinary \ngovernmental power over the people of Israel. The basic democratic \nrights we take for granted in our country were ignored in his actions. \nThe unelected court in Israel assumed the authority to set aside \nlegislation and executive actions when there were disagreements about \npolicy--not violations of the constitution, but disagreements about \npolicy. It would alter the meaning of enacted laws and override even \nnational defense measures.\n  Judge Posner wrote that Barak inhabits ``a completely different--and, \nto an American, a weirdly different--juristic universe.'' He goes on to \nsay: ``What Barak created . . . was a degree of judicial power \nundreamed of even by our most aggressive Supreme Court justices.'' \nJudge Posner compared Barak's actions to ``Napoleon's taking [of] the \nimperial crown out of the Pope's hands and crowning himself.''\n  Well, is that what we want in the Court? Do we want someone who sees \nthis judge as one of the most admirable judges in the world? Do we want \nto allow a disregard for the limits of governmental power to further \ninfect our own government? Is that disrespect for the views of ordinary \nmen and women something to which we should aspire? In other words, do \nunelected, lifetime judges, who are unaccountable to the people--are \nthey entitled to this kind of power? Is this progressive idea that \n``experts'' know best consistent with the American view of individual \nresponsibility and popular sovereignty? I think not.\n  What is Judge Barak's judicial philosophy, as he expresses it? He has \nwritten that a judge's role ``is not restricted to adjudicating \ndisputes'' between parties, as is required by the cases and \ncontroversies clause of our Constitution. Rather, he says:\n\n       The judge may give a statute new meaning. . . .\n\n  ``The judge may give a statute new meaning''--\n\n     a dynamic meaning, that seeks to bridge the gap between law \n     and life's changing reality without changing the statute \n     itself. The statute remains as it was, but its meaning \n     changes, because the court has given it a new meaning that \n     suits new social needs.\n\n  Well, I would say that Justice Barak let the cat out of the bag. In \nAmerica, activist judges firmly deny this is what they are doing, but \nin reality, often that is exactly what they are doing--just taking \nplain statutes and giving the words new meaning and making them say \nwhat they would like for them to have said had they written them in \nthat given period of time.\n  I believe that to the American people, those words, are offensive and \nstrike at the heart of our democracy. I do not know how you would \ndescribe that philosophy, but I do not think it is law, not the law in \nthe great American English tradition of law, a tradition that has \nattracted people all over the world because they believe they have an \nopportunity to achieve justice here. Again, I think it is more akin to \npolitics, which should not be a judge's role. There is no place for \npolitics in the courtroom.\n  Perhaps we should not be surprised that Ms. Kagan--President Obama's \nnominee--so greatly admires someone who endorses a results-oriented \napproach, however, because President Obama's Press Secretary, Robert \nGibbs, just recently described the President himself as ``results-\noriented'' when it comes to law and judging. Amazingly, Gibbs said this \nabout President Obama's view of judging:\n\n       The president is a very pragmatic person who is far less \n     wedded to the process and the mechanics of how you get \n     something done and more wedded to what will the results be.\n\n  He is results-oriented, Gibbs said. What do we mean by ``results-\noriented''? Results-oriented judging can only mean that a judge enters \nthe courtroom with a preconceived idea of what the results should be, \neven before he has reviewed the law or heard the facts of the case. And \nwhat kinds of conclusions do they have in mind before the trial starts? \nWell, it is based on the judge's political views or personal feelings \nabout parties or issues in the case. What else could they be? He or she \nmight suggest that those views are somehow provided to them as knowing \nbetter than anyone else and that they, therefore, have a duty to impose \nthose ``wise'' ideas on the people and the parties in the case. But I \nthink most of us are not so willing to acknowledge judges are any wiser \nthan anyone else. And what if the Constitution does not support such a \nresult? The judge simply would then declare the law to mean something \nother than it says.\n  So that is the philosophy, I contend, that has been endorsed, \nfrankly, by the President. I fundamentally disagree with his \nphilosophy, which is also a philosophy shared by the heroes of Ms. \nKagan.\n  This nominee has a very slim legal record, and it is difficult to \nevaluate that. She does have a very clear liberal political record. \nWhat legal record she has seems to be outside the concept that a judge \nmust serve under the law and under the Constitution.\n  So it is fair to ask, Does she agree with her heroes? Does she agree \nwith her President? Does she see her lifetime appointment to the Court \nas an opportunity to promote ideas she desires and then let the law \ncatch up? To that question, we cannot simply accept a confirmation \ntestimony: I will follow the Constitution. Too often, nominees have \ntestified before the committee like Chief Justice John Roberts and gone \non to rule more like Aharon Barak. Lipservice to the rule of law is not \nenough. Activists who have a postmodern view of the law think the \nConstitution really has no set meaning, there is no way to honestly \ninterpret what it means. So it is easy for them to promise to follow \nthe law because the law, to them, is something that can be changed. It \nis malleable. It is inexact. It is not finite. They can make it say \nwhat they want it to say.\n  So the question is, Is that the approach Ms. Kagan will take at the \nhearing? And is that her basic philosophy of judging? She has written \nthat judges should be forthcoming at the confirmation process, and I \nthink we will need to talk about those issues. It is an important \nconfirmation. It is not a coronation. This is a lifetime appointment. \nThis young nominee could easily serve for more than three decades. \nIndeed, the man she is replacing is--if she lives to his age and serves \nto his age, she would serve 40 years.\n  So I think she is entitled to fair and respectful treatment. She is \nentitled to have an opportunity to discuss and respond to the questions \nI have raised and others will raise. That is absolutely true, and we \ncannot use unfairness to besmirch a nominee. But we do need to know: Is \nthis her philosophy of law? What kind of judge will she be? Isn't it \ntrue that a person's heroes tell a great deal about who they really \nare? Few would dispute that these heroes of hers represent three of the \nmost well-known activist judges in the world. So I think the questions \nare important.\n  As I have said before, I will oppose--and every Senator should \noppose--any\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\nnominee who does not understand and fully accept that their duty is to \nserve, as the oath says, ``under the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States.'' That is why I think it is only fair to state these \nconcerns before the hearing. I hope my colleagues will be following it. \nI know our committee members are working hard. It is being a bit \nrushed, but we are doing our best to be ready next Monday to commence \nthe hearing. I think it will be a good time. I look forward to it, and \nI hope people who see it will feel as if it was fairly conducted and \nbeneficial not only to Senators, who must vote, but to the American \npublic at large.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5184-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5184-S5186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HEALTH INSURANCE RATE AUTHORITY ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, tomorrow the President of the United \nStates will address the Nation on the 90-day anniversary of the passage \nof health care reform, so I have come to the floor at this time to \ndiscuss an omission from the health care bill, and that omission is the \nprotection of consumers from unfair medical insurance premium rate \nincreases, which, as I will show in the next 15 minutes, are now taking \nplace virtually all over this Nation.\n  On March 4, I introduced legislation to provide the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services with the ability to set up a rate review \nprocedure to provide that insurance premium rate increases are \nreasonable. Senators Boxer, Burris, Casey, Gillibrand, Lautenberg, \nMikulski, Reed, Sanders, and Whitehouse have all cosponsored this bill. \nI originally proposed the amendment during the health care reform \ndebate. We worked with the Administration in putting it together. We \nworked with the Finance Committee. We worked with Representative \nSchakowsky in the House, who has introduced the same legislation. \nPresident Obama decided to include it in his health care reform \nproposal, but unfortunately it did not meet the criteria for \nreconciliation and therefore had to be dropped. On March 4, I \nintroduced a bill to provide this rate review, and on April 20 Senator \nHarkin was good enough to hold a full hearing in the HELP Committee.\n\n  The time has come to take action. The time has come to protect \nconsumers from the egregious abuse of insurance companies that are, in \nfact, taking place across this very Nation today.\n  Health insurance premiums have been spiraling upwards at out-of-\ncontrol rates--10, 20, 30 percent per year--all while big national \ninsurance companies enjoy increasing profits.\n  Everyone by now is familiar with the increases that Anthem Blue \nCross, a subsidiary of WellPoint, was set to impose--as much as 39 \npercent--for 800,000 Californians in the individual market. It turns \nout that Anthem Blue Cross used flawed data to calculate these health \ninsurance premium increases for hundreds of thousands of California \npolicyholders, resulting in increases that were larger than necessary. \nThe State insurance commissioner ordered an independent actuarial \nstudy, and here is what they found: They found that the 25-percent \naverage increase proposed by Anthem should only have been 15.2 percent.\n  What is most disturbing is that Anthem's case is not an aberration. \nFar from it. The five major insurers in the small group market in \nCalifornia--Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente, Anthem Blue Cross, Aetna, \nand United Health Care--have just announced rate increases for small \nbusinesses that will average 12 to 23 percent. Some will be hit with \nrate increases as much as 76 percent. That likely means people will \nlose their insurance. This means that over 1.6 million Californians \nwill shortly see increases in premiums. These premium increases have \nbeen going on all along. As a matter of fact, literally hundreds of \nthousands of Californians have had to lose their insurance because they \ncan't pay these premium increases.\n  This is not a problem unique to California. The White House reports \nthat premium rates have been rising across the Nation with substantial \ngeographic variation. For employer-sponsored family coverage, premiums \nhave increased 88 percent in Michigan over the past decade compared \nwith a 145-percent increase in Alaska.\n  A recent report by the Center for American Progress Action Fund found \nthat WellPoint is pursuing double-digit increases in the individual \nmarket for 10 other States in addition to California: Colorado, \nConnecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Maine, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, \nVirginia, and Wisconsin.\n  Here are a few examples of those rate increases in the individual \nmarket. Average rates in Colorado will increase by 19.9 percent. Some \nconsumers will see increases as high as 24.5 percent. In Maine, Anthem \nBlue Cross Blue Shield requested a 23-percent increase in 2010. They \nthen sued the State's insurance commissioner for rejecting an 18.5-\npercent increase last year on top of it. But in April a Maine court \nupheld the insurance commissioner's decision. In Indiana, rates are \nexpected to increase 21 percent in 2010.\n  Other insurance companies are also raising rates. Health Care Service \nCorporation of New Mexico proposed 24.6 percent increases for about \n40,000 individual policies last fall. The school district in Weston, \nCT, is served by CIGNA, which proposed a 23-percent increase in the \ndistrict's insurance premiums for the 2010-2011 fiscal year.\n  In a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 77 percent of people \npurchasing insurance in the individual market report being asked for \npremium increases. That is over three-fourths. These increases are \naveraging 20 percent. We don't know the extent of the problem \nnationwide, but the reporting requirements in the health reform law \nwill improve the information available. However, right now, until \nchanges go into effect, there is a glaring loophole which allows for \nprivate for-profit medical insurance companies--the big ones--to \nincrease rates as much as they possibly want to and possibly can.\n  The recently signed health care bill does require insurance companies \nto provide justification for unreasonable premium increases to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services. They must also post these \njustifications on their Web sites. This provides transparency, granted, \nbut it leaves the loophole. Simply stated, the Secretary has no \nauthority to do anything about these rate increases. So an insurance \ncompany can argue the large increase is justified, but in some States \nthere is no review to see that it is. In other States, officials may \nnot have the authority to block an increase that is not justified. We \nneed to close this loophole.\n  The bill we have introduced will do just that. This legislation gives \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to block \npremium or other rate increases that are unreasonable. In some States, \ninsurance commissioners already have that authority, and that is fine. \nThe bill doesn't touch them. In Maine, for example, the State \nsuperintendent of insurance was able to block Anthem's proposed 18.5-\npercent increase last year. She approved only a 10.9-percent increase.\n  In 23 States, including my own--California--companies are not \nrequired to receive approval for rate increases before they take \neffect.\n  So this legislation we have introduced simply creates a Federal \nfallback, allowing the Secretary to conduct reviews of potentially \nunreasonable rates in States where the insurance commissioner does \nnot--and I repeat, does not--already have the authority or the \ncapability to do so. That is in 23 States.\n  The Secretary would review potentially unreasonable premium increases \nand take corrective action. This could include blocking an increase, \nproviding rebates to consumers, or adjusting an increase.\n  Under this proposal, the Secretary would work with the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners to implement the rate review \nprocess. She would identify States that have the authority and \ncapability to review rates. States already doing this work will \ncontinue to do so unabated and unfettered. The legislation would not \naffect\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\nthem. However, for the consumers in the other 23 States with no \nauthority, such as California, protection from unfair rate hikes would \nbe provided.\n  This proposal would also create a Rate Authority, a seven-member \nadvisory body to assist the Secretary with these responsibilities. A \nwide range of interests would be represented, including consumers, the \ninsurance industry, medical practitioners, and other experts.\n  I think this proposal strikes the right balance. There is no need for \ninvolvement in States with insurance commissioners that are able to \nprotect consumers. So the legislation I have introduced simply provides \nFederal protection for consumers who are currently at the mercy of \nlarge health insurance companies whose top priority is their bottom \nline.\n  We, in fact, are the only industrialized country in the world that \nrelies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide \nbasic health care. As T.R. Reid says in his book ``The Healing of \nAmerica'': No country with a large for-profit medical insurance \nindustry has been able to really reform health care costs.\n  So what we have in America today are multiple large, for-profit \ninsurance companies. They are public companies. They are focused on \nprofits. They are heavily concentrated. They leave consumers with few \nalternatives when their premiums increase. They have merged over the \nyears and they have gained market concentration in a way that no other \nbusiness or industry is allowed to do in the United States because they \nhave an antitrust exemption. Major League Baseball has that exemption. \nThe health insurance industry is one of only a few industries with this \nexemption.\n  The Judiciary Committee has passed out legislation which would remove \nthat antitrust exemption, and that legislation should be passed as soon \nas possible. In 2007, just two carriers--WellPoint and United Health \nGroup--gained control of 35 percent of the national market for \ncommercial health insurance. That is because they have merged and \nacquired using that antitrust exemption.\n  According to a study by the American Medical Association, more than \n94 percent of American health insurance markets have a highly \nconcentrated market share. This means these companies could raise \npremiums or reduce benefits with little fear that consumers will end \ntheir contracts or move to a more competitive carrier because they have \nbought up the more competitive carriers.\n  In my State of California, just two companies--WellPoint and Kaiser \nPermanente--control more than 58 percent of the market. In Los Angeles, \nthese two carriers controlled 62 percent of the market in 2008. Before \nhealth care reform, these companies had little incentive to be \nefficient with the premium dollars they collected. These large \ninsurance companies have large and substantial profit margins while \ncontinuing to raise premiums for consumers.\n  According to Health Care for America Now!, four of the five largest \nhealth insurance companies--WellPoint, United Health, Humana, CIGNA--\nsaw profits increase 56 percent from 2008 to 2009; that is, from $7.7 \nbillion to $12.1 billion. Only Aetna saw their profits decrease.\n  In the first 3 months of 2010, the five largest for-profit medical \nhealth insurance companies--WellPoint Inc., United Health Group, Inc., \nAetna Inc., Humana Inc., and CIGNA Corp.--recorded a combined net \nincome of $3.2 billion. That is in the first 3 months of this year.\n  Here is the significance: That is a 31-percent jump over the first 3 \nmonths of 2009. So just in the first 3 months of this year, through \npremium increases they now have a $3.2 billion or 31-percent increase \nin profits.\n  Here are the company profits for the first quarter of 2010:\n  WellPoint, $876.8 million; that is a 51-percent increase over the \nsame quarter in 2009. Humana, $258.8 million; that is a 26-percent \nincrease in the first quarter 2010 over first quarter 2009. Aetna, a \n$562.6 million profit; that is a 29-percent increase for the first \nquarter 2010 over first quarter 2009. UnitedHealth, $1.19 billion; that \nis a 21-percent increase first quarter 2010 over first quarter of 2009. \nCigna, $283 million; that is a 36-percent increase first quarter over \nfirst quarter of last year.\n  See, this is amazing. They receive these huge profit margins, then \nthey turn around and raise premiums on consumers, many of whom are \nstruggling to keep their insurance because they have lost their jobs, \nand many of whom have had a double-digit increase last year and even \nthe year before.\n  In 2009, despite the worst economic downturn since the Great \nDepression, these insurers set a full-year profit record. This caps a \ndecade of enormous profit growth in the industry. Between 2000 and \n2007, profits at 10 of the largest publicly traded health insurance \ncompanies soared 428 percent--from $2.4 billion in 2000 to $12.9 \nbillion in 2007.\n  The rapidly increasing insurance premiums are a piece of a larger \nproblem. Multiple factors, including the large profit sustained by many \nhospitals, now are contributing to the cost of health care in the \nUnited States. So what we are seeing is an increase in costs charged by \nmajor hospitals.\n  But it is important to note that while the cost of medical care is \nincreasing, premiums are rising much faster than the cost of medical \ninflation. I must say, there are predictions that we will build into \nour budget deficit a structural deficit, and that structural deficit \nwill come from these very rising health care costs. Mr. President, we \nmust do something about it.\n  From 2000 to 2008, premiums for employer-sponsored health plans \nincreased 97 percent for families and 90 percent for individuals. At \nthe same time, the payments that private insurers made to health care \nproviders increased 72 percent, medical inflation increased 39 percent, \nwages increased 29 percent, and overall inflation increased 21 percent. \nSo figure inflation increased 21 percent, wages 29, medical inflation \n39, and payments to health care providers increased 72 percent, yet \ninsurance premiums increased 97 percent. Much more than the increase in \nmedical costs. That is the problem. If we let it happen, we have no one \nto blame but ourselves.\n  Meanwhile, consumers struggle to afford these continued rate hikes. \nBetween December 31, 2008, and March 31, 2010, the combined commercial \nenrollment of these five companies fell by 2.8 million Americans. So \ninsurers make increasing profits by increasing rates and, at the same \ntime, they push 2.8 million Americans off of medical insurance because \nof those increasing rates. This is very real. It is happening out there \nevery day, every week, every month. We must do something about it.\n  Let me give you one personal story. Laurel Kaufer is a 48-year-old \nsingle mother of two sons. She lives in Woodland Hills in my State. She \nis a self-employed mediator and lawyer. She has had Blue Cross for 25 \nyears. Her son, Brandon, is 21 and he attends the University of \nArizona. Her son, Zack, is 19 and goes to USC.\n  Anthem Blue Cross has raised her health insurance rates 550 percent \nover the last 10 years. Between February of 2001 and March of 2010, Ms. \nKaufer has spent $52,128 on health insurance premiums alone. That \ndoesn't include deductibles.\n  She has no choice but to pay the increases. With her two sons in \ncollege, she doesn't have any disposable income. She seeks medical \ntreatment only when she has to. She and her son do their annual \ncheckups, but as Ms. Kaufer says:\n\n       Sometimes I don't get a test that a doctor says I should \n     have, because it costs me money, and I wait it out to see if \n     I can do without it.\n\n  This is a family with insurance, passing up tests because they \nalready spend over $52,000 on premiums.\n  There are numerous stories like these. Individuals and families have \nto choose whether to buy groceries, pay their mortgage, or purchase \nhealth insurance.\n  As I pointed out, in the last few years, 2.8 million Americans who \nwere previously insured by for-profit insurance companies have severed \ntheir policies or lost their insurance because they can't pay the bill.\n  I strongly believe we need to take action on this and soon because it \nis going to continue and it is going to spiral. These companies are \ngoing to take every advantage of a loophole in the law to raise \npremiums, to be able to increase their profit margin and push more \npeople off of insurance.\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\n  This bill is very necessary. Premiums are increasing every day. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, the \nHealth Insurance Rate Authority of 2010, which will close this \nloophole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5186-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise briefly, and with great pride, to \ncommend to my colleagues the confirmation of Marc Treadwell from the \nState of Georgia to be a U.S. district court judge of the Middle \nDistrict of Georgia.\n  Marc is all Georgian. He was born in Blackshear, and he traveled \naround as the son of an Army officer. But he came back and attended \nValdosta State where he earned his bachelor's degree, and then he \ngraduated from Mercer University's Walter F. George Law School in \nMacon.\n  After graduating, he came to Atlanta and, ironically, practiced law \nat the firm of Kilpatrick & Cody, which represented my company for \nyears in Atlanta. It is one of the most distinguished law firms in the \nState of Georgia.\n  Marc has been inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers, \nand Martindale-Hubbell gave him an ``AV,'' its highest designation.\n  Marc now teaches at his alma mater, Mercer, and he has written more \nthan 50 publications for Law Reviews and other publications. He is \nrecognized as a leading authority and expert in Georgia evidence law.\n  Marc is married to his beautiful wife Wimberly. They have two sons, \nThomas and John. In addition to juggling his law practice, teaching, \nand family duties, Marc finds time to be an active member of the \nVineville United Methodist Church in Macon.\n  It is my privilege and honor to thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking \nMember Sessions for their diligence on this confirmation in the \ncommittee.\n  I commend Marc Treadwell with my highest recommendation for \nconfirmation to the court of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Like my friend from Georgia, I rise today also with \ngreat pride to strongly support the nomination of Judge Mark Goldsmith, \nto be a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nMichigan.\n  I have known Judge Goldsmith for a long time. He is a friend and \nsomeone for whom I have the greatest admiration both as a person and as \na judge. He is extremely intelligent. He is highly respected in \nMichigan as a judge. Since joining the Oakland County Circuit Court in \n2004, he has proven himself to be someone who is highly respected by \nall sides. He is known for his integrity and fairness. That is \ncertainly what we look for as we look to these important confirmations \non the Federal bench.\n  After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1974, he went on \nto receive his law degree from Harvard University in 1977. Before \njoining the State court, he was a partner at Honigman Miller in \nDetroit. He has also served as an adjunct professor of the law at Wayne \nState University's law school.\n  Judge Goldsmith is well known in the community where he formerly \nserved on many boards and is someone who is known for giving back to \nthe community, working with the poor, and working with those who need \nhis help in the Detroit area. He has been recognized for his pro bono \ninvolvement and his community work, most notably at B'nai B'rith \nAntidefamation League and Forgotten Harvest, an organization that \ncollects surplus perishable foods from grocery stores, restaurants, and \ncaterers and provides them to emergency food providers in the metro \nDetroit area.\n  The American Bar Association has given him the rating of \n``unanimously well qualified,'' which is their highest rating for \njudicial nominees.\n  He has been a judge in Michigan since 2002 when he was appointed as a \npart-time magistrate hearing traffic violations and civil infractions. \nIn 2004, he was appointed to the Oakland County Circuit Court, which \nhas jurisdiction over felonies and major civil claims cases. He was \nelected to that position in November of 2004 and reelected in 2006.\n  In the cases that have come before him, he has always been known to \nbe fair and impartial, willing to listen to both sides and make careful \nrulings based on the law. It has been my great honor and privilege to \nknow him and to join with Senator Levin in making a recommendation to \nthe President regarding his possible nomination. We were very pleased \nwhen President Obama chose to nominate him to the Federal bench.\n  I urge my colleagues to support him unanimously, as the American Bar \nAssociation has done--again, giving him their highest rating for \njudicial nominees of ``unanimously well qualified.'' I hope we will do \nthis soon today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the time be equally divided between both \nsides, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to say a few \nwords about an excellent lawyer from Macon, GA, Marc Treadwell, who has \nbeen nominated to serve as a U.S. District Court Judge for the Middle \nDistrict of Georgia, the district I was privileged to practice in for \n26 years.\n  He is a native of Blackshear, GA, but as an ``Army brat,'' he grew up \nnear various bases around the United States and abroad.\n  He is a graduate of Valdosta State University, as well as the Walter \nF. George School of Law at Mercer University in Macon.\n  At Mercer, Marc served on the law review and was a member of the \nschool's prestigious Brainerd Currie Honor Society.\n  After graduation, Marc went to Atlanta to begin his practice of law \nand returned to Macon in 1985 and has practiced in Macon ever since. He \ncurrently is a partner with the Macon firm of Adams, Jordan & \nTreadwell.\n  Marc has been inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers and \nMartindale-Hubbell and his colleagues have given him the highest rating \navailable to a lawyer in the country with an AV rating.\n  He now teaches at his alma mater, Mercer, and has written more than \n50 publications for law reviews and other publications. Marc is also \nrecognized as a leading authority on the evidence law in our State of \nGeorgia.\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\n  Marc and his wife Wimberly have two sons, Thomas and John. In \naddition to juggling his law practice, teaching and family duties, Marc \nis an active member of the Vineville United Methodist Church in Macon.\n  I am pleased to commend Marc Treadwell to my colleagues, and I \nbelieve he will serve Georgians and Americans very well as a Federal \njudge and will be a fine addition to the bench.\n  Marc gets the highest remarks from his colleagues with whom I have \ntalked over the last several months. I am extremely pleased to be here \ntoday to recommend to all of my colleagues the confirmation of Marc \nTreadwell to be a U.S. district judge for the Middle District of \nGeorgia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of California Superior Court Judge Josephine Staton \nTucker to sit on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia.\n  Judge Tucker brings a wealth of relevant experience as a lawyer and a \njudge to her candidacy for the Federal bench.\n  For the last 8 years, she has been a trial judge on the Orange County \nSuperior Court. She has managed a judicial calendar of up to 500 \npending cases at a time. She has presided over trials on topics as \ndiverse as commercial contract disputes, negligence and discrimination \nactions, felony criminal cases, and family law matters. And she has \nserved for 2 years on the Appellate Division of the court by special \nappointment from the chief justice of California, giving her important \nexperience with appeals as well as trials.\n  Additionally, Judge Tucker brings 15 years of litigation experience \nas an associate and then a partner at the law firm of Morrison Foerster \nLLP.\n  Her work in private practice included representation of both \nplaintiffs and defendants in all aspects of employment law, including \nindividual and class action litigation regarding employment \ndiscrimination, wrongful discharge, trade secrets and unfair \ncompetition, privacy, and wage and hour issues. She represented clients \nbefore State courts, Federal courts, and administrative agencies, and \nshe also provided training to employers regarding compliance with \nfederal and state employment laws.\n  From 1996 to 2002, Tucker was the cochair of Morrison & Foerster's \n50-lawyer employment law practice. In 2001, the Orange County Trial \nLawyers Association recognized her work by naming her their Employment \nLawyer of the Year.\n  Judge Tucker has also written prolifically. Her published work \nincludes: The California Employers Guide to Employee Handbooks and \nPersonnel Policy Manuals, a widely used reference book in California; \nthree articles and over 50 case critiques for the California Employment \nLaw Reporter, and 60 discussions of the law confronting employers and \nemployees in the Los Angeles Times Sunday Edition.\n  Finally, she has been active in community work, providing volunteer \nservices to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, the Orange Coast \nInterfaith Shelter, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and the Intercommunity \nChild Guidance Center.\n  Judge Tucker is a summa cum laude graduate of William Jewell College, \na graduate of Harvard Law School, and a former law clerk to Judge John \nGibson on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In sum, she \nis a highly qualified candidate for the Federal Court.\n  Judge Tucker is also well respected in the Orange County legal \ncommunity where she works. I have long used a committee process \ninvolving local lawyers to identify the most highly qualified \ncandidates for the Federal courts in California. Judge Tucker was \nrecommended to me by my current committee after diligent research into \nthe quality of her work and her reputation among local lawyers. I \nbelieve she will be a wonderful addition to the U.S. district court in \nOrange County.\n  I thank Senator Boxer for her support of Judge Tucker, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of confirmation.\n  I want to say briefly that while I will be very glad to see Judge \nTucker confirmed today, there is much more work to be done in \nconfirming the President's nominees. Let me give one example that is \nimportant to me.\n  The President first nominated Magistrate Judge Edward Chen to serve \non the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California \nover 300 days ago. He has been voted out of committee twice and has \nbeen pending on the floor most recently for 137 days without a vote.\n  Like Judge Tucker, Judge Chen came out of my committee process. He \nhas excellent credentials, including 9 years as a magistrate judge, and \nhas strong, bipartisan support in the community he has been nominated \nto serve. I understand that certain members of the minority have \nconcerns because Chen worked for the ACLU before becoming a magistrate \njudge and because of two lines that have been excerpted from his \nspeeches and caricatured in the Washington Times. Chen has a long \nrecord as an adjudicator, however, and it is available for all to \nreview.\n  He has spent 9 years as a magistrate judge and written over 200 \npublished opinions. There has not been a single objection in committee \nor on the floor to even one of his decisions.\n  In 2008, an impartial Federal Magistrate Judge Merit Selection Review \nPanel reviewed his full record. The Panel unanimously recommended him \nfor reappointment. Federal prosecutors they interviewed were \n``uniformly positive'' about Chen and called his rulings ``balanced'' \nand ``well reasoned.'' Similarly, the local civil bar called him ``well \nprepared,'' ``very intelligent,'' and ``decisive.''\n  His reputation is stellar among the district judges he works with--\nwhether they are Republican or Democratic appointees. District Judge \nLowell Jensen who served as the No. 2 official in the Reagan Justice \nDepartment said Chen's decisions ``reflect not only good judgment, but \na complete commitment to the principles of fair trial and the \napplication of the rule of law.''\n  Two bipartisan selection committees have recommended Chen for the \ndistrict court--one in the Bush administration and the committee I have \nestablished to review candidates for the current Administration.\n  The American Bar Association has also unanimously rated him well \nqualified.\n  There is a long track record that shows that Chen understands the \ndifference between his work as a lawyer almost a decade ago and the \nwork of a judge, which he has been doing for the last nine years with \ngreat success.\n  It is long past time for the minority to agree to a time agreement \nand for the full Senate to have an up-or-down vote on Judge Chen's \nnomination.\n  I will be very pleased to see Judge Tucker confirmed today, and I \nalso believe that we should move forward to confirm other nominees \npending.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for \nCalifornia Superior Court Judge Josephine Staton Tucker, who will be \nconfirmed today to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia. Judge Tucker was recommended to the President by my \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, and will be a great addition to the \nFederal bench.\n  Judge Tucker has had a distinguished career. After graduating from \nHarvard Law School, she served as a Federal clerk for Judge Gibson of \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Following her clerkship, she \npracticed labor and employment law at Morrison & Foerster in San \nFrancisco and Irvine, CA, becoming a partner at the firm in 1995. In \n2002, she was appointed by then-Governor Gray Davis to the Orange \nCounty Superior Court.\n  I congratulate Judge Tucker and her family on this important day, and \nwish her the best as she begins her tenure as a Federal judge.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I ask that the time in the quorum \ncall be charged to both sides equally. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I apologize for the voice. There is a fair \namount of pollution in the air. It will be much better as soon as I get \nto Vermont at the end of the week.\n  Mr. President, this evening the Senate is being allowed to confirm a \nfew\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\nmore of the 26 judicial nominations that have been reported by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee over the past several months, but that \ncontinue to be stalled by the Republican leadership. We have yet to be \nallowed to consider nominations reported last November. In addition to \nthe three nominations being considered today, there are more than a \ndozen more judicial nominations that were reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee, and a total of almost two dozen that are being \nheld up without good reason. There is no excuse for these months of \ndelay.\n  The Senate Republican leadership refuses to enter into time \nagreements on these nominations. Their stalling and obstruction is \nunprecedented. They refuse to enter into a time agreement to consider \nthe North Carolina nominees to the Fourth Circuit, who were reported by \nthe committee in January, one unanimously and one with only a single \nnegative vote. They refuse to enter into a time agreement to debate and \nvote on the Sixth Circuit nominee from Tennessee who was reported last \nNovember. I have told Senator Alexander that all Democrats are prepared \nto vote on that nominee and have agreed to do so since November. It is \nhis own leadership that continues to obstruct the nominee from \nTennessee.\n  The Senate is well behind the pace I set for President Bush's \njudicial nominees in 2001 and 2002. A useful comparison is that in \n2002, the second year of the Bush administration, the Democratic Senate \nmajority's hard work led to the confirmation of 72 Federal circuit and \ndistrict judges nominated by a President from the other party. In this \nsecond year of the Obama administration, we have confirmed just 19 so \nfar--72 to 19.\n  In the first 2 years of the Bush administration, we confirmed a total \nof 100 Federal circuit and district court judges. So far in the first 2 \nyears of the Obama administration, the Republican leadership has \nsuccessfully obstructed all but 31 of his Federal circuit and district \ncourt nominees--100 to 31. Today that number will rise, but to just 34. \nMeanwhile Federal judicial vacancies around the country hover around \n100.\n  By this date in President Bush's Presidency, the Senate had confirmed \n57 of his judicial nominees. Despite the fact that President Obama \nbegan sending us judicial nominations 2 months earlier than did \nPresident Bush, the Senate has to date only confirmed 31 of his Federal \ncircuit and district court nominees--57 to 31.\n  Last year, Senate Republicans refused to move forward on judicial \nnominees. The Senate confirmed the fewest number of judges in 50 years. \nThe Senate Republican leadership allowed only 12 Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees to be considered and confirmed despite the \navailability of many more for final action. They have continued their \nobstruction throughout this year. By every measure the Republican \nobstruction is a disaster for the Federal courts and for the American \npeople.\n  To put this into historical perspective, consider this: In 1982, the \nsecond year of the Reagan administration, the Senate confirmed 47 \njudges. In 1990. the second year of the George H.W. Bush \nadministration, the Senate confirmed 55 judges. In 1994, the second \nyear of the Clinton administration, the Senate confirmed 99 judges. In \n2002, the second year of the George W. Bush administration, the Senate \nconfirmed 72 judges. The only year comparable to this year's record-\nsetting low total of 16 was 1996, when the Republican Senate majority \nrefused to consider President Clinton's judicial nominees and only 17 \nwere confirmed all session.\n  Senate Democrats moved forward with judicial nominees whether the \nPresident was Democratic--1994--or Republican--1982, 1990, 2002--and \nwhether we were in the Senate majority--1990, 1994, 2002--or in the \nSenate minority--1982. Senate Republicans, by contrast, have shown an \nunwillingness to consider judicial nominees of Democratic Presidents--\n1996, 2009, 2010.\n  Over the last recess, I sent a letter to Senator McConnell and to the \nmajority leader concerning these matters. In that letter, I urged, as I \nhave since last December, the Senate to schedule votes on these \nnominations without further obstruction or delay. I called on the \nRepublican leadership to work with the majority leader to schedule \nimmediate votes on consensus nominations--many, like those finally \nbeing considered today, I expect will be confirmed unanimously--and \nconsent to time agreements on those on which debate is requested. As I \nsaid in the letter, if there are judicial nominations that Republicans \ntruly wish to filibuster--after arguing during the Bush administration \nthat such action would be unconstitutional and wrong--then they should \nso indicate to allow the majority leader to seek cloture to end the \nfilibuster. It is outrageous that the majority leader may be forced to \nfile cloture petitions to get votes on the North Carolina, Tennessee \nand other nominees.\n  The three nominees being considered today were all reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee in March, more than 3 months \nago. They could and should have been confirmed long before now. They \nare supported by their home State Senators. I congratulate them on \ntheir confirmation today.\n  After these votes, there will still be 23 judicial nominees favorably \nreported by the Judiciary Committee being stalled from Senate \nconsideration by the Republican leadership. We should change this \ncourse, and schedule confirmation votes without further delay.\n  Mr. President, I realize about half the time remaining is mine. No \none else is seeking recognition.\n  First off, I wish to thank Senator Isakson for his kind words \nearlier.\n  As I announced last month, the confirmation hearing on the \nPresident's nomination of Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court will begin next Monday. On Monday, I will give each \nSenator who is a member of the committee an opportunity to deliver an \nopening statement. After the nominee is presented to the committee, she \nwill proceed with her opening statement. On Tuesday morning we will ask \nquestions of the nominee. I hope that we will conclude the hearing by \nthe end of the week, including testimony from a few public witnesses, \nas has become our custom.\n  Over the last few weeks, I have come to the Senate floor to outline \nthe qualifications and achievements of the nominee, and to comment on \nthe attacks that have been launched against her. I have noted my \ndisappointment that too many Republican Senators seem predisposed to \noppose the nomination.\n  When he set out to find a well-qualified nominee to replace retiring \nJustice John Paul Stevens, the President said this:\n\n       I will seek someone who understands that justice isn't \n     about some abstract legal theory or footnote in a casebook. \n     It's also about how laws affect the daily realities of \n     people's lives--whether they can make a living and care for \n     their families, whether they feel safe in their homes and \n     welcome in our nation.\n\n  In introducing Solicitor General Kagan as his Supreme Court nominee, \nPresident Obama praised her ``understanding of the law, not as an \nintellectual exercise or words on a page, but as it affects the lives \nof ordinary people.''\n  President Obama is not alone in recognizing the value of judges and \nJustices who are aware that their duties require them to understand how \nthe law works, and the effects it has in the real world. Within the \nlast month, two Republican appointees to the Supreme Court have made \nthe same point. Last month, Justice Anthony Kennedy told a joint \nmeeting of the Palm Beach and Palm Beach County Bar Associations that, \nas a Justice:\n\n       You certainly can't formulate principles without being \n     aware of where those principles will take you, what their \n     consequences will be. Law is a human exercise and if it \n     ceases to be that it does not deserve the name law.\n\n  In addition, Justice David Souter, who retired and was succeeded by \nJustice Sotomayor last year, delivered a thoughtful commencement \naddress at Harvard University. He spoke about judging and explained why \nthoughtful judging requires consideration of human experience and \ngrappling with the complexity of constitutional questions in a way that \ntakes the entire Constitution into account. He spoke about the need to \n``keep the constitutional promises our nation has made.'' Justice \nSouter concluded:\n\n       If we cannot share every intellectual assumption that \n     formed the minds of those who framed that charter, we can \n     still address the constitutional uncertainties the way they \n     must have envisioned, by relying on reason, by respecting all \n     the words the Framers wrote, by facing facts, and by seeking \n     to understand their meaning for living people.\n\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\n\n  Justice Souter understood the real-world impact of the Supreme \nCourt's decisions, as does, I believe, his successor Justice Sotomayor. \nAcross a range of fields including bankruptcy, the fourth amendment, \nstatutory construction, and campaign finance, Justice Sotomayor has \nwritten and joined opinions that have paid close attention to the \nsignificance of the facts in the record, to the considered and \nlongstanding judgments of the Congress, to the arguments on each side, \nto the Supreme Court's precedents, and to the real-world ramifications \nof the Supreme Court's decisions. She has voted to keep the courthouse \ndoors open in important employment discrimination and pension rights \ncases.\n  A hallmark of real-world judging is acknowledging the challenges of \nconstruing the Constitution's broad language given our social and \ntechnological developments. I am talking about getting away from \nsloganeering and being concrete. I appreciate Justices like Justice \nJohn Paul Stevens, Justice David Souter and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \nwho are grounded, who draw on the lessons of experience and use common \nsense. In the real world of judging, there are complex cases with no \neasy answers. In some, as Justice Souter pointed out, different aspects \nof the Constitution point in different directions, toward different \nresults, and need to be reconciled.\n  This approach to judging is not only mainstream, it is as old as the \nConstitution itself and has been evident throughout American history. \nChief Justice John Marshall wrote for a unanimous Supreme Court in the \n1819 landmark case of McCulloch v. Maryland that for the Constitution \nto contain detailed delineation of its meaning ``would partake of the \nprolixity of a legal code, and could scarcely be embraced by the human \nmind.'' He understood, as someone who served with Washington, \nJefferson, Adams and Madison, that its terms provide ``only its great \noutlines'' and that its application in various circumstances would need \nto be deduced. The ``necessary and proper'' clause of the Constitution \nentrusts to Congress the legislative power ``to make all laws which \nshall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution'' the \nenumerated legislative powers of article I, section 8, of our \nConstitution as well as ``all other powers vested by this Constitution \nin the Government of the United States.'' In construing it, Chief \nJustice Marshall explained that expansion clause ``is in a \nconstitution, intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to \nbe adapted to the various crises of human affairs.'' He went on to \ndeclare how, in accordance with a proper understanding of the \n``necessary and proper'' clause and the Constitution, Congress should \nnot by judicial fiat be deprived ``of the capacity to avail itself of \nexperience, to exercise its reason, and to accommodate its legislation \nto human affairs'' by judicial fiat. Chief Justice Marshall understood \nthe Constitution, knew its text and knew the Framers. He rejected \nstagnant construction of the Constitution.\n  McCulloch v. Maryland was the Supreme Court's first construction of \nthe ``necessary and proper'' clause. The most recent was just last \nmonth in United States v. Comstock. That case upheld the power of \nCongress to enact the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which \nincluded provisions authorizing civil commitment of sexually dangerous \nFederal prisoners who had engaged in sexually violent conduct or child \nmolestation and were mentally ill. Quoting Chief Justice Marshall's \nlanguage from McCullough, Justice Breyer wrote in an opinion joined by \na majority of the Supreme Court, including Chief Justice Roberts, about \nthe ``foresight'' of the Framers who drafted a Constitution capable of \nresilience and adaptable to new developments and conditions.\n\n  Justice Breyer's judicial philosophy is well known. A few years ago, \nhe authored ``Active Liberty'' in which he discussed how the \nConstitution and constitutional decisionmaking protects our freedoms \nand, in particular, the role of the American people in our democratic \ngovernment. When he writes about how our constitutional values applying \nto new subjects ``with which the framers were not familiar,'' he looks \nto be faithful to the purposes of the Constitution and the consequences \nof various decisions.\n  During the Civil War, in the 1863 Prize Cases decision, the Supreme \nCourt upheld the constitutionality of President Lincoln's decision to \nblockade southern ports before a formal congressional declaration of \nwar against the Confederacy. Justice Grier explained that it was no \nless a war because it was a rebellion against the lawful authority of \nthe United States. Noting that Great Britain and other European nations \nhad declared their neutrality in the conflict, he wrote that the Court \nshould not be asked ``to affect a technical ignorance of the existence \nof a war, which all the world acknowledges to be the greatest civil war \nknown in the history of the human race.'' That, too, was real-world \njudging.\n  In the same way, the Supreme Court decided more recently in Rasul v. \nBush, that there was jurisdiction to decide claim under the Great Writ \nsecuring our freedom, the writ of habeas corpus, from those in U.S. \ncustody being held in Guantanamo. Justice Stevens, a veteran of World \nWar II, engaged in real-world judging, recognizing that the United \nStates exercised full and exclusive authority at Guantanamo if not \nultimate, territorial sovereignty. The ploy by which the Bush \nadministration had attempted to circumvent all judicial review of its \nactions was rejected recognizing that ours is a government of checks \nand balances.\n  Examples of real-world judging abound in the Supreme Court's \ndecisions upholding our individual freedoms. For example, the First \nAmendment expressly protects freedom of speech and the press, but the \nCourt has applied it, without controversy, to television, radio \nbroadcasting, and the Internet. Our privacy protection from the fourth \namendment has been tested but survived the invention of the telephone \nand institution of Government wiretapping because the Supreme Court did \nnot limit our freedom to tangible things and physical intrusions but \nsought to ensure privacy consistent with the principles embodied in the \nConstitution.\n  Real-world judging is precisely what the Supreme Court did in its \nmost famous and admired modern decision in Brown v. Board of Education. \nI recently saw the marvelous production of the George Stevens, Jr., \none-man play ``Thurgood'' starring Laurence Fishburne. It was an \nextraordinary evening recalling one of the great legal giants of \nAmerica. At one point, Justice Marshall reads a few lines from the \nunanimous decision of the Supreme Court in 1954 that declared racial \ndiscrimination in education unconstitutional. Chief Justice Warren had \nwritten:\n\n       In approaching this problem, we cannot turn the clock back \n     to 1868, when the [Fourth] Amendment was adopted or even to \n     1896 when Plessy v. Ferguson was written. We must consider \n     public education in the light of its full development and its \n     present place in American life throughout the Nation. Only in \n     this way can it be determined if segregation in public \n     schools deprives these plaintiffs of the equal protection of \n     the laws.\n\n  That was real-world judging that helped end a discriminatory--and \ndark--chapter in our history. The Supreme Court did not limit itself to \nConstitution as written in 1787. At that point in our early history, \n``We the People'' did not include Native Americans or African-American \nslaves, and our laws failed to accord half the population equality or \nthe right to vote because they were female. Real-world judging takes \ninto account that the world and our Constitution have changed since \n1788. It took into account not only the Civil War, but the Civil War \namendments to the Constitution adopted between 1865 and 1870.\n  Would anyone today, even Justice Scalia, really read the eighth \namendment's limitation against cruel and unusual punishment to allow \nthe cutting off of ears that was practiced in colonial times? Of course \nnot, because the standard of what is cruel and unusual punishment was \nnot frozen for all time in 1788. Does anyone dispute today that the \nfundamental rights set forth in the Bill of Rights are correctly \napplied to the States through the due process clause of the 14th \namendment? Literally, the freedoms in our Bill of Rights were expressed \nonly as limitations on the authority of Congress. Does anyone think \nthat the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment cannot be read \nto prohibit gender discrimination? It was most assuredly not\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\nwomen that its drafter had in mind when it was adopted.\n  Our Constitution was written before Americans had ventured into outer \nspace, or cyberspace. It was written before automobiles, airplanes or \neven steamboats. Yet the language and principles of the Constitution \nremain the same as it is applied to new developments. The Constitution \nmentions our ``Armed Forces'' but there was no air force when the \nConstitution was written. Similarly, in construing the ``commerce \nclause'' and the intellectual property provisions to provide copyright \nand patent protection for ``writings and discoveries,'' the Supreme \nCourt has engaged in real-world judging as it applies our \nconstitutional principles to the inventions, creations and conditions \nof the 21st century. Jefferson and Madison may have mastered the quill \npen, but never envisioned modern computers.\n  There are unfortunately occasions on which the current conservative, \nsometimes activist, majority on the Supreme Court did not engage in \nreal-world judging. One such case, the Lilly Ledbetter case, would have \nperpetuated unequal pay for women, by using a rigid, results-oriented, \ncramped reading of a statute to defy congressional intent. We corrected \nthat case by statute. Similarly, the Gross decision seeks to close our \ncourts to those treated unfairly. The legislature must correct it. And, \nof course, the Citizens United case wrongly reversed 100 years of legal \ndevelopments to unleash corporate influence in elections.\n  We saw yet another troubling example in a narrow 5-4 decision handed \ndown earlier today in a case called Rent-A-Center v. Jackson, in which \nthe conservative activists in the majority, once again, have ruled in \nfavor of big business at the expense of hardworking Americans. With \nthis narrow decision, the five Justices in the majority have overridden \nthe intent of Congress in passing the Federal Arbitration Act and \nabandoned our longstanding tradition of allowing people to go to court \nto challenge unconscionable agreements. Just as it was in the wake of \nthe Ledbetter case, it will be up to Congress to correct this error and \nundo the damage it has done to thousands of people who have no choice \nbut to sign unfair agreements in order to get a job and put food on \ntheir table for their families.\n  The issue before the Court was whether a court or an arbitrator \nshould decide the enforceability of an agreement to settle disputes \nthat may arise. Justice Stevens, writing for the four dissenting \nJustices noted that the question whether a legally binding arbitration \nagreement existed is an issue that the Federal Arbitration Act assigns \nto the courts. Congress did not intend to prevent employers from having \naccess to an impartial court's determination whether the agreement was \nunconscionable. Today's ruling turns that purpose, and even the Court's \nown precedent, upside down.\n  It is estimated that more than one hundred million Americans work \nunder binding mandatory arbitration agreements. Most Americans are not \neven aware that according to the new Supreme Court ruling, they will \nhave waived their constitutional rights to a jury trial when they \naccept a job to provide for their families. This divisive decision not \nonly closes the courthouse doors to millions of American workers and \ntheir families, it gives big business even more incentive to require \ntheir employees to sign one-sided arbitration agreements as a condition \nof employment.\n  Considering how the law will work in the real world is an \nindispensable part of a judge's responsibility. I expect that Elena \nKagan learned that lesson early in her legal career when she clerked \nfor Justice Marshall. In 1993, upon the death of Justice Thurgood \nMarshall, she observed:\n\n       Above all, he had the great lawyer's talent . . . for \n     pinpointing a case's critical fact or core issue. That trait, \n     I think, resulted from his understanding of the pragmatic--of \n     the way in which the law acted on people's lives.\n\n  If confirmed, Elena Kagan would be the third member of the current \nSupreme Court to have had experience working in all three branches of \nthe government prior to being nominated. Some have criticized her work \nduring the Clinton administration as political. I suggest that a fair \nreading of her papers indicates that she has the ability to take many \nfactors into account in analyzing legal problems and that her skills \ninclude practicality, principle and pragmatism. These were all used in \ntheir service to the American people by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, \nSouter and Stevens.\n  I have always thought that a nominee's judicial philosophy was \nimportant. Nearly 25 years ago, I noted in an earlier hearing for a \nSupreme Court nominee:\n\n       There can hardly be an issue closer to the heart of the \n     Senate's role than a full and public exposition of the \n     nominee's approach to the Constitution and to the role of the \n     courts in discerning and enforcing its commands. That is what \n     I mean by judicial philosophy.\n\n  It is only recently that some Republican Senators conceded that \njudicial philosophy matters. I hope this means that they will abandon \nthe false premise that all a Justice does is mechanically apply obvious \nlegal dictates to reach preordained outcomes. There is more to serving \nthe country as a Supreme Court Justice. A Supreme Court Justice needs \nto exercise judgment, should appreciate for the proper role of the \ncourts in our democracy, and should consider the consequences of \ndecisions on the fundamental purposes of the law and in the lives of \nAmericans--in other words, engage in real-world judging.\n  I intend to ask the nominee about her judicial philosophy and about \nreal-world judging. That is what I have done through the course of a \ndozen Supreme Court nominations hearings. Real-world judging is an \nimportant part of American constitutional life.\n  As I have said, I reject the ideological litmus test that Senate \nRepublicans would apply to Supreme Court nominees. Unlike those on the \nright who drove President Bush to withdraw his nomination of Harriet \nMiers and those who opposed Justice Sotomayor, I do not require every \nSupreme Court nominee to swear fealty to the judicial approach and \noutcomes ordained by adhering to the narrow views of Justice Scalia and \nJustice Thomas. I expect judges and Justices to faithfully interpret \nthe Constitution and apply the law, and also to look to the legislative \nintent of our laws and to consider the consequences of their decisions. \nI hope that judges and Justices will respect the will of the people, as \nreflected in the actions of their democratically elected \nrepresentatives in Congress, and serve as a check on an overreaching \nexecutive.\n  What others seem to want is assurance that a nominee for the Supreme \nCourt will rule the way they want so that they will get the end results \nthey want in cases before the Supreme Court. Lack of such assurances \nwas why they vetoed President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers, the \nthird woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court in our history and the \nonly one not to be confirmed. They forced Ms. Miers to withdraw even \nwhile Democrats were preparing to proceed with her hearing. They do not \nwant an independent judiciary. They demand Justices who will guarantee \nthe results they want. That is their ideological litmus test. As \ncritics level complaints against Elena Kagan, I suspect that the real \nbasis of that discontent will be that the nominee will not guarantee a \ndesired litigation outcome.\n  Of course that is not judging. That is not even umpiring. That is \nfixing the game. It is conservative activism plain and simple. It is \nthe kind of conservative activism we saw when the Supreme Court in \nLedbetter disregarded the plain language and purpose of title VII. It \nis the kind of activism we saw when, this past January, a conservative \nactivist majority turned its back on the Supreme Courts own precedents, \nthe considered judgment of Congress, the interests of the American \npeople and our long history of limiting corporate influence in \nelections in their Citizens United decision.\n  We can do better than that. In fact, we always have done better than \nthat. In reality, we can expect Justices who are committed to do the \nhard work of judging required of the Supreme Court. In practice, this \nmeans that we want Justices who will pay close attention to the facts \nin every case that comes before them, to the arguments on every side, \nto the particular language and purposes of the statutes they are \ncharged with interpreting, to their own precedents, to the traditions \nand longstanding historical practices of this\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\nNation, and to the real-world ramifications of their decisions. Judging \nis not just textual and is not automatic. If it were, a computer could \ndo it. If it were, important decisions would not be made 5 to 4.\n  The resilience of the Constitution is that its great concepts and \nphrases are not self-executing. They involve constitutional values that \nneed to be applied. Cases often involve competing constitutional \nvalues. In the hard cases that come before the Court in the real world, \nwe want--and need--Justices who have the good sense to appreciate the \nsignificance of the facts in the cases in front of them as well the \nramifications of their decisions in human and institutional terms. I \nexpect in close cases that hard-working Justices will sometimes \ndisagree about results. I do not expect to agree with every decision of \nevery Justice. I understand that. I support judicial independence. I \nvoted for Justice Stevens, Justice O'Connor and Justice Souter, who \nwere all nominees of Republican Presidents.\n  A year ago, most Republican Senators opposed the nomination of \nJustice Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, in spite of her outstanding \nrecord for more than 17 years as a Federal district and court of \nappeals judge. Most Republican Senators opposed Justice Sotomayor's \nnomination not because she lacked the requisite professional \nqualifications or because there were issues about her character or \nintegrity. Her record was impeccable. Sadly, the complaints about both \nJustice Sotomayor and now being echoed in opposition to Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan are based on the two nominees' unwillingness to promise \nto deliver results that align with a narrow political ideology.\n  We 100 who are charged with giving our advice and consent on Supreme \nCourt nominations should consider whether those nominated have the \nskills, temperament and good sense to independently assess in every \ncase the significance of the facts and the law and real-world \nramifications of their decisions. I have urged Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents to nominate people from outside the judicial \nmonastery because I think real-world experience is helpful and because \nI know that real-world judging matters in the lives of the American \npeople. The American people live in a real world of great challenges. \nWe have a guiding charter that provides great promise. At the end of \nthe day, the Supreme Court functions in the real world that affects all \nAmericans. Judicial nominees need to appreciate that simple, undeniable \nfact. history--segregation.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and a half minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, since Ms. Kagan was nominated, President \nObama and his administration have attempted to defend not only her \ndiscriminatory treatment of the military at Harvard but to do so \nthrough misleading and even untrue statements. Indeed, Vice President \nBiden said Ms. Kagan's policy was ``right,'' and he suggested she was \nmerely following the law, both of which were not correct.\n  The recent statements made by the White House after the release late \nFriday of relevant records on this matter are most troubling. The \nrecords not only prove Ms. Kagan deliberately obstructed military \nactivity at the Harvard campus during wartime, but they reveal her \nactions were even more concerning than previously known. The White \nHouse continues to insist she worked to accommodate military \nrecruiters--which is just the opposite of accurate--that she \nassiduously worked to follow the law--not so--and to ensure that \nHarvard law students could choose a career in the military service. \nWell, I guess they could, but she certainly was not furthering that \nopportunity.\n  The documents revealed late Friday night show these statements are \nnot accurate and really seem to be part of a campaign to rewrite what \nhappened there. The documents show that Ms. Kagan reversed Harvard's \npolicy--which allowed the military to come and recruit, as any other \ngroup would--without basis or notice, in order to block the access of \nthe recruiters, not to accommodate them. That is not disputed. It \nshouldn't be disputed.\n  The documents further show that she defied Federal law, forcing the \nDepartment of Defense to use its authority to bring Harvard into \ncompliance. They had to threaten to cut off Harvard's money. They \nshowed she did not ensure access to military careers and recruiters, \nbut that the Office of Career Services prevented the military from even \nposting job openings on campus. They show that she sanctioned a \ndemeaning second-class entry system for the military that the \nDepartment of Defense finally stood up to and said: No, that is \nintolerable and we will not accept it.\n  The documents also show that Ms. Kagan continued to fight military \nrecruitment even when her defiance of the law meant that Harvard could \nlose $\\1/2\\ billion a year. In a memorandum we obtained from the \nDepartment of Defense, Larry Summers--then president of Harvard, now \nPresident Obama's chief economic adviser--approved the entrance of the \nmilitary recruiters fully on campus over the objection of Dean Kagan. \nNow, that is the fact.\n  So this policy was designed to obstruct recruiters and not only to \nend recruiting on campus, really, but to punish and demean the military \nin an attempt to force them to change the ``Don't Ask Don't Tell'' \npolicy. But that rule was not enacted by the military. It was enacted \nby Congress and Ms. Kagan's former boss, President Bill Clinton, in \nwhose White House she worked for 5 years--without apparently any \nserious objection to his signing of the policy.\n  Ms. Kagan's actions, combined with the fact that she had little to \nsay about recruiting policy while working with President Clinton, raise \nquestions about whether this is just a hostility to the military. They \nwere just saluting and following the policy of Congress and the \nPresident. Why should they be blamed for this? Why should people who \nrisk their lives to ensure Harvard's freedom be given second-class \ntreatment on the Harvard campus? It was absolutely unacceptable then; \nit is unacceptable now.\n  I was involved, and this Congress had to pass a new law, an updated \nSolomon amendment, to end this policy. And Dean Kagan was one of the \nleaders of the law school's efforts. That is just a fact. And to \nsuggest otherwise is misleading.\n  Here are some quotes from some of the e-mails that were released.\n\n       Harvard Law School is delaying and providing a ``slow \n     role'' to Air Force's efforts to recruit during the Spring \n     recruiting season. Seems they have delayed sufficiently in \n     providing permission that the Season may already be ``too \n     late.''\n\n  That was in February 2005, when she was dean.\n  In March 2005, this memo was written:\n\n       The Army was stonewalled at Harvard. Phone calls and e-\n     mails went unanswered and the standard response was--we're \n     waiting to hear from our higher authority.\n\n  How about another one? This was in April of 2006:\n\n       We're all searching for a way to limit the polarizing \n     nature of the anti Solomonites--\n\n  Those are the people who were trying to have the Solomon amendment \npassed in Congress thrown out--\n\n     who now rattle sabers over an intent to shout down the \n     military. Dean Kagan is a case in point below as she \n     reportedly ``encouraged students to demonstrate against the \n     presence of recruiters . . . . (and to) express their views \n     clearly and forcefully.''\n\n  Indeed, she sent out e-mails to students explaining why she thought \nthis was so important. She was a national leader in this effort.\n  Another e-mail, March 10 of 2005. This military person said he \nexplained to Harvard that the Third Circuit opinion they were using as \na pretext to not follow the law had issued a stay of injunction and the \nSolomon amendment remained current law. He goes on to say:\n\n       I asked him if I could at least post a job posting via \n     their office and he said no. He stressed that I could contact \n     interested students via the Harvard veterans Student Group \n     but that his office could not provide any support to us.\n\n  So we need a fair and honest evaluation. I, for one, have frankly \nbeen disappointed in this administration's obfuscation, deliberately \nattempting to hide the nature of what happened at Harvard, because it \nwas, in fact, inexcusable. The administration should not defend this. \nThey should give her a\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\nchance. Maybe she would say she made a mistake; maybe she would defend \nit. But I can't imagine an administration would to want defend this \nkind of policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Leahy and \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee for the hearing they gave to Mark \nGoldsmith for the Eastern District of Michigan. He is an extraordinary \njudge. He has proved it already on the bench in Michigan. He has \nwonderful judicial temperament, he knows how to listen, he knows how to \nthink, and he brings to the bench--and will bring to the bench when, \nhopefully, we confirm him--the kind of judicial temperament we want in \nour district court judges. So I thank Senator Leahy and Senator \nSessions, while he is on the floor. I have talked to Senator Sessions \nabout Mark Goldsmith, and I thank him for his receptiveness.\n  I believe all the members of the Judiciary Committee who had the \nchance to read the record or to be there at the hearing will agree that \nthis is an unusually well-qualified nominee for our district court \nbench, and I thank them for their unanimous vote to bring him out of \nthe committee.\n  Judge Goldsmith has had an impressive legal career. He graduated with \nhigh distinction and honors in economics from the University of \nMichigan in 1974. He was a member of the Honors Program in Economics at \nthe University of Michigan and founded and served as editor-in-chief of \nthe Michigan Undergraduate Journal of Economics. He graduated cum laude \nfrom Harvard Law School in 1977.\n  Judge Goldsmith has served on the Oakland County Circuit Court in the \ncivil/criminal division since March 19, 2004, when he was appointed by \nGovernor Jennifer Granholm. He also served as a magistrate at the 45-B \nDistrict Court and as a Special Counsel to the State Bar Committee on \nthe Unauthorized Practice of Law, a hearing panelist for the Attorney \nDiscipline Board and as an adjunct instructor at Wayne State University \nLaw School.\n  Prior to his service as a circuit court judge, Judge Goldsmith \npracticed law for nearly 25 years. He is admitted to practice in \nseveral states, as well as the U.S. Supreme Court, U.S Court of Appeals \nfor the Sixth Circuit, U.S. Court of Military Appeals, U.S. Air Force \nCourt of Military Review and numerous U.S. District Courts.\n  Judge Goldsmith is also committed to legal community service. He \nserved as president of the Federal Bar Association, Eastern District of \nMichigan Chapter and has served for many years as that organization's \npro bono chair, receiving certificates of recognition from the U.S. \nDistrict Court, Eastern District of Michigan for his pro bono \ninvolvement. He is currently a member of the executive board of Wayne \nState University's Center for the Study of Citizenship and a member of \nthe Fair Housing Advisory Board of Legal Aid and Defender Association, \nInc. Further, he helped establish the Circle of Friends--teaching \nlanguage and acculturation skills to immigrants--and has served on the \nboard of Forgotten Harvest--a distributor of food to the needy--and on \nthe Regional Advisory Board of the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League.\n  Judge Goldsmith will be an excellent addition to the Eastern District \nCourt and will serve with great distinction. I wish him well and thank \nmy colleagues for supporting his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

All \n     my previous communication has been with one of his staff \n     members, Ms. Kathleen Robinson, the recruitment manager. He \n     stated that he was calling because he ``felt bad that they \n     had left us without an answer'' and wanted to pass on the \n     contact data of the president of the Harvard Veterans Student \n     Group. He stated that the faculty had still not decided \n     whether to allow us to participate in on-campus interviews \n     and that the official on-campus interview program for Spring \n     2005\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\n     had already concluded. I asked him if we'd be allowed to \n     participate in the Fall 2005 on-campus interview program and \n     he said he did not know.\n       Mr. Weber, asked me what our current position on the \n     Solomon Amendment was, and I explained that since the 3rd \n     Circuit had issued a stay of the injunction, the Solomon \n     Amendment was current law and that we were in the process of \n     following the procedures outlined in 32 CPR 216. He asked me \n     when they could expect a letter and I stated that I did not \n     know. We then briefly discussed the utility of on-campus \n     interviews.\n       I asked him what generated the phone call and he responded \n     that he ``felt bad they had left us with no answer but still \n     had no answer.''\n       I asked him if I could at least post a job posting via \n     their office and he said no.

Madam President, more than 57,000 Ohioans--that is \nabout the size of Elyria, OH, or Mansfield, OH, or twice the size of \nZanesville, OH--more than 57,000 Ohioans are estimated to have lost \nunemployment benefits since the extension ended in May 2010, a month \nago.\n  If the Senate does not pass an extension, that number will increase \ndramatically. More than 90,000 Ohioans could lose their benefits by the \nend of June. That is more people than live in Youngstown, more people \nthan live in Springfield, OH, more people than live in Cleveland \nHeights or Lakewood, OH. Madam President, 90,000 Ohioans could lose \ntheir benefits by the end of June.\n  Nationwide, since the beginning of June, some 900,000 workers have \nrun out of jobless benefits. That number will surpass 1 million by next \nweek.\n  Now, those are numbers, and we can stand around here and debate back \nand forth, and talk about 50,000 here and 100,000 here and a million \nthere. But later in my remarks I am going to share, as I often do, \nMadam President--as you and I have talked about--letters from people in \nCrawford County, Warren County, Pickaway County, and Hamilton County, \nOH, where I was earlier today--letters from people, individuals who are \npart of those 50,000 or 90,000 Ohioans who could lose their benefits.\n  Senate Republicans are denying tens of thousands of Ohioans--and \nthousands of people in New Hampshire and hundreds of thousands of \npeople in California and Texas and Florida--the Republicans are denying \ntens of thousands of Ohioans the unemployment insurance benefits they \nhave earned during years of hard work.\n  This year, this Chamber spent 9 weeks on the floor struggling to \nextend unemployment insurance and COBRA. Over the past week, every \nsingle Republican voted again and again to block a bill just to extend \nunemployment insurance. They chose to vote against extending COBRA, a \ncritical benefit for workers who not only lose their jobs but also \ntheir health insurance.\n  You know how this happens, Madam President. Someone is laid off from \ntheir job. They lose their income. Then they cannot afford their \ninsurance. They lose their insurance--unless they are enrolled in \nCOBRA. COBRA is a bit of a cruel hoax. In order to keep your insurance, \nyou have to pay what you were paying as an employee when you had a job \nand full pay and you have to pay the employer side of the insurance in \norder to continue your insurance. That is why a year ago, in the \nstimulus package, for the first time in American history, the Federal \nGovernment helped people who had lost their insurance keep their \ninsurance by paying about two-thirds of the COBRA premium.\n  If you lose your job, you get a little bit of unemployment insurance, \nalthough the Republicans have blocked that. Then you lose your \ninsurance. Then if you get sick, you are going to lose your house. When \nI hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk the way they \ndo about unemployment insurance, they act as if it is a welfare \nprogram. Unemployment insurance, decidedly, is not a welfare program. \nWe do not call it unemployment welfare. We call it unemployment \ninsurance.\n  What does that mean? It means when you are working--if you are an \nironworker in New Hampshire, if you are a steelworker in Ohio or you \nwork at Burger King in Cleveland--wherever you are working, you pay \ninto this unemployment insurance plan. When you lose your job, if you \nare full time, you get money back, some of the money you paid in. It is \ncalled insurance. That is why we call it insurance. Yet my Republican \ncolleagues act as if unemployment insurance is welfare. Well, it is \nnot. It really is insurance.\n  I think it is important we think about someone losing their job and \nnot getting unemployment insurance, and then losing their health care, \nand then, very likely, in many cases, losing their home. We do not know \nmany people like that because we dress like this and we make a good bit \nof money here and a good many of our colleagues are pretty insulated. \nThey do not know a lot of people who have lost their job or lost their \ninsurance or lost their home. But think about it, we should try to put \nourselves in the position of someone who has lost their job, then lost \ntheir insurance, then lost their home.\n  You are a family in Lima, OH, or Zanesville, OH, or Gallipolis or \nDayton. First the breadwinner loses her job. Then they cannot afford \nthe insurance. Then they get not really sick but sick enough that they \nhave bills that have piled up. Then they cannot keep up with paying for \ntheir home mortgage. Then they get 3 or 4 months behind. Then they get \na notice from the bank that they are going to lose their house. Think \nof what that does.\n  Say you have two kids. You live in Dayton, OH. You have lost your \njob. You have lost your insurance. Now you are about to lose your \nhouse. You have to explain to your son and daughter in Huber Heights, a \nsuburb of Dayton: Well, little Johnny and Jane, we are going to have to \nmove, and we are going to move to a really small, little apartment, and \nwe don't have any place to put all this stuff, and we are going to have \nto sell it or give it away. I don't know where you are going to go to \nschool next fall because I am just really unsure of things.\n  The son or daughter says: Well, mom, what about my friends? Where are \nwe\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\ngoing to school? She says: I don't know yet because we don't have an \napartment. I don't think my colleagues, particularly my Republican \ncolleagues--who vote no on unemployment insurance benefits, who vote no \non COBRA and helping people with their insurance and are unwilling to \ndo anything about these foreclosures--I do not think they think about \nthese individual situations. They look at statistics, like we do. They \nlook at numbers, like we do. They debate this stuff. But I do not think \nthey think about what it would be like if someone they knew or they \nthemselves had to lose their job and their health insurance and their \nbenefits.\n  It is pretty simple in so many ways. As I said, employees pay into \nthe unemployment fund when they are working. When they are laid off--\nthey did not ask to be laid off--they receive help from that fund. But \nwhen it comes to helping middle-class Americans, Republicans too often \nlook the other way. They start talking about deficit spending. I am \nempathetic with that because I think we have to get our budget house in \norder.\n  But all I can think of is where was this concern, where were my \nRepublican colleagues, where were they when they voted for two wars--a \nwar with Afghanistan and a war with Iraq--and did not pay for those \nwars? They took the cost of those wars, which is $1 trillion, which is \n1,000 billion. That is 1,000 billion. A billion is a thousand million. \nSo it is a thousand million: a trillion dollars. I know that is a \nlittle confusing. But they are spending $1 trillion. They are just \ncharging it to our grandkids for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They \ndo not worry about that being added to our grandkids' tab.\n  Then where were these Republicans, where was the concern of the \nRepublicans when they passed George Bush's tax cuts for the rich? That \nis why we have this huge budget deficit.\n  In 2000, as the Presiding Officer knows, we had a budget surplus in \nour country, and then George Bush and the Republicans took over. Two \nwars; did not pay for it; charged it to our grandchildren. Tax cuts for \nthe rich; did not pay for it; charged it to our grandchildren. A \ngiveaway to the drug and insurance companies in the name of Medicare \nprivatization; did not pay for it; charged it to our grandchildren.\n  Now, when it is not giving money to the drug companies or paying for \na war, or giving tax cuts to the richest people in America, now, all of \na sudden, when it is unemployment insurance, a bunch of people who are \nlaid off--or it is a bunch of people who have lost their health \ninsurance--middle-class families, then, all of a sudden, they are \nconcerned about the budget deficit. They did not care when it was \nshoveling money--hundreds of billions of dollars--for a war. They did \nnot care when it was shoveling out money, hundreds of billions of \ndollars, for tax cuts for the rich. They did not care about the budget \ndeficit when it was just shoveling hundreds of billions of dollars to \nthe drug companies and the insurance companies. That did not matter. \nThey did not care about the budget deficit then.\n  Now, Republicans tell us: Oh, we can't extend unemployment benefits \nbecause it would add to the deficit. We cannot help with COBRA. We \ncannot help give some assistance to people for health care because that \nwould add to the deficit. We cannot help the States with what is called \nFMAP, helping the States deal with their Medicaid costs going to many \npreviously working families who have lost insurance. We cannot do any \nof that because all of a sudden the budget deficit is the most \nimportant moral question of our times. Where was this important moral \nquestion of our times when they added $100 billion--hundreds of \nbillions of dollars--to the deficit for a war, for tax cuts, and for \nthe giveaway to the drug insurance companies?\n  I was in the House when the so-called prescription drug benefit, when \nthey created that huge doughnut hole and gave all those subsidies to \nthe drug companies and insurance companies. That vote took place in the \ndead of night while most Americans were asleep. Literally, that vote--\nthe rollcall--started at 3 o'clock in the morning. I was down the hall \nworking there then. The vote started at 3 o'clock in the morning. An \noverwhelming number of Democrats opposed it. Some Republicans who \nactually believed that deficit spending was a problem--a few of them--\nnot very many voted against it. So the vote started at 3 o'clock. \nUsually, a vote in the House of Representatives takes 15 or 20 minutes.\n  Three hours later, they woke up the President of the United States \nand had him start calling Republicans--George Bush then--to change \ntheir vote and vote yes. Finally, after 3 hours--history-making because \nthe House of Representatives never took 3 hours ever; when my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma or my colleague from Maine, who are sitting here, were in \nthe House of Representatives, they never saw us do anything like that--\n3 hours later, finally, President Bush twisted two arms--a Congressman \nfrom Idaho and a Congressman from Oklahoma--to change their votes, and \nthey passed the bill in the middle of the night, this huge bailout. It \nwas a bailout--there is no other word for it--a bailout to the drug \ncompanies and the insurance companies.\n  It was not a benefit for seniors. We could have done that much more \ndirectly and much less expensively and given seniors a prescription \ndrug benefit. No, the Republicans wanted to do a Medicare prescription \ndrug bill. When you give tens of billions of dollars--hundreds of \nbillions of dollars--to the drug and insurance companies and let some \ntrickle down to seniors, that is really the way they believe in doing \ngovernment.\n  All of this hypocrisy must end. It is wrong. It does a disservice to \nthe American people.\n  Let me share a handful of letters that say this way better than I can \nsay it about why unemployment insurance and COBRA are so important.\n  Barbara from Hancock County--that is south of Toledo. Barbara writes:\n\n       I cared for my cancer-stricken father while working full-\n     time and raising my three young children. After my father \n     died, I went back to college. I got an associate's degree, \n     three certificates, and a bachelor's degree. Last year I lost \n     my job. I have been looking for work ever since. I have \n     mouths to feed and student loans to pay back. I don't take \n     fancy vacations. I don't buy flashy expensive clothes. I am \n     over 50. I should be preparing for retirement. Because I \n     can't find a job, though, my small savings is gone. Without \n     unemployment insurance, there is no help for me. I send out \n     dozens of resumes, but no one is hiring. Please tell me what \n     I can do. Because the extension has not passed, I will be \n     living on the streets with my three children.\n\n  Think about that. She is playing by the rules. She worked hard. She \ntook care of her dying father. She has three children. She went back to \nschool. Now she has lost her job, No. 1. No. 2, she has a mortgage; she \nwants to keep her house. She has children to feed. She has student debt \nbecause she did what so many of us want people to do, which is to go \nback to school and make something better of themselves. She lost her \njob. She can't get unemployment insurance because my Republican \ncolleagues have said no to extending unemployment insurance.\n  This isn't a political game. This isn't playing with a bunch of facts \nand figures. This is people like Barbara from Hancock County, OH. We \nall have Barbaras in every State of this country--people who have lost \ntheir jobs and need that unemployment compensation just to tread water. \nWe don't want them to drown. They are not going to get ahead receiving \nunemployment benefits. They are not going to get rich.\n  Remember, as my Republican friends forget, unemployment insurance is \nnot welfare; it is insurance. You pay into it when you are working, you \nget help when you are unemployed.\n  I know the Presiding Officer--whether it is in Eugene or whether it \nis in Portland or wherever it is in Oregon--understands these are \npeople who are working hard. They lost their jobs. They paid into \ninsurance. They should be eligible to receive unemployment \ncompensation.\n  Rebecca is from Crawford County, just 8 or 9 miles from where I grew \nup in Mansfield.\n\n       Today is another day I am spending in tears and obsessed \n     with fear. I am in the ranks of the unemployed. I was brought \n     up with a sense of personal accountability and values. I have \n     attempted every method I can think of to obtain a job to \n     support myself. I won't burden you with a discussion of what \n     it feels like to be uninsured and not be able to see a doctor \n     when I am sick. You keep your fingers crossed. You pray you \n     can treat\n\n[[Page S5196]]\n\n     what ails you with over-the-counter remedies. My unemployment \n     insurance was allowing me to keep a roof over my head, \n     although incurring massive credit card debt for the remainder \n     of my essentials--food, gasoline, eating. Most of us who are \n     looking for work want to return to a normal life. Please pass \n     an unemployment extension so we can continue to survive and \n     maintain a degree of dignity. Allow us to rebuild our country \n     and our economy. I know I am one of millions and my voice \n     alone means very little. Please ask your fellow Senators to \n     at least acknowledge us.\n\n  Think about what she said. She is obsessed with fear. Her future is \nuncertain. She has lost her unemployment. She has lost her job. She is \nnot getting unemployment insurance now. She said she was brought up to \nbelieve in personal accountability, personal responsibility, and those \nvalues. She said: My unemployment insurance was helping me to at least \nget along, even though I was adding to my debt because unemployment \ninsurance is never really enough to do all you need to do. She points \nout that, as most people do, she wants to work. She sends out resumes \nevery week. You don't just get unemployment insurance by going like \nthis. You get unemployment insurance by filing for it, showing that you \nare out of work. You have to show that you are searching for work, \nseeking work, and you can't find it in this economy.\n  Whether it is Rebecca in Crawford County or Barbara in Hancock County \nor whether it is somebody from Oregon, you don't just automatically get \na job.\n  It is clear that it is hard to find work, and these are people who \nare out trying. If they are not able to find a job, they should be \ngetting this unemployment extension.\n  Three more letters, briefly.\n  Georgetta from Warren County:\n\n       I am an unemployed single mother of two children, 10 and \n     14. I was laid off through no fault of my own. I have been \n     doing what I can to secure a new job. I am about to lose my \n     unemployment insurance. How can I feed my children? How can I \n     keep a roof over their heads? What am I supposed to do? My \n     savings are gone. I have no health insurance. I am trying to \n     find a job. I can take the pain, but I can't sit by and watch \n     my children suffer through no fault of their own. Please help \n     me. Please pass an unemployment insurance extension.\n\n  I wish my colleagues who walk down into this well and, when their \nname is called, vote no--I wish they would meet people like Georgetta. \nI wish they would sit down with the Georgettas in their State and \nlisten to their stories. I wish they would look at the pain in her face \nthat she has because of her children suffering, not getting the food \nthey need, the clothes, the books they need for school, not even sure \nshe is going to have a roof over their heads. Think about that.\n  Again, I think we don't know very many people--my colleagues who vote \nagainst unemployment insurance, my guess is most of them don't know \nanybody who lost their job, lost their insurance, lost their house. My \nguess is they haven't thought through the conversation a parent has \nwith a son or a father has with his daughter telling them the news that \nthey are going to have to move out of their house, maybe move into a \ndifferent school district, maybe just not know about the future because \nthey are about to lose their home they have lived in for the last 5 or \n6 years. What is that like for a parent to explain that to a child?\n  I ask my colleagues to try to empathize and try to put themselves in \nthat position, when that conversation takes place, when parents have \nlost jobs and then health insurance and then their homes.\n  Joe from Pickaway County, south of Columbus:\n\n       I was laid off last year after working at a company for 13 \n     years. I am still unemployed. I have lost my house, my car, \n     my credit rating, and my liberty. I relied on unemployment \n     benefits to feed my family. If UI is not extended, there will \n     be people and families starving. Please do what you can to \n     help us.\n\n  This is in another part of the State, southern Ohio, Appalachia, OH. \nJoe worked at a place for 13 years. The company laid him off. He is \nunemployed. He has lost his house and his car and he is struggling. If \nwe don't extend unemployment benefits--even with unemployment benefits, \nhis life is not going to be very easy, but without it where does he \nturn? What does he do? He goes to food banks. He lives on the street. \nWhat does Joe do in Pickaway County if we don't extend unemployment \nthis week? He shouldn't be waiting any longer.\n  The last letter is from Amy from Hamilton County. That is where I was \ntoday, near Cincinnati. Amy is writing saying:\n\n       I am among the many Ohioans who lost their job due to the \n     economic downturn that started 2 years ago. My husband and I \n     did not live beyond our means. We bought a modest house. We \n     lived reasonably on what we could afford. I encourage you to \n     continue to push through passage of the UI extension. It will \n     help pay for basic bills like our mortgage, food and \n     utilities. UI is crucial to my family's viability. Please do \n     whatever you can to pass the extension. We want to restore \n     our basic way of life.\n\n  She is saying unemployment benefits would not make her life easy, \nwould not even make her life comfortable in any way, but unemployment \ninsurance would give her the bridge until she can, when the economy \ngets better, find a job.\n  I conclude by just saying again that I hope my Republican colleagues, \nwho have consistently voted no on extending unemployment benefits and \nhelping people keep their health insurance, will open their eyes and \nlook around their States and talk to people, look at the mail they are \ngetting, look at what they are hearing from constituents on the \nInternet and e-mails and try to put themselves in the shoes of a father \nwho lost his job and his insurance and has to explain to his kids they \nlost their house or a single mother who was renting and can't even pay \nthe rent because she has lost her insurance and she is going to have to \nfigure out how to explain to her children they will be in a different \nschool district and they don't even know what it will be yet.\n  As people without jobs often do, they change from one school district \nto another one, and their kids fall farther and farther behind.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues who consistently vote no to try to \nempathize with those who have less privileges than we do, who don't \nhave huge staffs and don't have a good salary and don't have good \ninsurance and don't have a secure place to live, what their lives would \nbe like if any one of us lost all of those privileges. I think it would \nmake a difference in how they vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. MERKLEY assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5196-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5196-S5197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          2009 METRO ACCIDENT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a sad day for the \nNational Capital region. On the eve of the 1 year anniversary of the \ndeadliest accident in Metro's history, I would like to extend my \ndeepest condolences to the families of the nine victims who perished on \nJune 22, 2009. On that day around 5 p.m., a Red Line train collided \nwith another train that sat stopped between the Takoma and Fort Totten \nstops as it waited for the Fort Totten station to clear. The first car \nof the moving train, an outdated model over 30 years old, sustained \ntremendous structural damage which resulted in significant casualties. \nAs Virginian, this issue is especially important to me because 1 of the \n9 victims who died--the train's operator--as well as 15 of the 80 \npeople injured were fellow Virginians.\n  The unfortunate events of that day shed light on some glaring \nproblems with our Nation's public transportation systems, and should \nprovide us with a sense of urgency to accomplish the task of ensuring \nthe safety of public transportation users.\n  Metro itself and its oversight agency--the Tri-State Oversight \nCommittee--TOC--are both in dire need of reform. While it has taken \nsteps towards addressing the problem, Metro needs to continue to make \nsafety its top priority. Full analysis of potential hazards and safety \nconcerns needs to be done, and Metro must start regimented data \ncollection efforts so that safety problems can be tracked and \nprioritized. Top Metro executives--those with decisionmaking \nauthority--need to be involved in critical safety conversations, and \nneed to have the relevant information in their hands when making \nimportant safety decisions.\n  I am proud that we have been able to provide $1.5 billion in Federal \nfunds over 10 years to make capital improvements to Metro, but this \ncannot be a blank check. Replacing the outdated 1000 series railcars is \na huge priority, and Metro is poised to sign the contract that will \nenable them to phase\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\nout the older cars with newer, safer models. But more needs to be done. \nMetro needs to demonstrate safety improvements it has been making and \nensure that it will continue to make safety its top priority if it \nexpects continued financial support.\n  More broadly, this accident has highlighted that the safety of our \npublic transportation systems should be a priority nationwide. We have \nbeen working in the Senate developing a legislative approach to \nensuring proper safety standards are in place. Incredibly, FTA \ncurrently has no authority to regulate our Nation's transit agencies or \ndevelop national safety standards. A new draft bill developed by \nSenators Dodd, Shelby, and Menendez will give FTA the tools to develop \na national transit safety plan while also providing states the \nresources and flexibility to develop more robust transit safety \noversight. The Banking Committee, of which I am a member, will soon \nconsider this legislation and I am pleased that we are moving towards \nmaking progress in this area so that preventable tragedies, such as the \none that occurred a year ago, will be a thing of the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5197-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Specialist Christopher W.

LESLIE IRELAND\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the confirmation \nof Ms. Leslie Ireland, the President's nominee to be the Assistant \nSecretary of the Treasury for Intelligence and Analysis.\n  This is an individual who is well qualified, nominated to an \nimportant national security position, and whose nomination has sparked \nno opposition or controversy to the best of my knowledge. Nonetheless, \nfor more than 3 weeks her nomination has languished on the Senate \ncalendar as Ms. Ireland has waited to be confirmed.\n  Let me speak briefly about Ms. Ireland and the position to which she \nhas been nominated.\n  Leslie Ireland is a 25-year veteran of the Central Intelligence \nAgency. She has substantial experience in just about all aspects of the \nintelligence profession. Following a successful career at the CIA, her \ntwo most recent positions were that of Iran mission manager in the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence and as one of the \nPresident's daily intelligence briefers.\n  In both capacities, she has worked extensively with all parts of the \nintelligence community. As the President's briefer, Ms. Ireland has \nbeen familiar not only with the breadth of intelligence analysis the \ncommunity produces, but also the policy context in which intelligence \nis used.\n  She worked directly for the Nation's premier intelligence consumer--\nthe President. His evaluation of her professionalism and capability is \nreflected in the fact that he nominated her for this Senate-confirmed \nposition.\n  As Iran mission manager, Leslie Ireland was given the responsibility \nover intelligence collection and analysis of what is perhaps our \nNation's most challenging intelligence target. She oversaw, \nprioritized, and directed efforts to understand the Iranian government, \nnuclear program, military, and society. This is a position with deep \nmanagement and analytic challenges.\n  Through Ms. Ireland's work as Iran mission manager, she was already \nwell known to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence before she \nwas nominated to be an Assistant Secretary of Treasury. She had \nappeared at numerous hearings and far more briefings, both for \ncommittee members and the staff.\n  Under the leadership of both of our past chairmen, Senators Roberts \nand Rockefeller, the committee had an Iran study group to follow, \noversee, and authorize intelligence activities with respect to Iran. \nThe staff met often with Ms. Ireland, and I believe it was a productive \nrelationship on both sides.\n  So it was no surprise that when Ms. Ireland was nominated on April \n12, the committee moved quickly to consider the nomination. She was \nvoted out of the committee on May 25 with the committee's unanimous \nsupport. She is ready to assume her new duties, and it is well past \ntime for the Senate to act.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, let me say a few words about the \nAssistant Secretary's position. It is a fairly new one, having been \ncreated in December 2003 in that year's Intelligence Authorization Act.\n  The Office of Intelligence and Analysis at Treasury has one foot \nwithin the Department of the Treasury, assisting the Secretary and \nother senior departmental officials to set policies on sanctions and \ndeclarations.\n  A notable recent example is the effort by the Treasury Department to \npush, successfully, for the strongest international sanctions to date \nagainst Iran in United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 1929. \nSanctions and international efforts such as this require careful \nanalysis and are the product of intelligence designed to shine a light \non the financial and other illicit activities of bad actors, including \nin this case the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n  At the same time, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis has its \nother foot inside the intelligence community. Its personnel focus and \nhelp prioritize the financial intelligence collection efforts of those \nagencies that collect human, signals, and geospatial intelligence that \nanalysts need.\n  The Treasury office also provides expertise on financial and economic \nmatters that are necessary for broader intelligence community issues. \nFor example, a recent issue of great interest is the financing of \nterrorist groups like al-Qaida and the militant and extremist groups \nwith which they operate, like the Taliban, the Haqqani Network, and the \nPakistani Taliban, the TTP. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis \nhelps inform the intelligence community on this topic.\n  It is critical to understand the financial activities of these groups \nboth to understand how they operate and to provide keys to disrupting \nthem.\n  In Afghanistan, our troops face a well-funded Taliban enemy that \nrelies on illicit funding for its lifeblood--and for the ammunition and \nimprovised explosive devices that put our troops' lives at risk.\n  In the tribal areas of Pakistan, al-Qaida affiliated terrorist groups \nmay be seeking to fund attacks on our homeland such as the unsuccessful \ncar bomb attempt in Times Square. Among the most important impacts of \nthe recent death of the third highest ranking al-Qaida figure, Shaykh \nSa'id Al-Masri, is the anticipated loss to the organization's \nfundraising.\n  As North Korea continues its erratic violent behavior and considers a \ntransition of power from Kim Jong Il to his son Kim Jong Eun, its \neconomy has been further wrecked by a disastrous devaluation of the \ncurrency.\n  These are the issues that confront the Assistant Secretary of \nTreasury for Intelligence and Analysis. It is a position that has been \nvacant since September 2009. There is no excuse for that vacancy to \ncontinue another week. The Senate has before it a nominee who is well \nqualified to fill this role. She has the full support of the \nIntelligence Committee, and there has been no controversy or opposition \nto her throughout the confirmation process.\n  I urge the Senate to confirm Leslie Ireland.\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5198-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CELEBRATING WEST VIRGINIA DAY\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I call to the Senate's attention that \non June 20, 147 years ago, a 35th State was added to our great Nation: \nWest Virginia, whose birthday is a time for us to remember proudly our \nstate's rich history, culture and unique qualities.\n  Nearly 150 years ago, West Virginia became the only State to have \nseceded from a Confederate entity to join the Union. Each year after, \nWest Virginia has continued to develop its own identity and contribute \nto our Nation's fabric. Our State's history, past and present, is rich \nwith development and progress that fills West Virginians with pride \nevery day.\n  West Virginia's mountainous terrain, countless river valleys, and \nrich natural resources have driven our State's history and economy, and \ndraw visitors from across the globe. Our State possesses timeless \nlandmarks and attractions, and has an abundance of natural beauty to \nshare.\n  President John F. Kennedy once said, ``The Sun does not always shine \nin West Virginia, but the people always do.'' This statement is a true \ntestament not only to the kind and hospitable nature of our citizens, \nbut also to our fortitude, determination and abiding faith.\n  Though a ``stranger to blue water,'' West Virginia has been no \nstranger to turmoil throughout its history. We have been and will \ncontinue to be undaunted in overcoming the challenges of yesterday, \ntoday, and tomorrow.\n  This year we stood together to face the tragic explosion at the Upper \nBig Branch mine that claimed the lives of 29 miners and left a \ncommunity and our whole state in mourning, calling again on the \nsteadfast spirit of our people. The devastating effects of the \nexplosion left mining families holding their breath for news of loved \nones. Rescue teams and the State's Red Cross and Salvation Army \nexpeditiously rose to the challenge to offer much needed support. True \nto custom, West Virginians across the State were ready and remain eager \nto lend a helping hand to their neighbors affected by the disaster.\n  And this year, like so many others before, we have called on the West \nVirginia National Guard to serve the State when we need them most, and \nto perform invaluable duties outside our borders--providing security on \na global scale. Our West Virginia National Guard has garnered top \nrankings for readiness for many years, showcasing the motivation and \ncommitment behind each one of our men and women serving our country.\n  West Virginia possesses the unique ability to make the traditions we \nhave historically treasured as much a part of our bright future as our \naccomplished past. Our State continues to retain its culture as an \nintegral part of our identity. Festivals and events, like Bridge Day at \nthe New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville and the Vandalia Gathering \nin Charleston, bring older and younger generations together to enjoy \nState treasures and traditions. Blues festivals can be found across our \nState, and from Martinsburg to Mullens you can find world-class \nartisans and craftsmen in the fields of glass blowing, classic \nwoodwork, and folk art.\n  Thanks to West Virginia's dedication to education, our academic \ninstitutions consistently bring new discoveries to the fields of \nscience and technology. And, our athletic programs continue to rank \namong the best in the country. West Virginia University's men's \nbasketball team reached the Final Four in this year's NCAA Basketball \nTournament representing the state on a national stage. And, football \nfans across our state eagerly await an upcoming football season that \npromises to be successful for all of our programs in West Virginia.\n  There is so much to honor, celebrate, and be thankful for on West \nVirginia's 147th birthday. Our past, present, and future are as \ncolorful as our Appalachian hills in autumn. Our people know and live \nwell by our motto-- Montani Semper Liberi--``Mountaineers are always \nfree,'' and our strong work ethic, one of God and family, and \nindubitable spirit makes our country and our State great. With these \nwords ever present, and on behalf of myself and my fellow West \nVirginians, I proudly wish the happiest of birthdays to my home State, \nWest Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5198-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5198-S5199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STEVE KIMBELL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to honor Vermont's leading \npolicymaker, Steve Kimbell, who announced his retirement on May 20 of \nthis year. For over three decades, Mr. Kimbell has been a major \npresence within the political world of Vermont and is noted as the most \nrespected and influential policy maker to walk the halls of our \nStatehouse.\n  Mr. Kimbell started his career as a lawyer at Vermont Legal Aid after \ncompleting his juris doctor from the University of Michigan Law School. \nOnly a few years later, he was hired as lieutenant governor candidate \nMadeleine Kunin's campaign manager and went on to be her State planning \ndirector after she was elected Governor. Mr. Kimbell then partnered \nwith Governor Kunin's former press secretary Bob Sherman to form \nKimbell Sherman Ellis, a government and communications company that has \ngrown into the most successful firm of its kind in the State. Kimbell \nSherman Ellis developed a nationwide clientele and has additional \noffices in Washington, DC and Massachusetts. Along with advising and \npolicymaking for Vermont State government, the firm provides \nlegislative and regulatory strategy in government affairs and manages \nmarketing and public relations campaigns nationwide.\n  Steve Kimbell has been credited with helping to shape almost every \npiece of major legislation to pass through the Vermont Statehouse. I \noffer my congratulations to Mr. Kimbell upon his retirement. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from the \nRutland Herald that depicts the contributions that Steve Kimbell has \nmade to the State of Vermont.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, May 30, 2010]\n\n                        Politician's Politician\n\n                           [By Peter Mallary]\n\n       Steve Kimbell can be tightly wound. But the other day \n     sitting in his office at Kimbell, Sherman & Ellis--the \n     Montpelier-based government and communications firm he \n     started with Bob Sherman back in 1987--he looked completely \n     relaxed. It is a small office, which he shares with his \n     partner's son, Nick Sherman. Kimbell's chair was kicked back. \n     His smile was broad and available.\n       Steve Kimbell just quit his job.\n       ``I never expected to work forever,'' he said.\n       Well, you could have fooled most of us.\n       And he has.\n       In most cases more than once.\n       Kimbell is the politician's politician, a lobbyist and \n     counselor who has built relationships unlike any other in \n     Vermont's political world.\n       He started out as a Legal Aid lawyer.\n       ``I spent my time suing state government,'' he said. \n     ``Mostly welfare and Medicaid cases.''\n       And he remains a government skeptic.\n       ``My underlying personal philosophy is that government is \n     very dangerous,'' Kimbell said. ``It's a huge operation. And \n     it breaks the law every day. This is the foundation of my \n     advocacy for every client. All citizens need to be watchdogs. \n     But we get paid to do it.''\n       No shock to any who know him--Steve Kimbell's decision to \n     retire is a political one. He tied it to Jim Douglas' \n     decision not to run for a fifth term. He pointed out that a \n     political shift like the one we may see this election cycle \n     only comes along every decade or so. Whatever happens there \n     will be a new political cast. So it seemed to him like the \n     right time to give a different generation a chance.\n       There was nothing sudden about his decision. The partners \n     in the firm have been planning for this for a year. But wary \n     of making Kimbell a lame duck in his final legislative \n     session they kept the story close, a remarkable \n     accomplishment in a town that does not guard political \n     secrets particularly well.\n       Not at all, most of the time.\n       I asked him if he could really quit.\n       ``I have gotten up and gone to work for 40 years,'' he \n     said, ``either working for myself or somebody else. It will \n     be a major change but it's worth a shot.''\n       He says he is going to tend the farm in Tunbridge.\n       I am not 100 percent convinced.\n       Kimbell's career spans the terms of every governor since \n     Tom Salmon--Salmon, Snelling, Kunin, Snelling again, Dean and \n     Douglas.\n       He reflected.\n       ``Governors are not noted for their sense of humor,'' \n     Kimbell said, referencing a quality he values in \n     politicians--politicians like Art Gibb, Bob Gannett and Ralph \n     Wright.\n       ``Snelling made an art form of being the intimidating \n     presence in the room.''\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\n       Not very funny.\n       ``Howard was frantic. Not much time for levity.''\n       But Salmon, Kimbell said, was funny.\n       ``He would hop into his state police car and say 'Let's go \n     to Boston.' And he'd go to see a Red Sox game.''\n       Kimbell first got directly involved in electoral politics \n     in almost as off-hand a manner.\n       ``After the '78 session I was leaving the Statehouse with \n     Madeleine [Kunin]. She was chair of the Appropriations \n     Committee and running for lieutenant governor. 'I need a \n     campaign manager,' she said. I got paid $150 a week. She beat \n     Peter Smith by 2,500 votes.''\n       And he recalled how Kunin won.\n       ``Within earshot of reporters, Peter Smith said that 'all \n     the broads' were going to vote for Madeleine. That ill-\n     advised comment is what swung the election.''\n       When Kunin was governor Kimbell served for two years as her \n     state planning director, the person in charge of the \n     administration's legislative program.\n       ``I found that I didn't really like working inside the \n     government,'' he said. ``I got out and went back to my \n     private practice.''\n       Then came the partnership with Kunin's press secretary, Bob \n     Sherman.\n       ``We went to Seyon Pond fishing and talked about what we \n     really ought to do. We concluded that combining law and \n     journalism in a firm to do advocacy was a good idea.''\n       And to call it just that is an understatement. Kimbell \n     Sherman & Ellis has no peer in Vermont. Not only is it the \n     most successful lobbying firm in the state, it has also built \n     an out-of-state client list which now represents about half \n     of the business. It has offices in Washington and does \n     business all over the country, tracking and reporting on \n     issues and also specializing in crisis management.\n       When I asked Kimbell about the most dramatic moment in his \n     political memory, he recalled the death of Richard Snelling \n     in August of 1991.\n       ``How many times does a sitting governor just drop dead,'' \n     he said.\n       Howard Dean was in touch almost immediately.\n       ``Howard called Sherman and said 'I need a speech within an \n     hour,''' Kimbell recalled. ``And we helped the new governor \n     make the transition. He was here for a lot of meetings. And \n     we took some heat. The press said 'How can these lobbyists \n     advise the new governor.' A lot of the criticism was probably \n     warranted, but sometimes you just have to do things.''\n       And Howard Dean is not the only politician to have beaten a \n     path to Steve Kimbell's door. For a couple of decades now \n     candidates and potential candidates have come to Kimbell & \n     company. They want to know--from someone who does--if they \n     should or if they shouldn't.\n       ``We are in the business of politics,'' Kimbell said. ``It \n     doesn't matter where they come from. If they want to talk to \n     us, we give advice.''\n       And Steve Kimbell has brought this sort of matter-of-fact \n     attitude to all his efforts. Despite his highly visible work \n     for civil unions and gay marriage, he insists that his \n     approach is always the same.\n       ``I'm an advocate,'' Kimbell said. ``I take a hard-nosed \n     approach. To do this job you have got to be well prepared, \n     emotionless and tenacious. Gay marriage was a hugely \n     emotional issue. I worked very hard to be analytical and \n     strategic. It is my personal belief that that is what people \n     pay us for.''\n       Hard-nosed. True enough.\n       Savvy. Unparalleled.\n       Matter-of-fact. Certainly.\n       Passionate. Despite protestations.\n       And funny.\n       The politician's politician.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5199-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO PATRICIA J. COVINGTON\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it has been nearly five decades \nsince Patricia J. Covington, Director of VA's Congressional Liaison \nService, began her public service, and nearly all of it has been with \nVA, first when it was the Veterans Administration, and, since 1989, as \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs. Although she served in various \ncapacities, it is in connection with her long and distinguished tenure \nat the Congressional Liaison Service that my colleagues and I, along \nwith our staffs, know her. I am sure that there is not a Member's \noffice in the U.S. Senate that does not regularly call upon her \nservices. Over the years, Pat has worked tirelessly to ensure that our \nrequests for information about VA or for help for veteran constituents \nare handled in a timely, thorough, and nonpartisan manner. On the \noccasion of her upcoming retirement, I call on my colleagues to join me \nin thanking her for assistance to us and to countless veterans, most of \nwhom will never know the critical role she has played in our efforts to \nimprove their lives.\n  Pat entered public service in 1963. After an initial period of \nemployment with another Federal agency, she moved to VA where she \ngained experience at the Board of Veterans Appeals with the appeals \nprocess for denials of disability claims. She also helped administer \nthe Presidential Memorial Certificate Program, established by President \nJohn F. Kennedy to honor the memories of deceased veterans. As my \ncolleagues know, each certificate bears the President's signature and \nconveys to the families of deceased veterans the Nation's gratitude for \ntheir service.\n  After gaining a hands-on understanding of many VA benefits and \nservices, Pat joined the Congressional Liaison Service in 1971. The \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, which I have the privilege of chairing, \nwas established that year, marking the Senate's heightened commitment \nto addressing the then-emerging challenges facing veterans of the \nVietnam war. I was not in the Senate at that time, but looking back at \nthe large and impressive work of the early days of the committee in \nresponding to a host of complex issues, along with the fact that there \nwere thousands of new veterans seeking assistance from their Federal \nelected officials, it must have been a very challenging time in Pat's \nnew assignment. From the start, she nevertheless kept pace with the \nunprecedented number of demands, deepening her knowledge about VA as \nshe took on new responsibilities. In fact, Pat was so good at her job \nthat over time she was repeatedly tapped to serve as Acting Director of \nthe Congressional Liaison Service. In 2002, she was appointed as \nDirector, and has continued to excel in that position.\n  Not long after I became committee chairman in 2007, a veteran arrived \nat the committee to seek help after being turned down by VA for \nadditional benefits in connection with post-traumatic stress disorder. \nHe had driven thousands of miles and related to committee staff that he \nhad struggled with suicidal feelings. At the time, although VA had not \nbegun to reckon with the rising tide of veteran suicides, Pat knew who \nto contact to provide counseling and other suicide-prevention services \nto the veteran and promptly secured a thorough review of his claim. Her \ncompassionate and deeply informed assistance to this veteran was in \nkeeping with her longstanding excellent work.\n  Committee staff and I have relied on Pat and the excellent staff she \noversees for information about a wide range of matters relating to the \nlarge and complex dimensions of VA's mandate. From disability \ncompensation to health care, construction and cemeteries, home long \nguaranties and the new G.I. bill, her office has consistently responded \nwith the highest professional standards. With a war on two fronts and \nincreasing numbers of returning servicemembers from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, along with serious issues facing veterans from earlier \nwars, her contributions have never been more valued nor her services \nmore needed. Yet to everything there is a season, and a time to every \npurpose under the heaven. Pat is ending this chapter in her life and \nwill soon open a new one. Again, I thank her for her long service to \nthe committee and her unsurpassed commitment to the veterans of the \nNation. I wish her every happiness in the days to come. We shall miss \nher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5199-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5199-S5200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WILDROSE, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

Wildrose reached its peak \npopulation of 518 in 1930.\n  Grace Lutheran Church, located in Wildrose, will also celebrate its \n100th anniversary on July 4.

Pettibone, who named the growing community \nafter himself. The post office was established on September 1 of that \nyear. Pettibone is the home of the late William Hurley, a successful \ncivil rights lawyer who won the first monetary settlement against the \nKu Klux Klan in the 1960s.\n  Today, Pettibone is a town of about 75 people located in the \nnortheastern part of Kidder County. It contains several different \nbusinesses including a Cenex, a grocery store, two bars, a cafe, and a \npost office. With its gently rolling hills, German-Russian, \nScandinavian, and Dutch immigrants found the land suitable to \ncultivating large fields of the crops they knew how to farm. Today, \ntheir descendants grow wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, flax, and beans--\nall crops that continue to be important to our country's agricultural \nindustry.\n  The 100th anniversary festivities will include a parade, a carnival, \na magician, fireworks display, demolition derby, and other celebratory \nevents.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Pettibone, ND, and \nits residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well in the \nfuture.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nfor one year the special depreciation allowances for certain property; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, over the past several months, we have seen \nsome improvement in our economy.\n  One year ago, in the first quarter of 2009, GDP was declining at an \nannual rate of more than 6 percent. Just 1 year later, in the first \nquarter of 2010, GDP grew at an annual rate of 3 percent.\n  This marks the third consecutive quarter of real economic growth.\n  It is not just the GDP that is growing. Consumer spending has risen \nat an annual rate of 3.5 percent this year. Manufacturing output rose 9 \npercent over the first 4 months of the year. Businesses have increased \nspending on equipment and boosted their inventory investments.\n  But one economic indicator continues to lag behind--employment.\n  The national unemployment rate stands at 9.7 percent. Over the course \nof this Great Recession, the American economy has lost more than 8 \nmillion jobs. In total, 15 million Americans remain out of work.\n  We must act to create jobs and get Americans back to work.\n  We began creating jobs with the 2009 Recovery Act. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office reports that last year's Recovery Act added \n1.2 to 2.8 million people to America's payrolls.\n  In March, Congress passed the HIRE Act. The HIRE Act, which includes \na payroll tax exemption for new hires, should help to bolster job \ncreation in the coming months.\n  This week, we are considering the American Jobs and Closing Tax \nLoopholes Act. That bill will create jobs by providing tax cuts and \ncertainty to American businesses. It will create jobs by improving our \nnation's infrastructure. And it will create jobs by making direct \ninvestments in jobs for young adults and needy families.\n  After we consider the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act, \nthe Senate will consider a small business jobs bill. The Finance and \nSmall Business committees are currently writing that bill.\n  Today, I am introducing another important jobs bill. This bill will \nextend bonus depreciation through 2010. I am introducing this extension \nas a stand-alone bill because of the unique ability of bonus \ndepreciation to help businesses and create jobs.\n  In 2008, Congress temporarily allowed businesses to recover the costs \nof certain capital expenditures more quickly than under ordinary \ndepreciation schedules. The 2008 law allowed businesses to immediately \nwrite off 50 percent of the cost of depreciable property placed in \nservice in 2008.\n  The Recovery Act extended bonus depreciation. But the provision \nexpired at the end of 2009.\n  My bill would extend bonus depreciation to property placed in service \nin 2010.\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\n  Bonus depreciation provides a double benefit. It helps two sets of \nbusinesses. It helps the business that purchases the equipment. It \nhelps the business that sells the equipment.\n  The businesses that purchase equipment can write off those purchases \nmore quickly.\n  This provides a significant tax savings. That savings makes equipment \nmore affordable and encourages purchases.\n  The savings gained from expensing, rather than the slower \ndepreciation, allows businesses to use that money to invest in the \nbusiness itself. Businesses can use those savings to hire employees.\n  The more purchases that are made, the more other businesses are \nhelped. This proposal will help manufacturers and suppliers to retain \nand hire employees as their businesses rebound.\n  I have heard from a number of business owners in Montana that bonus \ndepreciation has been extremely helpful for their business.\n  An extension of bonus depreciation will boost economic activity by \nhundreds of millions of dollars. It will create hundreds of jobs in my \nhome state of Montana.\n  Bonus depreciation is a cost-effective provision that provides real \nrelief for businesses. Bonus depreciation creates jobs.\n  I urge my Colleagues to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BEGICH (for himself, Mr. Wyden, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 3514. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \nprohibit a person from entering into any Federal oil or gas lease or \ncontract unless the person pays into an Oil Spill Recovery Fund, or \nposts a bond, in an amount equal to the total of the outstanding \nliability of the person and any removal costs incurred by, or on behalf \nof, the person with respect to any oil discharge for which the person \nhas outstanding liability, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation requiring \nBP and other oil companies to set aside ample funding in an escrow \naccount controlled--not by the company but by the Federal Government--\nto address the damage and claims from a major catastrophic oil spill \nlike the current Gulf of Mexico spill.\n  Twenty-one years ago, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground, \ngushing an estimated 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska \nwaters. This was the worst oil spill in American history, with oil \nhitting 1,300 miles of shoreline and killing hundreds of thousands of \nbirds and marine mammals. Thousands of hard-working Alaskans, just like \nthe residents of the Gulf, lost millions of dollars as their \nlivelihoods collapsed.\n  To add insult to injury, for nearly two decades Exxon fought the \nlegitimate claims of Alaskans harmed by the spill for nearly two \ndecades. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court when in 2008, \nthe Court issued a final judgment, reducing Exxon's punitive liability \nto just 10 percent of what the original court had ordered. During those \n19 years, hundreds of Alaskans entitled to damages had died; thousands \nof others' lives were forever harmed.\n  We Alaskans learned many lessons from the Exxon Valdez spill. One of \nthe most important was to set up a system as early as possible to \nguarantee that those affected by oil spills are justly compensated. \nThat is what my bill is designed to do. I am certainly pleased BP has \nagreed to set up an escrow account voluntarily, but I believe Congress \nshould underscore their commitment in law and to protect Americans from \nfuture spills.\n  This bill, the Guaranteed Oil Spill Compensation Act of 2010, \nrequires BP or any other party responsible for an oil spill interested \nin future Federal oil and gas leases to deposit into an escrow account \nheld by the U.S. Government enough money to compensate those affected \nby a spill. In the event of a spill, the Secretary of Interior can make \nan assessment of outstanding liability under provisions of the Federal \nlegislation passed in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez, the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990, OPA 90. The spiller must then deposit funds \nequal to the total liability minus the liability established for \nincident by OPA 90 into a separate fund to be administered by the \nSecretary for claims and costs related to that spill. Unexpended funds \nwould be returned to the spiller at the earlier of 5 years after the \ndate of deposit or the date the Secretary determines all Federal, \nState, and civil claims have been satisfied. The measure would have no \naffect on other liability.\n  I believe this legislation achieves what many of us want: ensuring \nAmericans damaged by this oil spill and future catastrophic spills are \nfairly compensated in a timely way. This didn't happen to Alaskans with \nthe Exxon Valdez. We must ensure it does happen for our Americans in \nthe Gulf of Mexico. This is another tool as Congress works on liability \nreform designed to make those injured whole again, while at the same \ntime allowing responsible companies to provide oil our country needs.\n  The Guaranteed Oil Spill Compensation Act of 2010 is the first of a \npackage of bills I intend to introduce designed to make oil companies \nfinancially responsible for the cost of oil spills; expand scientific \nresearch, especially in the Arctic; provide a steady source of Federal \nfunding for additional science and resources needed in the Far North to \ndeal with oil and gas development; and provide greater citizen \ninvolvement in oil development.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mr. Udall of Colorado, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 3515. A bill to authorize and enhance the programs of the \nDepartment of the Interior relating to the detection of, response to, \nand mitigation and cleanup of oil spills on Federal land managed by the \nDepartment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues \nSenator Mark Udall and Chairman Jeff Bingaman of the Senate Energy \nCommittee to introduce the Department of the Interior Research and \nTechnologies for Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act of 2010. \nLegislation intended to make sure we have the proper resources \navailable to respond to future oil spills.\n  While we are still getting to the bottom of what caused the Deepwater \nHorizon disaster in the Gulf, one thing is absolutely clear: BP was \ntotally unprepared to respond, contain and clean-up this kind of spill.\n  From ``junk shots'' to containment domes that failed to work at \ndepth, BP was caught totally flat footed by this spill. Even BP's CEO, \nTony Hayward, admitted that BP didn't ``have the tools in the toolbox'' \nto respond to this spill.\n  The oil and gas industry has poured significant sums of money into \ndeveloping technologies to find and produce oil and gas, but when I \nasked oil executives at a recent Energy Committee hearing what they've \ndone in the way of research and development to respond to and clean up \noil spills the response I got was: little to nothing.\n  The technologies being used today in the Gulf are the same \ntechnologies we used twenty years ago to clean-up the Exxon Valdez \nspill. The oil and gas industry needs to do better. Since they won't do \nit themselves, they can pay the government to lead on research and \ndevelopment. We need to have updated, innovative, and effective \ntechnologies at the ready to clean up after any oil spill--large or \nsmall.\n  We have to make sure that--through proper research and development--\nwe are prepared to prevent and respond to future oil spills. And that \nis what my legislation is intended to do.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senators Udall and \nBingaman does the following:\n\n       It creates a new Oil Spill research and development program \n     within the Interior Department to focus on research and \n     development technologies to respond to, contain and clean up \n     oil spills and ensure we're prepared to respond to future \n     spills.\n       It establishes an independent Scientific Advisory Board to \n     identify gaps and focus the research and development program \n     on priority areas. We know the concerns of the scientists \n     were ignored leading up to the Deepwater Horizon explosion. \n     This provision will make sure their important voices are \n     heard.\n       It makes the oil and gas industry pay for this critical \n     research and development. In order to make sure this import \n     effort has the resources it need to be successful, my \n     legislation creates a dedicated funding source to pay for \n     this research and development, and\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\n     this funding will come entirely from royalties, rent, and \n     bonuses from domestic oil and gas producers.\n\n  This legislation is one part of a broader effort to ensure that we \nare prepared for future oil spills and that the catastrophe in the Gulf \nnever happens again.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to incorporate this \nlegislation into comprehensive legislation the Senate is crafting to \nrespond to the Deepwater Horizon spill and reform the federal agency \nresponsible for oil and gas development in the outer continental shelf. \nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that we can ensure \nwe are prepared to handle future oil spills.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3515\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A resolution to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act \nto reform the management of energy and mineral resources on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nOuter Continental Shelf Reform Act of 2010. This act takes a number of \nimportant steps to ensure that the Outer Continental Shelf will be \nmanaged in a balanced, prudent, and vigilant way, to ensure energy \nproduction, safety, and protection of the environment. Its goal is to \ncreate a culture of excellence in this endeavor that benefits those who \nwork in the oil industry, those who depend on other marine resources, \nand all Americans who care deeply about our oceans and coastal \nenvironment.\n  This legislation is being introduced against the backdrop of oil \nstill gushing into the Gulf of Mexico more than 60 days after the \ninitial explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig. As the Congress \nformulates its overall response to this disaster, its first order of \nbusiness must be to continue to care for the families of those who lost \ntheir lives in the rig explosion and those Gulf residents who are \nsuffering every day through loss of livelihood and of places and \nwildlife that they love. Several Senate committees have important roles \nto play in formulating legislation in that regard.\n  At the same time, it also is essential that we look to the future, \nand to creating a better structure and system within the regulatory \nagency. That is a particular responsibility of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources. One goal must be, of course, to prevent future \ndisasters. But we can and must do more than that.\n  Congress should create organizational resources and a set of \nprinciples and requirements that will have safety, environmental \nprotection, and innovation at its core. We should require that both \nindustry and agency employees have the expertise, experience, and \ncommitment to quality necessary to handle the complex issues involved. \nIf we do this right, it is my hope that we can see tangible results on \nall fronts, and a shift away from the cascade of failures that led to \nthe Deepwater Horizon accident and towards work of the highest quality.\n  Thus, this bill clarifies the multiple responsibilities of the \nDepartment of the Interior in managing the Outer Continental Shelf--\nappropriate energy and other economic development and the protection of \nhuman health and safety and the marine and coastal environment. It \nreforms the structure of the regulatory apparatus of the Department \nconsistent with these responsibilities. The new organizational \nstructure requires that the Department avoid organizational conflicts \nof interest between its revenue-raising missions and its planning, \npermitting, and regulatory missions.\n  The bill increases the safety requirements for drilling wells, \nfocusing on best available technology, a systems analysis, risk \nassessment, an evidentiary safety case, and a full engineering review. \nIn furtherance of the development of these standards and their \nevolution of new and better technology, it requires new research \nprograms within the Department, independent of the leasing program, \nwhose data must be considered by the regulators. It provides dedicated \nfunding for the highest priority research, including in the areas of \nwell control and spill response, and an independent science advisory \nboard outside the agency to provide oversight.\n  It establishes new requirements for investigation of all accidents \nand the public sharing of data from those reviews so that all can learn \nfrom mistakes before they become major problems. It allows the National \nTransportation Safety Board to provide an independent and highly \nskilled investigation of any accident at the request of the Secretary.\n  In order to fully enforce the safety requirements, the bill imposes \nan inspection fee on industry participants to fully fund enough well-\ntrained inspectors to perform real and meaningful inspections more \noften. It also increases the sanctions on poor operators, including \nincreased civil and criminal penalties applicable to those who violate \nthe law, and the financial responsibility requirements to ensure that \nthose who participate in development of the Outer Continental Shelf can \nafford to pay for any damage they cause.\n  The bill provides the Department of the Interior with adequate time \nto carry out necessary reviews, clarifies the issues that need to be \naddressed, and makes the input of other Federal agencies occur in a \ntransparent way. In this way, the process will have more predictability \nand all stakeholders will have greater understanding of what is under \nconsideration. The result will be better decisions that will be capable \nof being implemented with greater certainty.\n  Finally, the bill takes steps to ensure that the taxpayers will get a \nfair return for development of energy resources. The Secretary will be \nrequired to regularly review the amounts of royalties and other charges \napplicable to those developing the Outer Continental Shelf, compare \nthem to charges levied by States and other countries, and consider \nwhether adjustments are necessary to achieve fair fiscal policies.\n  I believe these policies and resources can set us on a new and \nconstructive path toward managing the incredible natural resources of \nthe Outer Continental Shelf. I welcome ideas from others that may \nenhance our ability in this regard. We must commit ourselves to the \ngoal of excellence in this important endeavor. We start today.\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Murkowski, ranking Republican on \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Senator Dorgan, as \noriginal cosponsors of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3516\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I came here to talk about a couple of \nissues on the Armed Services Committee that we are going to be facing.\n  I only say to my good friend from Ohio that, yes, it is true that 9/\n11 occurred, and that we have al-Qaida out there, and there are the \nTaliban and other terrorists who want to kill everyone in this room and \nall throughout America, and that we were not in a position, \nfinancially, to go and defend our country after 9/11.\n  I suggest that, after Pearl Harbor, the same situation took place. We \ndidn't have time or the luxury of saying do we have the resources to go \ninto this. But it was necessary and it did happen.\n  Unfortunately, back in the 1990s, during the Clinton administration, \nthe amount of money funding our military reduced by about 40 percent--\nnot just the money but resources too. It went down in terms of force \nstructure, modernization, and operations and personnel, about 40 \npercent. There was kind of a euphoric attitude at that time, and people \nwere saying that the Cold War was over and we no longer needed the \nmilitary. I remember it so well. Then, of course, with the downgrading \nof the military and the peace dividend--we all remember the peace \ndividend--we would take the money that was going to go to the military \nand declare a peace dividend.\n  Unfortunately, peace is not there, and 9/11 happened. This President \nand this Congress inherited a war, an attack on America, the most \nvicious attack we have had on our homeland in the continental United \nStates. We had to fight with a reduced army. We had to rebuild the army \nat the same time.\n  If I had known the statement was going to be made by my good friend \nfrom Ohio, I would have brought my charts to show clearly what happened \nto the military during the 1990s.\n  Yes, we do have that problem. It is an expensive war. It is an \nenduring war. We have all been over there. We know we are going to win. \nThings look very good right now in Iraq. It is going to be a little \nmore difficult. It is necessary to do because if we had not done it, we \nwould have had the Taliban and al-Qaida--all of these groups--running \nrampant over there.\n  The big difference now in terms of how it affects the United States \nof America is that back in the days before they had the nuclear weapons \nand the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, a terrorist could \nhave a case bomb, something such as that. Now we are talking about \nweapons of mass destruction. We are talking about Iran which, according \nto our intelligence estimates, as early as 2015 could have an ICBM \ncapable of hitting the United States of America on the east coast. That \nis why it is so much more difficult.\n  Also, my good friend from Ohio talks about the Republicans. It was \nnot the Republicans who did the $787 billion stimulus program that did \nnot stimulate. Those were the Democrats. That is not why I am here.\n\n\n                            New START Treaty\n\n  Mr. President, I noticed on this week's agenda--and I am reading now; \nI think this is right--we are going to have three more hearings in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee on the New START treaty. That means \nwe will have had, when that is over, 16 Senate Foreign Relations \nwitnesses, over 7 hearings, all of them supporting the New START \ntreaty.\n  I am reminded of what happened back when we were considering another \ntreaty, the Law of the Sea Treaty. That passed the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee 16 to 0, as I recall. When it came to the floor, I \nrecognized--and, frankly, not many others did--that this was a very \nserious issue. This is the treaty against which Ronald Reagan fought so \nhard. It was coming up. That was a Republican administration. That was \nthe first President Bush. They were going to run this thing through.\n  We held hearings. At that time, the Republicans were in the majority. \nI made sure we had hearings in both of my committees--the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, as well as the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  I see the same thing happening. I gave a lengthy talk last week--I am \nnot going to repeat it now--about why we should oppose the New START \ntreaty. We all remember START I. We all remember START II. Keep in \nmind, the treaty we are talking about is a treaty not with the \ncountries where we are anticipating problems. It is between Russia and \nthe United States and it has to do with weapons of mass destruction, \nwith nuclear warheads, reducing them in conjunction with reductions \nthat would be imposed upon Russia and, at the same time, delivery \nsystems. We have three ways of delivering them. One is, of course, \nICBMs, one is SLCMs, submarine-launched missiles,\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\nand the other is through aircraft, such as the B-52 and B-2.\n  The problem with that is we have been talking about our nuclear \nwarheads and how we have not been able to modernize them or even to \ntest them for a matter of decades. So we do not know what we have.\n  In the way of force structure, we do know we have a declining force \nstructure. This administration put down the new system that would have \nbeen the next generation bomber. We are stuck with the B-52. The first \nvariety of that came out in 1964 before a lot of people around here \nwere born, and, of course, the B-2. We are not going to modernize that.\n  The missile defense system--we saw what happened over in Poland. This \nPresident made a determination to stop the construction of a ground \nsystem in Poland that would have had the capability by 2012 of knocking \ndown an ICBM from Iran to the eastern United States. That is gone.\n  There is no verification, very much the same as the verification we \ntalked about with the Law of the Sea Treaty and others.\n  I hope when this treaty comes up, we can keep talking about it and \nnot let it run through. I am going to make this very clear. I happen to \nserve on the Foreign Relations Committee, as well as the Armed Services \nCommittee. We will be having hearings. We have three more this week. \nNot one of these hearings has a witness who is opposed to the New START \ntreaty. They are all witnesses who are right there with the President \nand part of that program.\n\n\n                         Don't Ask, Don't Tell\n\n  The other issue that is coming up--no one is talking about it now, \nbut it is something that did come up in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee reauthorization hearing and we will be considering that \nbefore too long. They made strong statements to do away with don't ask, \ndon't tell. I remind my colleagues, back in 1993, we had this problem \nof how to deal with gays in the military. The Clinton administration \ncame up with the program don't ask, don't tell. Quite frankly, it has \nworked very well since 1994, since it went into effect.\n  For us to unilaterally say we are going to change that and have gays \nopen in the service so that people are really not there to serve but to \nuse the military to advance a personal agenda is wrong.\n  Here is the interesting thing about it because all the military \nagrees with what I am saying right now. At least they did until the \nWhite House got involved. I am not sure where they are now.\n  On April 28, both Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen said in a joint \nstatement:\n\n       We believe in the strongest possible terms the department \n     must prior to any legislative action be allowed an \n     opportunity to conduct a thorough, objective and systematic \n     assessment of the impact of such a policy change.\n\n  So they did. They decided they would conduct this study and report \nback this December 1.\n  To let you know where the military is on this issue--all the chiefs \nof the military--General Casey of the Army said:\n\n       I remain convinced that it is critically important to get a \n     better understanding of where our soldiers and families are \n     on the issue and what the impacts on readiness and unit \n     cohesion might be so that I can provide informed military \n     advice to the President and to the Congress.\n\n  He said also:\n\n       I also believe that repealing the law----\n\n  We are talking about the don't ask, don't tell law----\n\n     before the completion of the review will be seen by the men \n     and women of the Army as a reversal of our commitment to hear \n     their views before moving forward.\n\n  What he is talking about is he made a commitment--we made a \ncommitment--to all the military that before we repeal this law that has \nbeen working well since 1994, we want to get all the inputs. So we set \nup a mechanism where they--they, I am talking about all the troops that \nare out there--can evaluate this and make a determination as to how \nchange in that law could impair our readiness situation.\n  Admiral Roughhead of the U.S. Navy said:\n\n       We need this review to fully assess our force and carefully \n     examine potential impacts of a change in the law.\n       My concern is that legislative changes at this point, \n     regardless of the precise language used, may cause confusion \n     on the status of the law in the Fleet and disrupt the review \n     process itself by leading sailors to question whether their \n     input matters.\n\n  We asked for their input, then we declare what the results are, which \nthey have done in the House and actually in the Senate committee with \nlanguage.\n  General Conway of the Marines said:\n\n       I encourage the Congress to let the process the Secretary \n     of Defense created to run its course.\n\n  That is the study that goes to December 1.\n\n       Collectively, we must make logical and pragmatic decisions \n     about the long-term policies of our Armed Forces--which so \n     effectively defend this great nation.\n\n  General Schwartz of the Air Force said:\n\n       I believe it is important, a matter of keeping faith with \n     those currently serving in the Armed Forces, that the \n     Secretary of Defense commissioned review be completed before \n     there is any legislation to repeal the [don't ask, don't \n     tell] law. Such action allows me to provide the best military \n     advice to the President, and sends an important signal to our \n     Airmen--\n\n  Of course, he is the Air Force Chief, so he is concerned about \nairmen--\n\n     and their families that their opinion matters. To do \n     otherwise, in my view, would be presumptive and would reflect \n     an intent to act before all relevant factors are assessed, \n     digested and understood.\n\n  That is the military. That is what they all agree. I think it is very \nimportant that we keep in mind that we made the request, a preliminary \nreview of some 13,000 service members and families being interviewed. \nThat is 13,000 interviews; 400,000 would undergo a survey. We would get \ntheir input through a survey. Our military is not asking for this \nchange.\n  So that is what it is all about. That is what we are faced with. And \nI think the only way to stop this if we really believe the military is \nright and that we are right--and I would say this: I have a letter that \nis signed by myself and Senator McCain--from all of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee: Senators Brown, Inhofe, Thune, Burr, Sessions, \nWicker, Vitter, Chambliss, and LeMieux, all of us--saying that we need \nto wait until such time as the results are in before doing something.\n  I am very concerned about this. The 1993 law states--and I am reading \nfrom the 1993 law now--``There is no constitutional right to serve.'' \nThe military is a ``specialized society'' that is ``fundamentally \ndifferent from civilian life.'' In living conditions offering little or \nno privacy, homosexuality presents an ``unacceptable risk'' to good \norder, discipline, morale, and unit cohesion--qualities essential for \ncombat readiness. Making this retroactive is another serious problem \nwith this change they are talking about.\n  So I think those of us who are on the relevant committees are going \nto be trying to appeal to this body to consider that those issues, \nthose amendments that were passed right down party lines be \nreconsidered on the floor and that individuals are going to have to \nhave an up-or-down vote on this very critical issue. It is very \ninteresting that when we had a report that was due December 1, now all \nof a sudden it has to be done before the election. Obviously, it is all \nfor political reasons.\n  So I guess I would just say to my colleagues, get ready because we \nare going to have an open debate on this floor. And I would think that \nmyself and some others might want to make this a major issue for \ndiscussion and even require a cloture vote before it is over.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/21/senate-section/article/S5214-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
