Mr. President, last week, I criticized the Republican \nleader for the way he was handling Wall Street reform. I even \ncriticized him for a series of meetings he held in New York and the \nresult of the meetings. I want the record to be very clear, however, \nthat I in no way was impugning the integrity of my friend from \nKentucky.\n  The senior Senator from Kentucky and I have fundamental policy \ndifferences on a number of issues, but no one should take my \ndisagreement with my friend to question his honesty.\n  Wall Street reform is as complex as the financial instruments that \nfueled a worldwide recession. But voting to start on the Wall Street \nreform is as simple as right and wrong. This bill and the debate are \nabout the ability to trust our financial system again. They are about \ngiving families the peace of mind that they will be able to keep their \nhomes, that their savings will be safe.\n  We have a responsibility to bring accountability to Wall Street \nbecause each of us is accountable to the American people. We owe our \nStates' constituents and our Nation's taxpayers the promise that they \nwill never again have to endure a financial crisis such as the last \none.\n  Today, the vote to begin debate on Wall Street accountability will \nanswer many questions. It will reveal who believes we need to \nstrengthen oversight on Wall Street and who does not. It will \ndemonstrate who believes we need to strengthen the protections of \nconsumers and who does not.\n  In light of the extraordinary effort we have seen from the Republican \nleadership, it will force each Senator to publicly proclaim whether \nparty unity is more important than economic security. I know many on \nthe other side would like to pretend that is not what is at stake. But \nwe are not fooled and neither are the American people, two-thirds of \nwhom we learned today support cracking down on Wall Street.\n  This past weekend I was in four different counties in Nevada. I heard \nthe same thing everywhere I went, from everyone with whom I spoke. They \nsaid: Get this done. So many Nevadans are suffering because of the mess \nWall Street created, and they know better than anyone that we have to \nfix it. Democrats agree.\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\n  That is why we stand for guaranteeing taxpayers that they will never \nagain be asked to bail out big banks and that no Wall Street firm can \nbecome too big to fail.\n  Democrats stand for giving families more control over their own \nfinances and for giving consumers more clarity so they can make the \nright financial decisions.\n  Democrats stand for protecting the life savings of hard-working \nAmericans from Wall Street's gambling. We stand for making our \nfinancial system more transparent so we can rein in risky bets before \nit is too late.\n  In short, Democrats stand for bringing more accountability and \ntransparency to Wall Street. As far as I can tell, the only thing \nRepublicans stand for is standing together. They boasted about banding \ntogether at this time at all costs, even at the cost to our national \neconomy. But a party that stands with Wall Street is a party that \nstands against families and against fairness. Among the many reasons we \nneed to reform Wall Street is that those who work there have conspired \nfor too long under the cover of darkness. They have acted recklessly \nbecause they know they will not be held accountable for their risks.\n  They do not think twice about using working families as pawns in a \nget-rich-quick scheme. I would direct everyone to read the best seller, \n``The Big Short,'' by Michael Lewis. It is stunning in describing what \nthey do with our money on Wall Street.\n  When you come to Nevada to gamble at one of the casinos, you are at \nleast gambling with your own money. The people on Wall Street are \ngambling with our money. We know Wall Street does not like this bill. \nOf course it does not. It changes the system big bankers and hedge fund \nmanagers have taken advantage of for years.\n  Look at the rules of the road on Wall Street. Traders get to gamble \naway someone else's money with little risk and large reward. They get \nto take home their winnings and ask taxpayers to save them from their \nlosses. That is how the system worked when they brought our economy to \nthe brink of collapse.\n  Sadly, today the problem is it is still the way the system works. \nThat is what we are going to correct with this legislation, a bill that \nis the product of months of bipartisan discussions, a bill that \nembraces Republican ideas and Democratic ideas.\n  This afternoon's vote is a vote merely to begin debate; it is not the \nend of the process, just the beginning. All we are asking is to be able \nto start debating. My Republican colleagues certainly do not hesitate \ndebating this bill in press conferences or in interviews. So why would \nSenators object to debating it on the floor itself, the Senate floor?\n  Moving to this bill will move this issue from the sidelines to the \nplaying field. It will bring these proposals onto the Senate floor so \nwe can amend them, improve them, and act upon them. It will ensure this \ndebate is part of the legislative process, broadcast live on television \nso every American around the country can watch and weigh it. Let's have \nthat debate.\n  There is one more reason we need to reform how this financial system \nworks. For far too long, too many on Wall Street have bet on failure--\nyes, on failure. They have made billions betting on the housing market \ncollapsing or other failures in the economic system.\n  We will see this afternoon whether enough Republicans on Capitol Hill \nare determined to bet on failure also. I hope not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2606-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later today, the Senate will cast its \nfirst vote in the debate over financial regulation.\n  And let me just say this at the outset: Republicans are united in our \ndesire to protect the taxpayer from those who would put them and our \nNation's financial system at risk through recklessness, stupidity, \ngreed, or some combination of the three.\n  But as we consider this legislation today, Republicans are also \nacutely aware of the fact that government solutions to big, complex \nproblems like this one are rarely as effective as they are made out to \nbe, especially when they are rushed.\n  And Republicans are conscious of something else this afternoon too: \nwhen it comes to fixing the problems that we see in the economy or in \nour healthcare system or anywhere else, the days of taking the \nDemocrats' word for it are over.\n  There is a reason public confidence in government has slipped to one \nof its lowest levels in half a century, and it is not because Congress \ntakes its time to get legislation right. The reason Americans are so \nmistrustful of government at the moment is because on issue after \nissue, they feel as though they are being sold a bill of goods. The \nreason there is such a serious trust deficit out there is because what \nAmericans see is so rarely what they get from Washington these days.\n  Just consider the national debt, for example. The International \nMonetary Fund is right now warning us that mounting government debt is \nperhaps the greatest single threat to the global financial system. As a \nSenator, the President seemed to understand that. He said America's \ndebts and deficits were spinning out of control and that it was a \nfailure of leadership not to address them. Yet under his \nadministration, the debt has increased over $2 trillion. In February, \nwe ran the largest monthly deficit ever. And this year alone, we are \nexpected to run a deficit of $1.4 trillion.\n  What about the stimulus? Congress passed this trillion dollar bill \nabout 18 hours after the legislative text was available, because \nDemocrats said they needed it right away to keep unemployment from \nrising above 8 percent. A year later, unemployment is hovering around \n10 percent. It is even higher in Kentucky and other States. We have \nlost some 4 million jobs since the President took office, and every \nday, it seems, we hear about some new wasteful project funded by this \nbill.\n  Then there is health care. The White House and its allies in Congress \ntold the American people again and again and again that this \nlegislation was absolutely necessary in order to cut the cost of care \nand to ensure our Nation's economic security. Americans were skeptical. \nThey wanted us to take our time. But Democrats said they could not \nwait. They cut their deals and jammed it through.\n  Now we are beginning to see who was right in that debate.\n  Last Thursday, a report out of the Department of Health and Human \nServices concluded that the health care bill falls short of the \nPresident's goals. Rather than cutting costs, it is expected to \nincrease them.\n  The White House also said the bill would not raise taxes on the \nmiddle class. Yet now we are finding out that nearly 15 million middle \nclass Americans, as defined by the White House, will get hit with a tax \nincrease. The White House said premiums would come down too. Yet now we \nare learning that premiums will keep going up.\n  Pick the issue. Whether it is the stimulus, the debt, health care, \nbailouts, you name it, the concerns Republicans raised are being \nvalidated. And Democrats have the nerve, in this debate, to say that we \nare the ones who are being dishonest.\n  As I said, all of us want to deliver a reform that will tighten the \nscrews on Wall Street. But we are not going to be rushed on another \nmassive bill based on the assurances of our friends on the other side. \nIt is just this kind of rush that gets us a $13 trillion debt, a \ntrillion dollars for turtle tunnels and sidewalks to nowhere, and a so-\ncalled health care reform bill, the primary effect of which, so far as \nI can tell, is higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher costs. \nAmericans have been rushed by this Congress before. They have seen the \nresults. They are not going to be rushed again.\n  Now when it comes to financial regulations, my constituents have a \nfairly short list of demands. They do not want to be on the hook for \nrecklessness on Wall Street. And they do not think any financial \ninstitution should be considered too big to fail. But if the Senate \nvotes to get onto the Dodd bill tonight, there is good reason to \nbelieve we\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\nwill never truly solve these core problems.\n  Some on the other side may deny this. But the fact is, the bill that \nthe majority leader wants to bring to the floor tonight still contains \na number of loopholes that enable future bailouts.\n  This is not just me talking. A finance reporter on National Public \nRadio last week said he could not find a single expert who was willing \nto agree with the administration's claim that this bill puts a stop to \ntaxpayer funded bailouts, not a single expert who was willing to say \nthis bill really solves the problem we were asked by our constituents \nto solve. Is not that reason enough to slow down?\n  If we can not look our constituents in the eyes and tell them with \nabsolute certainty that we have addressed their core concerns, then \ntell me: Why are we voting on this bill?\n  The Democrats want us to trust them on this one. With all respect, \nAmericans aren't in a trusting mood at this point. The burden is now on \nthe Democrats to prove it when they say their legislation will or will \nnot do something. To a lot of Americans that is what this debate has \nbecome. It is about proving to our constituents and to the rest of the \ncountry that Congress can actually deliver on its assurances.\n  Americans aren't inclined to take our word for it when we say this \nbill doesn't allow for bailouts, that it won't kill jobs, or that it \nwon't enable the administration to pick winners or losers, like it did \nwith the auto bailout. They have heard all that before. This time, they \nwant us to prove it.\n  They want us to prove that this bill doesn't allow for bailouts or \nthe kind of regulatory overreach that ends up punishing Main Street \nunder the guise of reforming Wall Street. They want us to show them \nwhere it says in the text that the next time there is a crisis, the \ngovernment will have to seek permission from he taxpayer if it is \nthinking about creating a new bank debt guarantee program. At the \nmoment, we can't say this. That is unacceptable to my constituents. And \nit is unacceptable to the rest of the country.\n  We can solve this problem. But we won't solve the problem if we vote \nfor cloture tonight. A vote for cloture is a vote that says we are done \nlistening to the American people on this issue. And a vote against \nending this debate is a vote for bipartisanship, for working out an \niron-clad solution to the problem of too big to fail. A vote against \nending this debate tonight is a vote that says it is no longer enough \nto tell our constituents to trust us. It is a vote that says this time, \nwe will prove it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2607-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as is well known by my colleagues and most \nAmericans, over the last several days, the Governor of Arizona signed \nlegislation, which is controversial, which is designed to affect the \nissue of illegal immigrants into the country across the Arizona border. \nThat legislation was enacted by the Arizona legislature and signed by \nthe Governor because of the frustration the Governor and the \nlegislation and, indeed, the majority of my constituents have over the \nFederal Government's failure to carry out its responsibility to secure \nour border. Many viewed this as a civil rights issue. There is no \nintention whatsoever to violate anyone's civil rights, but this is a \nnational security issue. This is a national security issue where the \nUnited States has an unsecured border between Arizona and Mexico which \nhas led to violence, the worst I have ever seen, and numbers that \nstagger those who are unfamiliar with the issue--such as 241,000 \nillegal immigrants were apprehended on the Tucson sector border of \nArizona in the last year. Do the math. You have three to five times \nthat number who actually cross, so we are talking about a million \npeople crossing the border illegally.\n  This is not just a human smuggling issue. This is a drug issue. Our \nborders are unsecured, and the flow of drugs across the border is \nstaggering. Last year in the Tucson sector alone, there were over 1.3 \nmillion pounds of marijuana apprehended, 1.3 million pounds on the \nArizona border. The numbers of methamphetamine, cocaine, and other \ndrugs crossing the border by the drug cartels is staggering. The Los \nAngeles Times reported last week that over 22,000 Mexican citizens have \nbeen killed in drug wars against the cartels. Have no doubt, this is an \nexistential government between the Government of Mexico, the drug \ncartels, and the human smugglers who work together, and the security of \nthe United States.\n  The violence has already spilled across our borders, and unless we \nget it under control, it will get worse. Three American citizens were \nmurdered in Juarez, Mexico as they were trying to find their way home. \nA rancher in southern Arizona was murdered as he was out patrolling his \nown property. The people in southern Arizona have had their rights \nviolated by the unending and constant flow of drug smugglers and human \ntraffickers across their property. Their homes are being broken into. \nTheir rights are being violated, their rights as American citizens to \nlive in a safe and secure environment, as most of the pundits who are \ncriticizing this legislation enjoy.\n  The fact is, our borders are broken. They are not secure. It is a \nFederal responsibility to secure our borders. It is not being done. \nSenator Kyl and I have a 10-point plan that can be enacted immediately \nin order to secure the borders and secure them quickly.\n  Before I ask my colleague to comment, there is a question about \nwhether we can secure our borders. Of course, we can. We have seen in \nthe Yuma sector of Arizona a dramatic decrease in illegal crossings and \ndrug smuggling. Again, I want to mention to my friend from Arizona, \nhave no doubt that this is not just a human smuggling problem and \npeople trying to cross the border illegally to find work. This is a \nhuman smuggling cartel aligned with the drug cartels that are sending \ndrugs across our border and killing our citizens. The cartels and the \nhuman smugglers are a direct threat to the security of this Nation. Two \nweeks ago a highly organized syndicate that takes people who are coming \nacross our border illegally to Tucson, puts them in vans, taking them \nto Phoenix and distributing them all over the country. These \nindividuals come from as far away as China.\n  Have no doubt of the extent of the problem, the organization, the \ncruelty, the barbarity of the challenge we face, of the drug cartels \nand the human smugglers that are just south of our border, and the \nState of Arizona has been bearing the brunt of it. The administration \nhas failed to act. We need 33,000 Border Patrol agents down on the \nborder. We need the National Guard, 3,000 troops. We need to take a \nnumber of other steps Senator Kyl and I will describe. This situation \nis the worst I have ever seen. It is time for the Federal Government to \nact. If you don't like the bill the legislature passed and the Governor \nsigned in Arizona, then carry out the Federal responsibility to secure \nthe border. You probably wouldn't have had this problem.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. May I ask my colleague, who has been down on the border \nfairly recently. He went to the Tucson sector which is a sector that \nhas about half of all of the illegal immigration in the entire United \nStates coming across; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have. If it was 241,000 last year that were \napprehended, there are estimates that as many as five to one are not \napprehended. So that could have been over a million people who crossed \nthe Arizona border illegally in 1 year. That is staggering in itself.\n  Mr. KYL. The point here is, the Tucson sector is one of two sectors \nin Arizona. It is maybe 60 percent of our\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\nsouthern border. The Yuma sector may be the other 40 percent. The \nTucson sector ends at the New Mexico border. We are talking about a \ncouple of hundred miles, give or take--not that much area when we \nconsider the entire, more than 2,000-mile border all the way from the \nGulf of Mexico to the San Diego area. About one-tenth of the entire \nborder area accounts for over half of all the illegal immigration. My \ncolleague was there within the last month or so. I was down in the Yuma \nsector. The reason I mention these two sectors is that it is literally \nthe tale of two approaches to immigration reform. As Senator McCain \nsaid, there is absolutely no doubt that application of the right \nprinciples and resources to the border can secure the border.\n  Let me give my experience in the Yuma sector and then ask my \ncolleague to talk a little more about the Tucson sector. Those are the \ntwo sectors in Arizona. The Yuma sector has virtually eliminated \nillegal immigration. There is still substantial drug smuggling, and \nthat is a lot of what they are focused on right now. How could this \nhave happened? Mainly three things. First, they completed the fencing \nin that particular area. There are just a couple miles left to go, but \nthey have 11 miles of very good, new double fencing in the urban area \naround Yuma and then vehicle barriers beyond that. There are some areas \nwhere it is even triple fenced. They have enough Border Patrol agents, \nthough we have to be careful we don't take some from the Yuma sector to \nsend over to Tucson where they need more, because it is a little bit \nlike these wars abroad. Once you take the area, you need to have enough \ntroops to hold the area or, when you leave, bad guys come back in. We \nneed the Border Patrol there. If we could add some National Guard \ntroops, as my colleague has recommended, it would absolutely be the \nfinal personnel solution. I can remember when the Guard was withdrawn \nand there was only one guardsman left in the Yuma sector, and they \nstill stayed away. I am not even sure if he had his weapon with him. \nBut let's put it this way: The bad guys on the other side of the \nborder, whether it is the cartels or others, do not want to mess with \nthe U.S. military. They won't. That is the reason my colleague, then-\nGovernor Napolitano, and many others believe we need more National \nGuard on the border.\n  The third thing that brought illegal immigration in the Yuma sector \nalmost to an end is called Operation Streamline. It is very simple. \nWhen you cross the border, you get thrown in jail. The first time it is \nfor about 2 weeks; second time, 30 days. After that, it could be 60 \ndays. The sheriffs tell us that about 17 percent of the people they \napprehend are criminals in the United States or are wanted for crimes \nhere. Obviously, that is the 17 percent you want to catch. You want to \nput them in jail. The rest of them want to come here for work. They \ncan't work and make money while they are in jail. That is a huge \ndisincentive for them to cross in that area. So what the Border Patrol \nand the Department of Justice did was to say, if you cross in this \narea, you go to jail. They stopped crossing in that area. They \ngradually expanded those areas until it finally covered the entire Yuma \nsector. Now illegal immigrant coyotes and cartel folks know that if \nthey try to bring somebody across in the Yuma sector, immediately those \npeople are going to jail. Then they will be going back home, so they \ndon't try it anymore. As a result the statistics are, as Senator McCain \npointed out, in the Tucson sector you had almost a quarter of a million \npeople last year apprehended. Who knows how many more were not \napprehended. How many in the Yuma sector? This year, 4,946 so far--from \na quarter of a million almost to 4,000. It wasn't always so in the Yuma \nsector. In 2006, 118,000 were apprehended. The next year, it went down \nto 37,000. We could see a big impact. And then 8,000, 7,000, probably \n5,000 this year. We can see the impact of the fencing. The personnel \nand Operation Streamline have made a huge difference.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask unanimous consent, with the indulgence of my \nfriend from Hawaii, for 3 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have made my point here. Senator McCain is \nabsolutely right. If you want to do it, you can do it. You just have to \napply the will and the resources. What worked in the Yuma sector could \nwork in the Tucson sector, and almost all of those things are included \nin the 10-point proposal Senator McCain and I have made.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I also emphasize that the violence is worse than it \nhas ever been. Mr. President, 22,000 Mexicans have been murdered on the \nMexican border. American citizens have been murdered on our border. \nThis is no longer a situation where someone from Mexico or some other \ncountry decides they want to cross our borders. These are highly \norganized, highly sophisticated, well-equipped, well-trained, armed \ncartels. Drug and human smuggling cartels coordinate with each other \nthrough these corridors. They have better communication than our \nenforcement agencies due to our lack of interoperability. They have \nsophisticated equipment. They are even sending drugs over using \nultralights.\n  This is a struggle for the existence of the Government of Mexico. \nThis is a struggle on our side of the border for the fundamental \nobligation any government has; that is, to provide its citizens with \nsecure borders. Right now, our citizens are not safe, and therefore the \nFederal Government should be fulfilling its responsibilities to provide \nthe necessary equipment and manpower to secure our borders. As my \ncolleague from Arizona just pointed out, it can be achieved. It is now \na massive failure on the part of the Federal Government. They should \nalso fund it.\n  I thank my friend from Arizona, and I thank my colleague from Hawaii \nfor his indulgence.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2608-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2608-S2609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, enactment of emergency legislation in the \nfall of 2008 to stabilize the financial markets and the economy brought \nwith it an obligation to reform our financial system to make it fairer \nfor working families.\n  I support S. 3217, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of \n2010. I appreciate all of the extraordinary work done by the chairman \nof the Banking Committee and his staff on developing this vital \nlegislation. Many of my colleagues on the committee and I worked \ntogether to develop a bill that protects, educates, and empowers \nconsumers and investors. The legislation incorporates many ideas from \nMembers of both parties. We must act quickly to enact this bill.\n  A lack of consumer protection was a core cause of the financial \ncrisis. Prospective home buyers were steered into mortgage products \nthat had risks and costs they could not understand or afford.\n  We must do more to protect consumers. This legislation includes \nessential protections to do so. The new Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau has tremendous potential for restricting predatory financial \nproducts and unfair business practices. The bureau will work to prevent \nunscrupulous financial services providers from taking advantage of \nconsumers.\n  The legislation also creates an Office of Financial Literacy within \nthe bureau. The Financial Literacy Office is tasked with developing and \nimplementing initiatives intended to educate and empower consumers. A \nstrategy to improve the financial literacy among consumers that \nincludes measurable goals and benchmarks must be developed.\n  I am also proud of the work we have done in the bill to better \nprotect, inform, and empower retail investors. My proposal to create an \nInvestor Advocate within the Securities and Exchange Commission is in \nthis legislation. It is necessary to create an Office of the Investor \nAdvocate within the SEC to strengthen the institution and ensure that \nthe interests of retail investors are better represented. The Investor \nAdvocate is tasked with assisting retail investors to resolve \nsignificant problems with the SEC or the self-regulatory organizations, \nSROs. The Investor Advocate's mission includes identifying areas where \ninvestors\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\nwould benefit from changes in Commission or SRO policies and problems \ninvestors have with financial service providers and investment \nproducts. The Investor Advocate will recommend policy changes to the \nCommission and Congress in the interests of investors. I have highly \nvalued the contributions of the National Taxpayer Advocate, Ms. Nina \nOlson. Ms. Olson has helped us develop policies that have improved the \nlives of taxpayers. A similar office in the SEC will benefit retail \ninvestors. The creation of the Office of the Investor Advocate has \nwidespread support from consumer, labor, and industry \norganizations. Ms. Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for \nthe Consumer Federation of America, has stated that:\n\n       For far too many years, investors have found it difficult \n     to make their voices heard at the SEC on uses that are \n     important to them while business interests have dominated the \n     agency agenda . . .\n\n  The text of an amendment I had developed which clarifies that the SEC \nhas the authority to effectively require disclosures prior to the sale \nof financial products and services is included in the legislation. Many \nworking families rely on their mutual fund investments and other \nfinancial products to pay for their children's education, prepare for \nretirement, and attain other financial goals. We must ensure working \nfamilies have the relevant and useful information they need when they \nare making decisions that determine their future financial condition. I \nappreciate the efforts of Senator Michael Bennet on this issue.\n  I worked with Senator Kohl to develop title XII of the legislation, \nwhich is intended to increase access to mainstream financial \ninstitutions for the unbanked and the underbanked. About one in four \nfamilies is unbanked or underbanked. Many are low- and moderate-income \nfamilies who cannot afford to have their earnings diminished by \nreliance on high-cost or predatory financial services. Underbanked \nconsumers rely on nontraditional forms of credit, including payday \nlenders, title lenders, or refund anticipation loans for financial \nneeds. The unbanked are unable to save securely for education expenses, \nthe downpayment on a first home, or other financial needs. Regular \nchecking accounts may be too costly for consumers unable to maintain \nminimum balances or unable to afford monthly fees. Poor credit \nhistories may also hinder their ability to open accounts.\n  More must be done to promote product development, outreach, and \nfinancial educational opportunities at banks and credit unions intended \nto empower consumers. Title XII authorizes programs intended to assist \nlow- and moderate-income individuals establish bank or credit union \naccounts and encourage greater use of mainstream financial services.\n  Title XII will also encourage the development of small affordable \nloans as an alternative to more costly payday loans. Payday loans are \ncash loans repaid by borrowers' postdated checks or borrowers' \nauthorizations to make electronic debits against existing financial \naccounts. Payday loans often have extraordinarily high interest rates.\n\n  Loan flipping, which is a common practice, is the renewing of loans \nat maturity by paying additional fees without any principal reduction. \nLoan flipping often leads to instances where the fees paid for a payday \nloan well exceed the principal borrowed. This situation often creates a \ncycle of debt that is very hard to break.\n  There is a great need for working families to have access to \naffordable small loans. This legislation would encourage banks and \ncredit unions to develop consumer-friendly, small-dollar loan \nalternatives. Consumers who apply for these loans would be provided \nwith financial literacy and educational opportunities.\n  One example of an innovative payday lending alternative that has been \ndeveloped can be found at the Windward Community Federal Credit Union \nin Kailua, HI. Windward FCU has developed an affordable alternative to \npayday loans to help the U.S. marines and the other members they serve. \nThis program was developed with a National Credit Union Administration, \nNCUA, grant.\n  More working families need access to affordable small loans. We must \nencourage mainstream financial service providers to develop affordable \nsmall loan products.\n  Finally, title XII will enable community development financial \ninstitutions to establish and maintain small-dollar loan programs. I \nappreciate all of the work done by Senator Kohl and his staff on title \nXII.\n  Working families often send substantial portions of their earnings to \nfamily members living abroad. In my home State of Hawaii, many of my \nconstituents remit money to their family members living in the \nPhilippines and other nations. Consumers can have significant problems \nwith their remittance transactions, such as being overcharged or not \nhaving their money reach the intended recipient.\n  Remittances are not currently regulated under Federal law, and State \nlaws provide inadequate oversight. The bill will modify the Electronic \nFund Transfer Act to establish remittance consumer protections. It will \nrequire simple disclosures about the costs of sending remittances to be \ndisplayed in the storefront and provided to the consumer prior to and \nafter the transaction. A complaint and error resolution process for \nremittance transactions would be established by the legislation.\n  We must act quickly to enact this legislation that will protect, \neducate, and empower consumers and investors.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are in morning business, with \nSenators recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I can actually speak in morning \nbusiness, not as if I were in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2609-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2609-S2611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we will be voting at 5 o'clock this \nafternoon on a motion by the majority leader, and I can almost hear him \nnow saying something about the party of no as we talk about the \nfinancial regulation bill. Well, I would say to my friend the majority \nleader that he is rapidly becoming the leader of the party of no by \noffering so many ``no'' motions because the motion this afternoon is \none more of a record number of ``no'' motions offered by the majority \nleader to say no to more amendments, no to more debate, no to checks \nand balances on a runaway government in Washington.\n  What we on the Republican side have been trying to do on the \nfinancial regulation bill is to work with the majority party and the \nPresident to help fashion a set of rules and regulations that takes us \nfrom the financial crisis we had a few years ago, and which continues \ntoday in the lives of Americans everywhere, to complete a bill most of \nus can support so we can say to America and say to the world: These are \nour rules and regulations. We have done our job. We have set the rules. \nEven if Republicans capture control of the Congress in November--which \nwe hope we do--these still will be the rules because we did this in a \nbipartisan way, the kind of way the President talked about when he \ncampaigned for election a couple of years ago.\n  Well, unfortunately, that is not what has been happening. It has just \nbeen one ``no'' motion after another from the majority leader--a record \nnumber of them. And he will even bring that up, which I would \nrespectfully say I would not do. Twenty-six times the majority leader \nhas filled the amendment tree. That is a ``no'' motion that says no \nmore amendments. He has done it nearly as much as the last five \nmajority leaders combined. He has the record in saying no more \namendments, no more debates, and no more checks and balances on what \nthe Congress is doing. There have been 141 times the majority leader \nhas filed cloture on the same day a measure came up. That is simply \nanother no motion. It says no to more amendments, no to more debates, \nno to more checks and balances on the legislation Congress is \nconsidering.\n\n  Someone may say: Well, let's get on with it. Why do we need these \nchecks and balances? We were reminded over the weekend of why we need \nthe checks and balances. All of us remember the health care debate \nresulting in the\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\nhealth care law which passed this Chamber by a partisan majority. We \nwere here day after day after day with the Democrats meeting in secret. \nThe vote came up in the middle of a snowstorm, 1 a.m. in the morning, \nhad to be done before Christmas, nearly 3,000 pages before it all got \nthrough. No check and balance on that bill. We were saying slow down. \nWait a minute. This bill is making a fundamental mistake. It is \nexpanding a health care delivery system we all know we can't afford, \nwhen instead we should be taking steps together to reduce its costs so \nmore Americans can afford to buy health insurance.\n  So over the weekend, a report issued on Thursday by the Chief Actuary \nof the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services--he is the chief \nhealth actuary in the Federal Government; what did he say? Lo and \nbehold, his analysis showed it will increase health care costs instead \nof lowering them. In other words, we will increase--we will increase--\nspending on a health care delivery system we all know we can't afford \ntoday. Yet off we went with our new $1 trillion bill. It will raise \npremiums on health care. It will threaten seniors' access to health \ncare. It will threaten access for Medicaid patients, creating, in \neffect, a health care bridge to nowhere for a great number of low-\nincome Americans who will find they can't get a doctor or, in \nWashington State, that Walgreens will not fill their prescription. This \nwill make that problem worse. To those who are going to be serving as \nGovernor between 2014 and 2019, it is very bad news because it talks \nabout the increased cost of Medicaid, which is the largest government \nhealth care program, and how many of those costs are being passed on to \nStates. I know, in our State, our legislature--Republican--and our \nGovernor--a Democrat--have said we don't see how we can afford this. It \nis estimated to be roughly $1.1 billion, but potentially could be as \nhigh as $1.5 billion. It is going to cause State tax increases, tuition \nincreases at the public universities, and I believe it will seriously \ndamage American public education. Anyone can read this for himself or \nherself.\n  So over the weekend, the Chief Health Actuary of the Federal \nGovernment said the health care law does what we Republicans feared it \nwould. But the psychology on the other side of the aisle was: We won \nthe election. We will write the bill. We will pass it even by a \npartisan majority, unlike civil rights, unlike Medicare, unlike \nMedicaid, unlike social security. It was a purely partisan bill, with \nno checks and balances, and the American people see the results.\n  Here we go again, this afternoon at 5 o'clock. This should be a very \ndifferent situation. It is a very important bill. It is the financial \nregulation of this country. This country produces 25 percent of all the \nmoney in the world every year. Twenty-five percent of the wealth is \ncreated by this country, for just 5 percent of us who are privileged to \nlive here. So one would think we would be as careful as we could be in \ngetting this done.\n  For a long time on this bill, many Members of the Senate on both \nsides of the aisle have been working on it carefully and in a \nbipartisan way. So why would we bring another one of these record-\nsetting ``no'' motions up today to vote on? Why would we say--in the \nmiddle of debate and discussion to improve the bill--let's rush it on \nthrough; no, to more amendments; no, to more debate; no, to more checks \nand balances.\n  There are some pretty big issues to resolve to make sure we have it \nright. There is general agreement, I think, across both sides of the \naisle that we want a situation where we don't have these big banks that \nare too big to fail. The Senator from Virginia, who is the Presiding \nOfficer today and my colleague, and Senator Corker from Tennessee \nworked for a year on this. I went to some of their sessions. It is \ncomplex stuff, but they were coming up with a bipartisan solution to \nthe problem. One of the advantages of a bipartisan solution is, A, it \nmight be more likely to be right; and, B, it almost certainly is more \nlikely to be accepted. If there is a Corker-Warner or Warner-Corker \nsolution, Republican-Democratic solution on banks that are too big to \nfail, then the American people might look up here and say: OK, if they \nboth agree on it, maybe they are right. Maybe I will not worry about \nit, and I will not spend my next 3 years trying to repeal it. Well, the \nsame thing was true on other parts of the issue, and I commend Senator \nDodd, the chairman of the committee, for starting out in that \ndirection. He was working with Senator Shelby on this side on \nconsolidating bank regulators and consumer protection. Senator Reed on \nthe Democratic side and Senator Gregg were working on reforming \noversight of derivatives. As I said, Senator Warner and Senator Corker \nwere working on systemic risk, the too-big-to-fail issue. Senator \nSchumer and Senator Crapo were working on securities and exchange \nissues and corporate governance issues. They weren't coming to an \nagreement on every single one of these issues--the last one is \nespecially difficult--but they are making some real progress. Even \nyesterday, Senator Shelby, who is the ranking member, and Senator Dodd \nsaid on NBC's ``Meet the Press''--Senator Shelby said: ``We are closer \nthan we have ever been.'' Mr. Dodd added: ``We will get it together.''\n  Well, if we are closer than we have ever been and we will get it \ntogether, why are we having this ``no'' vote today? Why are we saying \nno to more amendments, no to more debate, no to checks and balances?\n  That is a serious question for the American people. If I were to \nsuppose in my State what the major issue before the people of Tennessee \nis today, it is that many Independents, almost every Republican, and \nsome Democrats would say: We need some checks and balances on a runaway \nWashington government. Well, here is an opportunity to have some checks \nand balances on a runaway Washington government and to get things \nright. Instead, we seem to have a campaign team at the White House that \nsays, Let's play a little politics and make it look like the \nRepublicans are in bed with the Wall Street bankers. They even said \nRepublicans took contributions from Wall Street bankers, but when the \nnewspapers added it all up, it looks like the Democrats got more \ncontributions from the Wall Street bankers than the Republicans did. So \nif the race is about politics and if the race is about who took the \nmost money from the Wall Street bankers, the Democrats win. That is not \nthe basis upon which we should be deciding this. I like the way the \ncommittee was working on it for the last year: Republican and \nDemocratic teams working to solve big, complex problems for the country \nthat produces 25 percent of all the money in the world and is the \nacknowledged financial capital of the world. But, instead, we seem to \nhave at least a fraction of the administration that says: We won the \nelection, we will write the bill, and up comes the majority leader with \nanother ``no'' motion, a historic, record number of ``no'' motions.\n  I am here simply to say this: This is a piece of legislation that \npresents President Obama and our Congress with a historic opportunity \nto do something right. We are coming out, we hope, of a great \nrecession. We need some signals to our country and to the world that \nthings are stabilizing. Every small businessperson or big \nbusinessperson I talk with says: A little certainty would help. We are \nnot going to hire another person; we are not going to invest another \ndollar until we get a little more certainty in the business environment \nin America, and people are waiting to see how we are going to deal with \nthis too-big-to-fail issue. Are we going to put up rules that will give \nbig banks an advantage over community banks? Are we going to put in \nregulations that are so cumbersome that they move the financial capital \nof America from New York City and Chicago to Washington, DC, or even to \nLondon and Singapore and Shanghai, along with the jobs and the prestige \nand the opportunity for an increased standard of living that goes with \nit?\n  We have, within our grasp, an opportunity to do as Senator Shelby and \nSenator Dodd said. We are close to getting it together. We think we \nwill get it together. If we were to get it together, if we were to be \nable to rely upon the work of Senator Warner and Senator Corker and the \nothers I mentioned who worked together over the last year and stand \ntogether with the President and let him say: Republicans and Democrats \nhave been working for\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\nmore than a year on this. We have taken enough time to develop a \nconsensus in the Senate, a consensus between parties, that this is the \nright thing to do for our country and we want to tell the American \npeople these are the rules for financial regulation and tell the world \nthat the United States of America is capable of governing itself and \nwriting its rules and doing it in a bipartisan way, think of the signal \nthat would send to this country and to the world. It might be a tipping \npoint in the recovery from the great recession, that kind of signal \nfrom Washington, DC. I can't think of a better one. Yet the vote today \nis the opposite. It is another ``no'' motion. No to debate. No to \namendments. No to working together. No to checks and balances.\n  I hope we prevail on this motion and I hope we will say yes to more \namendments, yes to more debates and yes to checks and balances and I \nhope the result is a financial regulation bill affecting this country \nthat all of us can vote for--or at least most of us can vote for; that \nwe can proudly give each other credit for. That is the way we like to \nwork. That is why we came to the Senate. When the country sees that, \nthey will have more confidence in us, in this government, in the \neconomy and the world may, too, and we will have taken an important \nstep forward; and the President will be able to say: Look, this is the \nway I wanted to do it all along. This is what I campaigned on, and I am \nglad we have worked together to get 70 or 80 votes in the Senate to get \na consensus on a financial regulation bill to get this country moving \nagain.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from Delaware, \nSenator Kaufman. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. About 16 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 16 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nthe incredible work he has done on putting this bill together. It is a \nhistoric effort. It is the third historic effort he has taken on this \nyear. That is not just a word, ``historic;'' it is putting into \nperspective the last 40 years. The Senator from Connecticut has been a \nleader on three truly historic pieces of legislation this year. I have \nnever seen a Member do that. There were credit card reform, bringing up \nthe health care reform bill, and now the financial regulatory reform \nbill.\n  I return to the floor to discuss the problem of too big to fail, \nwhich I remain convinced is a key issue in any financial reform bill. \nFirst, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to proceed, \nbecause these issues are of profound importance to our country and they \ndeserve to be debated and voted upon.\n  For example, it was over 10 years ago that Congress debated and \npassed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which formally repealed the Glass-\nSteagall Act's sensible and longstanding separation of commercial \nbanking and investment banking. While this landmark legislation passed \nthe U.S. Senate by a 90-to-8 margin, there were some voices who spoke \nout then that the bill would lead us on a glided path to disaster.\n  I recently reread the speech given in 1999 by the senior Senator from \nNorth Dakota, and I was thunderstruck, truly, by how accurately Byron \nDorgan warned then about the future. There were eight people who voted \nagainst the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. They were Senators Boxer, Bryan, \nDorgan, Feingold, Harkin, Mikulski, Shelby, and Wellstone. I first came \nto this body as a staff person in 1973. I have seen times when a few \npeople in the Senate--I don't think either party has a monopoly on it--\nget together and say the Senate is off in the wrong direction. Those \neight people said that on that day. Senator Dorgan deserves a special \nrecognition and award, because he predicted this in 1999, when he said:\n\n       We will, in 10 years time, look back and say: We should not \n     have done that [repeal Glass-Steagall] because we forgot the \n     lessons of the past.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       This bill will, also, in my judgment, raise the likelihood \n     of future massive taxpayer bailouts. It will fuel the \n     consolidation and mergers in the banking and financial \n     services industry at the expense of customers, farm \n     businesses, family farmers and others.\n\n  That is absolutely amazing. He absolutely totally completely nailed \nit. He predicted it would lead to ``future massive taxpayer bailouts.'' \nI think we should listen to Senator Dorgan now and any prediction he \nmakes about what we are going to do today in the Senate.\n  He also said quite presciently:\n\n       We also have another doctrine . . . at the Federal Reserve \n     Board called too big to fail. Remember that term, too big to \n     fail. . . . They cannot be allowed to fail because the \n     consequence on the economy is catastrophic and therefore \n     these banks are too big to fail. . . . That is no-fault \n     capitalism; too big to fail. Does anybody care about that? \n     Does the Fed? Apparently not.\n\n  These words would work just as well on the floor today. How many of \nus thought the term ``too big to fail'' was coined only in this recent \ndisaster? Not Senator Dorgan. He knew and warned about too big to fail \nin 1999.\n  He also said:\n\n       I say to the people who own banks, if you want to gamble, \n     go to Las Vegas. If you want to trade in derivatives, God \n     bless you. Do it with your own money. Do not do it through \n     the deposits that are guaranteed by the American people and \n     by deposit insurance.\n\n  Again, right on point, and perfectly accurate today. Byron Dorgan and \nBrooksley Born were warning about derivatives in 1999, but we did not \nlisten, And America suffered a catastrophe of monumental proportions--\nless than 10 years after these prophetic words were spoken.\n  Finally, Senator Dorgan said:\n\n       I will bet one day [I think we are at that day] somebody is \n     going to look back at this and they are going to say: How on \n     Earth could we have thought it made sense to allow the \n     banking industry to concentrate, through merger and \n     acquisition, to become bigger and bigger and bigger; far more \n     firms in the category of too big to fail? How did we think \n     that was going to help this country?\n\n  Well, Senator Dorgan, you were right, and we have arrived at that \nday. Let me repeat: Did it help our country? Will it help our country \nin the future? Each Senator has to answer that question.\n  Senator Dorgan knew that further unbinding the financial industry \nwould accelerate the process of deregulation and lead to far greater \nrisks, ushering in a new era of too big to fail and an ever more \ncasino-like version of financial capitalism. He knew that by lifting \nbasic restraints on financial markets and institutions and, more \nimportantly, by failing to put in place new rules to deal with the \nmarket's ever more complex innovations, that this deregulatory \nphilosophy would unleash the forces that would cause our financial \ncrisis and great recession of 2008.\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\n  I could not agree more with Senator Dorgan. Banks and other financial \ninstitutions that are too big to fail have become only more so today. \nThey are so large, so complex, and so interconnected that they cannot \nbe allowed to fail because their demise would threaten the stability of \nthe overall financial system.\n  There are those on the other side of the aisle who propose to simply \nlet them fail. They say the solution is to stand back and let these \nmegabanks follow the normal corporate bankruptcy process. I call that \n``dangerous and irresponsible,'' a slogan of an answer, not a real \nsolution. President Bush did not allow that to happen, and no President \nshould be faced with that decision again. When Lehman failed, our \nglobal credit markets froze and creditors and counterparties panicked.\n\n  We have the opportunity today to restructure our financial industry \nso that it will be safe for generations. That is what the Senate did in \nthe 1930s when it passed the Glass-Steagall Act, and it withstood the \ntest of time for six decades.\n  When I look at the current legislative approach, in my view it relies \ntoo much on regulator discretion and on a resolution mechanism that is \nultimately unworkable for the largest and most complex financial \ninstitutions. Under this arrangement, the megabanks will still have \nincentives to arbitrate their capital requirements, thereby continuing \nto grow and take on even greater and greater risks.\n  The six largest U.S. banks have assets totaling more than 63 percent \nof our overall gross domestic product. Fifteen years ago, the six \nlargest U.S. banks had assets equal to just 17 percent of gross \ndomestic product. In 15 years, it went from 17 percent to 63 percent.\n  Instead of girding a broken regulatory system, Congress must act \ndecisively now to end the ``doom loop'' Senator Dorgan accurately \nidentified and warned the Senate about in 1999. We need stronger \nstatutory medicine.\n  I believe the time has come for Congress to draw hard lines and high \nwalls in statute. We need statutory size and leverage limits on banks \nand nonbanks in order to eliminate too big to fail.\n  Senator Dorgan said he is working on an amendment to address this \nproblem. I look forward to hearing more from Senator Dorgan about his \nproposals, and I hope the Senate will listen carefully to him since his \ncredibility on this issue was born in the wisdom he showed in 1999.\n  Congress, which represents the people who are most hurt by the \nfinancial crisis, should not pass the buck to the very regulators who \nfailed to prevent the crisis in the first place. Congress must do it, \nas it did in the 1930s, by separating commercial from investment \nbanking activities and putting limits on the size and leverage used by \nsystemically significant banks and nonbank players alike. This is a \nproposal I introduced last week with Senator Brown and other \ncolleagues.\n  Of course, there are those who make the argument that the problem is \nnot really about size; that these institutions are not actually too big \nto fail. Instead, they say institutions such as Lehman Brothers were \nactually too interconnected to fail based upon interlocking counterpart \nexposures arising from credit derivatives and repurchase contracts.\n  But trying to contrast the distinction between too big to fail and \ntoo interconnected to fail is a distinction without a difference. The \nmassive growth from the derivatives market, including that for credit \nderivatives, which intertwine the fates of banks, hedge funds, and \ninsurance companies through side bets on whether mortgages, corporate \nbonds, or other assets would pay off, moved in lockstep with the \nrunaway growth of the megabanks' balance sheets.\n  All of these activities interconnected their fates, while also making \nthem far more risky and far bigger, so big, in fact, that the failures \nwould threaten the stability of the financial system.\n  As Senator Brown and I emphasized last week, our bill is a \ncomplementary idea, not a substitute to the Banking Committee bill.\n  There are many regulatory provisions in that bill that are designed \nto make the megabanks less risky and less interconnected, and we \nstrongly support them. But why gamble that the regulators will do a \nbetter job now and well into the future when they have the power today \nto impose a redundant fail-safe solution to limit the size and leverage \nof our biggest banks? We will not lose out globally, other than in a \nrace to financial destruction. The limits Senator Brown and I propose \nwould shrink these banks from massively large institutions to only \nlarge institutions, at a size well beyond the level at which economies \nof scale are achieved.\n  As Senator Dorgan asked in 1999: Why leave oversized institutions in \nplace when they are too big to fail? Instead, we should meet the \nchallenge of the moment and have the courage to act to limit the size \nand practices of those literally gigantic financial institutions, the \nstability of which is a threat to our economy. But we can only meet \nthese challenges once the bill reaches the Senate floor. Again, I urge \nmy colleagues to vote yes on cloture and not stand in the way of the \ndebate and collective wisdom from this body that this country so badly \nneeds. If we are to prevent another financial crisis, we must move \nforward with this debate and act strongly in the interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suspect sometime over the next hour and a \nhalf, Members will come to the floor--including the Presiding Officer--\nand I will be glad to take a few minutes and share some opening \ncomments and then give him relief so he can be heard on this matter.\n  I thank Senator Warner and my colleagues on the Banking Committee, \nboth Democrats and Republicans. We have spent a lot of time together \nover the last 2 years now--longer, in fact, going back even before the \narrival of my friend from Virginia.\n  When I became chairman of the Banking Committee in January of 2007, I \nwas asked to pick up this issue. We began to look at the issue of the \nmortgage crisis in the country through all of 2007 and, of course, the \nfollowing year when events began to unfold, culminating with the \ndisaster we encountered in the fall of 2008.\n  The members of the committee have worked very hard. We have had \nliterally hundreds of hearings and meetings, listening to people across \nthe spectrum of how best to address these issues, filling in the gaps \nthat led to the near collapse of our economy; what steps we ought to be \ntaking to provide intelligent, thoughtful, commonsense regulation, as \nwell as to see to it, in the process of doing so, we do not stifle the \nability of this country to lead in the financial sector globally; as \nwell as provide for the innovation and creativity necessary for our \ncountry to grow and prosper economically, the wealth creation that is \nnecessary for our country. It has been a long and arduous journey.\n  I was speaking with Bob Corker of Tennessee, with whom I spent a \ngreat deal of time, as I know the Presiding Officer has as well. I \nthank Senator Shelby, my colleague and former chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, who is the ranking member on our committee. We have spent a \nlot of time on these issues, including some time earlier this \nafternoon, and we will be meeting again depending on the outcome this \nevening one way or the other. We will continue our conversations to try \nto resolve some of these outstanding matters in a very long and complex \npiece of legislation.\n  I will not enumerate every member of the Banking Committee, but \nsuffice it to say, to this juncture, the work they have done has been \ntremendously helpful and has produced a good and strong bill on \nfinancial reform.\n  Today the Senate faces its first vote on the issue, which will occur \nin a little less than 2 hours from now, deciding whether we can even go \nforward and debate the matter. My hope is our colleagues will allow us \nto debate this issue.\n  I understand there are differences. There is hardly unanimity in \ncaucuses, let alone in the Chamber, on the way\n\n[[Page S2613]]\n\nto go, particularly in areas involving systemic risk, dealing with the \nso-called too big to fail provisions, dealing with the provisions of \nhow we administer the notion of exotic instruments, the derivative \ncommunity, and the like. Significant discussions have gone on. The \nassumption we are going to resolve all of those issues prior to \ndebating the issues is somewhat unrealistic if we are trying to reach \naccommodation on all the various matters that are included in the 1,400 \npages of the proposal which we will have before this body.\n\n  Today my plea is not so much on the substance of what is here, \nalthough I am willing to discuss all of that because it is important \nour colleagues know what we have tried to achieve and accommodate in \nour legislation, but a plea to let us get to the debate.\n  I do not think the American people understand this. Regardless of \nwhere you come out on the issues, whether you stand on the various \nprovisions of the bill, I do not know how to explain to people to make \nthem realize how vulnerable we are today in the waning days of April \n2010 as we were in the fall of 2008 when we saw what happened to our \neconomy. Nothing has changed except, of course, jobs have been lost, \nhomes have gone into foreclosure, retirement incomes have evaporated, \nand housing values have declined. Almost $11 trillion in household \nwealth has been lost. That is what has happened over the last 18 \nmonths.\n  We have yet to stand and address what caused that to happen in our \ncountry, to fill in those gaps to provide the regulation, put the cops \non the beat, create provisions that would minimize the next economic \ncrisis. And it will occur. There is nothing I have drafted that can \nprotect our country from future economic difficulty.\n  As certain as I am standing here today, we will face yet another \ncrisis or crises in the future. The question is, Are we going to be \nbetter positioned to minimize that crisis so we do not see the \ncollateral damage that has been caused to businesses, individuals, \nretirement, homes--all of the things that we have suffered because we \ndid not have in place the kind of safeguards that might have put a \ntourniquet on this problem in its earliest stages, not to have \neliminated the crisis but certainly eliminated the damage it caused \nbecause we did not have the cops on the beat, we did not have the \nregulation, and we did not have what is exactly included in this bill \nto minimize the danger in the future.\n  I have tried to explain this issue. Obviously, it is complicated when \nyou start talking in these words that are archaic; talking about credit \ndefault swaps and derivatives and systemic risk and all the other \nterminology that is used to talk about financial services. But let me \ntry to phrase this in more graphic terms, if I can.\n  Imagine coming home from a weekend away. You have been away. You have \ntaken your family out on a trip and you come home to find the front \ndoor swinging wide open, flapping back and forth. When you walk in the \nhouse, you realize you have been robbed. Your TV is gone, your \nfurniture, your jewelry, important documents, cash, and family photos, \nall have been stolen out of your home. Maybe worst of all, there is \nbroken glass and shattered pottery. Not only did they steal, but they \ndecided to wreck the house as well. So you are angry and frightened, \nwondering what is coming next and how much it will cost you to replace \nyour TV and your stereo. Then you find out, at the end of all this, \nthat they have identified the robbers who have broken into your home \nand stolen everything and, by the way, you have to write a check to \nthem. The very people who caused the damage are now going to get a \ncheck written out to them--those who caused the problem in the first \nplace.\n  Well, that is what happened, in effect, 18 months ago. People came in \nand robbed our homes, in effect. In fact, they took the home, they took \nthe income, and they took the retirement. They watched jobs go out the \nwindow. The very people who were responsible for it, of course, were \nstabilized because we wrote a check for $700 billion to stabilize those \ninstitutions. As we did so, and, of course, we got them back on their \nfeet, the very leaders of these industries began to reap massive \nbonuses to put themselves on solid footing. So they have benefited from \nthis financially. Yet 8\\1/2\\ million jobs were lost, 7 million homes \nended up in foreclosure, there was a 30-percent decline in home values \nand a 20-percent decline in retirement of working families, all who \nthought they were protected. All that is gone, and somewhere between \n$11 trillion and $13 trillion--not ``b'' as in billion but a trillion \ndollars--in household wealth has been lost in 18 months.\n  If that is not wreckage of your home--your economic home--I don't \nknow what is. Today, we are as vulnerable as we were 18 months ago. Our \nhouse is still unlocked, in a way. What happened 18 months ago could \nhappen again. The difference this time is I don't think there is an \nounce of willingness on the part of the American people to write that \ncheck again. What they are asking is for us to step up, to think \ncarefully--as we have tried to do over the last year or so as we have \ngone through this process--and craft some ideas that would minimize \nthat from happening again so there is not a huge part of our economy \nthat is totally unregulated, as we had with real estate brokers who on \ntheir Web site had as their first rule to brokers, convince the \nborrower you are their financial adviser, when they were anything but \ntheir financial adviser. So they were luring people into mortgages they \ncouldn't afford and convincing them they could pay for it, knowing full \nwell they never ever could. Of course, the banks themselves were then \nbundling these mortgages, only holding them for 8 or 10 weeks and then \nselling them off, branding them AAA to unsuspecting investors, and that \ncreated that bubble that ultimately was the major cause of the \ncollapse.\n  Today, that same problem can exist in the absence of the law we are \nputting before our colleagues. Maybe I should have said this at the \noutset, but we hardly claim perfection in what we have written here. \nHardly. But we believe they are sound ideas that deal with these very \nissues that caused the problem in the first place, and what we need to \ndo is to be able to debate those ideas. If my colleagues disagree, as \nmany do--some think I have gone too far, some think I haven't gone far \nenough, and those are maybe two legitimate points--how are we to \nresolve our disagreement if we can't bring up the bill and have the \ndebate this Chamber was designed to engage in? What is the point of \nhaving 100 seats, coming from 50 States, when a major issue affecting \nour country cannot even be the subject of a debate?\n  So I urge my colleagues--I urge them--to let us get to this debate. \nLet us do our best to resolve these matters as adults, as people who \nhave strong views and feelings, many of which we agree on, by the way. \nI mentioned my colleague from Virginia, the Presiding Officer. I don't \nknow how long Mark Warner and Bob Corker spent--hundreds and hundreds \nand hundreds of hours--to make sure that in this proposal never again \nwould a financial institution in the United States of America reach \nsuch a status that it would be guaranteed implicitly that the Federal \nGovernment would bail them out when they engaged in excessive risk and \nput themselves in great jeopardy. Our bill does that. Without any \nquestion whatsoever, those entities, if they reach that point, will \nfail. They will go into bankruptcy, they will go into receivership, and \nmanagement gets fired. They don't get a bonus, they get fired. \nShareholders lose their resources or their investments, as well as do \ncreditors, not to mention other problems associated with it. But the \nidea is, those entities go out of business, and we wind them down in a \nway that doesn't jeopardize other sectors of our economy.\n  Nothing could be more clear in our bill than that. If there was one \nissue I think we all agreed on, it was to make sure that didn't happen. \nAgain, the Senators from Tennessee and Virginia, and there were others, \nby the way, who were engaged in that debate in writing this bill to \nachieve that desired result by the American people.\n  We also said: Look, one of the problems that happened over the years \nleading to this crisis is that we didn't even know what was going on \nout there. We heard Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of the Treasury, \nand we heard Alan Greenspan and others--whether you believe them--who \nsaid we\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\ndidn't understand how this was happening or why it was happening or \neven that it was happening.\n  Well, that excuse ought to never occur again. So we create in our \nbill that early radar system--again, maybe a more graphic description \nof what the Systemic Risk Council does. This is made up of various \nFederal agencies, so that there is not just one but a multiple set of \neyes with differing backgrounds and experience to deal with the \neconomic issues of our Nation; to be constantly watching and monitoring \nwhat is occurring out there and not just in our own country, by the \nway, but around the world. How many of us have read headlines over the \npast few weeks about Greece and what problems it may pose to Europe and \nother parts of our global economy or what happened in the Shanghai \nstock market a number of years ago, where a decline in value in that \nexchange put the entire world in a tailspin for several days. So the \nnotion that it is just what happens here at home on mortgages or other \nissues is not limited, it is also what happens around the world today \nthat can affect us.\n  Anyway, this part of the bill is designed to be that early warning \nsystem--that radar system. Again, I wish to thank my colleague from \nVirginia and my colleague from Tennessee. One of the provisions in that \nearly warning system is data collection on a daily basis, so we know \nwhat is happening economically literally on an hour-to-hour basis. That \nwill be a great value as we sit there and try to make these assessments \nand pick up on these problems in the earliest stages before they can \noccur.\n  Consumer protection. This ought not be a radical idea--to protect \nconsumers from any problems financially. How many of us, of course, \nread the tragic news over the last few weeks about an automobile \nmanufacturer that had a defective accelerator? What was the first thing \nyou heard? Those cars are being recalled so you would not be at risk in \ndriving them. We hear of recalls all the time on products we buy. You \nbuy that nice TV and it doesn't work, you can send it back, you can \nrecall that product, and you will be protected as a consumer.\n  What happens when you get a financial product that doesn't work or is \ndefective or certainly producing results that were never intended but \nare causing major problems? Where do you go to get a recall on a faulty \nmortgage or a credit card deal that is corrupt or fraudulent or \ndeceptive or abusive? Why shouldn't we deal with financial products \nthat can bring someone to financial ruin? We can do it with a toaster, \na TV or an automobile. Well, our bill sets up a Consumer Financial \nProduct Safety Commission or bureau or division that we have \nestablished in this bill. So consumers themselves can have someplace to \ngo to get redress.\n\n  Rules can be written to protect them against abusive practices. I \nappreciate my colleague from Delaware mentioning my credit card bill, \nbut we shouldn't have to write a bill every time there is a deceptive \nor fraudulent practice that does damage to consumers. Why does it take \nwriting a bill every time there is a problem? Why not have regulations \nin place that would protect consumers?\n  Let me mention what else that does. It isn't just protecting the \nconsumer from a faulty financial product. One of the most important \nelements in our economy is consumer confidence--having a sense of \noptimism and confidence or faith that our institutions will be there to \nwork for them and not against them. One of the great damages to our \ncountry--and I don't know how you put a number on it. I can't cite the \nnumber on home values lost or wealth lost or mortgages or foreclosures \nor jobs lost. Tell me what price we put on the loss of the American \npublic's confidence in our financial system. What is that number; that \npeople no longer trust or have deep questions about whether they are \ngoing to be protected with their hard-earned dollar with that insurance \npolicy or that stock they want to buy? Not that they ought to be \nguaranteed a return on it but that there isn't going to be some \ndeceptive, abusive practice that will put them at risk. To me, that is \nabout as important an issue as you can have--confidence of the American \npeople that the architecture of our financial system is one they can \nhave faith in, that they can have confidence in. That reputation has \nbeen damaged severely over these last number of months.\n  I don't claim what we have written in this area of consumer \nprotection solves every problem. But for the first time in our Nation's \nhistory, for the very first time, we will have a consolidated consumer \nprotection agency with the principal responsibility of watching out for \nthe consumers of financial products. I think that is a major \nachievement for our bill.\n  Lastly, let me mention the old issue of these exotic instruments that \nI mentioned earlier that have complicated definitions of what they do \nand how they work. One of the major problems is, of course, it has been \nan unregulated area. It has been what they call the shadow economy. To \ngive an idea of how the issue has exploded, in 1998, the area of \nderivatives generated about $91 billion in activity. That is 12 years \nago. Last year--I think it was 2009 but the last year we have numbers \non this, the amount of activity in this area jumped from $91 billion to \nalmost $600 trillion--$91 billion to $600 trillion in 10 years in \nunregulated activities, in this shadow economy. It was those activities \nthat also contributed so much to the economic difficulties we are going \nthrough.\n  The Agriculture Committee, run by my good friend from Arkansas, \nBlanche Lincoln, and the members of her committee and our Banking \nCommittee have worked out a sound and solid proposal on how we can \nprotect the American consumers from these very risky instruments if \nthey are not subjected to some basic rules of margin requirements--\ncapital. Let the Sun shine on them in the exchanges, where people can \nsee the value. The market can determine that. All those things are \ncritical. Derivatives are not a bad thing. They are needed, in fact, to \nhave economic growth and prosperity. The problem isn't using them, it \nis how they are used and whether they operate in the shadows or in the \nbright light, where everyone knows what they are and how to value them. \nThat is in our bill as well.\n  There is a lot more in this legislation, and my intention was not to \ngo through and enumerate every section of the bill--all 12 sections of \nthe bill. My point to my colleagues is: Let us get to this debate. Let \nus have a chance. If you don't like what I have done on consumer \nprotection, on derivatives, if you don't like what we have done on too \nbig to fail, if you don't like what we have done on other provisions in \nthe bill, then come and bring up amendments. Let's debate them and \nlet's have that ability to at least try to shape this legislation.\n  At 5 o'clock this afternoon, for the very first time since the crisis \nhit--other than the credit card bill and a housing bill that we had \ncome out of my Banking Committee--this is the first chance we will have \nin 18 months, since the worst economic crisis in 80 years--which we are \nstill suffering from. I know the markets are doing better, I know \ncorporations are doing better, I know the stock market is making more \nmoney, but for most of us in this Chamber, we know it hasn't quite \nreached down yet--the economic recovery--to average citizens who have \nlost their jobs, who have lost their retirement, who have lost the \nwealth they built up over the years. All that is gone. For a lot of \nthem it is not going to come back. So what we need to do is step up and \ntry to provide some answers the American public is looking for. A lot \nof the rage and fury and anger we are seeing around other issues \nhappened in no small measure because of what happened to our economy \nand because of the failure to have regulatory procedures in place, to \nhave cops on the beat to enforce those regulations, to be able to have \nthe early warning system to identify problems before they spun out of \ncontrol.\n\n  Our bill, we believe, steps up and addresses those issues. Again, \ngive us the opportunity to at the very least debate them. We cannot get \nto the resolution of these matters if the matter is not on floor. \nSenator Shelby and I have been talking. We talked over the weekend. We \ntalked already this afternoon. We will meet again. Even if we get this \ndone and move to the bill, we have to sit down and work out how to \nmanage all of this, so I thank him again for his willingness to do \nthat. I deeply believe Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama\n\n[[Page S2615]]\n\nwants to get to a bill, as I believe do most of my colleagues here, but \nwe cannot ever get there if we do not have that debate.\n  I did not mean to speak this long but I wanted at least to let my \ncolleagues know how important I believe this issue is. Frankly, I don't \nthink it serves our interests well to be screaming at each other about \nwho cares more about this issue than the other. I think it unfortunate \nthat a number of my Republican friends who I know care about this very \nmuch would be branded that somehow they don't care about it to such an \nextent that they would not even let it get to a debate. They have ideas \non this legislation. They want their amendments considered and they \ndon't want to be told you cannot even do that because we do not have \nsome large, sweeping agreement on a bill here.\n  Senator Shelby and I are very close on some issues that we think we \ncan reach an understanding. Basically we are there in a lot of these \nmatters. I had hoped maybe we would get there before this afternoon, \nbut there is no reason to stop all this, in my view, and not get to the \nadoption of the motion to proceed.\n  For all of those reasons, I urge my colleagues at 5 p.m. to vote to \nproceed to this matter and let us take the next few days to consider \nthis legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport bringing forward Chairman Dodd's regulatory reform bill. The \nchairman has just spoken with great passion about how we got here. I \nwant to take perhaps somewhat of a similar tack and describe, as a new \nMember, why I think this legislation is so terribly important.\n  I have had the opportunity today and on other Mondays, as is often \nnoted, to sit in the chair and listen to my colleagues come in and talk \nabout this issue. I heard today my colleagues talk about health care, \ntalk about stimulus, talk about unemployment, as somehow reasons why we \nshould not start a debate about financial regulatory reform. I am not \nsure I understand the connection.\n  Candidly, the American people could do with a little less political \ntheater and a little more action. Regardless of what happens this \nafternoon at the vote at 5 o'clock, I hope--and I honestly believe most \nof my colleagues on both sides of the aisle hope--that we will get to \nthat agreement in a bipartisan new set of rules of the road for the \nfinancial sector that will stand the test of time for not a year or two \nbut for decades to come.\n  Before I get into a substantive discussion about how we got here and \nhow I believe the Dodd bill takes dramatic steps forward, there is one \nother issue I need to address. I have sat in the chair as the Presiding \nOfficer and have heard--and I know as Presiding Officer we have to bite \nour tongues sometimes--colleagues come forward and somehow portray this \npiece of legislation as a partisan product.\n  I have only been here for 15 months but in the 15 months I have had \nthe honor of serving this body, I have not seen any piece of \nlegislation that anywhere approaches the type of bipartisan input, \ndiscussion, and ongoing dialog that Chairman Dodd's bill has. \nLiterally, in the 15 months I have had the honor of serving on the \nBanking Committee, we held dozens if not hundreds of hearings on the \nobjectives of this legislation, objectives, again, that I think \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle agree upon: making sure there is \nnever again taxpayer bailouts for mistakes made by too large financial \ninstitutions, making sure we have more transparency and, as the \nchairman said, a return of a sense of fairness to our whole financial \nproduct system and, third, that ultimately the American people, the \nconsumers of this Nation, will make sure there is somebody watching out \nfor the financial products that sometimes they have been purchasing \nwithout appropriate knowledge or appropriate recourse, when these \nproducts explode in their faces.\n  Again, unlike the Presiding Officer who served around this body for \nmany years, I am a new Member. But I saw where the chairman did \nsomething I thought was somewhat unusual with a major piece of \nlegislation. Rather than saying he had all the knowledge and all the \ninput, he actually invited in the members of the committee, junior \nmembers, senior members of both parties to set up working groups to \ntake on some of the challenging aspects of this bill--consumer \nprotection, systemic risk, corporate governance, the whole question of \nderivatives. Let me state absolutely, because I can state from the \nsystemic risk/too big to fail portions, the products we developed that \nare critical parts of this legislation are bipartisan in nature, \nbipartisan in ideas, and find that common ground that has been so \nabsent from so many of the previous debates we have had over the last \n15 months--I think particularly about the fact of the systemic risk, \ntoo big to fail, and resolution authorities Senator Corker and I worked \non. There has been no better partner I could have had than Senator Bob \nCorker, grinding through hundreds of hours, recognizing there was no \nDemocratic or Republican response to systemic risk and too big to fail, \nbut we had to get it right. While there may be parts of this bill that \ncan still be tightened and need to be tweaked here and there, and the \nSenator and I may add a few improvements, on the overarching goal of \nmaking sure the taxpayers never again would be on the hook, I believe \nwe have taken giant steps forward.\n  As you heard from the chairman already, those conversations are \nongoing even today. Please, while we kind of get sometimes subject in \nthis body to hyperbole, anyone who makes the claim that this \nlegislation is partisan only doesn't recognize the facts or has not \nseen the experience of the members of the Banking Committee over the \nlast 15 months.\n  Let me also acknowledge--and I recognize I have a number of things I \nwant to say and maybe other Members want to come, but let me \nacknowledge something else about this discussion. Sixteen months ago, \nwhen I came to this body, I actually thought I knew something about the \nfinancial services sector. I spent 20 years prior to being Governor \naround financial services, taking companies public. I had some ideas \nabout how we would sort through these issues. I have to tell you what I \nquickly found was that oftentimes my original idea, or oftentimes the \nsimplistic sound bite solution that I thought might be the solution, \nmore often than not proved not to be the case and that trying to sort \nour way through this labyrinth of financial rules and regulations in a \nway that brings appropriate regulation but maintains America's \npreeminent role as the capital markets' capital of the world has been \nchallenging.\n\n  Again I thank my colleague Senator Corker. I think we both realize \nthere is no Democratic or Republican way to get this right but we had \nto get it right. Over the last year we have set up literally dozens of \nseminars where we invited members of the Banking Committee to come in \nand kind of get up to speed as well. Fifteen months later, with this \nlegislation now before the floor, I think we have taken giant steps \nforward in getting it right.\n  I also want to revisit for a moment, before we get to the substance \nof the bill, how we got here. I have actually been stunned sometimes, \nsitting in the Presiding Officer's chair, hearing colleagues come in \nand try to cite as the causation of the crisis that arose in 2007 and \n2008 a single legislative action back in the 1970s or a single \nindividual's activities over the last two decades. The claims are so \npatently absurd, sometimes they do not even bear recognition or bear \nrebuttal. But it is important to take a moment to look back on the fact \nthat none of us comes with clean hands to this process of how we got to \nsuch a mess in 2008 that we were on the verge of financial meltdown.\n  Think about the fact back in the early 1990s, back in 1993, Congress \nactually passed legislation to give the Federal Reserve the \nresponsibility to regulate mortgages--responsibility that we have seen \ntime and again they didn't take up the challenge to meet.\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\n  The Presiding Officer spoke very eloquently earlier this afternoon \nabout the actions of Congress in 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill, \nthat basically broke down the walls between traditional depository bank \nand investment banking that had been set up by the Glass-Steagall Act \nin the early 1930s. Where the Presiding Officer and I may differ now is \nI am not sure we can unscramble those eggs, but clearly we needed a \nlittle more thought back in 1999, as we internationalized our financial \nmarkets and turned these large institutions into financial \nsupermarkets, which was one of the precipitating factors in this crisis \nas well.\n  Candidly, bank regulators were not given the tools to regulate, and \noftentimes regulators of both depository institutions, their bank \nholding companies, and their securities firms, had no collaboration or \ncoordination.\n  During our hearings in the Banking Committee when we looked into one \nof the most egregious excesses in the last few years, the Bernie Madoff \nscandals, we heard regulators had started down the path to try to find \nout the source of some of the criminality that took place in the Madoff \ncase, only to find because of our mismatch of regulatory structure they \ngot to a door they couldn't open because that was the purview of \nanother regulator.\n  Regulators, under our existing rules, were actually prohibited from \nlooking at derivatives. Derivatives, as the Chairman mentioned, in the \nlast decade have gone from what seems like a large number--$90-plus \nbillion--to literally hundreds of trillions of dollars in value.\n  Responsibility continues, again, in some of our monetary policy. In \nthe early part of the 2000s--and again, not many people sounded the \nalarm at that point. We overrelied on low interest rates and monetary \npolicy to pull us out of the 2001 recession. But as we came out of that \n2001 recession, we left those monetary policies in place, which led to \na housing bubble for which we are still paying the price.\n  I know some of my colleagues on the other side said this bill does \nnot take on the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And, yes, to a \ndegree, they are right. And then, in a subsequent action, we will have \nto make sure we have a new model in place for these institutions. But \nthat should not be used as an excuse to not put in place major \nfinancial regulatory reform.\n  Candidly, if we are going to be really truthful with each other and \nthe American people, we have to acknowledge that everyone--not just the \nbanks but everyone--got overleveraged. Quite honestly, we all, the \nAmerican people, probably need to take a look in the mirror as well. I \nthink, as we bought those adjustable rate mortgages; took out that \nsecond and third loan on our home; ended up getting that deal that \nseemed too good to be true; moved away from the conventional idea that \nyou ought to go ahead and, before you get a mortgage, be able to put 20 \npercent down and be able to show you can pay it back, we all got swept \nup in this ``who cares about tomorrow; let's just borrow for today.''\n  We also saw innovations, and American capitalism has worked pretty \nwell, particularly in the last 100 years. But we particularly saw \ninnovations in the last 5 or 6 years alone, innovations that originated \non Wall Street that were supposed to be about better pricing risks: \nderivatives and all of their cousins, nephews, and bastard offspring. \nBut these tools that were supposed to be a better price risk we have \nnow found were more about fee generation for the banks that created \nthem and, instead of lowering overall risk, created this intertangled \nweb that, once you started to put the string on, potentially brought \nabout the whole collapse of our markets.\n  Time and again, we saw, rather than transparency in the market, \nopaqueness and regulators who never looked beyond their silos.\n  I think most all of our colleagues want reform. Colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle want to get it right. But I believe there are two \nreal dangers as we go down this reform path. One is to resort to sound-\nbite solutions that at first blush sound like an easy way to solve the \nproblem but in actuality may not get to the solution we need.\n  I know we are going to have a fervent debate on this floor--and I \nlook forward to it--about the question of whether the challenge with \nsome of our institutions was their market cap or was it really putting \npressure on the regulators to look at their level of interconnectedness \nand the level of risk-taking that was taking place. I look forward to \nthat. There are valid points on both sides. When we get to that debate, \nI will point out the fact that in Canada, where there is actually a \nhigher concentration of the banking industry than in the United States, \nbecause there was greater regulatory oversight and actual restrictions \non leverage, those Canadian banks didn't fall prey to the same kind of \nexcess we found here in the United States.\n  I know the chairman and Chairman Lincoln are working through the \nquestion of derivatives, where they should be housed, because they do \nprovide important tools when used properly. And there will be a \nspirited debate on whether we should break off derivatives functions \nfrom financial institutions. I look forward to that discussion. By \nsimply breaking off these products into a more unregulated sector of \nthe industry, we could, in effect, if we do not do it right, create an \neven greater harm down the road than we have right now.\n  So the first challenge is to make sure we don't fall prey to the \nsimple solutions and recognize the complexities of these issues.\n  The other challenge we have to be aware of is the converse. I know \nthe chairman has heard, I know the Presiding Officer has heard--any of \nus who have tried to get into this issue have had folks from the \nfinancial industry come in and talk to us about the unforeseen \nconsequences of any of our actions. Some of those arguments are valid, \nbut oftentimes those arguments are simply--they always start the same: \nWe favor financial reform, but don't touch our portion of the financial \nsector because if you do this, the unintended consequences would be \nenormous.\n  Because the knowledge level and the complexity of these discussions \nare so challenging, what we also have to fight against in this body is \nthe more easy process to default to the status quo because timidity in \nthis case will not solve this crisis and will not provide the new 21st-\ncentury financial rules of the road we need.\n  We can't be afraid to shine the light on markets or, for that matter, \nto raise the cost of certain activities, because the unforeseen \nconsequences of the interconnection of these activities, as we saw in \n2007 and 2008, pose grave risk to our financial system--and as we have \nseen with the 8 million jobs lost and literally trillions of dollars of \nvalue lost from the American public.\n  So what does S. 3217 do to accomplish this? I spent most of my time \non the two titles that Senator Corker and I worked on and the chairman \nand his staff adopted and changed a bit but that still provide the \nframework and, I believe, the right structure.\n  First--the chairman has already mentioned this--we create for the \nfirst time ever an early warning system on systemic risk. If there is \none thing that has become clear from all of the hearings that have been \nheld, not just at the Banking Committee but under Senator Levin's \nInvestigations Committee and Chairman Lincoln's Agriculture Committee, \nit is that there was very little combination and sharing of information \nbetween the regulatory silos.\n  The chairman's bill creates a nine-member Financial Oversight Council \nchaired by the Treasury Secretary and made up of the Federal financial \nregulators. This group will bear the responsibility, both good and bad, \nif they mess up, of spotting systemic risk and putting speed bumps in \nplace because we can never prevent another future crisis, but to do all \nwe can to slow and minimize the chance of those crises. The most \nimportant part of this systemic risk council is it will actually share \ninformation, so no longer will we have one regulator who is looking at \nthe holding company, another regulator looking at the depository \ninstitution, a third looking at the securities concerns and not sharing \nthat data.\n  We will place increased cost on the size and complexity of firms. The \nlargest, most interconnected firms will be required--not optional but \nrequired--to have higher capital, lower leverage, better liquidity, \nbetter risk management. Those have all been traditional tools that have \nalready been in our regulatory system, but this systemic risk\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\ncouncil will require those large institutions to meet all of these \nhigher costs--in effect, their cost of being so large and \ninterconnected.\n  But what we are also bringing to the table are three brandnew tools \nthat I think, if executed and implemented correctly, will provide \ntremendous value in preventing that next financial crisis. Those three \ntools are contingent debt, our so-called funeral plans, and third, the \nOffice of Financial Research. Since these are new tools, let me spend a \nmoment on each.\n  One of the things we saw in the 2007, 2008 crisis was that as these \nfirms got to their day of reckoning, it became virtually impossible for \nthem to raise additional capital and shore up their equity. Once they \nstart going down the tubes, the ability to attract new investors, \nparticularly from a management team that sometimes doesn't recognize \nhow far and how close they are coming to the brink, is a great \nchallenge.\n  So working with folks from the Fed and experts across the country, \nthis bill includes a whole new category within the capital structure of \nthose large institutions: contingent debt. There will be funds within \nthe capital structure that will convert into equity at the earliest \nsigns of a crisis. Why is this important? This is important because if \nthis debt converts into equity, the effect it has on the existing \nshareholders is it dilutes them. It takes money right out of their \npockets. So existing shareholders will have a real incentive to hold \nmanagement accountable, not to take undue risks, because long before \nbankruptcy or resolution we will be able to have this trigger in place \nthat will convert this debt into equity, diluting existing shareholders \nand, candidly, diluting management as well. How effectively we use this \ntool has yet to be seen, but it will provide another early warning \ncheck on these large institutions.\n  The second new addition to the chairman's bill is basically funeral \nplans for these large institutions. What do I mean? I mean a management \nteam will have to come before their regulators and explain how they can \nunwind themselves in an orderly way through the bankruptcy process.\n  We heard stories--I will not mention the institution--we heard \nstories in the height of the crisis in 2008 about how certain very \nlarge international institutions in effect came before the regulators \nand said: You have to bail us out because we cannot go through \nbankruptcy; it is just too hard. Never again should any institution be \nallowed to be in that position. And if we use this tool correctly--this \nis an area where I know the Presiding Officer has great interest--if \nthe regulator does not sign off on the funeral plan for this \ninstitution, on how it can unwind itself, even with many of its \ninternational divisions, through an orderly bankruptcy process, then \nthe regulator can, in effect, make this institution sell off or dispose \nof parts that can't be done through a regular order of bankruptcy. By \ndoing this, we create the expectation in the marketplace that \nbankruptcy will always be the preferred option.\n  Never again will there be an excuse that, we are too big and too \ncomplicated to go through that orderly process. Creditors and the \nmarket will know there is a plan in place that has to have been \napproved by the regulator and constantly updated so we have a way out.\n  The third area--again, I was very pleased to hear the chairman \nmention this because within the press and the commentary, it has gotten \nno information or no focus at all--is the creation of a new Office of \nFinancial Research within the Treasury.\n  One of the things we heard time and again from regulators as we kind \nof went back and looked at how we got in the crisis of 2007 and 2008 \nwas that the regulators didn't realize the state of interconnectedness \nof some of the institutions they were supposed to be regulating. No one \nhad a current, real-time market snapshot of all of the transactions \nthat were taking place on a daily basis, so nobody knew what would \nhappen if you pulled the string on AIG, even though it was their \nLondon-based office, what would happen if those contracts suddenly all \nbecame suspect.\n  By creating this Office of Financial Research, we will give the \nregulators and the systemic risk council, on a daily basis, the current \nstate of play across all the markets of the world.\n  This tool, if used correctly, would be another terribly important \nearly warning system. But as the chairman has mentioned, with all this \ngood work, we still can't predict there will never be another financial \ncrisis. Chances are Wall Street and others, creativity being what they \nare, will find some way, even with all this additional regulatory \nstructure and oversight. We can never predict there might not be \nanother crisis. So what do we do?\n  First and foremost, what this bill puts in place is a strong \npresumption for bankruptcy so that creditors and the market alike will \nknow what happens if they get themselves in trouble. Particularly for \nthese largest institutions that are systemically important, they will \nhave to have their preapproved, in effect, bankruptcy funeral plan on \nthe shelf so that we can pull that off in the event of a crisis and \nallow the institution to go through an orderly bankruptcy process. \nAgain, bankruptcy will be the preferred option of any reasonable \nmanagement team because through bankruptcy there is at least some \nchance they may emerge on the other side in some form or another. They \nmay be able to keep their job, if they are part of management. Some \nshareholders may still have some equity remaining.\n  What happens if we have a firm that doesn't see the inevitable and \nisn't willing to move to bankruptcy? What happens if we have a \ncircumstance where the failure of an institution could cause systemic \nrisk and bring down the whole system?\n  With an appropriate check and balance--and again, I commend Senator \nCorker for his additions--in effect, simultaneous action of three keys: \nthe Treasury Secretary, the head of the Fed, the FDIC, and additional \noversight--all of these actions taking place, there then is an ability \nto say, how do we resolve an institution, in effect put it out of \nbusiness--unlike in 2008 where the government invested, in effect, in a \nconservatorship approach that said: We will prop you up to keep you \nalive because we don't know what to do with you to keep you alive \nbecause you are so large and systemically important.\n  We have created in this bill a resolution process that says: If you \nas a management team are crazy enough not to go into bankruptcy, but \nactually allow resolution to take place, you are going out of business. \nSenator Corker said: You are toast. Your management team is toast. Your \nequity is toast. Your unsecured creditors are toast. You are going \naway.\n  Again, we are going to put this institution out of business in a way \nthat does not harm the overall financial system. We have to have an \norderly process.\n  We saw during the crisis of 2008 what happens when one of these \ninstitutions fails without any game plan. We saw the value of these \ninstitutions disappear overnight as confidence in the market, \nconfidence within the market in the institution was lost. So working \nwith my colleagues and experts from the FDIC and others, we said: What \nyou have to do is, you have to have some dollars available to keep the \nlights on so that you can sell off the portions of the institution that \nare systemically important and unwind this in an orderly way that \ndoesn't have an effect, the equivalent of a run on the bank or a run on \nthe financial system.\n  Again, we have heard critiques of the approach Senator Corker and I \ncame up with in this resolution fund, this ``how do you put yourself \nout of business in an orderly way'' fund. We actually thought it ought \nto be paid for by the financial industry, with the ability then to have \nthat fund, in effect, replenished after the crisis is over.\n  I saw polling today that shows the overwhelming majority of Americans \nactually think the financial sector ought to bear the cost of unwinding \none of these large, systemically important firms. Let me say, if there \nare other ways to do it--as a matter of fact, some in the \nadministration have suggested other ways--I am sure we can find common \nground as long as we do have at least two principles: First and \nforemost, the taxpayer must be protected, and industry, not the \ntaxpayer, has to take the financial exposure. Second, funding has to be \navailable quickly to allow resolution to work in a way to orderly \nunwind the process. But it ought to be done in a\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\nway--again, this is where some of the judgment comes in--where there is \nnot so much capital available that we create a moral hazard, but a \nbailout fund is created.\n  Personally, I believe the House legislation goes too far in creating \na fund of that size. I think the chairman's mark strikes a much more \nappropriate balance. But if there are ways to do this that protect the \ntaxpayer, allow speedy resolution with funds that will be available so \nwe don't have a run on the market, a run on the institution that \ncreates more systemic risk, as long as the industry at the end of day \nis going to pay for it, I am sure there are other ways and we can find \nthat common ground.\n  What we did in this process of resolution is we said: Let's take what \nis working. Let's see what is best from the FDIC process which \ncurrently resolves banks on a regular basis. One of the things I have \nheard from some of my colleagues on the other side--I don't know about \ntheir community banks, but my community banks in Virginia; I would bet \nthe community banks in Delaware and the community banks in \nConnecticut--we don't want to get stuck paying the bills for the large \nWall Street firms that bring the system to the brink of financial \ncatastrophe. So, again, one of the aspects of the chairman's bill is to \nmake sure any resolution process does not burden, charge, or in any way \notherwise interfere with community banks.\n  What we think we have struck is a process that puts costs on those \ninstitutions that make the business decision to get large and \nsystemically important. We think we have put in place abilities for the \nregulators, with the funeral plans, to make sure if this \ninterconnectedness is so large that they can't go through bankruptcy, \nthen we can stop them from taking on these new activities. But because \nwe can't always predict eventuality, we have then said: If you need to \nuse a resolution process, let's make sure it is orderly, paid for by \nindustry, and that you have stood it up in a way that no rational \nmanagement team would ever expect or want to choose resolution.\n  I know my colleague from New Hampshire has been a great partner in \nthis legislation and is on the Senate floor. I will end with just a \ncouple more moments. There are other parts of this bill that have not \nreceived a lot of attention. In this bill, the chairman has included an \noffice of national insurance.\n  One of the things we saw in the crisis in the fall of 2008 was that \nnobody knew how entangled AIG's activities were with the whole \nfinancial system. This doesn't get to the question of who should \nregulate insurance companies, but it does create at the Federal level \nat least the knowledge within the insurance sector of its \ninterconnectedness. The chairman has mentioned that he and Chairman \nLincoln are working to grapple through one of the toughest parts of the \nbill--again, an area I know my colleague, Senator Gregg, has been \nworking on: How we get it right around derivatives.\n  Again, there is no policy difference. Both sides agree derivatives \nare an important tool when used appropriately. Particularly industrial \ncompanies need to use the derivative to hedge against future risk \nwithin their business. The challenge is, how do we not draw that end \nuser exemption so large that every institution on Wall Street suddenly \ntransforms itself into an industrial end user. Secondly, while these \ncontracts are unique, they have to have more light shown on them in \nterms of clearing and exchanges.\n  I know Chairman Dodd and Chairman Lincoln and Senator Reid and \nSenator Gregg will be working through this. One suggestion I would \nhave--because as someone who has seen Wall Street act time and again, I \nwish them all the luck--part of my concern is that whatever rule we \ncome up with, there is so much financial incentive on the other side \nthat a year or two from now, we may be back because they found a way \naround it that we again need to give the regulators certain trip wires. \nI, for one, believe we ought to take the industry at its word. The \nindustry says end users are only going to be 10 percent of total \nderivative contracts. Then let's put that in as a regulatory goal. If \nthey end up exceeding that, then we can bring draconian consequences to \nbear. Or if they say, yes, we can make most of these transactions and \nmost of these contracts transparent through clearing or exchange, \ngreat; let's accept them at their word.\n\n  But if they don't get to those totals, then perhaps some of the \nactions that particularly Members on my side of the aisle would like to \ntake can be put in place. But, again, folks of goodwill can find common \nagreement.\n  Finally, the area around consumer protection, where the chairman and \nthe ranking member have worked at great length to kind of sort this \nthrough, everybody agrees on the common goal. There needs to be \nenhanced consumer protection, particularly for the whole nonregulated \nportion of the financial industry that now exceeds the regulatory half. \nToo often it was the community bank that was chasing the mortgage \nbroker on some of the bad financial products because there was no \nregulation on the mortgage broker to start with. So, again, there will \nbe differences, but I think the approach of the chairman, which is to \nkeep this with the appropriate rulemaking ability but to make sure, \nparticularly for those smaller banks, that we don't end with \nconflicting information of a consumer regulator showing up on Monday \nand a safety and soundness regulator showing up on Wednesday, to do \nthat in a combined fashion so there is commonality of message, \nparticularly to smaller banks, that strikes that right balance.\n  Again, I can only say for the banks in my State of Virginia, those \nsmaller banks who oftentimes have said they didn't cause the crisis--\nand they didn't--they are the first to say: We need enhanced consumer \nprotection to make sure that our financial products are regulated by \nthe type of product, not by the charter of the institution that issues \nthe product. There may be ways to improve on this section. But, again, \nI think Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby are working to get it right.\n  We have seen, as well, major action on the rating agencies, questions \naround underwriting. There are tremendous parts of this bill that \nhaven't been the subject of great criticism because they are that \ncommon ground that, I think Senator Shelby has said in earlier quotes, \n80 or 90 percent of both sides agree on. Where we don't agree, we ought \nto debate and offer amendments.\n  I look forward to candidly working with a number of colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle on technical amendments to this bill where we \nthink we can make it slightly better. But if we are going to get there, \nwe have to get to the debate.\n  I hope we move past procedural back-and-forth that, as a new guy, I \nstill don't fully understand. I think it is time to fully debate this \nbill out in the open. The chairman made mention of what has been taking \nplace in the last few weeks in Greece. I know the Presiding Officer has \nhelped educate me on a whole new activity that is taking place in the \nfinancial markets right now around high-speed trading and co-location \nthat could be the forbear of the next financial crisis.\n  How irresponsible would we be, 18 months after, again, the analogy of \nthe chairman, after our house was broken into, when we haven't even put \nnew locks on the door, if we ended up with another robbery, whether it \nwas caused by internatinoal action or whether it was caused by high-\nspeed trading, because we don't have new rules of the road in place?\n  In the 15 months I have had the honor of serving in the Senate, I \ncan't think of a piece of legislation that better represents what is \ngood about the Senate, folks on both sides of the aisle coming forth \nwith their ideas, trying to fashion a good piece of legislation. I \ncan't think of an area where there is less traditional partisan, left \nversus right, Democrat versus Republican divides. I can't think of an \napplause line better, whether I am talking to a group of liberal \nbloggers or folks from the tea party, than the notion that we have to \nend taxpayer bailouts.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's get through \nthe procedural wrangling. Let's find that common ground that I think we \nare 90 percent of the way there. Let's pass a bill that gets 60, 70, 80 \nMembers of the Senate and set financial rules of the road\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\nthat will last not just for the next congressional session but for \ndecades to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the bill. This is such a \ncomplex piece of legislation, it is difficult to debate in a sense that \nis understandable because there is so much of a technical aspect to the \nbill.\n  Let's start with the purpose or what I believe the purpose should be. \nOur purpose should be, one, to do as much as we can to build a \nregulatory regime which will reduce the potential for another event, \nthe type of which we had at the end of 2008 where we had a massive \nbreakdown in the financial system and, as a result of huge systemic \nrisk being built into the system, which wasn't properly regulated and \ncertainly was not handled correctly by either the financial \ninstitutions or by the Congress--the Congress maintains a fairly \nsignificant responsibility for the meltdown that occurred at the end of \n2008, for the policies that we had running up to that period in the \narea of housing. That should be our first goal, prospectively, trying \nto reduce systemic risk as much as possible in the system and putting \nin place policies which will accomplish that.\n  The second goal, however, should be that we maintain what is a unique \nand rare strength which America has, which is that we have the capacity \nas a country to create capital and credit in a very aggressive way so \nentrepreneurs who are willing to go out and take risks have access to \ncapital and credit, that creates jobs, and that creates the dynamics of \nour economy.\n  We should not put in place a regulatory regime that overly reacts \nand, as a result, significantly dampens our capacity to have the most \nvibrant capital and credit markets in the world while still having safe \nand sound capital and credit markets.\n  The bill the Senator from Connecticut is bringing forward, I presume, \nis going to have a lot of different sections in it. I want to focus on \none because it has become a point of significant contention, and that \nis the derivatives section. Derivatives are extraordinarily complex \ninstruments, and there are a lot of different variations of \nderivatives. They are basically insurance policies on an underlying \nproduct that is occurring somewhere in the economy. Their notional \nvalue is almost staggering. There is $600 trillion of notional value \nout there in derivatives, which is a number that nobody can comprehend. \nBut you can understand it is a pretty big issue.\n  Notional value means, of course, that if everything were to go wrong \nat the same time, you would have $600 trillion of insurance sitting out \nthere that had to be paid off. That obviously is never going to happen. \nBut the fact is, it shows the size of the market and what its \nimplications are. There are all sorts of different elements to this \nmarket. It is not one monolithic market. It is not even a hundred, it \nis thousands--tens of thousands--of different and various things that \nare having derivatives written against them, although they divide into \npretty understandable categories.\n  Within the bill that came out of the Agriculture Committee, there \nwas, for lack of a better word, an antipathy expressed toward the \nentities which presently manage the derivatives market in this country, \nwhich are essentially the large financial houses. There was an equal \nantipathy expressed relative to the entities that use these \nderivatives, including large amounts of manufacturing companies in this \ncountry, people who are dealing with financial debt instruments in this \ncountry, people who are dealing with the housing markets in this \ncountry.\n  It was almost as if somebody sat back and said: We dislike these \nfolks, and we are going to put in place a regime which will sort of \ngratuitously penalize them for the business they do because we do not \nlike it. It is too big. It is too complicated. I think the people who \nwrote it felt it was not understandable and, therefore, they decided to \nput forward proposals which would fundamentally undermine the capacity \nto do derivatives in this country.\n  Is that bad? Yes, it is very bad because derivatives basically are \nused for the purpose of making commerce work in our Nation, of making \nit possible for people to borrow money in our Nation, of making it \npossible for companies in our Nation to sell overseas, of making it \npossible for people to put a product in the stream of commerce and to \npresume that when they enter into an agreement on that product, the \nprice would not be affected by extraneous events, such as the \nfluctuation of currency costs or fluctuations in material costs. So it \nis critical we get the derivatives language right.\n  There needs to be a significant new look at the regulatory regime of \nderivatives. The essence of the exercise should be transparency, \nmaintaining adequate capital for the counterparties and margins, \nliquidity. That should be where we focus our energy: trying to make \nsure the different derivatives products that are brought to the market \nare as transparent as possible and also have behind them the support \nthey need in the form of collateral, capital, and margin, so if \nsomething goes wrong they will be paid off, for lack of a better word.\n  This proposal, as it came out of the Agriculture Committee, does not \ntry to accomplish that. Rather, it tries to essentially eviscerate the \nuse of derivatives as products amongst a large segment of our economy. \nIt sets up something called section 106, where it essentially says the \npeople who are doing derivatives today, which are, for the most part, \nfinancial markets, must spin those products off from their financial \nhouses.\n  That sounds, in concept, like a reasonable idea, especially if you \nwere in Argentina in the 1950s and working for the Peron government. \nBut as a very practical matter, it is a concept which will do \nfundamental harm to the vitality of our economy. Why? Because you will \nnot have a lot of derivative products in this country that will be able \nto pass the test of being spun off. You do not have to listen to me to \nbelieve this. Let me quote from a message that was sent to us by the \nFederal Reserve, which is a reasonably fair arbiter in this exercise. \nThey do not have a dog in the fight other than the financial stability \nof our country. This is the Fed talking, not me:\n\n       Section 106 would impair financial stability and strong \n     prudential regulation of derivatives; would have serious \n     consequences for the competitiveness of the U.S. financial \n     institutions; and would be highly disruptive and costly, both \n     for banks and their customers.\n\n  That is about as accurate and succinct a statement as to what the \neffect of this section would be as I could have said. I did not say it. \nNobody would probably believe me. The Fed said it. The fair arbiter \nsaid it.\n  Why did they say that? Well, it is pretty obvious if you know \nanything about the way these products work. But essentially, if you \nspin off these products, you are going to have to create entities out \nthere to replicate the entities they were spun off of. So if a large \nfinancial institution is now doing derivatives, and you spin the \nderivatives desk off, the swap desk off, from that financial entity, \nthat spun-off event is going to have to replicate the capital structure \nof the financial institution which was basically underpinning the \nderivatives desk. That capital structure is estimated to be somewhere \nin the vicinity of a quarter of a trillion dollars to a half a trillion \ndollars of capital, which will have to be created.\n  Well, what is the effect of that? When you start putting capital like \nthat into the system, that capital comes from somewhere--assuming it \ncomes at all--it comes from somewhere, and where it comes from, quite \nhonestly, is the creditworthiness of other activity. It is not new \ncapital. It is taking capital and recreating an event, a freestanding \nentity here, of which capital is not around.\n  It will also mean there would be a contraction--and this is an \nestimate not of the Fed but of the group of entities that actually do \nthis business and, therefore, it can be called suspect, but I think it \nis in the ballpark, give or take a couple hundred billion dollars--it \nwill also cause a contraction of about $700 billion of credit in this \ncountry, to say nothing of the fact that if you are looking for a \nderivatives contract and you cannot go to the financial houses that \nusually do it in the United States, and you are a commercial entity or \na hedging group, you are going to go overseas and do it because they \nare not going to have these types of restrictions and you are going to \nbe able to buy that contract in Singapore.\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\n  So a large amount of entities, a large amount of business, will move \noffshore almost immediately upon the passage of this bill, should this \nsection be kept in it.\n  Is it necessary, is the question. Is it necessary to make the \nderivatives market work right in this country? Absolutely not. This is \npunitive language put in out of spite because there is a movement in \nthis country, and in this Congress, unfortunately, which I call \npandering popularism, which simply dislikes anything that has to do \nwith Wall Street.\n  I am sure they did a lot of things wrong and they caused a lot of \nproblems. But if you are going to apply the problems that occurred \naround here fairly, we should be looking in our own mirror, at \nourselves, for some of the problems we caused to the American economy, \nby forcing a lot of lending in a housing market that could not sustain \nit. It is penal. That is the purpose of this: punitive. In the end, it \nis going to cut off our nose to spite our face because it will be our \ncredit that contracts, and business can be done and could be done in a \nvery effective way, here in the United States, overseas.\n\n  What should be done here? What should be done rather than this \nexercise, as the Fed has said, in causing a ``highly disruptive and \ncostly'' effect on banks and their customers, and having serious \nconsequences on the competitiveness of the United States? Remember, we \nare competing in the world. That may have escaped the attention of the \nAgriculture Committee when they wrote this language, but we are in a \nworld competition. Derivatives are not a unique American product. They \nare a world product. So these are jobs that go overseas. This is credit \nthat goes overseas. This is business that goes overseas. This is Main \nStreet that will be affected by this language.\n  How should it have been done? Well, it should have been done in a \nrational way, not in a punitive way. We know the derivatives market was \nnot transparent enough. We know there was not enough capital, \nliquidity, margin--whatever you want to call it--behind the products \nand the counterparties that were exchanging products in the derivatives \nmarket in the over-the-counter system. We know--because we have AIG as \nexample No. 1--a tremendous amount of CDs, especially, were being \nwritten with nothing behind them except a name.\n  We can fix all that. It can be fixed in a way that almost everybody \nis comfortable with by, first, making sure the exempted products from \ngoing on a clearinghouse are only products which have a specific \ncommercial use and are customized and are narrow, and that the people \ndoing those products are not large enough in their business so there \nare systemic issues. Secondly, we put everybody else in a \nclearinghouse.\n  What does a clearinghouse mean? It essentially means there will be a \nthird party insurer or holder of the basket of assets necessary to \nsupport the derivatives contracts so we are fairly confident when a \ntrade is made in a clearinghouse, the counterparties have the liquidity \nin the margin behind their positions to support their trades. At the \nsame time, the clearinghouse itself must be structured in a way that it \nhas adequate capital.\n  Where is that capital going to come from? It can only come from one \nplace. It comes from the people who trade in these instruments. They \nare going to have to put up the capital. The regulators--the SEC, the \nCFTC--will have direct access to controlling and making sure that \ncapital is adequate in the clearinghouses and making sure the \nclearinghouses are adequately monitoring the contracts.\n  Then as the contracts become more standardized--and they can and they \nwill; we all accept that--they move over to exchanges where they are \nbasically traded like stock. Then you have absolute transparency, price \ndisclosure, and you do not have the issue of the over-the-counter \nmarket that causes so much problem for us. That will happen. That will \nhappen almost naturally, but you could have the regulators stand up and \nsay: Well, we think this group of derivatives is standardized enough \nand you have to move it to an exchange. We could give that power to the \nregulators, and that makes sense. But it would happen naturally anyway \nas these clearinghouses become more effective and standardized in the \nproducts, and people become more comfortable with standardized products \nin these areas.\n  Of course, there would have to be real-time disclosure to the \nregulators of what the prices were, if they are OTC prices or \nclearinghouse prices, so they know what is going on. Then it would be \nup to the regulators to decide when that information should be \ndisclosed to the markets, depending on how you make these markets. \nSometimes you cannot disclose the information immediately; otherwise, \nyou would not be able to make a market; otherwise, you would not be \nable to do the contracts and, therefore, you would not be able to do \nthe business, which underlies the need for the derivative.\n  So all of that could be done. All of that could be done, and it does \nnot require creating this entity or these series of entities out there \nwhich the Federal Reserve has described as impairing the ``financial \nstability and strong prudential regulation of derivatives.'' In other \nwords, what the Federal Reserve is saying is, when you go in the \ndirection of what is being proposed from the Agriculture Committee in \nthe area of derivatives and set up this independent swap desk, you are \nnot making things stronger in our financial structure; you are making \nthem weaker. You are significantly reducing the strength of the \nregulatory arms that guide derivatives or oversee derivatives. You are \nalso, as I mentioned earlier, creating an almost guaranteed-to-fail \nsituation relative to the need for capital to support these derivative \ntransactions. It is just--it just makes no sense at all.\n\n  To begin with, derivatives are, by definition, a bank product, so the \nidea that they have to be spun out of banks and financial institutions \nis, on its face, absurd, truly absurd, and counterproductive to the \nwhole purpose of doing derivatives, which are very important. The \nCongress recognizes that. In Gramm-Leach-Bliley, we called derivatives \na bank product. We understood that then. We seem to have forgotten it \nnow.\n  I have been trying to figure out what is behind this type of language \nbecause it is so destructive to our competitiveness as a nation. This \nis the type of thing, as I said earlier, we would have seen in \nArgentina in the 1950s, this almost virulent populist attack on \nentities simply because they are large and because obviously there is a \npopulous feeling against them, which ends up, by the way, significantly \nimpacting Main Street in a negative way. Look at Argentina. In 1945, I \nbelieve, or 1937, somewhere in that period, they were the seventh best \neconomy in the world, the seventh most prosperous people in the world. \nNow they are like 54th. It is because of this populous movement which \nhas driven basically their ability to be competitive offshore. So now \nwe have this huge populous movement here, and I am trying to think what \nis behind it. What is the rationale here, other than just rampant \npandering populism? A vote occurred in the Budget Committee last week, \nof which I happen to be ranking member, which crystallized the \nsituation. Senator Sanders from Vermont--whom I consider a friend and I \nenjoy immensely. He is a great guy. He has a great sense of humor, but \nwe disagree on a lot of things. He runs as a Socialist. I run as a \nconservative. Senator Sanders offered an amendment which said that the \ngovernment--and the government, I assume, would be four or five people \ndown at Treasury or four or five people down at--I don't know where \nthey would be, some new offices somewhere--has the right to break up \nlarge corporations. It didn't say break up large corporations which had \nproblems, which had overextended themselves, which everybody agrees \nshould happen. That is what Senator Warner was talking about. He has \ndone extraordinary work in this area and I am supportive of his efforts \non resolution authority, where if a big bank, a big financial house or \na big entity gets into trouble, if they overextend themselves or they \nare essentially insolvent, they get broken up. There is no--the \ntaxpayers do not come in, in any way, shape or manner and support that \nentity. That is what the Warner-Corker language does, and I believe the \nSenator from Connecticut has tried to incorporate a large amount of \nthat. That should be our policy. But what the Sanders amendment said \nwas anything--any financial house--could be\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\nbroken up simply because it was deemed to be big, no matter how \nresilient or strong it is; no matter if it is a major player for our \nNation in being more competitive internationally.\n  Remember, when an American company goes overseas, they want to use an \nAmerican bank. They don't want to have to use the Credit Suisse or the \nBank of Singapore. They want to use an American bank to follow them \naround the world, and those banks have to be pretty big to do that. \nSome of them are quite profitable and quite strong. Well, this language \nwould have said no matter how strong and profitable you are and how \nrobust you are and how much you contribute to the American economic \nsystem by giving us one level of financial services--which we need as a \ncountry, large financial institutions that can support very complex, \nsophisticated, international economic activity and domestic economic \nactivity--that they would be broken up because a group of people in \nWashington didn't like them for social policy, social justice reasons. \nThey didn't lend enough money to some group they wanted them to lend to \nor they lent too much money to some group they didn't want money lent \nto. For social justice reasons, we will go in and break up this \ncompany, even though it is totally solvent, strong, fiscally \nresponsible.\n  That is the policy that was proposed in the Budget Committee. Ten \npeople voted for that policy. Ten. Ten out of the twenty-two people who \nvoted, voted for that policy. Incredible. Where does that stop? Where \ndoes that stop? Where does this section 106 stop? Do we break up \nWalmart because they are not union? Do we break up McDonald's because \nthey sell food that some people think makes you too fat? Do we break up \nCoca-Cola because they have too much sugar in their products? Does \nanything that is big in this country get broken up because there is an \nattitude that big is bad, whether it contributes or not? Unless you \nhappen to be big and union, in which case you get saved, of course, as \nthe UAW was able to work out with GM and Chrysler.\n  That is the essence of this language. This language isn't about \nfixing the derivatives market at all. You can fix the derivatives \nmarket in a most comprehensive and substantive and effective way that \nkeeps America the best place to create these types of products in the \nmost sound and safe way. You can do that, and I have outlined pretty \nspecifically how you would do it, without this section. I will close by \nreading one more time how the fair arbiter has defined it, the Federal \nReserve. This is such a damaging section that it cannot be \nunderestimated the damage to our economy were it to be approved.\n\n       Section 106 would impair financial stability and strong \n     prudential regulations of derivatives; would have serious \n     consequences for the competitiveness of U.S. financial \n     institutions; and would be highly disruptive and costly, both \n     for banks and their customers.\n\n  Remember, their customers are the people who work on Main Street for \nthe companies that use derivatives, and almost every company in this \ncountry of any size uses a derivative to hedge their risks. Ironically, \nthis is all done in the name of social justice because Wall Street is \nbad, so we are going to go out and cut off our nose to spite our face.\n  It is incomprehensible that a nation which has become as strong and \nas vibrant as we have by promoting a market economy would decide to go \ndown this route, which is the antipathy of a market economy, but that \nis where we are. That is what has happened here, and that is the \ndirection we are going. It is unnecessary, by the way, as I said \nearlier; unnecessary, because derivatives can be made safer and sounder \nby simply restructuring the transparency and the manner in which they \nare put on clearinghouses, limiting the amount of those that are \nsubject to exemption, and pushing people toward exchanges, to the \nfullest extent possible and to the extent it will work. All that can be \ndone without this type of language which is so destructive and, as the \nFed has said, will have the exact opposite effect of what it is alleged \nto be doing.\n  Mr. President, I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Hampshire. We \nare great friends and have worked together on a number of issues over \nthe years together. In a matter of months, both of us will be former \nMembers of this institution. Let me express my gratitude to him for his \nservice over the years and his commitment to these issues.\n  He has focused his attention on the particular matter coming out of \nthe Agriculture Committee, of which we are all very much aware. That \nproposal was supported by Democrats as well as, as my colleagues know, \na Republican on the committee. As my colleague from Arkansas pointed \nout and as I am sure we have heard already, there was at least an \nappearance of bipartisanship on this bill.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire raises some very important issues. \nThere are a number of our colleagues who have very strong feelings, \ndifferent than those of my friend and colleague from New Hampshire, as \nwe know; otherwise, it wouldn't have come out of the committee with the \nvote it did, and, therefore, the subject of a debate in this Chamber. I \nshould, of course, begin by thanking him as a member of the Banking \nCommittee for his participation involving our product in the Banking \nCommittee.\n  The issue before us in the next few minutes is whether we can have \nthis debate on these issues. Again, as my colleague from Alabama has \npointed out on several occasions, we are 80 percent or 90 percent, \nwhatever the number he wants to talk about, there in terms of agreeing \nto a major part of what our bill proposes. Obviously, we are not all \nthere. You can't ever get ``all there'' in one of these debates, before \nyou have the opportunity to do exactly that, where Members have a \nchance to be heard, to raise their ideas, a different point of view, \nand my friend from New Hampshire feels as passionately as do others \nabout their point of view. That is the purpose of having a debate and \nan institution such as this for that debate to occur.\n\n  My hope would be, again, that when this motion to proceed occurs, \nthough some may share the views of my friend from New Hampshire or some \nmay have an alternative view, as is certainly the case in major parts \nof this bill as I have written it along with my committee members--that \nis the purpose for which this institution exists, to have that debate. \nNo one Member, no one committee, no handful of Members should even \nsuggest that they have the right to write the legislation without the \nconsideration of others. So there is a difference of opinion on these \nmatters.\n  I see my colleague from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, if my friend will yield for a few \nminutes, I understand my friend from New Hampshire had something to \nsay.\n  Mr. DODD. What time is the vote to occur?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 5 p.m.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Vermont better take the next 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I will do what I can in 3 minutes.\n  My good friend from New Hampshire, my colleague from across the \nConnecticut River, apparently does not have a problem with the fact \nthat the largest financial institutions in this country that we bailed \nout because of their recklessness, greed, and illegal behavior have, \nsince the bailout, become even larger. Three out of the four major \nfinancial institutions, all of which were bailed out, have become \nlarger. No matter what anybody tells you, when one of these \ninstitutions is about to tip over and take a good part of the economy \nwith them, despite the rhetoric today, people are going to be bailing \nthem out, and they are going to lose millions of jobs if we don't.\n  The reality is, we have a situation now where the top six banks in \nthis country, despite what the Senator from New Hampshire has \nsuggested, now have total assets in excess of 63 percent of GDP. We are \ntalking over $7 trillion. When you have six institutions with 63 \npercent of total assets compared to GDP, I think we have a problem, and \nwe have a problem for two reasons. No. 1, we have a problem in terms of \ntaxpayer liability and the fact that we will, once again, have to bail \nthese behemoths out. Secondly, as Teddy Roosevelt told us 100-plus \nyears ago, it is time to break up these guys because they have \nincredible concentration of ownership over our entire economy.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that the Senator from New Hampshire can \nbe\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\ncomfortable as a conservative--doesn't like big government but \napparently doesn't mind huge financial institutions.\n  So I think that anyone who is not worried about the concentration of \nownership within our financial institutions is missing an enormously \nimportant point, not just from too big to fail but economic \nconcentration of ownership.\n  With that, I thank my friend from Connecticut and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I was not intending to speak because I \nwas hopeful that tonight we would have a simple vote that would move us \nto debate on a bill that I think people have been waiting for, for a \nlong time, and that is getting reform to our banking institutions and \nfinancial institutions.\n  I will say for those who are watching and listening, I am new here. I \nhave been here a little over a year, and I am trying to understand all \nof the process. But one thing I have learned is this great motion \ncalled a motion to proceed--a lot of people watch and see us vote and \nthink, oh, the bill has gone down.\n  This motion was a very simple motion. It allowed us to move to the \nbill so we can debate. What I have heard over the last several weeks \nand literally the last 48 hours is the desire for people to add \namendments and talk about it and do all of the things we want to do and \nto have full debate on the floor. But because of this simple motion \nthat the Senate requires, which I think is kind of a foolish motion--\nthat is my personal opinion--this motion to proceed, we are not even \nallowed now to debate this bill and offer amendments to this very \nimportant financial reform legislation.\n  So I am disappointed. I am disappointed for us as a body that we \ncan't move forward. Second, I think my constituents in Alaska are \ndisappointed that we don't have an opportunity to debate this issue and \nthrow amendments on the floor to refine a good piece of legislation and \nmove us forward to getting reform in our financial institutions, \nespecially these megabanks.\n  Over the last year and a half since I have been here--almost a year \nand a half--all I have heard about is how bad this economy was a year \nor so ago and what caused it was the financial institutions just kind \nof crashing in because of the rules--or the lack of rules--under which \nthey operated. The goal of the Senate is to try to create some rules, \nto make sure the public sees some transparency in these megabanks. Yet, \nfor whatever reason, our friends on the other side are not willing to \neven move this forward.\n  But I also learned today, just reading some of the material we get \nevery single minute around this place, that they have been working on a \nbill for months. I don't know where they have been working on this bill \nbecause I sure as heck haven't seen it. The public hasn't seen it. I do \nknow they have been having a lot of meetings up on Wall Street, and \nmaybe that is where they are writing the bill. But I haven't seen this \nbill for 2, 3, 4, 5 months, whatever the timetable they claim they have \nbeen working on some legislation. That is what I read today. But the \npublic hasn't seen it. The American people haven't seen it. And we \nactually had a chance tonight to vote to allow us to see it and have a \ndebate, and they wouldn't allow that.\n  So I am disappointed. I am disappointed that we don't have that \nopportunity. I am disappointed for the American people that we will not \nmove forward on banking and financial reform, which is desperately \nneeded. It is what crashed this economy, because of the lack of rules \nand the carelessness of so many with hard-earned dollars from working \npeople across this country that they had put into banks and anticipated \nit would be put aside and protected and not put into some high-risk \nventures that later on banks did and other megabanks did and caused \nthis economy to be in the position it is in today.\n  In Alaska, we have some great institutions. Our credit unions and our \ncommunity banks did a great job. They were not investing in risky \nventures. They were not investing in risky financial instruments with \nhard-earned dollars people put into those banks as investors or people \ndeposited in those banks. The credit unions and these small community \nbanks did a great job.\n  This is our opportunity to not continue the status quo. It is clear \nto me that the other side is interested in the status quo, where \nbillionaires became billionaires again by betting against the recovery \nof the economy, which is amazing, to me. They bet against the American \npeople. They hoped they would be foreclosed on. Those are the rules the \nother side wants to continue. Now, maybe I am living in another world. \nI am betting on the American people. I am betting on Alaskans, that we \nwant to move forward, not the status quo where this economy almost \ncrashed and burned.\n  At the same time, we want to make sure that banks in the future \ncannot be coming to the taxpayers and asking us for a bailout because \nthat ain't happening, at least while I am here, anymore. It is \noutrageous that the taxpayers got left behind in this process.\n\n[[Page S2623]]\n\n  So, again, I am disappointed. It is amazing, as I said, that they are \ndrafting some bill somewhere in some dark room somewhere. I don't know \nif it is in the Capitol or up on Wall Street. It is somewhat amazing to \nme, the people were complaining some time ago on some legislation they \nsaid we were drafting in the back room--which was not true--and now \nthey are doing the exact same thing they complained about. The \nhypocrisy is unbelievable.\n  So I was not planning to come down here and speak. I was voting like \nthe rest of us, thinking we were going to move forward, and here we \nare: No bill to offer amendments, no bill to strengthen our financial \nposition. Same old business as usual, status quo. The rich get richer. \nThe people who are working hard every single day suffer, lost their \n401(k)s or their education retirement accounts they set aside for their \nkids or thought they put them in a bank that was supposed to be secure, \nended up who knows where, except in a few people's pockets who were \nworking on Wall Street.\n  So I am disappointed. I would hope our colleagues on the other side \nwould allow us the opportunity to offer amendments to financial reform \nlegislation that will, for once and for all, hold these financial \ninstitutions accountable for the actions they caused to this country \nthat almost put us on the verge of bankruptcy.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to vent, I guess would be my view right \nnow, in aggravation of what is going on. But, again, it is our job to \nhold these financial institutions accountable for what they did to the \ntaxpayers of this country. I hope our colleagues on the other side will \nsee the light of day and join us to offer a debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I am pleased to be here with my \ncolleague from Alaska. I also was not planning to come to the floor to \ntalk about this tonight because I thought the vote was going to pass. \nThis is called a motion to proceed, and around here, I think that is \nSenate-speak for a motion to not get anything done. That is what \nhappens when we do these motions.\n  It is particularly aggravating because I was back in Colorado this \nweekend, as I am every weekend, traveling the State and had the chance \nto see the TV from time to time. You couldn't turn on a television \nstation without seeing some politician from this town on TV talking \nabout the importance of getting this work done, Democrats and \nRepublicans, people taking the time out of their weekend to say to the \nAmerican people: We are actually working hard to try to correct the \nproblems that led us into the worst recession since the Great \nDepression. Then we all get back to town on Monday and we don't get \nanything done. We take a vote, not on the bill but a vote that would \njust allow us to debate the bill, to amend the bill, to get Republican \namendments and Democrat amendments, to improve the legislation, and we \nare told we can't do that. We can have the debate on the airwaves, we \ncan have the debate all weekend long on television in front of the \nAmerican people, but when we come back here, in theory, to do the \npeople's business, somehow we cannot debate it anymore. This is the \nreason so many people across the country think Washington is completely \nout of touch.\n  There are people saying: Well, the recovery started. Everything is OK \nagain. And I am glad to see there are some signs of improvement in our \neconomy. But for the families in Colorado, there is still a lot of \nstruggle going on, there are still of lot of people worried about \nlosing their houses or how to replace the houses they have lost, \nworried about losing their jobs or how to pay for their kids' higher \neducation.\n  The last period of economic growth in our country's history before we \nwere pitched into the worst recession since the Great Depression was \nthe first time in this Nation's history ever, ever, that our economy \ngrew, our gross domestic product grew, but middle-class incomes fell in \nthe United States. In Colorado, it fell by $800, while the cost of \nhealth insurance went up by 97 percent, the cost of higher education \nwent up by 50 percent.\n  Our families are recovering not just from one recession but \neffectively from two recessions, and you would think the least we could \ndo would be to put some commonsense regulations in place that, had they \nbeen in place before the last crisis, we wouldn't have had the crisis \nto begin with.\n  Our last period of economic growth in this country was based on debt, \ntoo much debt at every level of the economy.\n  The consumers have too much debt. Washington has too much debt. Some \nbankholding companies in New York that historically had 12 to 14 times \ndebt to equity decided during that period to go to 28 and 30 times. By \nany standard, it is an incredibly risky strategy. To make matters \nworse, the way they leveraged themselves up was with derivatives that \nno regulator was looking at, that shareholders didn't even understand, \nthat bondholders didn't even understand. The commonsense reforms that \nare in place in this bill--because of the work of the Banking \nCommittee, the work of the Agriculture Committee, both committees on \nwhich I serve--would have cured that problem.\n  Ultimately, what we are trying to do is put ourselves in the position \nof never having to say some financial institution is too big to fail or \nthat the taxpayers have to hold a gun to their head and clean up \nsomebody else's greedy mistake; to make sure there is transparency in \nthe marketplace so we know what securities are being traded.\n  I have spent half my life in the private sector, a lot of it in the \ncapital markets. This is not an antibusiness piece of legislation. In \nfact, quite the contrary. There are a lot of businesses out there that \nhave been harmed terribly by judgments that were not made because they \nwere prudent business decisions but to make a fast buck.\n  Here we are on Monday night, after a weekend of people talking on \ntelevision programs, and we can't get done the American people's \nbusiness. Again, this is not an up-or-down vote on the bill. This is \njust a vote so we can have a debate on the floor of the Senate, so we \nhave the opportunity to amend and improve the bill. I am sure the bill \nis not perfect. In fact, I know it is not perfect. It has room for \nimprovement.\n  I see my colleague from the Banking Committee from the Commonwealth \nof Virginia is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, let me thank my colleague from Colorado, \na member of the Banking Committee, who has been part of trying to get \nthis bill right over the last 14, 15 months. He has spent a career in \nthe private sector, as I did. I think we both can read a balance sheet. \nWe both understand it is the capital markets that drive the American \neconomy. I think we both agree we want to keep America the capital of \ncapital formation for the whole world. We don't want this to migrate to \nLondon or Shanghai or elsewhere around the world.\n  We also know 18 months after we came to the precipice of a financial \nmeltdown ought to be enough time to put rules of the road into place so \nwe can give the market what it craves most, which is predictability.\n  I will not go on at length. I had the opportunity earlier when the \nchairman was here, and I think, unfortunately, I probably spoke for \nabout 40 minutes going through how we got to this point and all the \nthings in this bill to put these new rules of the road in place. I will \nonly make two or three quick points.\n  One, in my 15 months here, as a new guy, I have never seen a bill \nthat has had more bipartisan input than this piece of legislation. I \nhad a great colleague in Senator Corker from Tennessee. We worked on \nthe too-big-to-fail and the resolution piece. There are places that can \nstill be improved. I would love to work with Senator Corker on some \ntechnical amendments to make this better. But this was a bipartisan \npiece of legislation.\n  Two, I actually think there is a great deal of agreement on both \nsides of the aisle about our policy goals. I am not talking about the \nrole of government or who should get covered or not covered, the way it \nwas with health care. We all agree, no more taxpayer bailouts, more \ntransparency, that there ought to be some sense of fairness in the \nfinancial system, and that consumers ought to know the financial \nproducts they are using and buying, or\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\nmortgages they are making have some basic underlying protections. I \nhave yet to hear any of my colleagues on the other side disagree with \nthose basic premises. I think we are still working toward what I hope \nwill be, as opposed to some of the disappointments that have come out \nof this Chamber, something we can all be proud of and something the \nAmerican people can be proud of in that we found some common ground.\n  I have to acknowledge, I am not a very good political prognosticator. \nI assumed last week there was an 80-percent chance we would get a \nbipartisan bill. I still believe that. I am not sure anybody who is \nlistening tonight understands procedurally why our colleagues who share \nthe same goals, those of us who have been working in bipartisan teams, \nwho have amendments that will help strengthen the bill, shouldn't be \nspending tonight talking about those amendments, offering those \namendments, offering those improvements, having those who disagree \ndebating, when there was a bipartisan product to date and will be a \nbipartisan end solution, I believe. The American people demand, 18 \nmonths after the fact, that we put these new financial rules of the \nroad in place.\n  Unlike many of my colleagues, I get to go home to Virginia tonight. \nIf I run into a Virginian who wants an explanation of why we are not on \nthe bill, I would not know what to tell them. My friend from Colorado \nspent the weekend crisscrossing Colorado. He is asking folks to rehire \nhim. I share he is head scratching on why we aren't here talking about \nsomething on which there is not major policy differences. There is \ncommon agreement that we need to have reform, and a lot of the reform \nparts there is agreement on. Where there is not agreement, there is \nactually more bipartisan consensus on the form of the amendments.\n  I would love to hear from the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Virginia. As \nhe was talking, I was thinking about my work in the real world, as he \nhas had that experience. If you were in a position where everybody \nwanted to get it done, if there was general agreement that you were 80 \nor 90 percent of the way there, the way to get it done was not to not \ncontinue discussion. It wasn't to say: Well, I am going to pick up and \nfly back to Denver or fly back to Virginia until cooler heads prevail. \nIt was to stay in the room and get it done.\n  I think, particularly when this isn't about a private sector \ntransaction, this is about the American people's business, the people \nwho have hired everybody here to do this job, it is a shame that we \nshould not be out here tonight in a bipartisan way figuring out how to \ncross the t's and dot the i's and put a framework in place that would \nhave prevented the catastrophe our families are now continuing to live \nthrough.\n  Sometimes that is one of the things people forget. There are parts of \nthe economy that have recovered faster than others. There are parts of \nthe economy where people are getting hired or paid, other parts where \npeople are still struggling along. The people I saw this weekend were \npeople who were struggling along. They are not interested in engaging \nin class warfare, as some people say. What they are interested in is \nmaking sure we create a set of conditions where the game is not rigged \nand where they have some predictability in their lives as business \npeople and as working families.\n  Like my colleague, I am new. Maybe we don't know exactly the way this \nplace works. I hope somewhere in this building there are people who are \ncoming together to figure out how we can create the conditions where we \ncould at least get a vote to have the conversation about how to get to \nthat last 10 percent on this bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Again, one final comment. I know the Presiding Officer is \na new Member as well. This is one of those moments when there has been \na year and a half of bipartisan work that has gone on, when there seems \nto be a commonality of interest in what the goals of financial reform \nare. I don't know about the Presiding Officer, I don't know about my \nfriend from Colorado, but I never got the memo that said our job wasn't \nactually to get stuff done. There were legitimate, major policy \ndifferences in the health care discussion. But in this discussion, \nthere are things that need to be worked out, but the goals we have all \nagreed on. The bipartisan working groups have been at it for more than \na year.\n  I implore my colleagues from the other side of the aisle, I don't \nknow if maybe there was some procedural shenanigans, that kind of back \nand forth. But I hope my colleagues from the other side of the aisle--I \nsee my colleague actually who has great expertise in the financial \nsector, the new Senator from North Carolina coming in--some of the \nnewer folks, whatever the reason our colleagues on the other side \ndidn't want to get to a real discussion of the bill, I hope they can \ncome back later tonight, first thing tomorrow, and we can move to this \nbill, talk about it, put forward those amendments. I know I will have \nsome bipartisan amendments to make the bill stronger.\n  I know my colleagues will. At the end of the day, let us get the \npeople's business done. As my friend has said, the Dow may be back \nnorth of 11,000, but that doesn't mean much if you don't have a job. \nOne of the ways we can guarantee the financial markets will continue to \nhave the capital to make the loans, to make the investments, to create \nthat next wave of jobs is to make sure we have in place financial rules \nof the road.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I, too, am disappointed that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided against even \ndebating Wall Street reform legislation in the Senate. It has been \nalmost 2 years since our financial system stood on the brink of \nabsolute catastrophe. The meltdown on Wall Street has wreaked havoc on \nMain Street across America. Millions of Americans lost their homes, \ntheir jobs, their retirement savings. Taxpayers were asked to fund a \nmassive bailout of Wall Street.\n  Here we are, a full 2 years later, trying to debate a bill that will \nestablish new rules of the road, create a more stable financial system, \nand ensure the American taxpayer will not be asked to bail out Wall \nStreet banks again. I am sorry to say my colleagues today voted to \nstand up for Wall Street instead of standing up for all the people on \nMain Street who lost their job and their entire life savings.\n  They voted against the seniors who saw their 401(k)s instantly eaten \naway by the reckless games Wall Street was playing with their hard-\nearned money.\n  In my State, this recession, the worst since the Great Depression, \nhas meant that currently half a million North Carolinians are out of \nwork. In many families, both the husband and wife are out of a job. \nThey are worried how they will put food on the table for their \nfamilies.\n  Democrats have been working in good faith for many months on a bill \nto hold Wall Street accountable for gambling with the money of North \nCarolinians and people across the country. I know Chairman Dodd has \nbeen working with Republicans on the Banking Committee for the last \nyear and a half. The time has come to have this debate on the floor of \nthe Senate. Wall Street reform means ending taxpayer-funded bailouts. \nIt also means establishing new standards for the complicated financial \nproducts that contributed to this economic downturn.\n  The purpose of this bill is to ensure the recent financial meltdown \nnever happens again and that we protect seniors who lost retirement \nsavings and small business owners who got caught up in the credit \nfreeze and the countless Americans who lost their job. It means \nprotection for consumers from irresponsible banking practices and \ngreater certainty for bankers. Banks need to be able to understand what \nthe ground rules will be so they can focus on the business of banking. \nNorth Carolina is a leader in the banking industry. Both our State's \nbanks and banking customers will benefit from responsible financial \nreforms.\n  The proposed legislation also creates an office of financial literacy \nthat will develop initiatives intended to educate and empower consumers \nto make informed financial decisions. Our students today need the tools \nto understand financial products and how to manage debt, including \nmortgages, student loans, and credit cards.\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues will listen to the American people on this \nissue. It is imperative we pass commonsense Wall Street reform so \nAmerican taxpayers will never again have to shoulder the cost of a \nfinancial crisis.\n  Madam President, I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I am disappointed but not surprised \nthat our Republican colleagues have chosen not to go forward in terms \nof financial reform because we should be very clear that when we do \nfinancial Wall Street reform, we are taking on not only the most \npowerful people in the United States of America but some of the most \npowerful people in the world--people of endless resources.\n  When Congress deregulated Wall Street, against my vote, Wall Street \nand their allies, over a 10-year period, spent $5 billion fighting for \nderegulation so they could be in a position to do anything they wanted, \nwhich was, of course, what brought us the terrible recession we are \ncurrently in. Last year alone, in 2009, the financial interests spent \n$300 million in lobbying, campaign contributions, in order to fight \nfinance and Wall Street reform. So I am not surprised that at this \npoint our Republican friends have not chosen to go forward. I hope they \nchange their mind, and I hope they know back home the American people \nare profoundly disgusted at the behavior of Wall Street, and they want \nto make sure we never again will be placed in the position of having to \nbail out people who, through their greed and recklessness, have brought \nsuffering to tens and tens of millions of Americans.\n  As we proceed--and I believe we will proceed--to Wall Street reform, \nit is also important we not just pass something for the sake of a press \nrelease but we do something substantive. There are a lot of issues out \nthere. I know Senator Dodd has brought forth a bill with 1,600 pages in \nit. There are dozens and dozens and dozens of important issues. I want \nto touch on simply three that I believe are essential if we are going \nto be serious--underline ``serious''--about Wall Street reform.\n  Issue No. 1. I receive calls every week from Vermonters--and I \nsuspect the Presiding Officer does from people in New Hampshire--who \nare disgusted by having to pay 25-, 30-, 35-percent interest rates on \ntheir credit cards. In my view, usury is immoral. If you look at \nChristianity or Judaism or Islam or any of the major religions, they \nmake the point that charging outrageous interest rates to desperate \npeople is immoral.\n  We finally have to end usury in the United States. We have to put a \ncap on the interest rates that financial institutions can charge when \nthey issue credit cards. The amendment I will be bringing before the \nfloor is similar to what has existed for several decades now for credit \nunions. Credit unions today are doing just fine, but they cannot charge \nmore than 15-percent interest rates, except under exceptional \ncircumstances. If it is good for credit unions, it is good, in my view, \nfor Wall Street and large financial institutions.\n  Second of all, I think there is great skepticism about the role of \nthe Fed and the lack of transparency that exists in the Federal \nReserve. About a year ago, Chairman Bernanke came before the Budget \nCommittee on which I serve and I asked him a pretty simple question. I \nsaid: Mr. Chairman, you have lent out trillions--underline \n``trillions''--of dollars in zero or near-zero interest loans to the \nlargest financial institutions in America. Could you please tell me and \nthe American people who received those trillions of dollars in loans?\n  I do not think that was a terribly unfair question to ask. Mr. \nBernanke said: No, I am not going to tell you. He gave me his reasons \nwhy. I disagreed. The American people have a right to know who received \nthose loans. The American people have a right to know whether some of \nthose large financial institutions took those zero-percent interest \nloans and then went out and bought government bonds, T bonds, at 3-\npercent interest, which, if true--as I suspect it is--is a huge scam, a \nhuge scam. So we need transparency in the Fed, and I am going to bring \nan amendment to the floor to do that.\n  The third point I want to make is, in, I believe, November of 2009 I \nintroduced legislation--three pages--very simple legislation, which \ncalled for breaking up large financial institutions. As this bill \nproceeds, my colleagues Senator Brown and Senator Kaufman are going to \nbe offering a bill along those lines, which basically says if an \ninstitution is so large that its collapse will bring systemic damage to \nthe entire economy, we have to start breaking up those institutions--\nbreak them up. If a financial institution is too big to fail, in my \nview, it is too big to exist.\n  The issue here is not just the liability, the potential liability for \nthe taxpayers of this country if a large financial institution \ncollapses and we have to bail them out, it is also an economic issue. \nAre we comfortable when, according to Simon Johnson, the former chief \neconomist of the IMF, ``as a result of the crisis and various \ngovernment rescue efforts, the largest six banks in our economy now \nhave total assets in excess of 63 percent of GDP. . . . This is a \nsignificant increase from even 2006. . . .''\n  I find it quite interesting the senior Senator from New Hampshire was \non the floor a little while ago attacking me because in the Budget \nCommittee I brought up a resolution which lost 12 to 10 to begin to \nbreak up these large financial institutions. I get a little bit tired \nof our conservative friends who say: Oh, the government cannot do \nanything. We hate big government. But apparently they do not hate large \nfinancial institutions, six of which have assets equivalent to over 60 \npercent of the GDP of this country.\n  Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, over 100 years ago started \nbreaking up large financial institutions, large corporations. What we \nare talking about now is a handful of corporations, of financial \ninstitutions that play a very negative role in creating a stranglehold \nand a lack of competition in our entire economy. I intend to be \nstrongly supporting the amendment brought forth by Senator Brown and \nSenator Kaufman. I think it is moving exactly in the right direction.\n  So I am disappointed but not surprised that the Republicans have not \nchosen to go forward on Wall Street reform. I hope they will reconsider \nthat. When we do go forward, I hope we listen to the American people, \nwe take serious action, and we start the process of standing up to some \nof the most powerful people not only in this country but in the world.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I appreciate the words from the \nSenator from Vermont and his support of the Brown-Kaufman amendment and \nhis work on real Wall Street reform.\n  Two years ago, as we know, we were on the verge of another Great \nDepression. Wall Street had gorged itself on greed and junk debt. \nMarkets panicked and chaos and hardship threatened Main Street. At the \nrequest of the Bush administration, we acted swiftly, we acted \nbipartisanly, to pull ourselves back from the brink of economic \ncollapse. We saved the banks temporarily, as we should have, but Wall \nStreet recklessness, aided and abetted by lax regulation and \nderegulation and appointments by the Bush administration of people far \ntoo friendly to Wall Street, had done its damage. Wall Street's greed \nled to more than 7 million Americans losing their jobs.\n  Go to Mansfield or Lima or Sandusky or Cleveland or Zanesville and \nsee the damage it did to American manufacturing. Wall Street's excess \nand rampant speculation caused nearly 6 million home foreclosures. Go \nto neighborhoods in Over-the-Rhine in Cincinnati or go to neighborhoods \non the west side of Cleveland or go to neighborhoods in north Columbus \nand see the damage Wall Street excess and rampant speculation caused to \nhomes and families in my State.\n  Here we are 2 years later and Wall Street is continuing to risk Main \nStreet jobs, Main Street pensions, and Main Street homes on get-rich-\nquick schemes. Here we are 2 years later in reach of legislation \ndesigned to put an end to the recklessness, and Wall Street and Senate \nRepublicans--and sometimes it is hard to tell the difference--are \ndelaying and hoping to kill any such reforms. We cannot afford to let \nthis be delayed any further. Bear Stearns collapsed 2 years ago.\n\n  Senator Dodd, after careful thought, put out a working draft of \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\nthe following November. There was a big hue and cry over that draft--\nmany said it was too tough on Wall Street--but Chairman Dodd continued \nworking on the draft, talking to Republicans and Democrats on the \nBanking Committee and throughout the Senate. He put together bipartisan \nworking groups, including Senators Corker and Warner, Senators Gregg \nand Reed, Senators Dodd and Shelby, and Senators Crapo and Schumer--a \nRepublican and a Democrat in each negotiating team.\n  So we have been working on this since the start of the financial \ncrisis. It has been months since Senator Dodd first put his legislation \nout for the public's review. But here we are tonight--requesting a \nsimple up-or-down vote so we can start debate--and the entire Senate \nRepublican caucus said no.\n  They are filibustering. They are delaying. I think they are trying to \ndestroy this bill. All we are trying to do tonight is--not pass \nlegislation; we know we are not ready to do that yet--all we are trying \nto do is move the bill forward so any Senator, whether it is a \nRepublican colleague or a Democratic colleague, can offer an amendment. \nThere are good amendments out there that can make a strong bill even \nstronger.\n  There is an amendment going to be offered by Senator Corker. He and I \ntalked about this on our Sunday morning show this week--just \nyesterday--an amendment on clawing back executive compensation that he \nhas been working on that seems to make sense.\n  There is an amendment Senator Kaufman and I have been working on to \nput size limits on banks and end the days of banks that are too big to \nfail. If banks are too big to fail, those banks simply are too big.\n  I would add, 15 years ago, the combined assets of the six largest \nbanks in America were 17 percent of GDP. The combined assets of the six \nlargest banks in America today are 63 percent of GDP.\n  There are other amendments that can finally hold Wall Street \naccountable for its own mistakes offered by some Republicans and some \nDemocrats. We just want to move forward so those amendments can be \nconsidered.\n  So it is unfortunate when Senate Republican leadership--and I know \nthere are Republicans who want to work with us, but when Senate \nRepublican leadership pulls their colleagues back from doing the right \nthing. We saw the same tactic with the health insurance debate--delay \nand delay--only to find obstruction at the end. We know if they can \ndelay and delay, as officials in the American bank associations have \nsaid, that is the best way to kill this legislation and to get their \nway--if they can delay this for months and months and months. We saw \nthose same delaying tactics with essential programs such as \nunemployment insurance and COBRA.\n  This is not a time to play games with the financial well-being of \nhard-working Americans, of hard-working middle-class Ohioans. I wish \nRepublican Senators could vote to do the right thing instead of simply \nfollowing the political calculus that the minority leader and the rest \nof the Republican leadership wants. It certainly is not the will of the \nAmerican people.\n  Just today, a Washington Post/ABC News poll release said 65 percent \nof Americans favor ``stricter federal regulations on the way banks and \nother financial institutions conduct their business.''\n  It certainly is not following the experiences of people in Ohio and \nacross the country who have lost jobs and lost much of their wealth \nbecause of Wall Street greed and excess. It is not following the \nexperiences of small business owners across the Nation.\n  I have talked to small business owners in Dayton and Springfield and \nZanesville and Cambridge and Steubenville and Findlay who simply cannot \nget credit. They cannot understand, with the money Wall Street has been \nrewarded with, if you will--or they were bailed out with--that they \nstill cannot get the kind of credit they need to make their businesses \na success.\n  This legislation would make financial institutions, not American \ntaxpayers, pay for their mistakes. We can't predict the next economic \ndisaster, but if we protect consumers and investors, we can probably \nprevent it. Wall Street reform could provide the strongest consumer \nprotections for Ohioans. No more of the tricks and the traps in the \nmortgage market and elsewhere that led to the near collapse of our \neconomy.\n  Wall Street banks wrecked our economy, got a taxpayer-funded bailout, \nand are profiting again, while working Americans continue to suffer. We \ncan't sit by any longer and continue to do nothing. We need to move \nnow. No more meltdowns. No more bailouts. No more cutting backroom \ndeals to prevent reform.\n  In order for us to get there, we need to move this bill forward. We \nneed our Republican colleagues to say yes--not vote for the bill but \njust say yes to move the bill forward so we can actually have debate on \nthe bill. We need to bring this bill out into the public light so the \nAmerican people know who is fighting on their side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

The motion to proceed to S. 3217.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the vote we had \njust a few minutes ago, a vote that was a victory for Wall Street but \nnot a victory for the American taxpayer. We hear our Republican \ncolleagues proclaim they are for Wall Street reform, that they are on \nthe reform bandwagon, but then they seem to pull the emergency brake. \nThey say they are on the reform bandwagon, and yet when they have a \nchance to move forward and simply to debate the process, they pull the \nemergency brake.\n  The approach our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have taken \non Wall Street reform symbolizes America's worst fears about how the \npowerful operate. They held a closed-door strategy session with Wall \nStreet executives that, from published reports, included solicitations \nfor their campaign committee. Then they marched into this Chamber with \na script, a Wall Street playbook written by the Nation's most \nsignificant Republican political consultant. Rather than debating what \nwas in the bill, they went to the Wall Street playbook. They waved the \nflag. They proclaimed their patriotic intention to protect Americans \nfrom those who took us to the brink of economic disaster. But then they \nplayed the fear card and they talked about bailouts and told Americans \nthey would pay.\n  Americans realize our Wall Street reform is actually what, in \nessence, has to be done to end taxpayer bailouts, that opponents are \njust playing fast and loose with the facts to protect the big banks \ninstead of taxpayers. Our colleagues on the other side claim to embrace \nWall Street reform in front of the cameras, while behind the scene, \nbehind closed doors they continue to strategize with Wall Street about \nhow to kill this legislation.\n  I am sure families in my State and across the country who are \nhurting, who lost their jobs, their health care, lost their homes \nbecause of the reckless excesses of Wall Street profiteers driven by \nprofits at any cost, the value of their property has plummeted, their \n401(k)s have been decimated, their hope for a decent retirement that \nthey had worked for is largely gone at this point, American taxpayers \nwant accountability, not trickery. They want all of us in this Chamber \nto stand up for them and mean it, not stand up for Wall Street and try \nto find a clever way to make it look like they are for Main Street.\n  We need only to look at the actions of those on the other side over \nthe past 2 weeks to see the other story. They huddle with Wall Street. \nThey strategize about how to protect Wall Street, but they make it \nsound like they are protecting Main Street. It is a game of mirrors: \nappear to stand for reform but do Wall Street's bidding. They hired a \npolitical consultant to tell them which words to use and came up with: \nThe American people do not like taxpayer bailouts. All you have to say \nabout this real effort for reform is that it is a taxpayer bailout, and \nthey will hate it.\n  The only problem is, the facts do not fit their rhetoric. The bill we \nwould have gone on to debate, in fact, ends taxpayer bailouts by \nreining in the excesses of Wall Street, and that is exactly why Wall \nStreet is working so hard with the other side to defeat it. They play \nthe fear card, as they always have. Then they try to distance \nthemselves from that consultant, but not before they march in lockstep \nto the microphones and tell Americans this is a bailout bill, it will \ncost taxpayers billions and lead to more and bigger bailouts, that it \nis another government intrusion into their lives.\n  Fear is a powerful force, and in the short term sometimes fear is far \nmore powerful than the truth. But in the long term, it simply is not \ntrue. Maybe that is why truth has been the first casualty of every \nargument we have heard from the other side, whether on the Recovery \nAct, on putting people to work, on making health care more affordable, \non extending unemployment insurance for those who are struggling, and \nnow on reining in those who brought us to the edge of economic ruin \nafter 8 years of lax regulatory policies that let Wall Street run wild.\n  Now that the fear card does not seem to be working, suddenly our \nfriends stand in front of the microphones and claim to be in favor of \nreform. Yet at the end of it all they could have cast a vote to let us \nbegin to work together on the process. But they continue to confer with \nWall Street and tell their members once again, as they have on every \nmajor piece of reform legislation that has come before this Chamber, to \nstand in lockstep and vote no--a ``no'' vote against even starting the \ndebate.\n  I say to my colleagues today, blindly following your consultant did \nnot work out so well, and neither will blindly following an \nobstructionist strategy work out very well either. The American people \nhave figured out the trick. You cannot talk like a gladiator and put on \nthe show for the taxpayers and then be a mouthpiece for Wall Street.\n  Doing nothing and calling it leadership is not an answer. Saying no \nonce again and keeping the status quo is not an option. Saying no to \nsensible Wall Street reform is a sure-fire way to wind up right back in \nthe same mess we just got out of recently. Saying no is the surest \nrecipe for more taxpayer bailouts.\n  The bottom line is, we as Democrats are here to say yes to \ncommonsense reform so that Wall Street excesses will never take us to \nthe brink of economic ruin again, yes to a free market. But there is a \ndifference between a free market and a free-for-all market. What we \nhave had is a free-for-all market.\n  Our Republican colleagues seem to want the free-for-all system to \nremain exactly as it is: same lack of rules, same lack of oversight, \nsame megaprofits for the large Wall Street banks. I ask, at whose \nexpense, at what cost to American families, at what risk to the very \nfoundation of our economic system?\n  If our colleagues are serious about ending taxpayer bailouts, then \nthey should favor making banks pay for their reckless behavior. \nInstead, they come to the floor one after another in an attempt to gut \nit. What they oppose, what they are once again saying no to is asking \nthe Wall Street firms to pay to insure against their own failure.\n  We should also remember today, after this vote, as we look back at 8 \nyears of an administration that nodded and winked and turned a blind \neye to Wall Street's schemes, that history has a way of repeating \nitself. Let's not forget the reckless behavior of the big banks and \nother entities and lenders and Wall Street speculators that sent the \neconomy into a near depression last year has a historic precedent, as \ndo the muscular safeguards and regulations that we must implement this \nyear to protect consumers so it never happens again. That precedent was \nthe Great Depression. It came after a period of Republican Presidents--\nHarding, Coolidge, Hoover--who sided with free-wheeling companies to \novercome commonsense regulations. We had no choice but to clean up the \nmess with a period of sustained, robust regulations implemented by \nanother Democratic administration at that time.\n  Once again, the time has come after the economic damage has been done \nto put in place a series of robust reforms and safeguards so it never \nhappens again. Once again, just as they did after the Great Depression, \nour Republican colleagues are saying, no, leave things as they are. \nThere is no need for Wall Street reforms. Let the market take care of \nitself. They want to say no to the lessons of history. We need to say \nyes to commonsense reforms; yes to sensible oversight and regulations; \nyes to protecting the jobs, homes, and retirement savings of families \nwho have been playing by the rules; yes to protecting them from more \nreckless financial gambling and creative derivative schemes; yes to \nguaranteeing taxpayers will never be on the hook the next time risky \ncorporate decisions force a too-big-to-fail company into bankruptcy.\n  We cannot have a system where big Wall Street banks and others take \nhuge gambles knowing they can keep the gains if they win but we as a \ncountry will pay the costs if they lose. That is playing Russian \nroulette with our economy. When that happens, the victims are hard-\nworking families who did everything right. They played by the rules. \nWall Street did not. And they expect us to make it right. They worked \nas hard as they could at every job they had and earned all their lives \nto buy a\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\nhome and raise their families, send their kids to college, and maybe, \njust maybe, put something away for a decent, safe, comfortable \nretirement.\n  Now they sit at the kitchen table at night asking heartrending \nquestions: Can we afford the mortgage this month? Can we keep our \nhealth insurance? How do we pay our credit card bills? Will we keep our \njobs? Will we lose our home? Can we ever retire?\n  These are the families who needed a ``yes'' vote a little while ago. \nThey need our protection. They did not deserve what happened to them. \nWe have a chance to make things right so it will never happen again. \nThe Senate needs to take up Wall Street reform.\n  The choice is simple: Do we stand for a banking system that is fair, \ntransparent, and honest or do we stand for a banking system that takes \nadvantage of consumers, one in which speculation runs wild and puts the \nentire economy at constant risk? Do we stand on the side of working \nfamilies who played by the rules, or do we stand on the side of Wall \nStreet and big banks? Not the community banks because they are not the \nones who got us into this but those large institutions that have gotten \nfar too comfortable writing their own rules.\n  In my view, the choice is clear. It is time for the Senate to step to \nthe plate on behalf of working families. It is time for reform. It is \ntime to end too big to fail. It is time to rein in the bulls. It is \ntime to protect hard-working taxpayers. It is time to simply move \nforward and take up the debate.\n  I hope the majority leader will bring us to another vote so that we \ncan, in fact, get to that moment in which we can move forward and have \nthe debate and have the amendments and ultimately know who stands for \nthe taxpayer and who stands for Wall Street. I hope there will be \nenough votes here to make sure this institution of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people is going to put them first.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment \nthat we were unable to reach an agreement today to begin debate on \nreforming Wall Street. As my colleague from New Jersey, Senator \nMenendez, so eloquently put it, this is not the time to say no. This is \nthe time to move forward and get something done.\n  Someone referred to the Senate the other day as dysfunction junction. \nIt was a nice little rhyme, and I can tell you it is incidents such as \nthe one we saw tonight, where our friends on the other side of the \naisle will not even allow debate to start, that leads to that sad name. \nWe are ready to move away from the station. There are those of us who \nhave been out talking to our constituents, and we know the train has to \nleave the junction. The train has to move ahead, and we need to move \nahead with this Wall Street reform.\n  Last week, I came to the floor with some of my colleagues to talk \nabout another delay--a delay of nominations. These are nominees who \nhave been voted out of committee, sometimes with unanimous support, but \nare now waiting months for a full vote on the Senate floor. During this \nsame timeframe in the Bush administration, five nominees were \noutstanding. Yet the same time during the Obama administration over 100 \nnominees are outstanding. So if there is anyone who doesn't believe us \nabout this delay and what is going on, look at those numbers and look \nat what is happening with this reform.\n  It is ironic we are talking about putting rules in place to prevent \nWall Street from gaming the system, when we have plenty of Senators who \nare gaming the system right here. But there is a problem with that. The \nAmerican people aren't a game of chance. They don't want the dice \nrolled over their futures. They don't want the dice rolled over their \nfamily homes. They want us to get this done.\n  Look at what has happened with this filibuster, again stopping us \nfrom going to debate. In the entire 19th century, including the \nstruggle and the debate about slavery, fewer than two dozen filibusters \nwere mounted. Between 1933 and the coming of the war, it was attempted \nonly twice. Under Eisenhower and JFK, the pattern continued. In 8 years \nof the Eisenhower administration, only two filibusters were mounted. \nUnder Kennedy, there were four. But now we see this tactic being \nemployed over and over. This year alone, since January, we have had \nover 50 filibusters.\n  I can tell you I believe, in the end, we are going to get this done. \nI believe, in the end, we will have Republican votes for this bill \nbecause I know there are some colleagues on that side of the aisle who \nwant to get this bill done and who have been working to get it done. \nBut the reasons I heard raised today for holding up debate do not ring \ntrue.\n  First off, advancing the idea that this bill isn't already a \nbipartisan product would be a slight to all those who have worked on \nit. I see Senator Dodd over here, who worked for months and months and \nmonths to craft a bipartisan bill. The bill we have before us is the \nproduct of countless hours of negotiation between Members on both sides \nof the aisle and incorporates many of the agreements that were reached.\n  If anyone thinks there is a more important issue to have before the \nSenate, that there is some reason we shouldn't be debating this, I \ndon't think they have been talking to the people back home. The people \nunderstand that while Wall Street maybe got a cold and has bounced back \nand is doing well, Main Street has pneumonia. Small businesses today \nare still starved for credit. The small banks, which Senator Menendez \npointed out had nothing to do with starting this crisis, are also \nsuffering. That is what is happening in this country today.\n  Nearly 3 years after our financial system began to melt down, America \ncontinues to suffer the effects of the worst economic crisis since the \nGreat Depression. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, homes, \nretirements, and savings. Although some key indicators are beginning to \nmove in the right direction, I can tell you, having been home this last \nweekend, many families are still struggling, and the economic damage is \nslow to reverse itself on Main Street.\n  Meanwhile, on Wall Street, the largest firms handed out record \nbonuses totaling nearly $146 billion, an 18-percent increase from 2008. \nWhat do we have at home? U.S. per capita income declined 2.6 percent. \nBoiled down to its essentials, the financial crisis was about risk. \nEveryone thought they could manage but, instead, things got wildly out \nof control. Three years later--and I think it is hard for people to \nbelieve this--we can't seem to even get past a debate tonight about \nactually getting the bill on the floor. Three years later Wall Street \nis still operating by the same old rules. That is why it is so \nimportant we begin this debate.\n  There may be some of my colleagues who think all Wall Street needs is \nfixing a few potholes. Well, that has been tried before and it \ncertainly didn't work. I think what we need are some stop signs at some \nintersections and some very good traffic cops. There is a lot more to \nthe modern financial system, as we all learned, than meets the eye. We \nneed transparency and accountability. That is in this bill. We need an \nearly warning system for too big to fail. That is in the bill.\n  We need derivatives reform, and I am not talking about the good work \nbusinesses do to weather an economic storm when they hedge their bets \nwithin their businesses. I am talking about the wildly out-of-control, \nover-the-counter derivative trails when financial institutions were \ntrading things they didn't even understand and creating the big mess we \nare in.\n  Reform legislation must include, and this legislation does include, \nprovisions to look out for the best interests of consumers by educating \nthem about their financial choices, ensuring that they have access to \nless risky products and protecting them from abusive sales practices, \nincluding from nonbank lenders. When we look back at what happened the \nlast few years, it is like Wall Street was driving down the street in \ntheir Ferrari and the government was following behind in a Model T \nFord. That has to stop.\n  When we look at the history of this country, when we have been \nconfronted by major challenges, we always rose to those challenges. \nWhen Hitler was running across Europe and Pearl Harbor happened, our \ncountry didn't just say no. We rose to the challenge, and the greatest \ngeneration won that war. When the Russians were going to put a man on \nthe Moon, we didn't just say: Oh, go ahead. We are not going to get \ninvolved.\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Burris.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota for allowing my interruption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota retains the floor.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. As I was saying, Mr. President, this country has done \nwell not by saying no but by saying yes and by moving ahead and getting \nthings done. We can't let this continue. We have to put these rules in \nplace.\n  Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are, in good \nfaith, negotiating; others are not. The American people will not allow \nthis gamesmanship to continue. The game is over. Let's debate. Let's \nget some amendments. There are changes we can make to the bill, changes \nI support. But the only way we are going to get this done is by getting \nthis bill on the floor and allowing for debate. The American people \ndeserve nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I first came to this place in 1973, \nworking for then-Senator Biden, and one of the things you learn around \nhere, after you have been here a while, is the American people don't \ncare about procedure. That is one of those things they don't care \nabout--procedure. It is all too complicated. I don't blame them. Half \nthe time, I don't know what the procedure is. Procedure doesn't work.\n  But during those 37-some years, every once in a while something comes \nalong where procedure matters. Our friends on the other side of the \naisle have had a field day on procedure for the past 15 months I have \nbeen here, and they count on the fact that nobody in America cares \nabout procedure. So what they have done is, time and again, they have \nfilibustered motions to proceed. That is hard to explain to someone out \nin America.\n  What is a filibuster on a motion to proceed? That is hard to figure \nout. So you can get away with that. You can filibuster on a motion to \nproceed and then you can filibuster on the bill and then filibuster on \ncloture and all these words mean nothing to most Americans.\n  I am all for filibusters. I think it is important to maintain the \nrights of political minorities, and that is the way to do it. I say to \nmy colleagues who are here and who want to change the filibuster rule, \nspend a year in the minority or 2 years in the minority and then come \nto me and tell me you want to change the filibuster rule. What people \ndon't realize--those who want to change the filibuster rule--is that \nwhen one side or the other gets out too far, then the American people \nnotice what goes on and they come in and they fix it.\n  I am convinced that is what is going to happen today. I think the \nAmerican people have figured out what it is my friends on the other \nside are doing. They are my friends. We just have a different point of \nview. Everywhere I go in this country, people are concerned about what \nhappened--everywhere. They are concerned because they have so many \nfriends and relations who lost jobs and other friends and relations who \nhave lost their houses and they say: What are you going to do about it? \nWhat are you in Washington going to do about it? Don't you get it? \nDon't you understand what is happening here? You are not going to do \nanything about this?\n  I have watched Senator Dodd work for hours and days and months--and, \nfrankly, years--to try to put together a bill so we can vote on what \nwill be a bipartisan bill. I have been hanging out at this place or \nteaching about it for 37 years, and I have never seen anyone work any \nharder to try to get a bipartisan bill. Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I got a \nlittle frustrated because it took so long. But Chairman Dodd did the \nright thing because I think he knew, at some point, if we didn't get \nagreement, we would be here and we would be faced with charges that \nthis was a partisan bill. This is not a partisan bill.\n  As you know, Mr. President, you and I have differences with this \nbill. The Presiding Officer and Senator Levin have an amendment to \noffer, which I am a cosponsor of, to change the bill. I have an \namendment with Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio to make some changes to \nthe bill. Senator Cantwell and Senator McCain have an amendment that I \nam a cosponsor of. There are three amendments already that I am in \nfavor of to change this bill. I have heard Chairman Dodd say time and \nagain, this is not the perfect bill. This is a bipartisan bill. We have \nput a lot of effort into it. But he has welcomed the opportunity for \npeople to come forward and offer amendments.\n  I don't get it, how you can say you don't agree with a bill, but you \nwill not let anything happen on it and on an issue such as this--an \nissue that is so important to the American people. It is so important \nthat we get it right. It is time. Committees are great, and I support \nthe committee system. I think they are wonderful. I think negotiations \nare great. I think the bipartisan negotiations that have been going \non--and I know they are going on because I have seen them on the floor. \nI have seen there are about 10 or 12 members from the Banking Committee \nwho are working.\n  Chairman Dodd, in the beginning, set this up and he delegated it down \nso Senator Warner and Senator Corker were working together. He had a \nRepublican and a Democrat working on each of these things. They are \nstill working, as we talk now. But it is time for that to stop. It is \ntime for us to get out in the open and be a Senate. It is time for us \nto debate these issues in the open. It is time for the Republican Party \nto decide if they want to do something about Wall Street reform. I hope \nthey are listening. In my opinion, we should stay and discuss it until \nwe are ready to go. We are going to disagree.\n  One of the big things I am in favor of is returning to Glass-\nSteagall. When we voted on that in 1999, Senator Dorgan voted against \nit and Senator Shelby voted against it. These are not issues that are \nRepublican or Democratic issues, in my opinion. I have talked to my \ncolleagues on the other side about some of the amendments I am \noffering, and they say they are interested in them. I don't see this as \nbeing a partisan fight. I think it looks like a fight to get political \nadvantage. I am very hesitant to bring that forward, but that is what \nit looks like to me. It looks like they do not want to vote, period. I \nknow that is not true for certain Members on the other side. I know \nthey wish to talk about these issues.\n  So I wish to say to the American people tonight, it is time to \ncontact your Senator and say: Let's bring financial regulatory reform \nto the floor. Let's debate the issues on it. Let's get to the \namendments and let's pass it so millions of Americans who have lost \ntheir jobs and their homes know we in the Senate have done everything \nwe can to make sure this never happens again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here tonight to join my colleagues \nbecause, like them, I am deeply disappointed that 41 Republican \nSenators tonight voted to stop us from even beginning to debate on \nlegislation to rein in the reckless and risky Wall Street conduct that \nbrought this economy to its knees. Rather than make the case out in the \nopen on the floor of the Senate for the changes they want to the Wall \nStreet reform bill, these 41 Senators who voted to block debate are, \ninstead, saying they want changes worked out behind closed doors. They \nare actually saying they will prevent debate and hold this Wall Street \nreform bill hostage until they are accommodated behind closed doors.\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\n  We heard Senator Kaufman say there are amendments he wants to the \nbill. There are amendments I wish to see in the bill. For example, I \nthink we need to strengthen the provisions in the bill to prevent \nfinancial institutions that are supposed to be helping American \ncompanies finance their growth plans--that are supposed to be helping \nfamilies save for their retirement, that are supposed to be helping \nfamilies save for their kids' college education--to prevent those \ninstitutions from making risky side bets for their own profit. But \nrather than block the Senate from taking up the Wall Street reform \nuntil I get what I want, I intend to cosponsor the amendment the \nPresiding Officer and Senator Levin are sponsoring and then debate that \nissue openly on the floor of the Senate.\n  Our amendment prohibits federally insured banks from engaging in \nproprietary trading and it imposes strict capital charges on large \nnonbank financial institutions to limit their proprietary trading.\n  We have all learned in recent days about the proprietary trading that \nGoldman Sachs was doing, betting their own money that mortgage-backed \nsecurities would fail, while getting their clients to invest in those \nsame mortgage-backed securities. I am sure there are a lot of people \nwho think, as I do, that a system that allows that kind of conflict \ndoes not make sense and we need to change it. So I think we need to get \nthis bill on the floor so we can debate this issue and so many others \nthat we need to address to change the practices on Wall Street.\n  We need to enact a strong Wall Street reform bill as soon as \npossible. While we delay, the big banks on Wall Street have returned to \nthe same types of reckless and risky gambles that brought our economy \nto the brink of a complete financial meltdown. My grandmother used to \nsay that while the cat's away, the mice will play. Today I think my \ngrandmother would say while Wall Street reform is delayed, middle-class \nfamilies are being played.\n  Let's be clear. A vote against opening debate on holding Wall Street \naccountable is a vote to protect Wall Street. We are still suffering \nthe consequences of unregulated Wall Street greed. Millions of hard-\nworking Americans lost their jobs through no fault of their own and \nthey still can't find work. Too many small businesses still can't get \ncredit. We need to do everything we can to ensure that the recent \nfinancial crisis never happens again, that taxpayers never again have \nto bail out Wall Street bankers for their bad bets. I hope all those \nSenators who tonight voted to block us from taking up Wall Street \nreform will reconsider that vote and that they will come to the floor \nof the Senate and let us do the work of the people of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, for years at big corporations such as \nGoldman Sachs, Wall Street bankers packaged bad mortgages and sold them \nto investors. They knew these investment vehicles would inevitably fail \nso they turned around and bet against them. They bet against the \nAmerican people. That is what they did when they put these packages \ntogether. They sought to make a profit off the misfortunes of their own \ncustomers.\n  Tonight we stand at the brink of a real debate on this topic, but our \nRepublican colleagues will not even agree to let us move forward. We \nhave to debate whether we are going to debate. Main Street suffered the \nmost challenging economic situation in a generation. It has been made \nclear tonight who the Republicans stand with--they stand with Wall \nStreet--because we are debating to debate.\n  After the breathtaking scope of the economic crisis that America is \nonly now coming to terms with, how can we simply refuse to move \nforward, refuse to debate this critical legislation? We are debating to \ndebate--unbelievable. We have to debate to debate about fair, \nmeaningful reform while Wall Street continues to pose a systemic threat \nto the American financial system.\n  I know a little bit about the financial system. I am probably the \nonly one here who is a banker. I spent my early years in the biggest \nbank of the State of Illinois, selling money for a living. I know about \nbanking and I knew what Glass-Steagall would do at the time. It \nprevented us from getting into the insurance business, the investment \nbanking business, and banks were still able to grow and to make loans \nto the various entities that needed the loans. That is what we were \nthere for, to assist businesses to grow and provide capital and make \nsure they would be successful and repay their loans.\n  As a matter of fact, I financed some of the most difficult businesses \nin the State of Illinois. We had a government-guaranteed loan section \nfor startup businesses. I loaned $1 million to a church-owned hospital, \nthe first Black church-owned hospital in America. I financed that in \n1969 with a $1 million loan. Guess what. The hospital paid every penny \nof that money back to our bank, plus we made interest on it. It wasn't \na giveaway; it was not any type of charity; it was a business \ntransaction to help the community. That is what banks ought to be \ndoing. That is why we need to pass strong financial reform, to prevent \nbad behavior on Wall Street from sinking ordinary folk on Main Street. \nI know a little bit about Main Street because that is where I financed \nthose businesses.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the reform legislation \nintroduced by Senator Dodd, the distinguished Senator who put his life \ninto this business, trying to make sure we have some type of financial \nsecurity for the people and not a bunch of people who are going around \nripping off folk and getting rich off of the work of other people. This \nbill would have prevented Goldman Sachs and other companies from \ngetting into this mess in the first place and it can help ensure that \nwe will never end up in this position again.\n  I hope so, but we don't know what will come up. I heard Senator \nWarner on the floor today. Senator Warner was saying he might not know \nwhat will happen and probably won't. But I hope when we get this \nlegislation to debate--the legislation we are debating to debate--it \nwill never happen again. But first we need to agree to debate the bill \non the floor.\n  I ask my colleagues on the right to simply talk and debate about the \nideas on this bill. I want Glass-Steagall. I am cosponsor of the \namendment for the Glass-Steagall Act to come back. This legislation \nwill create a consumer protection bureau designed to shield ordinary \nAmericans from unfair, deceptive, and abusive business practices. As a \nformer attorney general, I know what it is, in so many of these \nfinancial situations, mistreating our consumers. I defended those \nconsumers tremendously during my years as Attorney General of the State \nof Illinois. I want the bill to establish an oversight task force to \nkeep an eye on emerging risks so we will not be taken by surprise \nagain. It will end too big to fail, protect taxpayers from unnecessary \nrisk, and eliminate the need for future bailouts.\n  This bill would also increase transparency and accountability for \nbanks, hedge funds, and the derivative market. Some people don't even \nknow what they are doing about it, so big companies such as Goldman \nSachs won't be able to get away with fraud anymore. These basic reforms \nwill establish clear rules of the road for the financial service \nindustry so we can keep the market free and fair without risking \nanother economic collapse.\n  But if we fail to take action, if we do not pass this reform \nlegislation, if we even fail to move forward on this simple procedural \nmotion on the debate to debate, then we will be right back where we \nstarted--no safeguards against this kind of deception and abuse in the \nfuture.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting moving on to Senator \nDodd's bill. Let's move on to it and get on with the business of \ndebating the bill and not debating to debate. I ask my friends on both \nsides of the aisle to stand with me on the side of the American people. \nLet's move to debate this financial reform legislation without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we are now, for those who are tuning \nin, in a situation in which the Republicans who filibustered probably \nabout 100 times in this session, are now filibustering not a piece of \nlegislation, they are filibustering the ordinary procedural technical \nmotion on the Senate\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\nfloor to move to that piece of legislation. There will probably be a \nwhole second filibuster when we actually get to the Wall Street reform \nbill. For now, what they are filibustering is moving to proceed under \nthe Senate rules, to take up the bill and begin the debate.\n  In obstructing us from even debating the Wall Street reform bill, the \nRepublican minority has once again shown the American people whose \nbusiness it is they serve. Make no mistake about it, Wall Street \nbankers are chortling tonight about this, Champagne corks are flying \nacross Wall Street, all in celebration of the Republican success in \nonce again obstructing reform. Each day the Republicans delay us, high-\npowered investment banks make more money on highly leveraged gambles. \nEach day the Republicans delay us, mortgage brokers, unregulated by a \nconsumer protection agency, push people into poor quality mortgages \nwith confusing terms. Each day the Republicans delay us, CEOs continue \nto get rainy day bonuses, unchecked by proper corporate governance and \noversight. Each day these Republicans delay us, credit card companies \ntrick and trap American consumers with exorbitant rates and fees and no \nconsequences. Each day the Republican minority delays us, Wall Street \nwins and Main Street loses.\n  The ties between the Republican party and Wall Street CEOs are pretty \nwell documented. News outlets, for instance, reported earlier this \nmonth that the leaders of the Senate minority sat down with two dozen \ntop Wall Street executives to discuss Wall Street's concerns with these \nproposed reforms. Nobody is talking about what was said, what deals \nwere made, what winks and handshakes were exchanged. The meeting was \nbehind closed doors. But the very people who brought about the housing \nbubble and the financial meltdown and profited handsomely through both \nhave been strategizing with the Republicans on how to prevent us from \ncleaning up their industry.\n  They have good reason to do so. By continuing to operate too-big-to-\nfail firms, these executives make millions in the good times and get \ntaxpayer bailouts in the bad times. It is win-win for Wall Street and \nlose-lose for the American people. The American people have about had \nit with that deal. They want Wall Street cleaned up.\n  An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted yesterday found that an \noverwhelming majority, 63 percent, of Americans support ``stricter \nFederal regulations on the way Wall Street firms conduct their \nbusiness.'' Every one of us can vouch for that from what we are hearing \nfrom our constituents at home. The Republican minority can delay reform \nbut they cannot defeat it. Remember Joshua; he walked around the city \nof Jericho blazing his horn. The first time the walls did not come \ndown. The second time the walls did not come down. He had to go seven \ntimes around the city of Jericho before those walls came down, but the \nwalls of obstruction of the Republican minority are going to come down \non this issue because the American people will not have it any other \nway.\n  Let's look at the provisions of the bill as it passed Senator Dodd's \nBanking Committee that they are so upset about, the bill that the \nRepublicans are so upset about, they are obstructing us from even \ndebating it and beginning the process of legislating.\n  The bill would end government bailouts by establishing an industry-\nfinanced wind-down mechanism to put banks that are failing out of their \nmisery. That is how we would deal with future meltdowns--no more \ntaxpayer bailouts, no more AIG.\n  The Republicans, amazingly, assert that this industry-financed \nresolution fund to put an orderly end to banks that have gotten in \ntrouble will actually perpetuate government bailouts. That does not \neven make sense. So why are they saying it? Well, they are saying it \nbecause a Republican pollster named Frank Luntz determined that if you \ncall a bill a bailout bill, the public will be alarmed and confused and \nupset and against it. So they are saying it because the polling shows \nthat is what will concern Americans.\n  We have gotten to the point where it is no longer important in \nAmerican debate for words to be true; it only matters that they have \nthe requisite effect. Well, words that are used for their effect \nwithout regard for whether they are true have a name; it is called \npropaganda. Frankly, it is beneath proper debate in this forum.\n  The bill would also create a strong consumer products regulator to \nmake sure Americans are never again fooled into subprime mortgages and \nother tricky, ``gotcha'' financial products with little hooks and \ntricks and traps in there to catch the unsuspecting consumer. We need a \nregulator in place who can monitor the market and act quickly when \nthere is a consumer hazard. We need this new agency to do for credit \ncards and mortgages what the Consumer Product Safety Commission does \nfor toasters and toys. A tough, independent consumer protection agency \nis a plain-old good idea to give consumers a fair shake.\n  The bill would also consolidate existing bank regulators so that \nbanks cannot shop around for the most lenient regulator. Under the bill \nthe Republicans won't even let us debate, regulations would be \nstrengthened over all financial firms. No more changing your charter \njust to avoid the rules you don't like and picking your favorite \nregulator.\n  Again, these are commonsense protections against Wall Street \ntrickery. But they are being blockaded.\n  Perhaps the provisions that have the CEOs most distressed are the \nones that would crack down on runaway executive compensation. It is \nreally remarkable that even in the worst of times, Wall Street bankers \npay themselves multimillion-dollar bonuses. There really are no lean \nyears, it appears, on Wall Street, just good times and really, really, \nreally good times.\n  The bill the Republicans will not let us debate would give \nshareholders a stronger say on management compensation and would ensure \nthat the compensation committees of boards of directors, the ones who \nare figuring out what the CEOs should be paid, are composed of \ndirectors who are independent, who are not tied to the management: No \nmore having your pals and golfing buddies decide how much you should be \npaid. It would also require companies to develop policies that would \npermit them to rescind compensation--to take it back--if the executive \nis found to have engaged in fraud.\n  Again, these are commonsense provisions to prevent unfairness and to \ngive the American people a chance. Yet the Republicans will not even \nlet us debate them.\n  The American people have grown sick and tired of delay and \nobstruction, and they want their Congress to move forward with the \npeople's business. This is something on which we should agree. The \nAmerican people also overwhelmingly favor stronger regulation over Wall \nStreet banks. So let's get to it.\n  I implore my Republican colleagues to cut the delay tactics and let \nus debate a bill that will help prevent future financial crises. If \nthey have a better idea and they want to offer it on the Senate floor, \nthat is what we are here for. But let's get to the bill. Let's begin \nthe process of serving the American people. Let's end the endless \nfilibuster and obstruction and delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ncritically important legislation before the Senate, the bill to reform \nWall Street and end the excesses that sent our economy into a tailspin.\n  Having made the tough choice to fend off a collapse of our economic \nsystem, we must now look back and decide what actions are required to \nhold Wall Street accountable and put consumers back in control of their \nfinances.\n  This Congress has taken decisive action to stem the bleeding, actions \nthat were not always comfortable, but were necessary. And our economy \nis starting to heal. Yet we remain at a seminal moment in history.\n  One tenth of our population remains unemployed, the threat of home \nforeclosure haunts far too many families, and American seniors are \nscrambling to replenish what were once considered their retirement \naccounts.\n  The fault for this economic decline, however, does not lie at the \nfeet of the working class nor reflect the steady strength of American \ningenuity. Instead, the Wall Street bailout, and the threat of global \neconomic depression\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\nthat necessitated it, was thrust upon us by those who put short-term \nself-interest above the economic security of a nation.\n  It is an unpleasant fact to admit. But the current financial system \nall too often rewards greed and recklessness, fans speculative trading, \nand has fostered shady dealings that are so complicated that only those \nWall Street firms that stand to benefit can comprehend them.\n  Compounding this, consumers have found themselves on the losing end \nof these deals. Wall Street executives have taken excessive risks, \nknowing a sweetheart contract, bonus or stock option will cover their \nlosses while stockholders are left empty handed. Nearly one quarter of \nAmericans have found themselves with home mortgages they struggle to \nafford, while the lender's commission has long been spent.\n  And, American consumers have to jump through hoop after hoop and \nultimately pay to have access to their own credit score, while banks \nand lenders can easily obtain this information to hike their annual \ninterest rate or monthly payment.\n  Don't get me wrong, I am the first to recognize that our financial \nsector historically has played a driving role in the growth of our \neconomy. In many instances, Wall Street's ingenuity has spurred solid \ninvestment and helped U.S. businesses compete world-wide.\n  But we cannot ignore the plain fact that transparent investing and \nfair business dealings seem to be the exception, rather than the rule.\n  In one recent example, the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission \nalleged that Goldman Sachs realized that the only way out of bad \nsecurities was to sell them to unwitting investors.\n  This investigation is rapidly expanding to other financial firms and \nproducts, and is symptomatic of how out of touch Wall Street has become \nwith the American workers who are the real engine of our economy.\n  As the 2008 collapse washed away nearly half of Americans' savings \nand investments, these same taxpayers were on the hook to finance Wall \nStreet's rescue. I understand the anger of Coloradans and Americans all \naround the country, many who felt that the big banks should have been \nleft to fail.\n  So our constituents have asked us: Please reform the current laws so \nthat this does not happen again. Please hold Wall Street to the same \nrules that hardworking families and small businesses are held to.\n  But now, as the economy recovers, slowly adding jobs and allowing \nfamilies to rebuild their savings and retirement portfolios, Wall \nStreet is reporting record profits and its executives are again \npocketing record bonuses.\n  It is time to put American consumers back in control of their \nfinancial future. We must hold Wall Street accountable and create a \nfinancial system that works for all Americans, not just rich \nexecutives.\n  The legislation that we are trying to bring up for debate this week \ndoes just that. With Senator Dodd's leadership, the Wall Street \nAccountability Act will:\n  Safely regulate the shadow markets and the hidden side-bet financing \nthat escaped the regulatory radar and allowed financial firms to engage \nin the risky and irresponsible behavior that wiped out trillions in \nfamily savings.\n  The bill will hold big banks and financial institutions accountable \nfor the bad decisions they make, and make them plan ahead to deal with \ntheir losses to ensure that taxpayers are never again responsible for \nbailing out a financial firm that is deemed too big to fail, like AIG.\n  The bill will also hold Wall Street accountable by giving consumer \nshareholders new power to prevent excessive bonuses that reward \nexecutive failures, while average Americans are left holding the bag.\n  Complementing the credit card bill I introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives several years ago and legislation Congress passed last \nyear, this bill forces big banks and credit card companies to provide \nclear, understandable information to consumers. This bill will also \nhold the nonbank lending industry to the same sort of standards as the \ntraditional banking industry.\n  Finally, this bill will start to change the culture of Wall Street by \ninstilling new transparency and accountability rules to ensure that \ncomplicated financial derivative transactions take place in an open \nmarketplace.\n  This legislation provides what our friends, neighbors, and family \nmembers for years have been demanding, a system that is designed for \nthem, rewards hard work, and is grounded in the kind of business \nintegrity that Americans every day certify with a handshake. In short, \nAmericans back in control of their financial well-being.\n  That is why, in addition to the reforms we will be discussing this \nweek, I introduced legislation last week with bipartisan support to put \neveryday Americans back in charge of their finances by giving consumers \nfree access to their credit score.\n  I thank Senators Lugar, Menendez, Lieberman, Levin, Hagan, Shaheen, \nKlobuchar, Tom Udall, and Scott Brown for joining me in putting \nconsumers first by cosponsoring this commonsense legislation, which has \nthe support of a wide range of consumer groups.\n  Today, in looking back on the mistakes of the past and the imbalances \nthat still disadvantage consumers, Americans deserve a Congress on \ntheir side.\n  Yet some here appear to still support a risky system where Wall \nStreet can act with impunity and get bailed out when things go bad. \nThey want to protect speculators at the expense of consumer protections \nand shield financial institutions from rules that would avert taxpayer-\nfinanced bailouts.\n  I am here to say that those days are over. We must hold Wall Street \naccountable and we cannot let the status quo persist.\n  A few blocks from here outside the Federal Trade Commission stands a \npair of statues, each depicting a heroic figure straining to control a \npowerful horse. They were erected under the Roosevelt administration as \nan emblem to Americans from all walks of life that fair business \npractices would serve to further the common good of all. Well, I have \nnews: Under our current system, the reins have been released when it \ncomes to Wall Street. And now some 70 years later here we are, at a \nsimilar point in history. We must stand together once again as a nation \ncommitted to sound investing, transparent business dealings and an \neconomic system that puts consumers first.\n  This debate is about choices, and the American people have a clear \nchoice. There are a lot of us here who want to get to work.\n  But the vote we just took tonight also showed that some in this \ninstitution are willing to filibuster and delay to prevent the Senate \nfrom even debating Wall Street reforms.\n  It is clear to me and clear to Coloradans that a vote against even \nhaving this debate is a vote to protect Wall Street at the expense of \nhard-working Americans. Too much is at stake to let this delay persist.\n  President Roosevelt said in 1932, ``Never in history have the \ninterests of all the people been so united in a single economic \nproblem.'' Once again, as we did 70 years ago let us get to together \nput in place protections against the Wall Street excesses that threaten \nour economic stability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, tonight we had a vote in which 57 Members \nof this body said we should proceed to have a fully public debate and \nvotes on issues related to Wall Street and Main Street; 57, far more \nthan a majority, said it is time for us to come to this floor, now well \nmore than a year after our bubbled economy burst, and wrestle with the \nright rules of the road and lane markers for our financial system. But, \nunfortunately, 57 votes are not enough. We need additional votes from \nour colleagues across the aisle in order to have that debate on this \nfloor. We need additional votes from our colleagues across the aisle to \nconsider what the lane markers should be and what the traffic signals \nshould be in our financial regulatory system.\n  Tonight we did not get those votes. Instead, tonight my colleagues \nacross the aisle said they do not want a debate in public on how to \nreform Wall Street. They want a conversation behind closed doors \ninstead. Quite frankly, I don't think the American people agree with \nthem.\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\n  There are many parts of this story, but it is a story that can be \ntold in millions, billions, and trillions. The millions are the size of \nthe Wall Street bonuses. A single bonus can equal what a working family \ncan expect to earn in an entire career. Then we have the billions, the \nbillions of dollars of quarterly profits of many Wall Street firms. \nThen we have the trillions. That is the trillions of dollars of damages \nto working families in America.\n  What happened when the bubble burst more than a year ago? We had a \ntremendous loss in the value of retirement savings. We had a tremendous \nloss in the family savings for children to go to college. We had an \nenormous drop in employment. We had a tremendous drop in families \ncovered by health care because of the loss of employment. We had damage \non every part of a family's finances, including the value of their \nhome, so that millions of American families today owe more on their \nhome than their home is worth.\n  Quite frankly, I don't believe a system of million-dollar bonuses and \nbillion-dollar profits and trillions of dollars of damage to American \nworking families is a system we need in America. Tonight's vote was \nabout whether to have a public debate on the rules of the road for Wall \nStreet, but it was also about whose side are we on. Are we on the side \nof some Wall Street firms which don't believe that any additional rules \nof the road are necessary?\n  They are happy with the status quo. Bonuses have rebounded on Wall \nStreet. Profits have rebounded on Wall Street. But if you are not \npaying attention, let me clue you in. The American working family has \nnot rebounded. Ten percent of American working families are unemployed. \nHouses are still underwater, savings still decimated.\n  It is very important we have this debate on the floor of the Senate, \nthat we ask ourselves about and we adopt the right rules of the road, \nthe right traffic signals, the right lane markers to create a solid \nfinancial foundation for our economy to thrive.\n  That is what happened after the Great Depression. New rules were \nadopted that restored the integrity of the American financial system, \nthat restored the integrity of the stock market. Why was that \nimportant? It meant that people throughout America and around the world \nsaid: We can trust to invest in the United States because their system \nhas integrity, it has transparency. That solid foundation has served \nour Nation well for decades until deregulation dismantled it, allowed \nwild speculation. Wild speculation and wild risk led to a spectacular \ncollapse of the economy, and working families are still paying the \nprice.\n  So what is the way to be on the side of working families? It is to \nsay: We will adopt those rules to provide that new foundation, that new \nmuscular set of rules that will allow Wall Street to prosper but will \nalso set the foundation for the American economy to prosper.\n  How should we measure the success of that economy? This economy \nshould not be measured by the size of the bonuses on Wall Street. The \nsuccess of our economy should not be measured by the billion-dollar \nquarterly profits of Wall Street firms. The success of this economy \nneeds to be measured by how well we build the financial foundations for \nworking families throughout the Nation.\n  Do we create the ability to have the next generation do better than \nwe did? Do we create living-wage jobs that enable a family to have \nsignificant opportunities for their children? Do we proceed to \nstrengthen, as we have been working at in this Chamber, the structure \nof health care? Do families in America have a share in the increased \nproductivity of our Nation which has not been the case since 1974, the \nyear I came out of high school? Yes, our Nation had a huge surge in \nproductivity, a huge surge in national wealth. But that has not been \nshared with working families. That is a diversion from what happened in \nthe earlier era.\n  How do we rebuild our economy so it builds working families? That is \nwhat we are about. We can proceed to look at the pieces of this bill. \nSenator Dodd, who is here tonight, the chair of our Banking Committee, \nhas put so many strong steps forward on the work that came out of his \ncommittee. A lot of folks don't realize the humble family mortgage and \na new product that came out in 2003 is right at the center of the \nfiasco in our economy.\n  What happened? A new mortgage called a subprime came out. It was \ndesigned differently than subprimes in the past. It was designed with a \n2-year teaser rate--that is a low interest rate--then with a prepayment \npenalty that prevented families, once the ink had dried on the \nmortgage, from ever escaping that mortgage without giving many pounds \nof flesh, and then an exploding interest rate that soared from perhaps \n4.5 percent or 5 percent to 9 percent or maybe even 11 percent, \ninterest rates that could never be sustained.\n  This diabolical device was worth a lot of money on Wall Street \nbecause it was going to make a lot of money pulling those exploding \ninterest rates out of American families. So Wall Street paid bonuses \nback to brokers to say to them: I am your financial adviser. I \nrecommend this subprime loan, instead of recommending a loan that was \nbest for the family. So a vicious circle resulted in exploding subprime \nmortgages.\n  This bill that has come out of the Banking Committee says: No longer. \nPrepayment penalties will not be allowed on subprime mortgages. We will \nbreak the cycle that led us into this economic fiasco, this financial \nfiasco.\n  If my colleagues across the aisle have some ways to improve on that, \nthen let's have a public debate. Let's have that amendment on the \nSenate floor. If my colleagues across the aisle think they don't want \nto protect a fair deal for consumers and they want to continue a \ndiabolical subprime exploding interest rate trap that has destroyed \nmillions of families, then go ahead and propose that amendment. I doubt \nthe majority of people will support it. I certainly will oppose it \nvigorously. But if my colleagues want to do that, then have the debate \non the Senate floor.\n  This bill is designed to end the taxpayer from ever being on the hook \nfor bailing out financial firms again. It does it by assessing \nfinancial firms for the cost of unwinding or, to put it a little bit \nmore directly, dismantling a financial firm when it fails. To make sure \nthe taxpayer isn't on the hook, it creates a fee on the financial \nindustry to pay to make sure those costs are covered by the financial \nindustry itself. This is a buffer that protects the American taxpayer.\n  My colleagues across the aisle have said: No, here is a fund. It \nlooks like a bailout fund.\n  Quite frankly, it is amazing what we hear on this floor. Here is a \nfund designed to ensure that taxpayers are protected, to ensure the \nfinancial industry pays their own cost of dismantling their firms. Yet \nit is spun 180 degrees until north is south and south is north, trying \nto confuse the American public.\n  I don't think the American public is going to be all that confused \nabout this. They want to see the financial industry pay for the cost of \ndismantling their own failures. They don't want to be on the hook \nagain. You can try to keep pulling the wool over the eyes of the \nAmerican people, but it will not work. I say to my colleagues across \nthe aisle, if you want to pull the wool over the eyes of the American \npeople, come here and propose that amendment that puts the taxpayers \nback on the hook, when we are taking them off the hook. See how it \nfares. Make your case, make your fair debate on this floor. But come \nand face and present and debate and vote so that we can proceed to put \nthe rules of the road back in place for Wall Street.\n  This bill takes a huge stride forward on proprietary trading. It says \nwe should not put fireworks in our living rooms. That is pretty \nstraightforward. Fireworks are wonderful. I love fireworks on the \nFourth of July. This bill says they should not be stored in the living \nroom. I have an amendment that I think will further strengthen that \nconcept.\n  I applaud my colleague, Carl Levin from Michigan, my cosponsor, who \nhas brought forward a part of that amendment and emphasized it, saying \nwe need to address the conflict of interest in financial firms. What is \nthat conflict of interest? You should not be in the position of \ndesigning and selling securities, telling your customers that they are \nthe best thing since sliced bread over here, when at the same time you \nare betting against those securities because you think they are going \nto fail.\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nThat is a conflict of interest. It should not be allowed.\n  Under the Merkley-Levin amendment, we will address that as well as \nstrengthen proprietary trading.\n  I am comfortable bringing that to the floor of the Senate and having \nthat debate. It may have a majority; it may not. But that is the type \nof debate we need to have on this floor.\n  I could go on through the treatment of derivatives--and I applaud my \ncolleague, Blanche Lincoln--the discussion of a consumer financial \nprotection agency that provides the same fairness in financial \ncontracts that the Consumer Product Safety Commission provides on \ntoasters, making sure that tricks and traps and scams are taken out of \nfinancial products so that a consumer can make a fair choice without \nbeing misled by something hidden in the fine print. That is the type of \noption citizens in this country want.\n  Wall Street plays a very important role in aggregating and allocating \ncapital, but we need to make sure the rules are done such that that \nrole is done well, that conflicts of interest are removed, that \ntransparency is provided, that tricks and traps and scams are taken out \nof financial products. These are the sorts of things this bill does.\n  This is a bill that is all about fighting for fairness for Main \nStreet which, in the long term, will be a very good business model for \nWall Street as well.\n  Let's, as a Chamber, recognize our responsibility to build an \neconomic system that strengthens the financial foundation of our \nfamilies--that is what this bill is all about--and puts our country on \na firm basis for decades to come. International investors will want to \ninvest back here in America. They will trust the integrity of our \nsystem.\n  I encourage my colleagues to come together when we have the next \ncloture vote and decide it is time to fight for the people of this \ncountry and fight for the economic future of our country by proceeding \nto the debate on this bill and the passage of this bill and getting it \nto the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about how we \ncan take a big step toward holding Wall Street accountable and stopping \nit from lining its own pockets at the expense of America's families.\n  Last month, as part of the health care reconciliation bill, the \nSenate also passed student loan reform that ended a longtime corporate \nwelfare program. Our reforms halted the enormous subsidies the Federal \nGovernment paid to lenders in the student loan market, replacing it \nwith a program called Direct Lending that slashes $61 billion--$61 \nbillion--in cost to the taxpayers by cutting out the middleman and \nlending to students directly. The money saved will go toward Pell \ngrants, helping kids from working families go to college.\n  Today, as we debate Wall Street reform, we continue that fight to end \nthe stranglehold big banks have on our economy and, by extension, on \nthe everyday life of the American people.\n  Over the past year and a half, we have seen, in stark reality, the \ndevastating impact Wall Street can have on our economy when it is left \nto its own devices. Fueled by unbridled greed, a love of risk--well, \nthe love of risking other people's money--and an obsession with profit \nat all costs, banks bought up toxic mortgages by the thousands, driving \nthe subprime lending market in the process. Credit rating agencies, \nconveniently funded by the same institutions they were rating--that is \na bad idea--gave the resulting securities their highest AAA rating, and \nthe initial ingredients of the financial crisis were born. \nIncidentally, today Paul Krugman wrote in the New York Times that 93 \npercent of these AAA-rated subprime mortgage-backed securities have \nsince been downgraded to junk status--93 percent. That is hard to do on \nanything.\n  Several bank failures and a $700 billion-plus bailout later, the \nAmerican people were left paying the price. By October of 2009, \nunemployment had jumped to 10.1 percent and even today it remains at \n9.7 percent. By contrast, just 10 years ago, in October of 2000, the \nunemployment rate was 3.9 percent. Americans have lost $11.7 trillion--\n$11.7 trillion--in personal wealth since the financial crisis, and \nhousing values have fallen 15 percent in just the past year. We have \nseen our retirement accounts shrink and our plans for the future \ndelayed, sometimes indefinitely--and all because of Wall Street's \nincessant need to rack up enormous profits.\n  Over the past few decades, Wall Street's profits have gone through \nthe roof. In 1987, the financial industry represented only 19 percent \nof all domestic corporate profits. By 2009, that number was almost 32 \npercent. Thirty-two percent of all the Nation's corporate profits went \nto the financial industry.\n  The dramatic growth of the financial services industry would be fine \nif Wall Street was actually adding value--helping to invest in our \neconomy in constructive ways and to create jobs. But, instead, they \nhave been making bets on bets on bets on bets. It is one thing to have \na commodities futures market that provides the resources for farmers to \nput crops in the ground, but it is another thing altogether when Wall \nStreet is just gambling in areas where they have no real productive \ninterest. Let's put Wall Street back to work investing in America, not \ngambling with its future.\n  The bill we are discussing tonight would ensure that Wall Street can \nnever again bilk the American people in the same way. It would create a \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau--a true cornerstone of this bill. \nThe bureau would be an independent watchdog for consumers housed inside \nthe Federal Reserve. The bureau would force big banks and credit card \ncompanies to offer clear terms to families on credit cards, student \nloans, on retirement financial products. Just as importantly, it would \nmake sure mortgage companies cannot sell misleading loans and mortgages \nto consumers so we avoid the kinds of problems that led to this crisis \nin the first place.\n  For the first time, the bill would set up a council of regulators \nthat would oversee the financial system as a whole. This council would \nmonitor risk across the entire system and ensure that industries and \ncompanies do not fall through the cracks between regulatory agencies. \nThis bill also includes a tough section on derivatives to ensure \ngreater transparency and tighten their regulation.\n  It ends taxpayer bailouts by forcing banks to pony up $50 billion to \npay for their own funeral if they fail. This is not a taxpayer-funded \nbailout, and let me tell you why. First, it is not a bailout. The bank \nwould get liquidated. Secondly, it is not taxpayer funded because \ntaxpayers do not fund it. The banks do. I do not know how to make this \nany clearer to my colleagues across the aisle. Yet tonight we find \nourselves where we are.\n  Let me be clear: We cannot afford not to pass this bill. Americans \nare demanding we act to hold Wall Street accountable. Without further \nprotections, it would be easy to have another crisis such as the one we \nhave just been through. Yet tonight, despite the urgency and the \nimportance of this bill, my colleagues across the aisle are \nfilibustering our attempt to reform Wall Street and not just the bill \nitself. They have blocked us from even starting debate on the bill by \nfilibustering the motion to proceed. They have done this despite the \nfact that many of them actually agree with substantial portions of the \nbill. They are doing this because they want to stop government from \nactually being able to accomplish anything.\n  I have said it before, and I will say it again. This is a perversion \nof the filibuster and a perversion of the Senate. Let's turn our \nattention back to legislating, which is the reason voters put us in \nthis august body in the first place.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Wall Street reform bill. We often \ntalk on the Senate floor about wanting to make sure American families \nare protected. Now we have a chance to actually do something about it. \nAmerica cannot afford another financial crisis. That is now in our \nhands in this body, and it is one of our greatest responsibilities.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I have a favorite President and it is \nnot President Obama. It is, in fact, President Harry Truman. I still \ncannot quite get over the fact that I am sitting at Harry Truman's desk \non the\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\nSenate floor and that I hold the seat in the Senate that Harry Truman \nheld.\n  Tomorrow, when I attend the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \nand as we see a parade of Wall Street executives justifying their \nbehavior, I will be asking questions at the committee that Harry Truman \nmade famous when he took war profiteers to task many years ago.\n  Harry Truman said:\n\n       If you can't convince them, confuse them.\n\n  Well, I am confused. I read today that the ranking member, from the \nRepublican Party, of the Banking Committee said the following at a \nmeeting of community bankers. I am quoting exactly what he said:\n\n       I think we basically know what went wrong. We had a lot of \n     hearings. We've been working on it 15, 16 months now.\n\n  That is not Chairman Dodd who said: ``I think we basically know what \nwent wrong.'' It is not Chairman Dodd saying: ``We had a lot of \nhearings.'' It is not Chairman Dodd saying: We've been working on it \nfor 15 or 16 months. It is the Republican ranking member on the Banking \nCommittee.\n  I am confused. Is it that they do not realize it is a huge problem?\n  Well, of course they realize it is a huge problem.\n  Is it that they are not prepared, that they do not have enough \ninformation? Well, of course not. Senator Shelby said today: We \nbasically know what went wrong. We have had a lot of hearings. We have \nbeen working on it for 15 or 16 months.\n  Senator Dodd has sat here this evening as many Members of my class \nand the freshmen class have come to the floor to express regret and \nconfusion about why we cannot debate this bill. It is admirable he has \nsat and listened to all these speeches tonight. He did not have to. He \ncould have gone home. He is invested in this legislation for all the \nright reasons: Because he cares deeply about this country. He \nunderstands we have an obligation as Senators to address this problem. \nHe sees it as his duty to see this through.\n  So why--why--did this happen today? Why did we not move forward to \ndebate? It is just politics, raw, bare-knuckled politics--the kind of \nstuff Americans are so sick of they want to throw up. They are so sick \nof this game playing, they want to throw everybody out of this place. \nFrankly, right about now, I do not blame them. What in the Lord's Name \nare we doing delaying the debate on this bill?\n  I do believe the leader of the Republican Party thinks his success as \na leader can only be defined by my party's failure. It is like it is a \nfootball game. I was confused when 41 people signed the letter saying \nthey did not want to go forward. All 41 Republicans signed this letter.\n  Then I got confused because Senator McConnell came to the floor and \nsaid black is white. He literally said that. He said: We cannot be for \nthis bill because we want to stop bailouts. Well, of course this bill \nis about stopping bailouts. That is why we are doing the bill, to make \nsure we do not have any more taxpayer bailouts. He knows that. But he \nhonestly, I don't think, believed the American people were paying close \nenough attention. Then we had the announcement that the SEC had come \nout of a coma and was going to do something about Goldman Sachs and \nwhat had happened. Then, as Senator Dodd said so well on the floor the \nother day, it is like the rooster taking credit for the morning. They \nsaid, Well, we wrote that letter and now we are back at the negotiating \ntable. What hogwash. What hogwash. The negotiating table has always \nbeen open. The door has always been open. Senator Dodd has been out \nworking the floor of this building and every building within a mile \ntrying to find Republicans to sit down and negotiate and find what is \nthe problem we need to solve to make sure we never have this kind of \nfinancial meltdown again in America.\n\n  Here is another thing that is very confusing. It is time for the \nmarkup in the Banking Committee. I believe the number is over 400 \namendments were filed by the Republicans for the markup. The Friday \nbefore the markup, all of these amendments were on file. Many people \nworked all weekend long getting ready for the markup on Monday, for the \nmarkup of this bill. The chairman of the committee, assumed--as anybody \nwould who has spent as many hours working in this august body as he \nhas--that on Monday Republicans were going to offer amendments. In \nfact, the Democrats worked all the way through the weekend trying to \nfigure out how many amendments filed by the Republicans they could \neasily accept without any debate or contention.\n  So what happens when the committee starts? The ranking member on the \nRepublican side says they don't want to offer any amendments. What? Now \nI am really confused. They don't even want to try to change the bill in \ncommittee. They make no effort to offer any substantive changes, and \nthen they all vote no.\n  If the American people don't realize that a game is being played \nhere, they need to pause for a minute and think about that. Why on \nEarth would the members of the Banking Committee from the Republican \nParty fail to offer one amendment to this legislation, unless there was \nsome kind of plan, political plan: Don't participate. Don't vote for \nit. Stop it. Obstructionism, saying the Democrats are doing something \nthey are not trying to do: taxpayer bailout.\n  It would be so easy to stand here and say there are ulterior motives \nabout helping big bankers or helping Wall Street and campaign finance \nissues. I don't know. I just know I am confused. I am confused as to \nwhy the Republicans would march lockstep away from the debate on an \nissue that is of paramount importance to this country. I am confused \nwhy the Republicans would fail to offer one amendment at the committee \nlevel. I am confused why debating this bill is a problem for them \npolitically. I am confused.\n  Ronald Reagan is cited for this quote often, but it wasn't Ronald \nReagan who first said it, it was Harry Truman: It is amazing what you \ncan accomplish if you don't care who gets the credit. Man, oh, man, do \nsome people need that advice in this body. We need to quit worrying \nabout whether the Democrats are getting credit or the Republicans are \ngetting credit and realize all the American people want us to do is get \nto work. Get this thing done. Quit fooling around with this game that \nis being played. Tomorrow I think the leader may have a motion to \nreconsider. I would implore my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle: Reconsider what you are doing. Many of my colleagues are such \nfine, upstanding people who also care deeply about their country. They \nare just wrapped up. They have been convinced this is some political \nTic-Tac-Toe match and if they hold on for a couple more turns they are \ngoing to be able to draw the line through the series of squares.\n  This is about whether we fix a serious problem. I am a big fan of how \nhard Senator Dodd has worked. I think he is trying with every bit of \nintellect and passion he has to get this across the finish line, \nbecause he knows we need to do it for the American people. The games \nneed to stop. The American people need to pay attention and realize \nthey have a very good reason to be confused. Let's debate this bill. \nLet's debate it beginning tomorrow. Let's debate our differences. Let's \ntry to amend it. Let's vote on amendments. Let's agree to disagree on \nsome of it and decide who has the most votes to move forward a piece of \nlegislation, the way our Founding Fathers intended. I guarantee they \ndidn't intend this. They did not intend this, a refusal to even debate.\n  So let the debate begin. If the Republican Party wants to lockstep \nand say we don't even get to debate it, then the American people are \ngoing to have to draw their own conclusions, and I have a feeling it \nwon't be a good one.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me first begin by saying if Harry Truman \nwere here tonight, he would be very proud of his successor sitting in \nthat chair in the back of this Chamber. I wish to thank my colleague \nfrom Missouri for her passion, her eloquence, and her common sense, \nsomething that Harry Truman was noted for. My father actually seconded \nthe nomination of Harry Truman at the convention in Philadelphia in \n1948, and I cherish the letter thanking my father for that nomination \nnow hanging on the wall of my home--a wonderful personal letter \nthanking him for that seconded nomination. He didn't have many people \nin\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\n1948. My father had not been elected at that time. He couldn't find \nelected officials to stand up for him in 1948. My father had a great \nrelationship with President Truman and was always proud of it. He had a \nwonderful, direct--some would call it blunt--relationship with him. \nFrankly, at moments such as this, I think that is what is needed, \nbecause as the Senator from Missouri articulated, this is not a \ncomplicated moment.\n  Maybe there are those who don't appreciate how an institution such as \nthis is supposed to operate. It isn't always a pretty process when we \nengage in debate, with 100 people in this Chamber of different \npolitical persuasions, ideologies, and interests. We try to come \ntogether as a committee system chosen years ago in order to try and be \nefficient about our work, so we split up into various groups to \nconsider various matters under certain headings. We sit as Democrats \nand Republicans, Independents, and try and work our way through a \nhearing process, listening to experts, gathering informally, talking \nwith one another, reading and educating ourselves, whether it is \nagriculture or defense or the environment or energy or, in this case, \nbanking, over a period of weeks and months--particularly after a moment \nin time in our history that nearly brought us to the brink of financial \ncollapse--and then through our collective judgments try and frame to \nthe best of our ability our answers to nagging questions: Why did we \nget into this mess? What was missing? What did we do wrong? What can we \ndo right? How can we make this better so we don't go through this \nagain, so we don't strangle the system, so we won't lack the creativity \nand imagination that have been the hallmark of our financial sector and \nnot lose our financial leadership in the world as a nation? How can we \nharmonize those rules in a global economy today so we don't end up \nracing to the bottom the various nations who offer the least resistance \nto some of the practices that brought us to the brink in our own \ncountry?\n  That is basically what we have engaged in for the last 38 or 39 \nmonths since I have been chairman of this committee beginning in \nJanuary of 2007. We didn't agree on everything, but we tried to fashion \nthe best we could. I introduced a proposal back in November. My \ncolleagues said that is a good beginning, but we ought to try some \ndifferent ideas, so between November and this April, I divided up the \ncommittee labors. I asked Democrats and Republicans to take on subject \nmatters because it was a highly complex area of the law dealing with \nderivatives, dealing with systemic risk, dealing with corporate \ngovernance, dealing with consumer protection and other matters; \nthinking that if we broke it up into groups, Democrats and Republicans \nwould become invested and knowledgeable about the subject matter so we \ncould then frame a proposal that would enjoy the kind of bipartisan \nsupport needed to advance the cause.\n\n  Well, I wish to compliment my colleagues. Many of them worked very \nhard. While we didn't achieve a complete understanding in all of these \nmatters, I think the bill reflects a lot of that labor, to such a \ndegree that the proposal we tried to move to today is so fundamentally \ndifferent than the bill I introduced in November as a result of that \nlabor.\n  I thank my colleague from Missouri for identifying what occurred a \nfew weeks ago, and that is, of course, the committee markup. Again, my \ncolleagues on the committee made a judgment. They thought that maybe it \nmight be better--there were an awful lot of conflicting amendments, \nsome of which didn't make a lot of sense, quite candidly, from the \nother side, and I say that respectfully. It was their determination \nthat they would decide to go further in the process without engaging in \nthe amendment process.\n  So here we are. We need to get to this. I have listened very \npatiently this evening to some wonderful remarks. I wish to begin with \nMark Warner, who spoke earlier this afternoon on the bill and has made \na remarkable contribution to this body and to the Banking Committee. He \nspent about 20 years in the financial services area, so he speaks from \na base of knowledge and personal experience. Bob Menendez of New Jersey \nas well was eloquent in his comments. Senator Klobuchar, and Senator \nKaufman, who spoke on this before; Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire as \nwell, and Senator Burris of Illinois, and the Presiding Officer, \nSheldon Whitehouse, a good friend who has been invaluable in these \ndebates. We worked together on the health care matter for weeks and \nmonths over the last year and, again, his thoughts and ideas on this \nbill as well I am thankful for; Mark Udall of Colorado, Senator Merkley \nof Oregon, Al Franken and, of course, Senator McCaskill, who I spoke \nabout as well. It is quite a group here, these new Members, their first \nor second terms in the Senate. I hope my other colleagues and their \nstaffs were listening this evening. It wasn't just eloquence, it was \ncommon sense. They are people who have gone home and listened to their \nconstituents. While we all may not agree--and I can't suggest that \nevery amendment they have talked about is one I would necessarily even \nbe supportive of when the debate begins--I firmly believe every Senator \nhas equal status in this Chamber. Whether you are a chairman or a new \nMember, you are a Senator, and you deserve the courtesies of this \ninstitution. You deserve the history of this institution. You deserve \nto be heard and respected for your ideas and to be given the time to \npresent them, to debate them, and to have an up-or-down vote on your \nproposals.\n  That is how this institution is supposed to operate. I have been here \nfor three decades, and in all of my three decades here, I have never \ngone through a period such as we have over the last couple of months \nwhere we can't even get to debate some of these critical matters.\n  I am still optimistic. I guess that explains why I have been here for \n30 years. I still want to believe this is going to work, that all we \nhave been through is not for naught. As does my colleague from \nMissouri, I have great respect for my colleagues in this Chamber, \nDemocrats and Republicans, and I have over the years, even with people \nI have had basic and fundamental disagreements with. I am convinced the \nmajority of us here--an overwhelming majority--want to be associated \nwith passing legislation that we believe will make a significant \ndifference in the economic life of our Nation by at least limiting or \nprohibiting the kind of activities that led us to the problems and \neconomic difficulties we are in.\n  I hope in the coming days we will have a chance to move to this bill. \nI hope sooner rather than later. It may be a matter not well known by \nmany, but we only have by my count about 45 or 50 legislative days left \nin this session. We are working about 3\\1/2\\ days a week. We are here \nfor about another 14 or 15 weeks, when you exclude the August break, \nthe break for Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and, of course, our \ndeparture sometime I presume in early October for the elections. That \ndoes not give us a lot of time. Last week we spent the entire week on \nfive nominations that, as I recall--and I may be corrected--passed I \nbelieve overwhelmingly when the votes finally occurred. So 5 days on 5 \npeople who were filibustered and delayed. That is all we did last week. \nThat was it: five nominations that were ultimately agreed to--not \ncontroversial nominations, just ones where votes were designed to slow \nthe process. I don't think the American people want us to leave our \nwork in this Congress without having addressed this issue.\n  I will end on this particular note. If, for some reason, Lord forbid, \na major financial institution were to begin to fail this evening, we \nare in no better shape than we were in the fall of 2008. There is an \nimplicit guarantee that such an institution would receive the backing \nof the them and our economy. Despite what I perceive to be overwhelming \nobjections to that kind of a bailout occurring, that is one issue on \nwhich there seems to be unanimity. Yet, if tonight a problem began to \nemerge, we would be in a similar situation as we were 18 months ago. I \ndon't know of a single Member here who would want that to occur. That \nissue alone ought to cause every one of us to move to get to this \ndebate. That is a principal part of this legislation. There are other \nfeatures as well, but that alone ought to be motivation to begin this \ndebate, listen to each other's thoughts and ideas, and to conclude that \ndiscussion and debate by passing\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\nthis legislation--or at least an amended version of this legislation.\n\n  I thank these 12 or 13 colleagues for their patience, their \neloquence, their determination, and their conviction. As I get ready to \nleave this Chamber in the coming months, I will leave with a high \ndegree of confidence that this Chamber will be in good hands. After \nlistening tonight to your words, advice, counsel, and determination, it \nis with a sense of optimism that we will get this bill done. I am \nconfident of that as I stand before you this evening.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2637-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I rise to thank Special Agent James \nHarold Sizemore for his many years of service to the people of \nKentucky. For nearly three decades, he has worked in the dangerous \nfield of law enforcement, risking his own well-being on behalf of his \nneighbors, and for that an entire State is grateful.\n  Harold was born and raised in Clay County, where his father was the \nsheriff. Harold followed in his father's footsteps and was elected \nsheriff of Clay County in 1982. He took a hard stand against illegal \nmarijuana cultivation, a problem in that area, and conducted several \nsuccessful eradication missions.\n  I first met Harold in 1989 when he was still serving as sheriff, and \nhe described to me the devastating effect marijuana cultivation was \nhaving in Clay County. After that and right up to today I have given my \nfull support to the Governor's Marijuana Strike Force, which \ncoordinates local, State, and Federal law enforcement to combat the \ndrug problem in Kentucky. This task force has been recognized by the \nPresident's Office of National Drug Control Policy for 5 consecutive \nyears.\n  In 1990, Harold became a Federal law-enforcement officer with the \nU.S. Forest Service, a job he held for 20 years. In that capacity, he \nhas conducted over 700 flight hours of surveillance and detection for \nmarijuana eradication missions in Kentucky in support of State, local, \nand Federal task forces. His dedication and tireless efforts resulted \nin the eradication of over 100,000 marijuana plants, with a street \nvalue estimated at $600 million, many in small plots located in remote \nterrain to avoid detection.\n  In addition to these flight hours, Harold also participated in \nseveral missions in support of high-risk felony search and arrest \nwarrants executed by State and Federal agencies. His professionalism \nand expertise, coupled with intimate knowledge of the local area, \nplayed a significant role in these missions being accomplished safely.\n  Harold provided key information in over 20 felony investigations, \nresulting in several Federal indictments and arrests. His personal \nknowledge of the Clay County area of the Daniel Boone National Forest \nplayed a decisive role in the identification of several suspects caught \non surveillance, which was initiated as a result of Harold's aerial \nreconnaissance.\n  Throughout his career as a Federal law-enforcement officer, Harold's \nprimary responsibility has been that of marijuana eradication officer \nfor the Daniel Boone National Forest--and from that responsibility he \nhas never wavered. In 2008, he was recognized by the U.S. Forest \nService for a career of exceptionally meritorious service.\n  The U.S. Forest Service sometimes works with the Kentucky National \nGuard in their drug-control efforts, and Harold's dedication was clear \nto the soldiers he worked alongside. ``Harold is one of the driving \nforces behind the success of the Kentucky National Guard's efforts in \nsupport of these missions,'' says LTC Karlas Owens.\n  ``When observing marijuana in a helicopter, Harold possessed the \npatience of Job while maneuvering his ground element over difficult \nterrain . . . he guided officers cross-country as they walked to \ndistant marijuana plots in the Daniel Boone National Forest and ensured \nthey made a safe return. . . . Harold not only gives 110 percent to the \n[U.S.] Forest Service, but always supports the Kentucky National Guard \nand ensures we are successful as well.''\n  Lieutenant Colonel Owens also has these words for Harold, after \nworking alongside him for 20 years on these dangerous but vital \nmissions: ``For your teachings and friendship, I thank you, Sir.''\n  A countless number of Kentuckians owe their thanks to Harold as well. \nUpon his retirement, I know my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in \nthanking Special Agent James Harold Sizemore for his decades of \nservice. The work he has done for so many years has bequeathed to all \nof us a safer, stronger Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2637-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2637-S2638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARMENIAN REMEMBRANCE DAY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at this time every year, we observe \nArmenian Remembrance Day, when we commemorate the horrific and tragic \nevents that constitute the Armenian Genocide. We also honor those who \nsuffered persecution and lost their lives, and recognize those who \nsurvived this dark period in human history.\n  On April 24, 1915, Turkish Ottoman authorities began rounding up and \nmurdering more than 5,000 Armenians, including civic leaders, \nintellectuals, writers, priests, scientists, and doctors. This \nsystematic campaign of deportation, expropriation, starvation, and \nother atrocities continued until 1923, resulting in the deaths of \nnearly 1.5 million Armenians. As U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, \nHenry Morganthau, said at the time, ``When the Turkish authorities gave \nthe orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death \nwarrant to a whole race; they understood this well, and, in their \nconversations with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the \nfact. . . I am confident that the whole history of the human race \ncontains no such horrible episode as this.''\n  The Armenian Day of Remembrance serves to remind us all of how \nimportant it is that we look unflinchingly at the atrocities that \nmankind is capable of, sustained by the ability of our human spirit to \novercome such tragedy. The horrific events we remember today \nconstituted the first genocide of the 20th century. But it was soon \nfollowed by the Holocaust, where Hitler said he could pursue it and \ninflict it on humanity since ``Who, after all, speaks\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\ntoday of the annihilation of the Armenians?'' Recent history in Rwanda, \nCongo, Darfur and elsewhere reminds us that genocides and mass \natrocities remain with us to this day. And as President Obama has said, \n``bearing witness is not the end of our obligation--it's just the \nbeginning.'' He has called for our committing ourselves ``to resisting \ninjustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they may \ntake.''\n  Some have sought to deny that the atrocities committed against the \nArmenian people occurred. But as the Genocide Prevention Task Force, \nchaired by former Secretary of State Albright and former Secretary of \nDefense William Cohen, stated, it is ``fundamental to address the \nlegacy of past abuses.'' This is necessary, the task force emphasizes, \nfor the sake of justice, to remove the cause of retribution, and to end \nthe discounting of the costs of violence. Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel \nhas said that the denial of genocide constitutes a ``double killing,'' \nfor it seeks to rewrite history by absolving the perpetrators of \nviolence while ignoring the suffering of the victims.\n  We need to be clear that marking this Armenian Day of Remembrance is \nnot an indictment of the Republic of Turkey. It occurred before the \nRepublic of Turkey came into existence. With the signing of accords \nlast October, Turkey and Armenia have taken a major step forward in the \nprocess of normalizing relations, opening their common border which has \nbeen closed for more than a decade and a half, and removing barriers to \ntrade. Ratification of those accords will be important for continuing \nthis process of reconciliation and hopefully will be completed \npromptly. All friends of Armenia and Turkey should hope that these two \nnations and peoples can jointly face their shared history and move \nforward together as fellow members of the community of nations.\n  In speaking to a joint session of Congress last November, German \nChancellor Angela Merkel spoke eloquently about the importance of \ntearing down walls, not only between neighbors but also the ``wall in \npeople's minds that make it difficult time and again to understand one \nanother in this world of ours. This is why the ability to show \ntolerance is so important.'' She added, ``Tolerance means showing \nrespect for other people's history, traditions, religion and cultural \nidentity.''\n  So I say to my colleagues that one way we can honor the memory of the \n1.5 million Armenian victims of the tragic events of 1915-1923 is by \nrecognizing that we have an obligation to do all we can to stop mass \natrocities from occurring, to aid the survivors of such tragedies, and \nto promote justice, tolerance, and understanding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2638-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Natural \nResources Conservation Service, NRCS, on its 75th anniversary.\n  Even though we are an urban nation, we are still an agricultural \nland. Nearly 70 percent of the United States, exclusive of Alaska, is \nheld in private ownership by millions of individuals. Fifty percent of \nthe United States--907 million acres--is cropland, pasture-land, and \nrangeland owned and managed by farmers and ranchers and their families.\n  In the early 1900s, President Roosevelt and other conservationists \nlike John Muir and Gifford Pinchot had the foresight to set aside \nAmerica's special places as national parks and forests, seashores, and \nwilderness areas. America's public land became a showcase for some of \nthe most dramatic and beautiful landscapes on the North American \ncontinent.\n  But others also recognized the importance of America's private land \nto the health of the Nation. It took the seriousness of the Dust Bowl \nfor this message to be accepted. Rooted in our national experience with \ndevastating soil erosion of that time, the conservation movement began \nwith the purpose of keeping productive topsoil--and a productive \nagriculture--in place.\n  To lead conservation efforts at the Federal level, Congress created \nthe Soil Conservation Service, SCS, within the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, in 1935. SCS was renamed the Natural Resources \nConservation Service, NRCS, in 1994. This was the beginning of the \nNation's historic commitment to a conservation partnership with farmers \nand ranchers.\n  At the same time, the Nation also adopted a remarkable Federal, \nState, and local partnership for delivering conservation assistance to \nfarmers and ranchers. The concept was that NRCS would deliver technical \nand financial assistance for conservation, while State governments and \nlocal conservation districts would connect with individual landowners \nand set local priorities.\n  From the beginning, this was a cooperative approach, drawing on many \nsources for technical knowledge, financial assistance, and broad-based \neducational programs for natural resources conservation and management. \nThis partnership remains the preeminent model for intergovernmental \ncooperation today and is admired around the world.\n  In the 1980s, NRCS's programs began to change as Congress began to \nincrease incentives for farmers and ranchers to practice good \nconservation. During the 1990s, Congress accelerated the investment in \nconservation by creating additional programs, such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program, EQIP, to share the cost of enhancing \nnatural resources on farms, ranches and private forestland.\n  Congress increased this investment in the 2002 and 2008 farm bills \nand is expected to continue to support conservation well into the \nfuture. However, there are challenges in conservation today. One \nchallenge is how to sustain the ability of NRCS to provide technical, \nscientifically sound advice and assistance in a time of tight budgets \nand increased demands. Another challenge is how to maintain the highly \nsuccessful conservation partnership that works with farmers and \nranchers as individuals to address their specific conservation \nconcerns.\n  W.C. Lowdermilk, the Assistant Chief of the Soil Conservation Service \nin the 1930s said, ``In a very real sense the land does not lie; it \nbears a record of what men write on it. In a larger sense, a Nation \nwrites its record on the land. This record is easy to read by those who \nunderstand the simple language of the land.'' Conservation leads to \nprosperous, healthy societies and stable, self-sufficient countries. It \nsustains the agricultural productivity that allows for division of \nlabor and the growth and longevity of a society.\n  Careful land stewardship through terracing, crop rotation and other \nsoil conservation measures enables societies to flourish. However, \nneglect of the land, manifested as soil erosion, deforestation, and \novergrazing, helps to topple empires and destroy entire civilizations.\n  These lessons of history, including our own with the Dust Bowl of the \n1930s, are ones we should not forget. America's future is tied to how \nwe treat our land. Today, the Nation's farmers and ranchers deliver \nsafe, reliable, high quality food, feed, and fiber to the Nation and to \nthe world, but also much more. Through their careful stewardship, \nfarmers, ranchers, and private forest landowners also deliver clean \nwater, productive wildlife habitat, and healthy landscapes.\n  Today, we thank all who have made this happen through their service \nto our country as part of the NRCS. Congratulations on your 75th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2638-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2638-S2639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MIDDLEBURY INTERACTIVE LANGUAGES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York \nTimes article, ``Middlebury to Develop Online Language Venture,'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 13, 2010]\n\n             Middlebury To Develop Online Language Venture\n\n                            (By Tamar Lewin)\n\n       Middlebury College, a small Vermont college known for its \n     rigorous foreign-language programs, is forming a venture with \n     a commercial entity to develop online language programs for \n     pre-college students. The college plans to invest $4 million \n     for a 40 percent stake in what will become Middlebury \n     Interactive Languages.\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\n       The partnership, with the technology-based education \n     company K12 Inc., will allow Middlebury to achieve two goals, \n     said Ronald D. Liebowitz, the president of the college: It \n     will help more American students learn foreign languages, an \n     area in which they lag far behind Europeans; and it will give \n     Middlebury another source of revenue.\n       ``We wanted to do something about the fact that not enough \n     American students are learning other languages, and it's \n     harder for students if they don't learn language until \n     college,'' Mr. Liebowitz said. ``It is also my belief, and I \n     think our board's belief, that finding potential new sources \n     of revenue is not a bad thing. By doing what we're doing with \n     this venture, we hope to take some stress off our three \n     traditional sources of revenue--fees, endowment and \n     donations.''\n       Middlebury, a 2,400-student liberal-arts college with an \n     endowment of more than $800 million, has offered summer \n     immersion language classes for almost a century, and now \n     teaches 10 languages in those programs at its campus and, as \n     of last year, some at Mills College in Oakland, Calif.\n       Partnerships between universities and commercial entities \n     have become increasingly common in recent years, but the \n     Middlebury venture is unusual in that it ties the college's \n     academic reputation in foreign languages to a third-party \n     vendor. Moving into such an uncharted area carries risks, \n     education experts said.\n       ``These partnerships are starting as ways for colleges, \n     which may feel themselves cash-strapped, to make some \n     bucks,'' said Philip G. Altbach, the Monan professor of \n     higher education at Boston College. ``I have problems with \n     the whole thing, particularly for a place like Middlebury, \n     which has a reputation as one of the best liberal-arts \n     colleges in the country, and for doing a very good job with \n     languages. They should protect that brand. They are not known \n     for online programs, and to jump in to the deep end of the \n     swimming pool, with a for-profit, is in my view dangerous.''\n       Mr. Liebowitz said that although the move carried risks, \n     so, too, does inaction. ``The way I see it, to retain our \n     leadership in the teaching of foreign language, we have to \n     evolve with the times,'' he said. ``And where things are \n     going, in terms of access and education, is online.''\n       In 2008, Middlebury joined with the Monterey Institute of \n     International Studies, a California graduate school, to start \n     the Middlebury-Monterey Language Academy, an intensive \n     language-immersion summer program for students in grades 8 \n     through 12. That program, which will expand to new sites in \n     the new venture, offers four-week residential sessions at \n     Green Mountain College in Vermont, Oberlin College in Ohio, \n     Pomona College in California, and Bard College at Simon's \n     Rock in Massachusetts.\n       Middlebury has also expanded its academic-year study-abroad \n     sites, the C. V. Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad, to 35 \n     cities across 14 countries. Almost half the students at those \n     sites now come from other colleges.\n       A hallmark of Middlebury's language schools has been a \n     formal pledge to speak only the language of study during the \n     session.\n       Of course, online programs cannot replicate the immersion \n     experience.\n       The online expertise for the venture will come from K12, a \n     publicly traded company based in Herndon, Va. In partnership \n     with charter schools and school districts, K12 operates \n     online public-school programs in 25 states and Washington. \n     K12 also operates the K12 International Academy, an \n     accredited, diploma-granting online private school serving \n     students in more than 40 countries.\n       ``We plan to make the courses available to individual kids, \n     home-school kids, charter virtual schools, and teachers who \n     might want them as supplements,'' Mr. Liebowitz said. ``I \n     think the price point will be somewhere in the vicinity of \n     $100.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2639-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GEORGE DENNISON\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an \noutstanding leader from my home State of Montana as he embarks on a new \nadventure in his life. Since 1990 George Dennison has served as the \npresident of the University of Montana; he is now the longest serving \npresident in the history of the institution. This summer on August 15, \n20 years to the day after he began his duties at UM, President Dennison \nis retiring. I would like to speak today about some of George's \nachievements and all he has done to better higher education in Montana.\n  A historian by training, George earned a bachelor's degree with \nhighest honors from the University of Montana in 1962, as well as his \nmaster's degree in 1963. After earning his Ph.D. in history from the \nUniversity of Washington, George went on to serve as a professor and \nadministrator for universities in Arkansas, Washington, and 18 years at \nColorado State University in Fort Collins. George eventually returned \nto Missoula from Kalamazoo, MI, where he served as provost and vice \npresident for academic affairs for Western Michigan University, to \nbecome president of the University of Montana in 1990.\n  I have enjoyed working with George during his tenure as president of \nthe university. We share a strong desire to ensure that Montana's \nstudents have access to a high-quality, world class education that \nprepares them for the careers of the future and to be active members in \ntheir communities.\n  The University of Montana has seen tremendous growth under President \nDennison's leadership. Over the past two decades, student enrollment \nhas jumped from 10,000 to over 15,000. In the 20 years that George has \nserved as president, more students have graduated from UM than did in \nthe entire previous century. The number of doctorates awarded has \nincreased from 15 to 75 annually. External research funding has \nexpanded from $7 million in 1990 to over $170 million in 2010. The \nathletic programs at UM have competed well on a national level and have \ncreated a great sense of school and community spirit as the Griz have a \nfaithful following throughout Big Sky country.\n  Like President Dennison, I strongly believe that an understanding of \nthe world in which we live is essential to a well-rounded education. \nUnder George's leadership, the university has developed strong \ninternational and exchange programs. Building on the work done by our \ndear friend Mike Mansfield, the former Senate majority leader and \nAmbassador to Japan, UM has relationships with universities across \nAsia. These partnerships help strengthen our educational, diplomatic, \nand economic ties with our friends across the Pacific and carry on the \nlegacy and good work of Mike and Maureen Mansfield.\n  One initiative on which I have been particularly proud to work with \nPresident Dennison is the educational and cultural exchange program \nthat the university recently started with Vietnam. I invited the \nVietnamese Ambassador to the U.S. to visit Missoula in 2008 to meet \nwith President Dennison about the exchange. President Dennison then \ntraveled to Vietnam last year to meet with several universities and \nsubsequently signed memoranda of understanding with Can Tho University \nand Vietnamese National University to establish student and faculty \nexchanges. It is important that we provide our students, the leaders of \ntomorrow, with the knowledge they will need to thrive in our \nincreasingly global society--this exchange program does just that.\n  George has received numerous awards and recognition during his time \nat UM including the Governor's Humanities Award in 2009, the Montana \nExcellence in Leadership Award in 2007, and the Council for Advancement \nand Support of Education Region VIII Leadership Award in 1999. \nPresident Dennison has received honorary doctorates from universities \nin Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. During his career, George has had a \nnumber of historical works published. His 1976 book, ``The Dorr War: \nRepublicanism on Trial, 1831-1861,'' was runner-up in the Frederick \nJackson Turner Award Competition. Upon retiring as president, George \nplans to spend the first years of his retirement writing a history of \nthe University of Montana.\n  I would like to once again thank President Dennison for all his hard \nwork and commend him for his leadership over the years. I wish him and \nJane all the best as they start a new chapter in their life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2639-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2639-S2640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR E.

He is a devoted and loving husband of 46 years, \nfather of three daughters and grandfather of seven.\n  As a well-respected member of the community, Arthur has been involved \nin numerous roles, such as the past president of the Temple Emanu-El \nsynagogue in Sandy Springs and as a board member of the Marcus Jewish \nCommunity Center of Atlanta.\n  His commitment to community service and volunteerism has been \ntremendously valuable, and I am sure he has touched many lives over the \nyears.\n  Arthur Katz is a true champion of patriotism and it is only fitting \nthat he be honored and featured at the Wall of Gallantry at the U.S. \nCoast Guard Academy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2640-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING PITNEY BOWES COMPANY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the Pitney \nBowes Company on the occasion of its 90th birthday. Headquartered in \nStamford, Pitney Bowes has proven time and again that it is a true \nConnecticut institution, leading the way in innovation and facilitating \nprogress in the mailing industry.\n  But at least as important as its financial success, is the kind of \ncompany that it is. The company is a notably progressive employer, \ncapturing repeated honors for its commitment to diversity. It is \nregularly cited as among the best places to work for women, African \nAmericans, and Hispanics. It does this because it is right but also \nbecause they know it makes smart business sense.\n  Pitney Bowes is also a corporate leader in health care. It is truly \nin the forefront of efforts to improve their employee and retiree \nhealth while at the same time reducing costs. The examples are \nnumerous. The company learned that forcing people to make large \ncopayments for the medications they need to manage chronic conditions \noften led employees to skip taking their medicine. This resulted in \nmore trips to the doctor and hospital, higher costs, and more \nabsenteeism. So the company reduced or eliminated employee copayments \nfor these medications. It cost more in the short run, but a lot less in \nthe long run, and the affected employees enjoy greater health and \nproductivity.\n  The company put healthy food in its cafeterias and charges less for \nit. There are still lots of choices, some not so healthy, but you have \nto look harder for the less healthy foods, and you have to pay more. \nAnd either way, there are on-site gyms in many facilities.\n  The company also established on-site clinics to make it easier for \nemployees and retirees to obtain medical care. Indeed, Pitney Bowes \nwent so far as to arrange for specialist doctors, used by many of their \nemployees, to hold office hours on-site. These efforts have been \nrecognized by the Obama administration, and Murray Martin, the chairman \nand CEO, met with the President last year to discuss the company's \nprograms.\n  Finally, the company also has a profound commitment to community \nservice, providing funding for education and literacy organizations, \nand encouraging employees to volunteer their time to a wide variety of \ncauses. This is just another way in which Pitney Bowes has benefited \nour State.\n  At a time when many American companies have failed, and others have \nbecome deeply troubled, it is with pleasure that I am able to recognize \na cutting-edge company with good old fashioned values. Congratulations, \nPitney Bowes, on your 90th birthday. \n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize one of my \nState's great companies on the occasion of its 90th birthday. On April \n23, 1920, Arthur Pitney and Walter Bowes officially formed the Pitney \nBowes Company with its headquarters in Stamford, CT. Today the company \nis still headquartered in Stamford, and employs 33,000 individuals \nworldwide.\n  In 1912, Arthur Pitney introduced the postage meter in the United \nStates. This device, which is used to create and apply physical \nevidence of postage to pieces of mail, has allowed postal officials and \noffices throughout the United States to process mail more efficiently. \nIn 1920, he partnered with Walter Bowes, a successful entrepreneur, to \nform the Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company. In order for the postage \nmeter to be sold in the U.S., Congress had to act to permit the meter \nindicia to be recognized as postage.\n  Since its founding, Pitney Bowes has been at the forefront of \ntechnological innovation. It has added vastly to the intellectual \ncapital of this country and currently manages an active patent \nportfolio of more than 3,000 inventions. Quite simply, it is a company \nthat has been the source of many, many good ideas. Many of its \nscientists are based in its R facility in Shelton, CT. In addition, \nthe company actually had one of the first ``e-commerce'' applications, \nwith its meters able to download postage electronically since 1979.\n  Pitney Bowes continues to innovate and grow. Last year its R \ninvestment was $182 million. It recently launched its newest mailing \nsystem. It also has become one of the world's largest software \ncompanies, helping its customers more accurately address their mail, \ndeliver smarter marketing, provide more efficient government services, \nor locate their stores in the most promising location. The company also \nis a leader in the field of document management, helping government \nagencies, large companies and law firms manage their critical \ndocuments.\n  For more than 20 years, Pitney Bowes Financial Services \nInternational, a wholly-owned subsidiary, has been providing high-\nquality financial services for Pitney Bowes customers throughout the \ninternational marketplace. For example, Pitney Bowes finances the \npurchase of postage in its meters for over 1 million customers.\n  Pitney Bowes has operated globally for decades, and currently \ngenerates almost 30 percent of its revenue outside of the United \nStates. At its manufacturing facility in Danbury, the company assembles \nlarge-scale mailing machines for export to many countries. I have had \nthe privilege of touring the facility and have enjoyed seeing the flags \nof the destination countries hung over the machines they will be \nreceiving.\n  Pitney Bowes has a large and diverse customer base with 2 million \ncustomers worldwide, many of which are small businesses. It has been \nlisted on the New York Stock Exchange since 1950, has been a component \nof the S 500 Stock Index continually since 1957, and first joined the \nFortune 500 in 1962.\n  Over the years, I know that Pitney Bowes has also been a good partner \nto the Postal Service and cares passionately about maintaining a mail \nservice that not only survives but thrives. Pitney Bowes took the lead \nin creating the Mailing Industry CEO Council, which for the last \nseveral years has been at the forefront of educating policymakers about \nthe mailing industry. There was a time when many of us in Congress \nfailed to appreciate the extent of the importance and impact of the \nmailing industry. But thanks to their efforts, we know that it is a big \ntrillion dollar industry employing more than 8 million workers. The \ncompany and the CEO Council played important roles in helping us enact \npostal reform legislation after a decade of effort. The company's \nchairman and CEO, Murray Martin, continues to regularly visit us in \nWashington to share his insights on how Congress can help the Postal \nService adjust in a rapidly changing world.\n  On behalf of the people of Connecticut and the rest of the Nation, I \nwould like to honor Pitney Bowes on the occasion of its 90th birthday. \nI am certain that the company and its employees will continue to \npioneer new technologies and services that will contribute to economic \ngrowth in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2640-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2640-S2641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JORDAN SOMER\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an \noutstanding young Nebraskan for her spirit of community service and for \nher dedication to making a difference in the lives of others.\n  Jordan Somer is currently a junior at Central High School in Omaha, \nNE. At Central High School, she is a member of the school's dance team \nand is involved in student clubs.\n  Jordan's vision was to create a pageant for girls and women with \ndisabilities. In 2007, she founded the Miss Amazing Pageant. Now in its \nfourth\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\nyear, the annual pageant encourages girls and women with disabilities \nto develop their public speaking skills and to build a positive self-\nimage.\n  The Miss Amazing Pageant not only provides girls and women with \ndisabilities with opportunities to shine, but also makes a clear \ndifference in the community. Each participant in the Miss Amazing \nPageant is asked to donate four cans of food. This food is then given \nto people in need. Jordan's pageant also gives back the money raised \nthrough ticket sales and silent auctions. Since 2007, Jordan's pageant \nhas generously donated $15,000 to various community organizations.\n  I am pleased to recognize Jordan as a winner of the National Youth \nService Award for Global Youth Service Day. It was a special honor for \nme to nominate someone so deserving of this award. Her service and \nleadership through the Miss Amazing Pageant has made a difference in \nthe lives of individuals with disabilities and in Nebraska communities.\n  I want to express my personal congratulations to Jordan on her \nNational Youth Service Award. I commend her for the worthy example she \nis setting for other young people and wish her all the best in her \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2641-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2641-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/26/senate-section/article/S2641-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 7:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1963.

A bill to authorize the Department of Labor's voluntary \nprotection program and to expand the program to include more small \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenator Landrieu known as the Voluntary Protection Program Act. This \nbill will codify the Voluntary Protection Program, or VPP, expand it to \ninclude more small businesses, and incorporate recent GAO \nrecommendations for program improvements.\n  No program has been more successful in creating such a culture of \nsafety in the workplace than VPP. Since it was created in 1982, \nRepublican and Democrat administrations alike have fostered its growth \nto now 2,284 worksites, a quarter of which are unionized, and it covers \nalmost a million employees. The bipartisan support for VPP continues \ninto this Congress. Last week, the Senate Budget Committee unanimously \napproved an amendment to preserve VPP budget authority and Chairman \nConrad noted that the program actually saves taxpayer dollars.\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\n  Worksites that pass the rigorous evaluation process and become VPP \nsites have an average Days Away Restricted or Transferred, DART, case \nrate of 52 percent below the average for its industry. In recent years, \nsmaller worksites have made significant strides in VPP, increasing from \n28 percent of VPP sites in 2003 to 39 percent in 2008.\n  The innovative program doesn't just keep employees safer; as I have \nnoted, it also saves both the VPP companies and the taxpayers money. In \n2007, Federal Agency VPP participants saved the government more than \n$59 million by avoiding injuries and private sector VPP participants \nsaved more than $300 million. Additionally, when workplaces make the \nsignificant commitment to safety required by VPP, it allows OSHA to \nfocus its resources where they are most needed. VPP Participant \nemployers contribute a great deal to the VPP program expenditures. VPP \nparticipants have assigned approximately 1,200 of their own employees \nto act as OSHA Special Government Employees, SGEs, who conduct onsite \nevaluations for OSHA.\n  Despite the strong bipartisan support for VPP and its very positive \nresults, the need for this legislation has become painfully clear. The \nadministration's fiscal year 2011 Budget Request proposed eliminating \nthe small amount it takes to administer VPP--$3.125 million and sought \nto transfer the 35 FTEs it takes to run the program to other functions. \nThe budget proposal stated that OSHA was seeking ``alternative non-\nfederal forms of funding'' and working closely with stakeholders, but, \nto date, no plan to secure such funding has been offered by the \nadministration or in either the House or Senate authorizing committee. \nTo the extent such ``alternative funding'' is bureaucratic code for a \nfee-based system such a proposal is simply not workable and completely \ncounterproductive. Participating employers already voluntarily absorb \nsignificant costs to participate in the current program. Asking \nbusinesses--particularly small businesses, and particularly in the \ncurrent economic environment--to take on more costs will only result in \nthem dropping out of the program. Further still, a fee-based system \nsimply destroys the credibility and integrity of VPP participation for \nemployees.\n  I would like to thank Senator Landrieu for working with me on this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 3258. A bill to amend the securities laws to modernize and \nstrengthen investor protection, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the recent lawsuit by the Securities and \nExchange Commission, SEC, against Goldman Sachs underscores that much \nstill needs to be done to improve transparency and restore confidence \nin our financial system. Indeed, that is why we must have the debate on \nWall Street reform. The nearly \\1/2\\ of all U.S. households that own \nsecurities deserve a strong cop on the beat that has the tools it needs \nto go after swindlers and scam artists, and pursue the difficult cases \narising from our increasingly complex financial markets. Our economy's \nsuccess depends in no small part on restoring confidence in our capital \nmarkets and a smoothly operating capital formation process.\n  The bill I am introducing this afternoon, the Modernizing and \nStrengthening Investor Protection Act, would improve the ability of the \nSEC to protect investors by strengthening its ability to bring \nenforcement actions, addressing issues revealed by the recent Madoff \nfraud, and modernizing its ability to obtain critical information. In \nparticular, it would enhance the ability of the SEC to hire market \nexperts, strengthen oversight of fund custodians, modernize the SEC's \nability to obtain information from the firms it oversees, and clarify \nand enhance SEC penalties and other authorities.\n  This legislation mirrors a bill that Representative Kanjorski \nintroduced and worked to include in the House version of Wall Street \nreform. I urge my colleagues to take a look at my legislation during \nthe next few days, as I plan to introduce it as an amendment to the \nWall Street reform bill that is about to be considered by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3258\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend subtitle A of the Antitrust Criminal Penalty \nEnhancement and Reform Act of 2004 to make the operation of such \nsubtitle permanent law; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Antitrust \nCriminal Penalties Enforcement and Reform Act of 2004 Extension Act. \nThis legislation makes permanent a critical component of the Antitrust \nCriminal Penalty Enforcement and Reform Act of 2004, set to expire on \nJune 22, which encourages participation in the Antitrust Division's \nleniency program. As a result, the Justice Department will be able to \ncontinue to detect, investigate and aggressively prosecute price-fixing \ncartels which harm consumers.\n  The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has long \nconsidered criminal cartel enforcement a top priority, and its \nCorporate Leniency Policy is an important tool in that enforcement. \nCriminal antitrust offenses are generally conspiracies among \ncompetitors to fix prices, rig bids, or allocate markets of customers. \nThe Leniency Policy creates incentives for corporations to report their \nunlawful cartel conduct to the Division, by offering the possibility of \nimmunity from criminal charges to the first-reporting corporation, as \nlong as there is full cooperation. For more than 15 years, this policy \nhas allowed the Division to uncover cartels affecting billions of \ndollars worth of commerce here in the United States, which has led to \nprosecutions resulting in record fines and jail sentences.\n  An important part of the Division's Leniency Policy, added by the \nAntitrust Criminal Penalties Enforcement and Reform Act of 2004, limits \nthe civil liability of leniency participants to the actual damages \ncaused by that company--rather than triple the damages caused by the \nentire conspiracy, which is typical in civil antitrust lawsuits. This \nremoved a significant disincentive to participation in the leniency \nprogram--the concern that, despite immunity from criminal charges, a \nparticipating corporation might still be on the hook for treble damages \nin any future antitrust lawsuits.\n  Maintaining strong incentives to make use of the Leniency Policy \nprovides important benefits to the victims of antitrust offenses, often \nconsumers who paid artificially high prices. It makes it more likely \nthat criminal antitrust violations will be reported and, as a result, \nconsumers will be able to identify and recover their losses from paying \nillegally inflated prices. The policy also requires participants to \ncooperate with plaintiffs in any follow-on civil lawsuits, which makes \nit more likely that the plaintiff consumers will be able to build \nstrong cases against all members of the conspiracy.\n  Since the passage of ACPERA, the Antitrust Division has uncovered a \nnumber of significant cartel cases through its leniency program, \nincluding the air cargo investigation, which so far has yielded over a \nbillion dollars in criminal fines. In that investigation, several \nairlines pled guilty to conspiring to fix international air cargo rates \nand international passenger fuel surcharges. Not only were criminal \nfines levied but one high-ranking executive pled guilty and agreed to \nserve 8 months in prison. In fiscal year 2004, before the passage of \nACPERA, criminal antitrust fines totaled $350 million. Criminal \nantitrust fines in fiscal year 2009 surpassed $1 billion. Scott \nHammond, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Criminal Enforcement \nin the Antitrust Division, has stated that the damages limitation has \nmade its Corporate Leniency Program ``even more effective'' at \ndetecting and prosecuting cartels. In fact, in the first 5 years after \npassage, leniency applications increased by 25 percent, and the \nAntitrust Division experienced ``unprecedented'' success in criminal \nenforcement.\n  ACPERA's damages limitation is set to expire in June, so we must act \nquickly to extend it. Otherwise, the Justice Department will lose an \nimportant tool that it uses to investigate and prosecute criminal \ncartel activity. The strong evidence that this program works means it \nis time to make it permanent. Permanence will give all parties--the \ngovernment, potential amnesty applicants, and potential private \nlitigants--a clear sign that criminal cartel enforcement continues to \nbe a top priority, and that the amnesty program is a key and continuing \ncomponent of that enforcement program.\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\nThis certainty is likely to lead to increased participation in the \namnesty program, the discovery of more cases, the receipt of more \ncriminal fines, and a higher likelihood of consumers being able to \nrecover their losses in civil litigation.\n  Some have raised questions about whether the leniency program could \nbe made more effective by changing the requirements for leniency \napplicants to cooperate in private litigation, or by increasing the \nincentive for whistleblowing. Currently, there is insufficient evidence \nto show that changes are needed and the Department of Justice is \nconcerned that any changes could have the unintended consequence of \nreducing the incentives to use the Leniency Program. Therefore, at this \ntime we are hesitant to tinker with success. However, in response to \nthe concerns, the Antitrust Criminal Penalties Enforcement and Reform \nAct of 2004 Extension Act of 2010 requires a GAO study to consider the \neffectiveness of the incentives for leniency applicants to cooperate in \nprivate litigation, and specifically whether such cooperation is made \nin a timely fashion. The Antitrust Criminal Penalties Enforcement and \nReform Act of 2004 is meant to facilitate both government and private \nenforcement of the antitrust laws, and the GAO study will shed some \nlight on whether it strikes the correct balance. When we receive the \nstudy, we will review it and act accordingly, changing the law if \nnecessary.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3259\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance and further research into the prevention \nand treatment of eating disorders, to improve access to treatment of \neating disorders, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am joining with Senator Klobuchar \nand Senator Franken to introduce the Federal Response to Eliminate \nEating Disorders, FREED, Act. This important bill is the first \ncomprehensive legislative effort to confront eating disorders in the \nU.S.\n  Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are \nwidespread, insidious, and too often fatal diseases. Today, at least 5 \nmillion Americans suffer from eating disorders. Because these diseases \noften go undiagnosed and uncounted, the actual number is closer to 11 \nmillion Americans. Adolescent women are by no means the only people \nsuffering from eating disorders; these diseases don't discriminate by \ngender, race, income, or age.\n  Eating disorders are dangerous conditions, but their consequences are \noften underestimated. These diseases can lead to serious heart \nconditions, kidney failure, osteoporosis, infertility, gastrointestinal \ndisorders, and even death. The National Institute of Mental Health \nestimates that one in 10 people with anorexia nervosa will die of \nstarvation, cardiac arrest, or some other medical complication. One in \n10! That is deeply disturbing, and cries out for a much more aggressive \nFederal response. Moreover, fatalities resulting from eating disorders \nare grossly underreported, because deaths are typically recorded by \nlisting the immediate cause of death, such as cardiac arrest, rather \nthan the underlying cause, which is the eating disorder.\n  But, despite their prevalence and very serious impacts on health, \nresearch funding for eating disorders has lagged behind funding for \nresearch into similar diseases. We simply don't know enough about the \ncauses and consequences of eating disorders, or how to stop them from \ndeveloping in the first place. We have research suggesting that there's \na genetic component to eating disorders, but we have got to learn more \nso we can effectively prevent these diseases before they start.\n\n  The good news is that eating disorders are treatable. With \nappropriate nutritional, medical, and psychotherapeutic interventions, \nthey can be successfully and fully cured. But right now, only one in 10 \npeople receive treatment.\n  The FREED Act takes a major step forward in promoting research, \nscreening, treatment, and the prevention of eating disorders.\n  First, the FREED Act expands research efforts at the National \nInstitutes of Health to examine the causes and consequences of eating \ndisorders. We need to understand these diseases to more effectively \nprevent and treat them. The FREED Act also improves surveillance and \ndata collection systems at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention so we'll have accurate information and epidemiological data \non eating disorders.\n  Second, the FREED Act expands access to treatment services and \nscreening for eating disorders for Medicaid beneficiaries, and creates \na patient advocacy network that will help individuals with eating \ndisorders find treatment. Furthermore, the FREED Act improves the \ntraining and education of health care providers and educators so they \nknow how to identify and treat individuals suffering from eating \ndisorders.\n  Finally, we need to step up efforts to prevent these diseases in the \nfirst place. As I have said so many times, we don't have a genuine \nhealth care system in America, we have a sick care system. In other \nwords, if you get sick, you get treatment. But we can spend just \npennies on the dollar to prevent disease and illness in the first place \nby placing a much more robust emphasis on wellness, nutrition, physical \nactivity, and public health. With this in mind, the FREED Act \nauthorizes grants to develop and implement evidence-based prevention \nprograms and promote healthy eating behaviors in schools, athletic \nprograms, and other community-based programs.\n  Sadly, eating disorders are not rare. These diseases touch the lives \nof so many of our families and friends. Nearly half of all Americans \npersonally know someone with an eating disorder. We have got to do a \nbetter job at the Federal level of investing in research, treatment, \nand prevention. The FREED Act builds on the investments we made in \nprevention, wellness, and mental health in health reform and mental \nhealth parity.\n  I thank Senator Klobuchar and Senator Franken for partnering with me \non this bill, and urge our colleagues to join us in dramatically \nstepping up the federal response to eating disorders.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3260\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Response to \n     Eliminate Eating Disorders Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Estimates, based on current research, indicate that at \n     least 5,000,000 people in the United States suffer from \n     eating disorders including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, \n     binge eating disorder, and eating disorders not otherwise \n     specified (referred to in this Act as ``EDNOS'').\n       (2) Anecdotal evidence suggests that as many as 11,000,000 \n     people in the United States, including 1,000,000 males, may \n     suffer from eating disorders.\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\n       (3) Eating disorders occur in all nations and in all \n     populations, and among people of all ages and races and of \n     both genders.\n       (4) Eating disorders are diseases with grave health \n     consequences and high rates of mortality.\n       (5) Health consequences associated with eating disorders \n     include heart failure and other serious cardiac conditions, \n     electrolyte imbalance, kidney failure, osteoporosis, \n     debilitating tooth decay, and gastrointestinal disorders, \n     including esophageal inflammation and rupture, gastric \n     rupture, peptic ulcers, and pancreatitis.\n       (6) Anorexia nervosa has one of the highest overall \n     mortality rates of any mental illness. According to the \n     National Institute of Mental Health, 1 in 10 people with \n     anorexia nervosa will die of starvation, cardiac arrest, or \n     another medical complication.\n       (7) The risk of death among adolescents with anorexia \n     nervosa is 11 times greater than in disease-free adolescents.\n       (8) Anorexia nervosa has the highest suicide rate of all \n     mental illnesses.\n       (9) New research suggests that bulimia nervosa has a much \n     higher rate of mortality than is reflected in current \n     statistics, because of the failure to identify the underlying \n     eating disorder.\n       (10) Binge eating disorder is the most common eating \n     disorder, with an estimated 3.5 percent of American women and \n     2 percent of American men expected to suffer from this \n     disorder in their lifetime. Binge eating disorder is \n     characterized by frequent episodes of uncontrolled overeating \n     and is associated with obesity, heart disease, gall bladder \n     disease, and diabetes.\n       (11) Research demonstrates that there is a significant \n     genetic component to the development of eating disorders.\n       (12) Certain populations, including adolescent females and \n     athletes of both genders, are at higher risk of developing an \n     eating disorder.\n       (13) Different types of eating disorders may affect certain \n     races and genders disproportionately.\n       (14) Despite the serious health consequences and the high \n     risk of death, Federal research funding for eating disorders \n     has lagged behind research concerning other diseases, when \n     compared by the number of individuals affected by, and the \n     relative health consequences of, the diseases.\n       (15) The ability of individuals suffering from eating \n     disorders, particularly bulimia nervosa, binge eating \n     disorder, and EDNOS to access appropriate treatment is \n     unacceptably low.\n       (16) The development of an eating disorder is frequently \n     preceded by unhealthy weight control behaviors commonly \n     identified as disordered eating, including skipping meals, \n     using diet pills, taking laxatives, self-induced vomiting, \n     and fasting. Such disordered eating behaviors should be \n     included in enhanced research prevention and training \n     efforts.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to expand research into the prevention of eating \n     disorders;\n       (2) to expand research on effective treatment and \n     intervention of eating disorders and to support evidence-\n     based programs designed to prevent eating disorders;\n       (3) to expand research on the causes, courses, and outcomes \n     of eating disorders;\n       (4) to increase the number of people properly screened and \n     diagnosed with an eating disorder;\n       (5) to improve training and education of health care and \n     behavioral care providers and of school personnel at all \n     levels of elementary and secondary education;\n       (6) to improve surveillance and data systems for tracking \n     the prevalence, severity, and economic costs of eating \n     disorders; and\n       (7) to enhance access to comprehensive treatment for eating \n     disorders.\n\n            TITLE I--EATING DISORDER DETECTION AND RESEARCH\n\n     SEC. 101.
