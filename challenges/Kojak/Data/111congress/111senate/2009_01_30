Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will take up the \nnomination of Eric Holder to be the next Attorney General of the United \nStates. I\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\nserve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and that committee held \nhearings regarding Mr. Holder's confirmation. Regrettably, last \nWednesday, when the Senate Judiciary Committee voted that nomination \nout of the committee, I was a ``no'' vote.\n  I wish to say that originally I approached this nomination with an \nopen mind and a determination to ask--indeed to demand--answers to \nlegitimate questions. I think that is the responsibility of each \nSenator under the Constitution in performing our duties of advice and \nconsent. I also think it is important for me to explain why, even \nthough I approached that nomination with an open mind and a \npredisposition to vote for Mr. Holder's nomination, I ultimately \nconcluded, as a result of some of the evidence, which I will lay out, I \ncould not do so in good conscience.\n  Mr. Holder, of course, served as Deputy Attorney General during the \nClinton administration, and if there is any public service that is more \nillustrative of how someone will actually perform as Attorney General, \nI think it would be in performing as Deputy Attorney General. The \nDeputy Attorney General is the one job on Earth most similar to the job \nfor which Mr. Holder will be confirmed on Monday. It is rare to have \nsuch a clear picture of the job a nominee will do if confirmed. Thus, I \nreviewed Mr. Holder's record with great care, as you might expect, and \nalso with great interest.\n  Unfortunately, two of Mr. Holder's actions as Deputy Attorney \nGeneral: the recommendation that President Clinton commute the \nsentences of 16 Puerto Rican separatist terrorists and the \nrecommendation that President Clinton pardon the billionaire fugitive \nMarc Rich, raised serious questions about Mr. Holder's judgment and \nindependence from the wishes of his political sponsors--two key \nqualities I would hope the Senate would want for any Attorney General, \nindependence, adherence and fidelity only to the rule of law--and good \njudgment.\n  Two other aspects of Mr. Holder's record also raised concerns for me. \nMr. Holder's record demonstrates a failure to understand the profound \nthreat posed by radical Islamic terrorism; and, second, Mr. Holder has \noften appeared to be hostile to the second amendment, to the \nconstitutional right to keep and bear arms.\n  As I said, in the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Holder failed to answer my \nquestions, regrettably, and the questions of my colleagues in a way \nthat alleviated these concerns. As I will explain, I indeed found Mr. \nHolder's answers to be nothing short of evasive in some key respects. \nBecause I have doubts about Mr. Holder's judgment and independence, I \nam opposing this nomination, and the four reasons, as I tried earlier \nto summarize but which I will repeat are Mr. Holder's role in the FALN \nand Los Macheteros commutations, his role in the Marc Rich pardon, his \nmisjudgments and shifting opinions with regard to the war on terror, \nand his record of hostility toward the individual's right to keep and \nbear arms.\n  First, I would ask my colleagues to consider Mr. Holder's role in the \nFALN and Los Macheteros commutations. In August 1999, President Clinton \noffered clemency to 16 members of two Puerto Rican separatist terrorist \norganizations, FALN and Los Macheteros. Deputy Attorney General Eric \nHolder made the recommendation that he should do so. The FALN was a \nclandestine terrorist group devoted to bringing about the independence \nof Puerto Rico through violent means. Its members waged open war on the \nUnited States, with more than 150 bombings, arsons, kidnappings, prison \nescapes, threats and intimidation, which resulted in the deaths of at \nleast six people and injuries to many more between 1974 and 1983.\n  The most gruesome attack was in 1975 in lower Manhattan. Timed to \nexplode during the lunch hour, the bomb decapitated 1 of the 4 people \nkilled and injured another 60. In another attack in Puerto Rico, Los \nMacheteros opened fire on a bus of U.S. sailors. Two American sailors \nwere killed and nine were wounded. Fortunately, much of the leadership \nand membership of these terrorist groups was captured and brought to \njustice in the late 1970s and early 1980s. By the late 1980s, the worst \nof the FALN's reign of terror was over.\n  In the early 1990s, sympathetic activists petitioned for clemency on \nbehalf of these terrorists, and it was an easy call for the pardon \nattorney. The pardon attorney is the attorney at the Department of \nJustice who reviews clemency requests and makes recommendations. They \nmake sure the record is thoroughly reviewed and, as I said, then make \nrecommendations. The fact is these unrepentant terrorists who were \ngiven clemency by the Clinton administration never even petitioned for \nclemency. They never even asked for it.\n  Pardon attorney Margaret Love, who worked for then-Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Jamie Gorelick, recommended against clemency for any of these \nprisoners, and a recommendation was transmitted to the President. \nShortly thereafter, when Eric Holder became Deputy Attorney General, he \nrescinded that recommendation opposing clemency and recommended that \nPresident Clinton grant clemency to these unrepentant terrorists.\n  Strangely, Mr. Holder still stands behind this recommendation, saying \nhe considered it reasonable. But the reasons he gives are not \npersuasive. Mr. Holder claims these men were not linked to violence. \nThat is false. These men were active members of a terrorist \norganization that had committed dozens of violent crimes, including, as \nI mentioned earlier, bombings, murder, and arson. It is true the \nparticular crimes for which these individuals were convicted were not, \nin and of themselves, violent crimes, but by that standard, Saddam \nHussein did not commit crimes, unless he pulled the trigger himself. \nLikewise, Osama bin Laden, responsible for the deaths of thousands of \ninnocent American citizens, would not be linked to crime under the \nstandard Mr. Holder posits.\n  There is ample evidence that at least some of the men for whom Eric \nHolder recommended clemency were, in fact, murderers. These \ncommutations were, at the time, widely believed to have some political \nmotivation. Indeed, the Clinton White House discussed how these \nclemencies would affect then-Vice President Gore's political standing \nwithin the Puerto Rican community. For this reason, I believe a full \naccounting of whom Mr. Holder met with, what they discussed, and what \nwent into his decision to recommend these commutations is in order.\n  But there is another equally important reason that these questions \nmust be answered. The victims of the FALN and the Los Macheteros \ndeserve answers. I would encourage all my colleagues, before voting, to \nreview the testimony of Joseph Connor, whose father was killed in the \nbombing in lower Manhattan in 1975. Mr. Connor testified that Mr. \nHolder did not consult with him, did not inform him or his family or \nother victims before recommending that the President set FALN \nterrorists free.\n\n  I cannot vote for Mr. Holder until I can explain my vote to Joseph \nConnor. Because Mr. Holder has failed to answer my questions about the \nFALN commutations, I do not have an explanation I can give to Mr. \nConnor.\n  One of the reasons Mr. Holder has refused to answer some questions \nis, it appears he is invoking executive privilege. But it is very odd \nbecause this apparent assertion of executive privilege comes despite \nthe fact that President Clinton waived executive privilege for all \ntestimony concerning these commutations. That is in the record of the \nhearing before the Judiciary Committee. I think it is unfortunate that \nthe current administration's first apparent assertion of executive \nprivilege seems to come for no purpose other than to protect Mr. \nHolder's record from scrutiny.\n  As I said, in 2001, President Clinton waived executive privilege with \nregard to the commutations and pardons he granted. In a letter to the \nHouse of Representatives, President Clinton's lawyer explicitly stated \nPresident Clinton ``will interpose no executive privilege objections to \nthe testimony of his former staff concerning these pardons, or to other \npardons and commutations he granted.''\n  Nonetheless, Mr. Holder continues to assert he is not authorized to \ntestify about the so-called options memorandum, which is part of the \nrecord underlying these commutations. Instead of forthright answers \nabout Mr. Holder's decision to recommend these\n\n[[Page S1105]]\n\ncommutations or present the options memo to then-President Clinton, he \nhas repeatedly refused to answer questions submitted by Judiciary \nCommittee members, including me.\n  For example, I asked Mr. Holder whether he was aware at the time he \nmade his commutation recommendation of the leadership positions of \nthree of these terrorists and their alleged involvement of another \nmurder of a U.S. Navy sailor--more than one. Mr. Holder responded that \nthis information ``was included in [their] presentence reports which in \nthe ordinary course would be requested and reviewed by the Office of \nPardon Attorney as one of the first investigative steps.''\n  This answer, I have to say, is a very lawyerly answer, but it is \nnonresponsive to my question. It avoids the question of whether he was \naware of these matters when he recommended commutation. In fact, \nChairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter sent a letter to the \nDepartment of Justice citing President Clinton's waiver of executive \nprivilege and requesting the relevant documents regarding the clemency \ndecision. This request, inexplicably, has been denied.\n  Because President Clinton has waived this privilege, this assertion \nof privilege is apparently now being made by the present administration \nof President Obama. Of course, executive privilege only belongs to the \nprincipal, to the client--in this case the Executive--so it has to be \neither President Clinton or President Obama, and clearly President \nClinton has waived it.\n  The Justice Department has apparently advanced the argument that the \nClinton waiver applied only to testimony and not to documents, but Mr. \nHolder's testimony about the options paper is clearly testimony and not \na document. Thus, his assertion of privilege is indeed broader than the \nmost restrictive reading of the Clinton waiver. So who is denying the \nHolder authorization to testify about the options paper? Apparently, I \nconclude, it could only be President Obama.\n  Assertions of executive privilege, as we know, raise questions about \nthe balance of power between the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch. The Executive's interest in secrecy and confidential \ncommunications, and Congress's right to information, particularly in \nthe context of a confirmation hearing when performing our \nconstitutional duty of advice and consent, are in tension and, in this \ncase, conflict. It is up to the branches to negotiate and work together \nto take both interests into account and to make public relevant \ninformation that bears on the qualifications and experience of members \nof the President's Cabinet--in this instance, Mr. Holder. I believe \nPresident Obama owes the American people--consistent with his ideals on \nopen government, which I enthusiastically support--to make his \nassertion of privilege plainly and in the light of day.\n  Moreover, it is hard to imagine any significant executive branch \ninterest in keeping this information secret. These documents are a \ndecade old and concern crimes committed about 30 years ago. President \nClinton, of course, is no longer in office, and he has waived the \nprivilege. The context of these documents has been alluded to in U.S. \nmajor newspapers and even by Mr. Holder himself. So it seems to me \nthere is no further executive branch interest in continuing to hide \nthese documents, only a desire to shield Mr. Holder from hard \nquestions.\n  In short, Mr. Holder's responses to questions regarding these \ncommutations has been evasive. The Senate and the American people \ndeserve forthright answers to questions that pertain to Mr. Holder's \njudgment, his independence, his seriousness of mind when it comes to \nthe threat of Islamic extremism, and his qualifications to be Attorney \nGeneral.\n  I also believe the families of the victims of the terrorist acts by \nthe FALN and Los Macheteros terrorists deserve a full accounting for \nthe release of terrorists who were partly to blame for their loved \none's deaths. Instead of providing a forthright accounting, Mr. Holder \nhas simply dodged the question, hidden behind an apparent claim of \nexecutive privilege, and refused to cooperate with the Judiciary \nCommittee in getting to the bottom of some of these matters.\n  The next concern I have has to do with the Rich pardon I alluded to \nat the very beginning. Less than 2 years after the controversy \nsurrounding the FALN commutations, on the very last night of the \nClinton administration, Mr. Holder made a very similar error of \njudgment when he recommended that President Clinton pardon the \nnotorious fugitive by the name of Marc Rich. At the time, Mr. Rich was \nNo. 6 on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List.\n  In 1983, then-U.S. attorney Rudy Giuliani in the Southern District of \nNew York, obtained an indictment of international commodities trader \nMarc Rich and his business partner, Pincus Green. The indictment \ncharged 65 counts of tax evasion, racketeering, and trading with the \nenemy.\n  Specific charges include illegally trading with the Ayatollah \nKhomeini's Iranian terrorist regime in violation of U.S. energy laws \nand a trade embargo against Iran.\n  Indeed, Mr. Rich made a fortune trading with the Ayatollah's regime \nat the same time that 52 American diplomats were still being held \nhostage in the U.S. Embassy in Iran. Mr. Rich profited by trading with \nCuba, Libya, and South Africa during apartheid--all despite U.S. \nembargoes. Rather than face these charges head on, Mr. Rich simply fled \nto Switzerland where he remained a fugitive for 17 years. Federal law \nenforcement, with help from the CIA, the NSA, and other agencies, \nexpended substantial resources in an effort to apprehend Mr. Rich. \nThese efforts included extradition requests and attempts by U.S. \nmarshals to arrest him abroad. Rich refused to return to the United \nStates, despite an offer by prosecutors to drop the racketeering \ncharges in exchange for his return.\n  In an effort to avoid his extradition, though, Mr. Rich went so far \nas to renounce his U.S. citizenship, and he tried to become a citizen \nof Bolivia. It is hard to imagine a more inappropriate candidate for a \npardon than a fugitive from justice accused of trading with the enemy. \nMr. Rich's own lawyer told him he ``spit on the American flag'' by \navoiding the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.\n  According to those involved in the pardon process, including \nPresident Clinton and Marc Rich's lawyer, Eric Holder was more \nresponsible for this controversial decision than any other member of \nthe Clinton administration with the exception of the President himself.\n  In fact, on the last evening of the Clinton administration, White \nHouse counsel called Mr. Holder to solicit his views on the Rich pardon \napplication. As Deputy Attorney General, Holder was effectively \nspeaking for the entire Department of Justice during this crucial phone \ncall.\n\n  Disregarding the strongly held views of hundreds of Department of \nJustice prosecutors and FBI agents who worked nearly two decades to \nbring Marc Rich to justice, Mr. Holder told Nolan he was ``neutral, \nleaning to favorable.''\n  What is crucial to understand is that Mr. Holder was not just \nspeaking for himself but the entire Department of Justice. But with \nthis recommendation from the Deputy Attorney General, President Clinton \ngranted the Rich pardon, one of his last and most despicable actions.\n  Even after having ample opportunity to explain himself, it is unclear \nwhat Mr. Holder's rationale was for recommending this despicable \npardon, as I said, which former FBI Director Louis Freeh called a \n``corrupt act'' on the part of President Clinton.\n  Mr. Holder has admitted he made a mistake, which is commendable. But \nnever in a full day of hearings and in answers to several written \nquestions did Mr. Holder offer a persuasive reason for supporting this \npardon--other than, apparently, caving in to pressure from the Clinton \nWhite House. Mr. Holder defends himself by claiming he was naive; and, \nagain, we have all made mistakes. I grant that. He now admits the Rich \npardon was a mistake and promises he will never make a similar mistake \nagain. In fact, he takes the position he will be a better Attorney \nGeneral because of learning from this mistake.\n  But this pledge is difficult to square with the fact that Mr. Holder \nhad essentially made the same error in judgment less than 2 years \nbefore with the\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\nFALN commutation. I am also concerned that Mr. Holder's testimony \nregarding key conversations and meetings on the Rich pardon seem to \ncontradict the recollections of members of the Marc Rich legal and \nlobbying team.\n  In the fall of 2000, there was an e-mail from former White House \nCounsel Jack Quinn--who was representing Rich in his quest for a \npardon--to the rest of the Rich legal team indicating Mr. Rich told Mr. \nQuinn to ``go straight to the White House.''\n  This suggests that Holder was telling Quinn to bypass the typical \npardon process through the Department of Justice, where opponents of \nthe Rich pardon were legion. Mr. Holder disputes this interpretation, \narguing that an application sent to the White House would be forwarded \nto the Department of Justice in any case. Whether this is true, it is \nindisputable that the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York \nwho indicted Marc Rich for the crimes I mentioned earlier--they were \nnever asked about their views on the Rich pardon, as they would have \nbeen if the normal pardon process had been followed at the Department \nof Justice.\n  If Mr. Holder advised the Rich pardon team on strategic matters, it \nwould be a serious violation of his duties as the second highest law \nenforcement officer in the land. Such aid would be particularly \ndisappointing because a House committee had specifically reprimanded \nMr. Holder for improperly aiding and facilitating the clemency \napplication of the FALN terrorists 2 years earlier. It is not disputed, \nthough, that the Rich pardon application was fast-tracked and sheltered \nfrom its many opponents.\n  It is clear to me that Mr. Holder played a role in clearing the way \nfor this pardon and, at a minimum, he knew it had not been \nappropriately handled through the Department of Justice pardon process.\n  Nevertheless, he declared himself as ``neutral, leaning favorable'' \nwhen the White House asked him about his opinion.\n  In summary, Mr. Holder appears once again to simply have given \nPresident Clinton the answer he wanted. The Rich pardon recommendation \nis the most recent major action by Mr. Holder as a public official. I \nbelieve the evidence casts doubt on his independence and his judgment \nonce again.\n  My greatest concerns, however, are that Mr. Holder fails to fully \nunderstand the unique challenges and threats posed to our country by \nradical Islamic terrorism. I want to explain why I say that. I agree \nwith Mr. Holder when he says the most important duty of the Attorney \nGeneral is to protect America from another terrorist attack. But his \npublic statements regarding the war on terror too often betray a \nwillingness to advance ideological rhetoric without fully appreciating \nthe sensitivity and the complexity of this issue.\n  I find it especially troubling that Mr. Holder's legal views on \nnational security have seemed to shift, depending upon the political \nmood of the day and the audience to whom he is speaking.\n  Shortly after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Mr. Holder voiced \nsupport for the Bush administration's interpretation of the status of \nterrorist detainees. Mr. Holder said, in January 2002, that al-Qaida \nterrorists:\n\n       . . . are not, in fact, people entitled to the protection \n     of the Geneva Convention. They are not prisoners of war.\n\n  He went on to endorse indefinite detention of terrorist prisoners at \nGuantanamo Bay and argued that such prisoners should not be afforded \nGeneva Conventions protections so that they could, in fact, be \ninterrogated to provide actionable intelligence.\n  He did insist, as did the Bush administration at the time, that these \ndetainees should be treated humanely, though. But more recently, as the \npolitical winds have shifted, Mr. Holder has chastised the Bush \nadministration for policies he now seems to believe defy the law.\n  There is a disturbing Jekyll-and-Hyde quality to Mr. Holder's legal \npronouncements concerning our counterterrorism policies. I wish to \nquote from an Associated Press article entitled ``Obama AG pick \ndefended Guantanamo policy,'' dated November 22, 2008. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this article be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Asked whether terrorism suspects could be held forever, \nHolder responded:\n\n       It seems to me that you can think of these people as \n     combatants and we are in the middle of a war.\n\n  Holder said in a CNN interview in January 2002:\n\n       And it seems to me that you could probably say, looking at \n     precedent, that you are going to detain these people until \n     the war is over, if that is ultimately what we wanted to do.\n\n  Just weeks later, Holder told CNN he did not believe al-Qaida \nsuspects qualified as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions.\n\n       One of the things that we clearly want to do with these \n     prisoners is to have an ability to interrogate them and find \n     out what their future plans might be, where other cells are \n     located. Under the Geneva Convention, you are really limited \n     to the amount of information that you can elicit from people.\n\n  Holder said it was important to treat detainees humanely, but he said \nthey:\n\n       . . . are not, in fact, people entitled to the protection \n     of the Geneva Convention. They are not prisoners of war.\n\n  He also downplayed criticism that prisoners were being mistreated.\n\n       Those in Europe and other places who are concerned about \n     the treatment of al-Qaida members should come to Camp X-ray \n     and see how people are, in fact, being treated.\n\n  Those were essentially the same arguments the Bush administration \nmade with regard to Guantanamo Bay with regard to holding enemy \ncombatants who wear no uniform, who do not obey the laws of war, and \nare not citizens of a state, a nation state, but, in fact, are a \nterrorist organization bent on killing innocent civilians here and \nabroad in an effort to pursue their ideology.\n  Since then, however, these arguments have been heavily criticized, as \nwe know, by human rights activists and leading Democrats and, \ninexplicably to me, Mr. Holder himself.\n  He said in June of 2008:\n\n       We must close our detention center at Guantanamo Bay.\n\n  He said that in a speech to the American Constitution Society. He \nsaid:\n\n       A great nation should not detain people, military or \n     civilian, in dark places beyond the reach of law. Guantanamo \n     Bay is an international embarrassment.\n\n  Holder added he never thought he would see the day when the ``Supreme \nCourt would have to order the President of the United States to treat \ndetainees in accordance with the Geneva Convention.''\n  These sharply contrasting legal conclusions were made, again \ninexplicably by one and the same person, Eric Holder, the nominee for \nthe highest law enforcement officer in the United States. One can only \nwonder what he truly believes.\n  In a 2008 speech to the liberal American Constitution Society, he \nattacked many of the same legal positions he once held as ``making a \nmockery of the rule of law.''\n  In that same speech, Holder called for a ``reckoning'' over the Bush \nadministration's ``unlawful practices in the war on terror.''\n  He also accused the Bush administration of ``act[ing] in direct \ndefiance of Federal law'' and railed against counterterrorism policies \nthat he claimed ``violate international law and the United States \nConstitution.''\n  In this way, Mr. Holder appears to have already publicly prejudged a \npotential prosecutorial question that may come before him as Attorney \nGeneral, without knowing all the facts.\n  Now, it is one thing to change your mind, but it is quite different \nto change your mind and then attack the very same position you once \nheld as one that could only be held in bad faith, describing it as \n``making a mockery of the rule of law.''\n  I can only conclude that as an act of pure cynicism, somebody who \ntells you, particularly a lawyer who takes a legal position he once \nembraced, as now only being able to be held in bad faith, is a person \nwho has made a bad-faith legal argument at least once.\n  The recent terrorist attacks in India, in Mumbai, have reminded \nAmericans of the possibility of further attacks on U.S. soil or \nliterally anywhere around the world. On November 26, last year, Mumbai, \nas we know, was ravaged by a gang of terrorists. One of the attackers\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\nwas captured while the rest were killed.\n  More than 170 individuals died as a result of bombings and gunfire, \nincluding 6 Americans. If a U.S. city was targeted in the same way \nMumbai was, or worse, biological, chemical, other even nuclear weapons \nbeing used, it is critical that we be able to obtain the intelligence \nfrom captured terrorists in order to assess whether any other imminent \nattacks are in the works.\n  If we captured the terrorist in an ongoing attack on an American \ncity, it is critically important that we not treat him as an ordinary \ncriminal, with all the rights conferred by the Constitution on an \nAmerican citizen. That, I believe, is one of the most important lessons \nwe must recall and never forget from the tragedy of 9/11. To do so \nwould effectively shut down the intelligence-gathering process and risk \nAmerican lives.\n  When this sort of unpredictable legal challenge arises in the war on \nterrorism, I wish to know whether the Eric Holder of 2002 or the Eric \nHolder of 2008 will be calling the shots. I was not encouraged by Mr. \nHolder's refusal to say he would authorize aggressive interrogation \nagainst terrorists, even if he knew that to do so would prevent a major \nattack on an American city.\n  I also fear his recommendation for and continued endorsement of the \nFALN terrorist commutations is evidence of a failure to appreciate the \ncontinuing dangers of terrorism. At his confirmation hearing, Mr. \nHolder attempted to defend his poor judgment on the terrorist clemency \nissue by noting these commutations occurred long before 9/11.\n  But as I reminded him, the FALN clemencies came after the first World \nTrade Center bombing of 1993, and the al-Qaida attacks on U.S. \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. As Senator Coburn rightly \npointed out, his clemency recommendation came in the wake of the 1995 \nOklahoma City bombing right here on our own soil, the most horrific \ndomestic terror attack that has ever occurred in our country.\n  So I worry that Mr. Holder is not prepared to lead the Department of \nJustice at a moment when this Nation is waging an asymmetric war whose \nbattlefield extends across the globe and even onto U.S. soil.\n\n  If confirmed as the next Attorney General, Mr. Holder will inherit a \ncomplex legal architecture constructed to prevent terrorist attacks \nhere in America and against our allies. That has admittedly been \ncontroversial. But I do not think anyone can question its effectiveness \ngiven the fact that we have not had another terrorist attack on our own \nsoil since 9/11.\n  If Mr. Holder is confirmed, I hope he will study these issues and \ntreat them more carefully and with greater deliberation and greater \nsoundness of judgment than he has demonstrated by his conflicting \npositions in 2002 and 2008. I hope that rather than shifting his \nopinions with the political winds, he will do his very best to uphold \nthe rule of law and the Constitution of the United States while \nprotecting the American people by making sure we are protected within \nthe limits of our law from future attacks.\n  The final issue I wish to mention is my concern about Mr. Holder's \nadherence to the Supreme Court ruling in the District of Columbia v. \nHeller, which interpreted an individual's right to keep and bear arms.\n  That case reversed the District of Columbia's position that said \nindividuals could not own firearms in their homes to protect their \nfamily and their possessions. I believe this is an important victory \nfor the second amendment that must be protected and preserved.\n  As the Nation's chief law enforcement officer, the Attorney General \nsteers Federal gun law policy. The next Attorney General's views will \nshape not only law enforcement and prosecution priorities with regard \nto these issues but also the positions the Department of Justice takes \nin court. The views of the Justice Department will always be given \nconsiderable weight during the early stages of the law's development \npost-Heller.\n  It is crucial the next Attorney General fully appreciate that an \nindividual's right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental freedom \nprotected by our Constitution. I was not comforted by Mr. Holder's \nvague assurance that Heller now is the law of the land because it \ncannot be reconciled with his long record of hostility to second \namendment rights.\n  Through his service as Deputy Attorney General and continuing to \nprivate practice, Mr. Holder has opposed the individual right to keep \nand bear arms. As Deputy Attorney General, he advocated for a wide \nvariety of Federal gun restrictions. Mr. Holder's fierce hostility to \ngun rights continued after, as I say, his tenure as Deputy Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Mr. Holder feels so strongly about his opposition to gun rights that \nhe, along with his former boss, the former Attorney General Janet Reno, \nfiled a brief with the Supreme Court in the Heller case and argued \nagainst the individual rights approach to the second amendment and in \nfavor of the view that the second amendment protects only militia \nactivities.\n  The Holder-Reno brief argued:\n\n       The Second Amendment does not protect firearms possession \n     or use that is unrelated to participation in a well-regulated \n     militia.\n\n  Although the individual rights approach prevailed in the Supreme \nCourt and in the D.C. Circuit, Holder's brief described that approach \nas ``unwise'' and ``unjustified.'' The Holder-Reno brief goes on to \nargue that, even if the second amendment protects an individual right, \nthat right should be narrowly construed.\n  I worry it will be impossible for Mr. Holder to vigorously protect \nthe second amendment rights of all Americans when he is so clearly \nopposed to the decision in the Heller case. I believe his hostility to \nthe second amendment could lead the Department of Justice to take \nopposing positions to narrow that Supreme Court decision, particularly \nin court.\n  Holder's Heller brief was directly at odds with the Court's opinion, \nas we have seen. Can we expect him to vigorously enforce and protect \nthe constitutional right to bear arms, a right with which he personally \nand strenuously disagrees?\n  Let me say, in conclusion, the Senate's advice and consent function \nrequires us to carefully review a nominee's career, to ask hard \nquestions, and to insist on satisfactory answers. I take this duty \nseriously, as I know all my colleagues do. With this nominee, I \nconclude that there are simply too many questions to which I have not \nyet heard a satisfactory answer.\n  Why would he recommend clemency for unrepentant terrorists?\n  Why would he recommend a pardon for a fugitive who made billions \ntrading with America's enemies? Did Mr. Holder know one of the men \nwhose clemency he recommended was linked to the murder of a U.S. sailor \nand, if so, did he communicate this to the White House? Why did Mr. \nHolder consult with Mr. Rich's prosecutors before recommending a \npardon? Why is President Obama asserting executive privilege to prevent \nMr. Holder from testifying about these commutations? Was Mr. Holder's \njudgment in the Rich and FLAN clemency decisions influenced by the \noutcome that he believed President Clinton wanted so badly? How can I \nexplain to Joseph Connor, whose father was killed in the 1975 bombing \nin lower Manhattan, that the man who never spoke to his family before \nchampioning clemency for the men responsible for his father's murder \nwill be the next Attorney General of the United States?\n  Does Mr. Holder appreciate the gravity of the threats and the \ncomplexity of the legal issues posed by the war on terror? Can Mr. \nHolder be counted on to support and defend the constitutional right to \nkeep and bear arms?\n  I can't answer these questions with any degree of certainty. I regret \nto say I will vote against the nomination of Eric Holder to be the next \nAttorney General.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               Obama AG Pick Defended Guantanamo Policy)\n\n                            (By Matt Apuzzo)\n\n       Washington. Nov. 22, 2008--President-elect Barack Obama's \n     choice to become the next attorney general, Eric Holder, once \n     defended the Bush administration's arguments for holding \n     detainees at Guantanamo Bay, a position that runs counter to \n     his more recent comments--and to a signature policy of the \n     incoming administration.\n       Holder, a confidant to Obama on legal issues, recently has \n     been a leading voice in the chorus calling to close \n     Guantanamo Bay, which he has described as an international \n     embarrassment. Likewise, Obama has called\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\n     it a ``sad chapter in American history,'' pledged to close \n     the island prison and criticized the Bush administration for \n     arguing that terrorism suspects aren't covered by standards \n     set by the Geneva Conventions.\n       But in the months after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, \n     Holder defended the Bush administration's policies at \n     Guantanamo.\n       Asked whether terrorism suspects could be held forever, \n     Holder responded: ``It seems to me you can think of these \n     people as combatants and we are in the middle of a war,'' \n     Holder said in a CNN interview in January 2002. ``And it \n     seems to me that you could probably say, looking at \n     precedent, that you are going to detain these people until \n     war is over, if that is ultimately what we wanted to do.''\n       Just weeks later, Holder told CNN he didn't believe al-\n     Qaida suspects qualified as prisoners of war under the Geneva \n     Conventions.\n       ``One of the things we clearly want to do with these \n     prisoners is to have an ability to interrogate them and find \n     out what their future plans might be, where other cells are \n     located,'' said Holder, the former deputy attorney general \n     during the Clinton administration. ``Under the Geneva \n     Convention, you are really limited in the amount of \n     information that you can elicit from people.''\n       Holder said it was important to treat detainees humanely. \n     But he said they ``are not, in fact, people entitled to the \n     protection of the Geneva Convention. They are not prisoners \n     of war.'' He also downplayed criticism that prisoners were \n     being mistreated.\n       ``Those in Europe and other places who are concerned about \n     the treatment of al-Qaida members should come to Camp X-ray \n     and see how the people are, in fact, being treated,'' he \n     said.\n       Those were essentially the arguments of the Bush \n     administration. Since then, those arguments have been \n     criticized by human rights groups, leading Democrats, and \n     Holder himself.\n       ``We must close our detention center in Guantanamo Bay,'' \n     Holder told the American Constitution Society this summer. \n     ``A great nation should not detain people, military or \n     civilian, in dark places beyond the reach of law. Guantanamo \n     Bay is an international embarrassment.''\n       Holder added that he never thought he'd see the day where \n     the ``Supreme Court would have to order the President of the \n     United States to treat detainees in accordance with the \n     Geneva Convention.''\n       Those comments are in line with Obama's views. Holder did \n     not return e-mail and telephone messages seeking comment \n     about his earlier interviews. Brooke Anderson, a spokeswoman \n     in Obama's transition office, restated Obama's commitment to \n     opposing torture.\n       ``Eric Holder shares that view,'' she said. ``The \n     president-elect has complete confidence that Eric Holder will \n     be an attorney general who will restore respect for the rule \n     of law and for our international commitments.''\n       Obama's advisers are crafting plans to close Guantanamo \n     Bay, release some detainees and bring others to the United \n     States to face trial. One unanswered question, however, is \n     what to do with detainees who could not be prosecuted in \n     criminal courts without jeopardizing national security.\n       The Justice Department under Holder almost certainly would \n     help answer that question.\n       In introducing Holder and other members of his national \n     security team, Obama said he welcomed differences of opinion.\n       ``I assembled this team because I am a strong believer in \n     strong personalities and strong opinions,'' he said. ``I \n     think that's how the best decisions are made.\n       ``I will be responsible for the vision that this team \n     carries out,'' Obama said, ``and I will expect them to \n     implement that vision once decisions are made.''\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, next week the Senate begins the debate \nof the so-called stimulus package. I wish to talk about that for a few \nminutes. It is $1.2 trillion of borrowed taxpayer money to be spent in \nan effort to help get our economy restarted. Here is my position on it, \nand I believe the position of most Republicans and of some Democrats. \nWe believe that in order for the stimulus to be effective, it should be \nreoriented on housing. First, fix the real problem: housing. If housing \nis restarted, if home values are stabilized, and if people are buying \nhomes, that will do more to help restart the economy than anything \nelse. Second, we should let people keep more of their own money. A true \nstimulus is permanent tax relief. If people have more of their own \nmoney in their pockets, they will have more confidence. They will be \nable to buy more. After reorienting toward housing, that will also help \nrestart the economy.\n  Since we are borrowing so much of this money, especially, we believe \nit ought to be oriented directly toward those items that would \nspecifically create jobs now. It should not go toward good sounding \nideas such as Head Start and Pell grants for college students that we \nmay want to take up later, maybe as early as the following week, in a \nregular appropriations bill. So that is our belief: reorient the \nstimulus toward housing, let people keep more of their own money, and \nget the stuff out of the bill that has nothing to do with creating jobs \nnow, in the next few months or in the first year.\n  We know Americans are hurting. Every single Senator knows that. Our \ncountry's economic turmoil is hitting every family where it matters, in \nthe family budgets. More than 860,000 properties were repossessed by \nlenders in 2008, more than double the 2007 level. Manufacturing is at a \n28-year low. Tennessee is a State that relies heavily on manufacturing. \nThe unemployment rate is 7.2 percent, too high. It has been higher. I \ncan remember at a time when I was Governor of Tennessee in 1982, the \nunemployment rate was 12 percent, but 7.2 percent is too high. There \nwere 1.9 million jobs lost in the last 4 months of 2008. The long-term \nunemployed, people out of work for 27 weeks or more, rose to 2.6 \nmillion in December of 2008. So there are a number of steps we need to \ntake as a government, and we have been taking them.\n  At a hearing this week, where the Presiding Officer and I are both \nmembers of the Budget Committee--and we probably agree those hearings \nwere excellent--Douglas Elmendorf, Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, reminded us of the steps the Government is already taking. The \nFederal Reserve negotiated the sale of Bear Sterns to JPMorgan Chase, \n$29 billion, to form a new limited liability company. Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, the agencies that guaranteed half the home loans in the \ncountry, were taken over by their regulator and the Treasury put up \n$100 billion to stabilize that situation. The Federal Reserve extended \n$60 billion in a line of credit to the American International Group, \nthe insurance company called AIG. We had a debate in October where on \nboth sides of the aisle, two-thirds of Republicans as well as many \nDemocrats voted to give the Secretary of the Treasury $700 billion to \ninvest in troubled assets or to use in a variety of ways to try to keep \nour economy from going straight down. It has gone down, but it didn't \ngo straight down; we believe this is partly because of the action the \nCongress and the President took at that time.\n  What we had was, in effect, a wreck on the highway. There is an old \nRoy Acuff song by that title. I think that is the best way to explain \nwhat was happening. It was like a wreck on the interstate outside \nKnoxville and suddenly traffic is backed up all the way to Lenoir City \nor even Kingston. One lane was the money for the bank loan, the next \nlane was the money for your auto loan, and the next lane was for \nmeeting payroll. As long as that wreck was on the highway, none of the \nmoney could get where it needed to go, and nobody could borrow on \nanything. It is better today than it would have been, but we still have \na deeply serious problem.\n  The law we passed in October temporarily raised the insurance for \ndeposits from $100,000 to $250,000. Steps were taken to guarantee money \nmarket funds. The Treasury, Federal Reserve, and Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation announced agreements with Citibank and Bank of \nAmerica. They created a liquidity program for the banking system.\n  The Federal Government, in all of its variety of agencies, has been \nvery busy since October using taxpayer dollars, where necessary, or the \nFederal Reserve balance sheet, or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \nfunds collected from banks to try to create a situation in which our \neconomy can restart.\n  We know, having visited with President Obama and his team of \nadvisers, that they are thinking of even more things we may need to do. \nBut next week in the Senate we will be talking about whether it is a \ngood idea to borrow $1.2 trillion and spend it as the Appropriations \nand Finance Committees\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\nhave recommended we spend it as a way of trying to restart the economy. \nWhat I am here today to say is: we believe there ought to be a \nstimulus, but we believe it ought to be reoriented toward housing, that \nit ought to be reoriented toward permanent tax cuts, and that we ought \nto take out of this so-called stimulus anything that doesn't stimulate \njobs now.\n  Let me try to give an idea of how much money $1.2 trillion is. It is \nmore money than we spent on the Vietnam war in today's dollars. This \ncomes from an article in Politico this week. It is more money than we \nspent on the invasion of Iraq. It is more money than we spent on the \nentire New Deal in today's dollars, and a lot more money than we spent \non the Marshall plan. It is nearly as much money as we've spent on NASA \never since it started. It is a lot more money than we spent going to \nthe Moon. This is a lot of money. We throw dollars around up here. \nYears ago Senator Dirksen said: A billion here, a billion there, sooner \nor later it adds up to real money. This is a trillion, a number that is \nhard for us to imagine. It is borrowed money, which I will get to in a \nmoment.\n  Let me give one example of how I have been trying to describe how \nmuch money $1.2 trillion is. The Presiding Officer was Governor of \nVirginia. I was Governor of Tennessee. I looked around the Budget \nCommittee the other day and almost every member there had been in State \ngovernment in one way or another. In other words, we used to deal with \nreal dollars. We couldn't print anything. At the end of the year, we \nhad to balance our budgets. Sometimes we had to veto $25,000 programs \nfor epilepsy. I had to do that in 1981, 1982, and 1983, when we had an \neconomic turndown. That is why this amount of money is hard for me to \nget my arms around. I think it is hard for most Americans.\n  Let me give you an idea about how much money it is. The previous \nGovernor of Tennessee, one who came after me, Governor Sundquist, \nthought we needed a State income tax. He recommended Tennessee should \nhave a State income tax. It was about 4 percent. It would have raised \nabout $400 million a year. There was never a more unpopular act in our \nState than the Governor Sundquist proposal that we have a State income \ntax. Many people said he was courageous for recommending it, but it was \nrejected. People wouldn't even invite him to dinner for a few months. I \nwould, but many other people wouldn't. That was $400 million a year. \nThe State of Tennessee will receive almost $4 billion of this money. I \nam sure it will make life easier for the current Governor and the \ncurrent legislature, but think about that. The State only collects \nclose to $12 billion a year in State tax dollars, and it is going to \nget $4 billion over the next 2 years from this so-called stimulus \npackage. This would be the equivalent of imposing about a 20-percent \nnew income tax on the people of Tennessee for 2 years to raise that \nsame amount of money. There would be a revolution in Tennessee if we \ndid this. That is the amount of money we're talking about.\n  We are not talking about giving the State of Tennessee $40 million or \n$4 million or $400 million. Its shortfall this year is $900 million, \nwhich is the worst it has ever had. We are talking about shipping $4 \nbillion of borrowed taxpayer money to Tennessee. My point is, that is a \nlot of money.\n  There is another aspect to this amount of money. I listed a number of \nthings that the Federal Reserve Board and the Congress have done to try \nto create a better economic situation, to get housing going, to help \nstabilize banks, and even to deal with automobile companies. Almost all \nof those dollars we used either came from the Federal Reserve Board, \nwhich is not part of the Federal budget, not part of taxpayer dollars, \nor it was an investment.\n  In Tennessee, people don't like the word ``bailout.'' It has come to \nbe right up there with the top number. I voted twice, because I thought \nour country needed it, first to give President Bush, then to give \nPresident Obama the amount of money he needed to actually invest in \nbanks or nonfinance companies so we could get the credit moving again. \nBut in that case, we were investing dollars. We were not spending \ndollars. We hope and believe that we will get almost all of those \ndollars back for the taxpayer. When those dollars are put in a bank, \nfor example, they pay 5 percent or 8 percent or even 10 percent \ninterest, in some cases, back to the taxpayer. Maybe we will lose some \nof that money, but we don't intend to. It is not our goal. That is the \npurpose of it, investment. In this case, this is money gone.\n  This is borrowed taxpayer dollars, more than $1.2 trillion. I get to \n$1.2 trillion because the Senate bill is $900 billion, and the interest \nover the next 10 years is another $300 billion. That is the real cost \nof the stimulus package over the next 10 years. It is borrowed money.\n  Let me go to the borrowed money part.\n  We print money in Washington. We Governors cannot. That is one of the \nadjustments you make when you come here. It just takes a little while \nto do, and I understand the difference. The truth is, there is a \nreasonable level of debt a strong industrial country such as the United \nStates can tolerate and still continue to grow. As the country grows, \nthe debt reduces as a percentage of our output.\n  While it might be important for the State of Tennessee, as we always \ndid, to balance our budget and almost never have any debt--and we did \nnot even have an income tax--the Federal Government structure is \ndifferent. I recognize that. But there is some reasonable limit to the \namount of debt we should have, and there are good reasons there is a \nreasonable limit to that.\n  I think it is important to understand exactly what the debt we have \nis. USA Today did a story last year that talked about each family's \nshare of Government debt and Government obligations. By \n``obligations,'' I mean what we owe for programs such as Medicare, what \nwe owe for Medicaid, what we owe veterans. It is real money. It is \nmoney we are obligated to pay. It comes down to more than $500,000 per \nfamily a year.\n  So I think the way to talk about this stimulus package is: Should we \nask every American family to increase their $531,000 debt in order to \nspend money for a stimulus package to try to restart the economy? I \nbelieve we should increase our debt for some purposes, such as \nrestarting housing or permanent tax cuts--that actually allows people \nto keep their own money. Or possibly increase our debt for programs \nthat would, perhaps, actually do things in the next 6 months or 12 \nmonths to stimulate the economy. There are roads, and bridges, and \nnational park maintenance that could happen right now that would create \njobs that would be genuinely stimulative. But that is a very severe \ntest we should ask the American people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the USA Today article \ndetailing the obligation every American family owes be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Now, there is another problem of running up too much \ndebt. At the hearing where the Acting President pro tempore, the \nSenator from Virginia, and I were at earlier this week, I asked a \nquestion of the three witnesses: What can we learn from the rest of the \nworld about how much debt is too much debt for the United States of \nAmerica? The general answer was, today our debt is measured at about 40 \npercent of our annual gross domestic product. The estimates they gave \nsuggested if the stimulus packages and if the other things that are \ngoing on continue to happen, we will be up to 60 or 70 percent of GDP. \nIf the entitlement growth--the automatic spending we have in the \nGovernment from Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--keeps growing, \nand we keep adding at the rate we are doing, we will soon be at 100 \npercent of GDP. In other words, every year, government debt could equal \neverything we produced in this great country of ours--which produces 25 \npercent of all the wealth in the world every single year. We forget how \nfortunate we are. Twenty-five percent of all the wealth in the world, \nevery single year, is produced in the United States of America and \ndistributed among just 5 percent of the people in the world, which is \nus, those of us who live here. So we would have to take all that \nproduction for a whole year and use it to pay off our national debt.\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\n  Those economists who were testifying before us said that is too high. \nForty percent is OK. They thought 60 percent is getting into a little \nbit of a problem. Eighty percent is too much, and 100 percent is a real \nproblem. The practical problem is, as that number goes up--for example, \nas the entitlement spending goes up and other debt goes up--it squeezes \nout our ability to do anything else. I worked last year across party \nlines with Senator Bingaman and many others, and Senator Warner worked \nin the private sector in this way, to try to do something about \nAmerican competitiveness. We put into the law that we needed to double \nour investments in scientific research, and if we wanted to keep this \nhigh standard of living, we have a lot of work to do in high \ntechnology.\n  If we keep spending all the money on welfare, Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, and debt, we are not going to have anything left for \nthe great universities in the country on a yearly basis or for \ninvestments in our future. Those are annual investments. We will be \nsqueezing them out. That is another problem with debt. With a lower \ndebt, we have more money for not just the investments in our future but \nfor our national parks, our clean air, and the other things we need to \ndo to have a desirable country.\n  Let me go back to the stimulus package and ask: What do we need to \ndo? We need to, in the words of Senator Gregg--and I believe it is fair \nto characterize Senator Conrad, the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nin the testimony this week--we need to reorient the stimulus package \ntoward real estate, toward housing, and toward credit having to do with \nbanks. First, fix the problem: housing.\n\n       Every big mess has a way into it, and I believe--and many \n     on this side, and I think some on the other side also \n     believe--the way into it is housing. How would one fix that? \n     Well, one suggestion by Glenn Hubbard--former chairman of the \n     Council of Economic Advisors and now at Columbia University \n     is have the Treasury back, for a period of a year or 18 \n     months, a 4-percent, 30-year fixed rate mortgage for \n     creditworthy customers.\n\n  In other words, a bank in Nashville would say to you, if you are \ncreditworthy: We will give you a 30-year mortgage at 4 percent. If \ntoday's prevailing rate were 5.2 or 5.3 percent--which it is in the \nmarketplace--the Government would make up the difference, and it would \nprobably guarantee the loan. That would create a new demand for \nhousing.\n  I was talking with someone in the mortgage business yesterday who \npointed out that for one of our large lenders in America, when the \nrates went down naturally after the Federal Reserve action a few weeks \nago, the number of mortgages issued by that bank quadrupled.\n  So if we were to say to the American people: If you are creditworthy, \nyou can buy a house; you can get a 4-percent mortgage for a principal \nresidence, and we are going to keep that option open for a year. That \nwill cost us some money. That could be part of this stimulus. It would \ncreate demand in housing. It would create liquidity. It would get banks \nlending. We believe it would make a real difference. It would be a \nbetter way to start the stimulus package.\n  A second idea, as Senator Isakson and others have suggested, is to \ncreate a tax credit for home buyers. We would say $15,000. So if you \nare sitting around thinking today, well, homes in Richmond have \nactually gotten down to a pretty good level, and I like that house--you \ncould get a $15,000 tax credit when you buy the house, and when you \nfile your income tax return, you get $15,000 back. This is real money, \nand you do not have to pay it back. If you had a combination of a 4-\npercent mortgage and a $15,000 tax credit for the next year, maybe we \ncould get housing stabilized, maybe we could get demand stirring, and \nmaybe we could get people confidence that there is liquidity in the \nmarket. That might not solve every problem, but it is the place to \nstart. We would say first, fix housing. That is the way to restart \nthe economy.\n\n  Senator Gregg has suggested we take some of the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation's ideas about helping people who are stuck in \nhouses that are about to be foreclosed on and help to relieve those \nforeclosures. There may be a way for us to encourage servicers for all \nof these mortgages out across the country to modify the loans as some \nbanks are now doing. By modifying the loan, they simply say to you: \nWhat can you afford to pay? As long as you can pay that and pay the \ninterest on a regular basis, we will change the loan to fit you. That \nway there is no foreclosure. The loan does not go bad. The houses on \nthat same street do not go down in value because your house is \nforeclosed on. We suggest we should spend the next week talking about \nreorienting the money that we seek to spend to stimulate the economy on \nhousing first.\n  Second, we suggest the next component of a stimulus package should be \ntax relief that would help create jobs now. My own view is that \ntemporary tax relief is nice. I like having the money in my pocket, but \nit does not stimulate very much. Permanent tax relief, the economists \ntell us--money you can depend on for the future--builds confidence and \nstimulates the economy.\n  For example, the small business expensing provision, which would spur \ninvestments by doubling the amount that small business owners can \nimmediately write off on their taxes for capital investments and for \npurchases of new equipment in 2009. Another example is the bonus \ndepreciation provision, that would be helpful. Middle-class tax \nrelief--this is the permanent tax relief I was talking about--by \nlowering the 15-percent bracket to 10 percent and the 10-percent \nbracket to 5 percent. Those are examples of permanent tax relief or \nbusiness tax relief that could help create jobs now.\n  Third, we should not spend this kind of money on many of these \nprograms. We should not borrow this money when each family already owes \nover a half a million dollars. We should not borrow the money to spend \non programs we do not have to have. That is not a wise use of our \ndollars. We ought to take all of that out of this stimulus bill.\n  For example, there are small examples: buying new cars, money for \ncontraceptives, rehabilitating off-road trails, honey bee insurance. We \ncan find items like that which don't create jobs now. But the fact is, \nI am more concerned about the $190 billion of entitlement spending, the \nautomatic spending that is in this $1.2 trillion. Every estimate is \nthat $130 billion, $140 billion, $150 billion of that will never get \nout of the budget. The House put in almost $100 billion of new Medicaid \nspending for the States.\n  Well, Governors and legislators are going to like that except we are \nnever going to be able to reform the Medicaid Program. The Federal \ncontribution to it is so rich that States cannot afford to take a fresh \nlook at it. What is Tennessee going to do after it gets $2 billion--$1 \nbillion a year--for the Medicaid Program for the next 2 years and, \nthen, in the third year, gets zero of that money? That sort of money \nought not to be in a so-called stimulus package.\n  We need some truth in packaging. If it stimulates--and all of us can \nthink of things that do--then put it in; if it does not, keep it out. \nHistoric preservation fund grants, I love those, but they are not going \nto stimulate jobs in the next few months. Head Start, I was the \nprincipal sponsor of that. Pell grants, I was a college president. Next \nweek, after the stimulus, we will be talking about how much we can \nafford in our budget to increase those. Federal spending for Pell \ngrants has doubled in the last 6 years, but those things do not belong \nin a stimulus budget.\n  Some things do. There are highways that can be built. There are Corps \nof Engineers projects that can be completed. There are National Park \nService infrastructure projects that can be worked on next month. These \nare important improvement programs. That would help stimulate as well. \nWe should be able to make an intelligent distinction between those \nthings that can actually stimulate and those things that are just good-\nsounding things that we might vote for if we had the money and if we \ndid not have to borrow so much of it. That is our third suggestion \nabout what we should do.\n  One other suggestion--here is an area where we actually have \npotential, I believe, for bipartisan support. We should do something, \nwhen we debate the stimulus package, about automatic spending, \nentitlement spending, and by that we mean Social Security, Medicare, \nand Medicaid.\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, by the year 2015--not so far away--that will \nbe 70 percent of our budget. In other words, when we come here, we get \nto vote to appropriate 30 percent of the taxpayer dollars we spend \nbecause 70 percent is automatically spent on those entitlement \nprograms. That is forcing our debt up to 100 percent of gross domestic \nproduct.\n  We had a breakfast on Tuesday here, the bipartisan breakfast we have \non Tuesday mornings. It is a chance for us to get together across party \nlines. It was evenly divided, actually. There were 24 Members who came. \nThe whole subject was the Senator Conrad-Senator Gregg proposal to \ncreate a commission that would come up with a way to deal with Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid, and present it to us. We would vote \nit up or down, and some way we would be forced to deal with this \nentitlement growth problem.\n  Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, said in a speech a week ago \ntoday that he was ready to deal with the entitlement programs, but he \nwas disappointed it was not dealt with in the last 2 years. He pledged \nto President Obama he would give him more support on dealing with it \nthan the Democrats gave to President Bush during the last few years. \nYou will remember President Bush tried in the beginning of his second \nterm to deal with Social Security. He wanted private accounts. The \nDemocrats said no to private accounts. So they just went down their \nparallel tracks and never got anywhere. Somehow they never got together \nand said: Well, let's drop private accounts, or let's try to do this; \nwe can't do that.\n  President Obama has made clear he is serious about this. Senator \nMcConnell has made clear we are serious about it. We have a Conrad-\nGregg proposal. We had 24 Senators meeting last Tuesday. We are meeting \nagain next Tuesday. We believe something ought to be in this stimulus \npackage that at least begins the process of dealing with entitlements \nin the long term so we can say to the American people: Yes, we are \ngoing to borrow some amount of money--maybe hundreds of billions of \ndollars--to stimulate the economy, and we know it contributes to the \ndebt, but we are at least taking a step toward dealing with the long-\nterm excessive debt we are experiencing in our country.\n  Finally, after listening to the Budget Committee hearings this week, \nthe conclusion I came to was that I wish we were doing it all now. Here \nis what I mean by that. I spoke a little earlier about all the things \nwe have tried to do since October at the Washington level--some by \nCongress, some by the Federal Reserve, and some by the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation--to restart the economy. Whether it was dealing \nwith the banks or the auto companies or troubled assets, there has been \na lot of effort here.\n  After listening to the testimony in the Budget Committee, it seems \nperfectly obvious that we are going to have to do more. We are going to \nhave to do more in housing. We would like to suggest we at least start \naddressing housing in this stimulus package, but if we don't do it \nhere, President Obama and his team are going to have to recommend some \nsteps for us to take in housing because that is how you restart the \neconomy.\n  Everyone who looks at the Nation's banks and financial institutions \nknows we are going to have to do something there. We passed a bill in \nOctober called the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, providing \nmoney to Treasury to address troubled assets. We thought it was going \nto be used to go get those bad assets off of the bank balance sheets so \nthey could get back in good shape and lend again. That is what happens \nwhen banks fail or get in trouble. In normal times, the FDIC swoops in \nand takes the troubled assets out, sells them to another bank, and it \ncloses on Friday and opens on Monday. Depositors are protected, and \nsometimes stockholders lose, but we go on and barely notice it. \nHowever, that is not what the money we passed was used for. It was \nused, basically, to give money to banks to capitalize, and the reason, \napparently, was they were in such bad shape, they had to have it. So \nmaybe it wasn't a bad thing to do, but it wasn't what we thought was \ngoing to be done, and now we still have the problem of bad assets.\n  We asked the witnesses: How many troubled assets do we have in all of \nthese banks? They said $1 trillion or $2 trillion. I am not talking \nabout a stimulus package; I am talking about troubled assets in \nfinancial institutions in the United States. We said: Well, then, what \nare we supposed to do about that? They suggested that the ideas we are \nlikely to hear--they did not represent the administration, but the \nadministration is listening to many of the same people--was that they \nmay recommend, for example, some entity that will actually take the \ntroubled assets out of the banks at some price, and then the banks are \nfree to go ahead and with confidence start lending again. And we can \nstart borrowing again, the economy goes again, but then we still have \nthis entity over here. If it is going to buy $1 trillion or $2 trillion \nworth of bad assets, where does it get the money? Some of it is going \nto come from the taxpayers. How much of it? One witness said as much as \nwe can afford to put in. So maybe $500 billion, $600 billion, $700 \nbillion, $800 billion more dollars, not to spend as the stimulus \npackage does but to invest in assets that we hope to sell for at least \nas much as we paid for them. That could happen. We might lose some \nmoney, we might make some money, but we are not spending it. But it is \na lot of money, and it is taxpayers dollars, and there will be a lot of \nconcern in Virginia and in Tennessee and in every State when we have to \ndo that on top of what we have done before--on top of this stimulus. So \nwhy aren't we considering that today? Why aren't we considering that \nbad bank or what we are going to have to do about troubled assets?\n  So I think a better way to do it would be to say: Let's bring in the \namount of money for troubled assets--is it $500 billion?--let's bring \nin the money to reorient toward housing, $200 billion or $300 billion, \nand then let's see what projects really do stimulate. Let's do it all \ntogether, and then let's see how much money we are talking about so \nthat we are not surprised and the people we represent are not \nsurprised. I would like to see us do it all at once.\n  So next week in the Senate is a very important week. There is a good \ndeal of talk about bipartisanship. We appreciate President Obama's \nefforts on that. In my view, he and his team have been genuine in their \noutreach to Republicans. Just because we don't agree with their ideas \ndoesn't mean there is not a bipartisan spirit here. And as time goes \non, maybe we will get into a situation where even though the Democrats \nhave enough votes to pass most bills and we have enough votes to stop \ncold some bills and to slow down any bill, that is not the way we work. \nIf we come up with a better idea, maybe the majority will adopt it and \ncreate a bill that builds confidence in the country.\n  President Bush technically didn't need Congress's approval, except on \nappropriations, to wage the war in Iraq. Some of us thought it would be \nbetter if he had it, though, so Senator Salazar and I, along with 17 \nSenators and about 60 House Members across party lines, suggested that \nwe adopt a resolution approving the principles of the Iraq Study Group \nas a way to conclude the war in Iraq honorably. President Bush didn't \nlike that, and Majority Leader Reid wouldn't bring it up for a vote. We \nmight have been the only group that unified Senator Reid and President \nBush on the Iraq war, but we couldn't get it done.\n  I think it is a shame we couldn't because Secretary Rice and \nSecretary Gates told me not long ago they thought where we were going \nto end up in Iraq under Secretary Gates' administration is about where \nthe Iraq Study Group said we should. If we had adopted that as a \nCongress, perhaps the war would have been easier, and our enemies would \nhave gotten a clearer message, and our troops would have gotten more \nsupport, and President Bush would have had a more successful \nPresidency.\n  So we won the election, and we passed the bill. That is the recipe \nfor passing many bills, but it is not the recipe for a successful \nPresidency. I think President Obama knows that, and that is why he has \ngone out of his way to visit with us and talk with us. I hope--with the \nstimulus package, with entitlements coming down the road and health \ncare plans coming down the road--that the ideas we have\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\non this side of the aisle, if they are good, are adopted on the other \nside of the aisle and we genuinely can work together in a legislative \nway. I think that can happen, and I would like for it to happen \nstarting next week.\n  Next week is important for the Senate and important for the American \npeople. We on the Republican side of the aisle believe we need a \nstimulus package, but we believe it needs to be the right stimulus \npackage.\n  First, it should fix the problem, and the problem is housing. That \nwould help restart the economy. And we have specific ideas about how to \ndo that which I have suggested.\n  Second, we should let people keep more of their own money. That means \npermanent tax cuts. That is a way to build confidence.\n  Third, because we are borrowing this extraordinary amount of money \nand because we have other requirements for borrowed dollars, we should \nbe very careful about what we borrow and what we spend it for and only \nspend it for those items that genuinely stimulate the economy and \ncreate jobs in the very near term. That is the truth in packaging.\n  If we adopt those three principles, then I think there will be \ngenuine bipartisan support next week for a stimulus. If we don't, there \nwon't be. That is why we have the Senate. That is why we have the \ndebate. That is why I think we are here.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks an article by R.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record as well an article from the Wall Street Journal this week \ncalled ``A 40-Year Wish List'' as an example of the kinds of items that \nare in the stimulus bill that ought not to be if we are careful about \nthe money we are borrowing to spend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

That's \n     nearly $500,000 per household.\n       When obligations of state and local governments are added, \n     the total rises to $61.7 trillion, or $531,472 per household. \n     That is more than four times what Americans owe in personal \n     debt such as mortgages.\n       The $2.5 trillion in federal liabilities dwarfs the $162 \n     billion the government officially announced as last year's \n     deficit, down from $248 billion a year earlier.\n       ``We're running deficits in the trillions of dollars, not \n     the hundreds of billions of dollars we're being told,'' says \n     Sheila Weinberg, chief executive of the Institute for Truth \n     in Accounting of Chicago.\n       The reason for the discrepancy: Accounting standards \n     require corporations and state governments to count new \n     financial obligations, even if the payments will be made \n     later. The federal government doesn't follow that rule. \n     Instead of counting lifetime benefits for programs such as \n     Social Security, the government counts the cost of benefits \n     for the current year.\n       The deteriorating condition of these programs doesn't show \n     up in the government's bottom line, but the information is \n     released elsewhere--in Medicare's annual report, for example. \n     Since 2004, USA TODAY has collected the information to \n     provide taxpayers with a financial report similar to what a \n     corporation would give shareholders. Big new liabilities \n     taken on in 2007:\n       Medicare: $1.2 trillion.\n       Social Security: $900 billion.\n       Civil servant retirement: $106 billion.\n       Veteran benefits: $34 billion.\n       The multitrillion-dollar loss is a more meaningful \n     financial number than the official deficit, says Tom Allen, \n     chairman of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, \n     which helps set federal accounting rules.\n       Medicare has an unfunded liability of $30.4 trillion.\n       That means, in addition to paying all future Medicare \n     taxes, the government needs $30.4 trillion set aside in an \n     interest-earning account to pay benefits promised to existing \n     taxpayers and beneficiaries. The amount is sure to rise when \n     the oldest of 79 million baby boomers--62 this year--reach 65 \n     and become eligible.\n       Economist Dean Baker says the huge liabilities are \n     potentially misleading because future generations will have \n     greater income. ``If we fix health care, then our deficits \n     can be easily dealt with,'' he says.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 17, 2008]\n\nLow-Interest Mortgages Are the Answer--Stop the Decline in Home Prices, \n                            Stop the Crisis\n\n             (By R. Glenn Hubbard and Christopher J. Mayer)\n\n       Recent news articles suggest that the Treasury Department \n     is considering a plan to offer a 4.5% mortgage for home \n     buyers for a period of time. Let's hope it does. It would \n     help arrest the decline in house prices that is at the base \n     of the ongoing financial crisis and recession.\n       Raising the demand for housing makes sense now. While \n     fundamental factors clearly played a role in driving down \n     house prices that were at excessive levels two years ago, we \n     have argued in a paper (to be published in the Berkeley \n     Electronic Journal of Economic Analysis and Policy) that in \n     most markets house values are today lower than what is \n     consistent with the average level of affordability in the \n     past 20 years.\n       Nonetheless, without policy action house prices are likely \n     to continue falling, thanks largely to the meltdown in \n     mortgage markets and the weakening employment outlook. \n     Conversely, we see little risk that increasing the demand for \n     housing will touch off another housing bubble. And indexing \n     the mortgage rate to the Treasury yield could avoid this \n     outcome in the future. While the economy is contracting, low \n     interest rates would spur housing activity. When economic \n     activity improves, the U.S. Treasury yield and mortgage rates \n     would rise.\n       A 4.5% mortgage rate is not too low. The 10-year U.S. \n     Treasury yield closed at 2.3% on Dec. 12, 2008. Hence a 4.5% \n     mortgage rate is 2.2% above the Treasury yield, above the \n     1.6% spread that would prevail in a normally functioning \n     mortgage market.\n       Some have argued that lenders should earn more than the \n     average 1.6% spread, to compensate for the fact that housing \n     is a much riskier investment today. We don't think so. Recall \n     that a mortgage can be thought of as a risk-free bond plus \n     two possibilities that increase risk to lenders: default and/\n     or prepayment. Historically, the risk of default adds about \n     0.25% to the interest rate. The remaining spread of the \n     mortgage rate over the Treasury yield represents the risk of \n     prepayment and underwriting costs. With falling house prices, \n     the risk of default could indeed add 0.75% or more for a \n     newly underwritten and fully documented loan. But 4.5% would \n     be the lowest mortgage rate in more than 3o years--so the \n     additional risk to lenders of prepayment would be almost nil. \n     And low mortgage rates would substantially reduce the risk of \n     further house price declines.\n       Moreover, a 4.5% mortgage rate will raise housing demand \n     significantly. A simple forecast can be obtained by applying \n     the 2003-2004 homeownership rates to 2007 households. We use \n     the 2003-2004 home ownership rates because those were the \n     years of the lowest previous mortgage rates (the average \n     mortgage rate was 5.8%).\n       An increase in the homeownership rate from 67.9 (third \n     quarter, 2008) to 68.6 (the average rate from 2003-2004) \n     would increase homeownership by about 800,000 new homeowners. \n     If we also take into account the changing relative age \n     distribution of the population, there would be a total of 1.6 \n     million new homeowners. A simple statistical analysis \n     examining the impact of lower mortgage rates and higher \n     unemployment rates yields an even higher, and firmer, \n     estimate of 2.4 million additional owner occupied homes in \n     2009.\n       The increased demand for housing arising from lower \n     mortgage rates would provide a floor on further house price \n     declines. Estimates in our recent paper suggest that real \n     house prices increase by about 75% of the decline in after-\n     tax mortgage payments. So a decline in mortgage payments of \n     16% would result in approximately a 12% floor on the decline \n     in house prices.\n       Current futures markets suggest that house prices will \n     decline by 12%-18% in the next 18 months. So a 4.5% interest \n     rate might well lead to flat or even slightly higher house \n     prices in 2009.\n       Stabilizing house prices will likely improve consumer \n     confidence substantially. Increases in house prices relative \n     to where they would have gone with higher mortgage rates \n     would also provide a housing wealth effect--that is, higher \n     annual increases in spending as consumers feel richer--on \n     consumption of as much as $76 billion to $113 billion each \n     year.\n       The 4.5% mortgage rate that the Treasury is considering \n     also should be available for present homeowners who want to \n     refinance, because of the benefits for the economy as a \n     whole. We calculate that up to 34 million households would be \n     able to do so, at an average monthly savings of $428--or a \n     total reduction in mortgage payments of $174 billion. This is \n     a permanent reduction in payments and is thus likely to spur \n     appreciable increases in consumption.\n       Moreover, trillions of dollars of refinancings would retire \n     a large number of\n\n[[Page S1113]]\n\n     the existing mortgage-backed securities. This would reduce \n     uncertainty about the value of existing mortgage-backed \n     securities. It would flood the market with additional \n     liquidity that the private sector could deploy to other uses \n     such as auto loans, credit cards, commercial mortgages and \n     general business lending.\n       A reduction of mortgage interest rates to 4.5% (or, given \n     yesterday's Fed action, to a lower level) is superior to \n     other proposals that focus only on stopping foreclosures, or \n     on reforming the bankruptcy code to keep people in their \n     homes. Stopping foreclosures, however meritorious, may not \n     limit the dangerous decline in house prices as much as \n     proponents claim. It could work the other way. Stripping down \n     mortgage balances in bankruptcy would likely raise future \n     mortgage interest rates and lower the availability of \n     mortgages, reducing house prices.\n       Finally, a decrease in the mortgage rate, even though it is \n     intended be a temporary intervention in the present exigency, \n     plants a seed for future thought. Given the chaos of the \n     recent past, wouldn't a return to simple, 30-year fixed-rate \n     mortgages with a low rate be the right foundation for the \n     long-term future?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 28, 2009]\n\n                          A 40-Year Wish List\n\n       ``Never let a serious crisis go to waste. What I mean by \n     that is it's an opportunity to do things you couldn't do \n     before.''\n       So said White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel in \n     November, and Democrats in Congress are certainly taking his \n     advice to heart. The 647-page, $825 billion House legislation \n     is being sold as an economic ``stimulus,'' but now that \n     Democrats have finally released the details we understand \n     Rahm's point much better. This is a political wonder that \n     manages to spend money on just about every pent-up Democratic \n     proposal of the last 40 years.\n       We've looked it over, and even we can't quite believe it. \n     There's $1 billion for Amtrak, the federal railroad that \n     hasn't turned a profit in 40 years; $2 billion for child-care \n     subsidies; $50 million for that great engine of job creation, \n     the National Endowment for the Arts; $400 million for global-\n     warming research and another $2.4 billion for carbon-capture \n     demonstration projects. There's even $650 million on top of \n     the billions already doled out to pay for digital TV \n     conversion coupons.\n       In selling the plan, President Obama has said this bill \n     will make ``dramatic investments to revive our flagging \n     economy.'' Well, you be the judge. Some $30 billion, or less \n     than 5% of the spending in the bill, is for fixing bridges or \n     other highway projects. There's another $40 billion for \n     broadband and electric grid development, airports and clean \n     water projects that are arguably worthwhile priorities.\n       Add the roughly $20 billion for business tax cuts, and by \n     our estimate only $90 billion out of $825 billion, or about \n     12 cents of every $1, is for something that can plausibly be \n     considered a growth stimulus. And even many of these projects \n     aren't likely to help the economy immediately. As Peter \n     Orszag, the President's new budget director, told Congress a \n     year ago, ``even those [public works] that are `on the shelf' \n     generally cannot be undertaken quickly enough to provide \n     timely stimulus to the economy.''\n       Most of the rest of this project spending will go to such \n     things as renewable energy funding ($8 billion) or mass \n     transit ($6 billion) that have a low or negative return on \n     investment. Most urban transit systems are so badly managed \n     that their fares cover less than half of their costs. \n     However, the people who operate these systems belong to \n     public-employee unions that are campaign contributors to . . \n     . guess which party?\n       Here's another lu-lu: Congress wants to spend $600 million \n     more for the federal government to buy new cars. Uncle Sam \n     already spends $3 billion a year on its fleet of 600,000 \n     vehicles. Congress also wants to spend $7 billion for \n     modernizing federal buildings and facilities. The Smithsonian \n     is targeted to receive $150 million; we love the Smithsonian, \n     too, but this is a job creator?\n       Another ``stimulus'' secret is that some $252 billion is \n     for income-transfer payments--that is, not investments that \n     arguably help everyone, but cash or benefits to individuals \n     for doing nothing at all. There's $81 billion for Medicaid, \n     $36 billion for expanded unemployment benefits, $20 billion \n     for food stamps, and $83 billion for the earned income credit \n     for people who don't pay income tax. While some of that may \n     be justified to help poorer Americans ride out the recession, \n     they aren't job creators.\n       As for the promise of accountability, some $54 billion will \n     go to federal programs that the Office of Management and \n     Budget or the Government Accountability Office have already \n     criticized as ``ineffective'' or unable to pass basic \n     financial audits. These include the Economic Development \n     Administration, the Small Business Administration, the 10 \n     federal job training programs, and many more.\n       Oh, and don't forget education, which would get $66 billion \n     more. That's more than the entire Education Department spent \n     a mere 10 years ago and is on top of the doubling under \n     President Bush. Some $6 billion of this will subsidize \n     university building projects. If you think the intention here \n     is to help kids learn, the House declares on page 257 that \n     ``No recipient . . . shall use such funds to provide \n     financial assistance to students to attend private elementary \n     or secondary schools.'' Horrors: Some money might go to \n     nonunion teachers.\n       The larger fiscal issue here is whether this spending \n     bonanza will become part of the annual ``budget baseline'' \n     that Congress uses as the new floor when calculating how much \n     to increase spending the following year, and into the future. \n     Democrats insist that it will not. But it's hard--no, \n     impossible--to believe that Congress will cut spending next \n     year on any of these programs from their new, higher levels. \n     The likelihood is that this allegedly emergency spending will \n     become a permanent addition to federal outlays--increasing \n     pressure for tax increases in the bargain. Any Blue Dog \n     Democrat who votes for this ought to turn in his ``deficit \n     hawk'' credentials.\n       This is supposed to be a new era of bipartisanship, but \n     this bill was written based on the wish list of every \n     living--or dead--Democratic interest group. As Speaker Nancy \n     Pelosi put it, ``We won the election. We wrote the bill.'' So \n     they did. Republicans should let them take all of the credit.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there is a growing recognition in the \nCongress that the so-called spending stimulus bill is colossal in \nnature, and it is going to be moved through the Congress with little or \nno significant changes. Those of us who have been around a while can \nsee what is happening. The bill moved through committee. A lot of good \namendments and suggestions for change were made in the Appropriations \nCommittee, but none passed. A lot of ideas and suggestions were made in \nthe Finance Committee, and none were agreed to, at least none of any \nsignificance. There are provisions in the bill I would strongly support \nand believe should be part of a stimulus package because I think a \ntargeted, smart bill can help improve our economy, but it is not going \nto change the difficulties we are in, I am convinced of that.\n  Christina Romer, President Obama's top economist, has predicted that \nif we pass a stimulus bill, the unemployment rate will not reach quite \nso high. Her numbers were referred to in the Budget Committee, of which \nthe Presiding Officer, Senator Warner, is a member. Those numbers were \nbrought out, but even without any stimulus, she projected the \nunemployment rate would not reach 10 percent.\n  During the tough recession when President Reagan broke the \ninflationary spiral we were in, we hit almost 11 percent unemployment. \nThe Congressional Budget Office also projected that with no stimulus, \nthe unemployment rate would not reach 10 percent. When asked if the \nstimulus package would make it any better, Mr. Sunshine, the Acting \nDirector of the Budget Office at that time, said it might.\n  I think a stimulus package can help but I do not think a stimulus \npackage is going to change the fundamentals of this tremendous economy, \nwhich is going through a period of rebalancing and adjustment that is \npainful. It is not going to be bought away by throwing a few billion \ndollars or maybe even a trillion dollars at it.\n  I wish to make that point in general. We are in a tough time. We are \ngoing to go through a tough time. It is not going to be easy, but this \ncountry has gone through tough times before. We can hope and pray it \nwill not be as tough as the tough recession we had in the early to mid-\n1980s. We survived that. We developed some economic principles that \nended inflation, and we had 25 years of steady progress based on a \nsound dollar and sound economy. I guess I would say let's be a bit \nhumble in what we think we can accomplish.\n  I will add one more point. Politically, Presidents and Congress like \nto do something. When there is difficulty out there and the TV every \nnight is coming with some bad news stories and our constituents are \nworried, elected officials feel like they must do something; if we \ndon't do something, our constituents will get mad at us and vote us out \nof office. But what if the right thing to do is to not overreact?\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\nWhat if the right thing for America is to ask ourselves what it is that \ncan actually be of benefit, and let's do that. But let's not go hog-\nwild, let's not do some things that are going to do long-term damage to \nthe country. That is where we are. Good people can disagree on where \nthat line is drawn. A lot of people are talking about politics--\nRepublicans did not get this amendment or that amendment. I am beyond \ndiscussing those issues at this point. My view is: Is the stimulus bill \nthat is going to be moved in this Senate, which is even bigger than the \none in the House--it was $818 billion, I believe, in the House \nlegislation, and this one is already now at $888 billion. They added \n$70 billion for the AMT tax fix. So it is now almost $900 billion.\n  I am not sure how much thought we have given to it. We certainly have \nnot had extensive hearings on this legislation. That is where we are \nstrategically.\n  Let me say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the more \npeople look at this so-called stimulus bill, really a spending bill, \nthe more disastrous and the more flawed they are finding it to be. Most \nMembers of Congress, most Members of the Senate, I think, want to \nsupport a stimulus bill. They probably have made public statements that \nthey want to support a stimulus bill. But all of a sudden, people are \nsaying: Whoa, really? Is that much in it? This is in it? Only 3 percent \nof the money goes to roads? Really? I thought it was a roads bill. We \nare hearing that kind of talk. People are beginning to ask questions \nabout what is in the legislation that can spend $900 billion.\n  It doesn't just cost $900 billion. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas looked at it, as they are supposed to do. They are a nonpartisan \noffice. They give us good information on how much legislation costs, \namong other things.\n  Remember, every dime of spending, all of this $900 billion increases \nthe debt. We are already in debt. Any other dollar that is spent \nincreases the debt. So the $900 billion spending bill will increase the \ndebt in 10 years by $900 billion, and you have to ask yourself: Where \ndo we get that money? We have to borrow the money. And to borrow the \nmoney, we have to pay interest on it. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas calculated it. They didn't at first, but now they have. They \ncalculate $347 billion over the next 10 years, the budget period we are \nlooking at, will be expended by the American taxpayers to pay interest \non this debt. By the way, the deficit this year is the largest one in \nthe history of the Republic.\n  I will talk about the debt a little bit more because it is important. \nThere is no free lunch. Julie Andrews in ``The Sound of Music'' said \nnothing comes from nothing, nothing ever could. Debts will be repaid. \nYou think: Well, we may not repay these debts. We will have to, and we \nwill pay interest on it. We may succumb to the very pernicious \ntemptation to inflate the currency and pay back our debt with dollars \nless valuable than the ones we borrow today. That is what we call \ndebasing the currency. That is inflation. That is a corrosive situation \nthe country must not get into and has not been in for the last 25 \nyears. Those are the temptations we can fall into when the debt gets \ntoo great.\n  The argument is we want to have shovel-ready projects, and those \nshovel-ready projects will increase employment and will help us work \nour way through this recession. It is going to be longer than most \nrecessions. It is going to end, but it will be longer than most \nrecessions.\n  The message that has gone out is infrastructure is behind. Roads and \nbridges are not up-to-date. We need to spend money on them. Now would \nbe a good time to go into debt and borrow money and fix roads and \nbridges and that we would, therefore, be able to create jobs and have \nsomething concrete after it is all over.\n  I like building bridges because it is a concrete thing, and when it \nis over, people can benefit from it for generations to come. Unlike a \nlot of the Government programs that are in this bill, we spend billions \nand billions of dollars, and when it is over, we ask ourselves: Did it \ndo any good at all?\n  As I indicated, we now know the request for roads and bridges in the \n$900 billion stimulus bill amounts to around $30 billion--$15 billion \nthe first year, $15 billion the second. There is other infrastructure \nspending--on hospitals, school money, those kinds of things.\n  The idea that this is a roads and bridge bill is false. It is false. \nIt is not so.\n  In addition to that point, I note the Congressional Budget Office \nexamined the legislation to ask whether this spending we would be \nparticipating in would actually come forward quickly, as everybody says \nit must, to create jobs now and, therefore, help us ease the rising \nunemployment we are seeing.\n\n  CBO has found that only around 50 percent of the spending that is in \nthe legislation will occur in the first 2 years.\n  What about this year, the first year? But even over 2 years, only 50 \npercent of it is spent. The other 50 percent is going to be spent after \n2 years, in years 3, 4, 5. According to Ms. Romer, the President's top \nadviser on the economy, we will be coming out of the recession by then \nanyway without a stimulus package.\n  The programs, in addition to the construction projects and spending \nplans that are put together, have been poorly cobbled together in \nhaste. They have not been well thought out. There is no way they could \nhave been well thought out.\n  Three hundred economists, including three Nobel laureates, have \nsigned a petition condemning the stimulus plan as it is now written. \nMany of them would favor a stimulus plan, but when they look at this \none, they are aghast, and they are warning us that infrastructure \nspending has never successfully lifted a country out of an economic \nslowdown. There are many examples of that around the world. These \neconomists are saying that.\n  Marty Feldstein, an economist President Reagan admired and \nconservatives have admired and most Americans have admired, said at one \npoint he favored a stimulus bill. I think about $350 billion. He has \nnow written an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying this is bad; do \nnot pass this stimulus bill. He opposes it.\n  The Chamber of Commerce--I like the Chamber of Commerce. They are \ngreat folks. But if anybody thinks they are not self-interested does \nnot know what they do. They have a lot of Members who are going to \nbenefit from this program. They are going to get bucks out of it. They \nfavored a stimulus package sometime ago, and they said we need a \nstimulus package. Now they are saying they are not for this bill. They \nare opposing it, even though their members, a lot of them, are going to \nget bucks out of it. Because we are throwing a lot of bucks out there, \nand they are going to get some. Even they, in the interest of their \ncountry and the long-term vision for the economy, have concluded it is \nnot good for this country to pass the bill we are dealing with now.\n\n  The bottom line is that I am convinced now that the extreme long-term \ncost of this legislation outweighs any short-term benefits. And \nremember, the $1.2 trillion, the $900 billion plus the interest on it \nthat CBO has calculated--and it is only right that they do so--comes on \ntop of a $700 billion bank/Wall Street bailout that proved ineffectual, \nhas not been successful. We are being told now--and President Obama met \nwith the Republicans in a very nice discussion, and the President \nacknowledged that they are going to have to be coming back and asking \nfor more Wall Street money not that many weeks from now. So we are not \nthrough yet with throwing taxpayers' money into this vortex.\n  The surge in debt and reckless spending that we have seen in the last \nyear, from both parties, is unlike anything this Nation has ever seen \nin its history, yet there has been such little serious discussion about \nwhere the money is going, how we are going to account for it, and \nwhether we will receive a legitimate benefit from it. It is amazing to \nme. So I think we have to reconsider the size and the nature of this \nlegislation. We cannot do this. It is bad for America. It is not a \nquestion of Republicans and Democrats and that kind of thing. I know \nthe conventional wisdom is we have to do something; if we don't do \nsomething, people will be mad at us; if we don't do something and the \neconomy gets worse, they will say: You didn't do anything, you stupid \ngoof. You sat on the sideline and didn't do anything. But I have to \nsay, at some\n\n[[Page S1115]]\n\npoint you can do too much and you can do things that are unwise, and \nthat is what we are paid to decide here.\n  So I am committed, and I will do what I can, to defeat the bill as \nwritten. I will support a more targeted, cost-effective, temporary plan \nthat can help our economy, but it must be done at a price we can \nafford.\n  I am going to talk in a minute about the size of the deficit we are \nfacing. As a member of the Budget Committee, I know it is a grim \ndiscussion. I have concluded that this is a fight for the very \nfinancial soul of our country. I mean, what is it we are doing here? \nAre we fulfilling our responsibilities to watch over the taxpayers' \nmoney? Presidents can't spend money if we don't appropriate it. Every \ndime President Bush spent on the Wall Street bailout, we gave to him. \nEvery dime President Bush spent on sending out those checks last spring \nthat were supposed to stop the recession went to the debt. It increased \nour debt, causing us last year to have the biggest deficit in the \nhistory of the Republic. It didn't work, but we gave the money. It is \nnot President Bush who did it; we funded it. And no stimulus spending \nbill is going to get passed and no money is going to be available to be \nspent unless Congress spends it. It is our responsibility. We can't \npass it off on President Obama.\n  Let me show this chart. As a member of the Budget Committee who has \ndealt with these issues for a number of years, this chart is where my \nmind is, if you want to know the truth. In 2004, after that recession, \nwhen President Bush cut taxes and did some other things--I think he \neven sent out some stimulus checks in that period of time--the deficit \nthat year amounted to $413 billion. That is how much we spent that year \nmore than we took in, in 2004. It was the largest number we had ever \nseen. And he was pummeled by the loyal opposition, my Democratic \ncolleagues, for wasteful spending and for putting us in deficit and \nthat kind of thing, and some of that was justified, in my view.\n  In 2005, the deficit dropped about $100 billion. It dropped to $318 \nbillion. In 2006, it dropped to $248 billion. In 2007, a year and a \nhalf ago, it was $161 billion. We were heading in the right direction. \nI began to feel better about the country. Last spring, we sent out $160 \nbillion in checks to try to stop this economic slowdown, and that \nvirtually doubled the deficit. We came in, September 30 of last year, \nwhen the fiscal year ended, the deficit was $455 billion--the largest, \nI think, ever, but certainly the largest since World War II--and we \ndidn't hear much talk about that. The Congressional Budget Office is \nour expert office on this, and we now see that they have estimated that \nwithout the stimulus package, without the stimulus bill, the deficit \nthis year will be $1.2 trillion, more than twice the highest deficit in \nthe history of the Republic. To give you some idea of how much money we \nare talking about, imagine all the income tax payments that come to our \ncountry from individuals. That amounts to $1.1 trillion. Right here, \nwithout the stimulus, we are at $1.2 trillion, equal to the entire \nrevenue from the income tax in America. With the stimulus package, CBO \nestimates it will be just over $2 trillion, and that does not include \nthe interest that will be accumulated on it.\n  That $1.2 trillion deficit that they are projecting now includes \n$200-plus billion for the Wall Street bailout, and they are also \nincluding about $240 billion for the Freddie and Fannie financial \nbailout, those huge institutions that bought up these bad mortgages and \nthen we bailed them out. That is what helps drive the number. Next \nyear, they are projecting $703 billion and then $498 billion--all of \nthose bigger than any in previous history, and we will be seeing some \nadditional expenditures there.\n  For example, this $703 billion does not include the alternative \nminimum tax fix, which costs $70 billion a year. I think most of my \ncolleagues probably know this, but I see some new Members of the Senate \nhere, so to tell you all how we gimmick the system, the alternative \nminimum tax is $70 billion a year to fix it. Everybody knows we are not \ngoing to allow it to kick in and hit the American economy at the full \namount. So why don't we go on and fix it permanently and set a rate? \nBecause CBO will score it. And if we score it for $70 billion a year, \nfor a 10-year budget, that is $700 billion. So we pass a law that fixes \nit for 1 year, and the next year, when they calculate the debt, they \nassume we are going to have $70 billion more in revenue from the \nalternative revenue tax. But we are not going to have that money \nbecause we are going to fix it again. There are a lot of gimmicks in \nhere, so those numbers are going to be a lot higher. I know this. I \nhave been here, and I know how the system works.\n  Finally, I will add one more thing to the discussion, and that is the \ninterest on the debt. We are now a little under $200 billion a year in \npaying interest on the debt. The debt has been growing. I think it is \nabout $10 trillion. In the next 10 years, the estimates are it could be \n$21 trillion in debt--the total debt of America. This bill, by the way, \nraises the debt limit. It has to, because we are adding another \ntrillion dollars in debt. The Congressional Budget Office scores that \nin 2014--5 years from now--the interest on the debt will not be $200 \nbillion, but counting the stimulus package it will be around $430 \nbillion.\n  Now, how much money is that--$430 billion? Today, it is $200 billion, \nand 5 years from now it will be $430 billion. Big deal. But that is \nevery year, No. 1. It is every year. And to give some perspective on \nhow large that is, it is more than a third of the income tax revenue of \nthe entire U.S. Government from individuals, and it is a number that is \nalmost equal to the 5-year cost of the Iraq war. We have spent about \n$500 billion on the Iraq war in the 5 years that has occurred. That has \nbeen a major expense of the U.S. Government, and it has been very \npainful to us. People have been not happy about it. But by surging this \ndebt, we will in the future be incurring an interest payment almost \nequal every year to the 5-year cost of the Iraq war.\n  So I say to my colleagues, I know the momentum has been going \nforward. I know the House moved forward with the bill and people have \nexpected that we are going to pass it, but I am not sure. I think the \nAmerican people are getting concerned about this, and they are saying, \nlet's pare this down. Why can't we do a $200 billion or a $300 billion \ndollar stimulus package that will actually create jobs and won't add so \nmuch money to our deficit and will create things that are of permanent \nvalue to the public, not providing relief to soldiers who fought with \nus in world wars and other programs that are in the legislation.\n  This is the beginning of a discussion, or it ought to be the \nbeginning of a national discussion about what this country is about. We \nneed to ask ourselves: Isn't it important that we have a sound \ncurrency? Shouldn't a sound dollar be one of the highest possible goals \nof the Congress? And to have that, aren't we, as a Congress, going to \nhave to be responsible enough to, in times of uncertainty and fear, be \nable to rationally think through this and do this right?\n  My 90-year-old aunt, who I was with last week in Alabama, said to me: \nYou all don't know what you are doing up there, do you? And I don't \nthink we do. I think that was as good a synopsis of what the American \npeople are thinking about us as anything I have heard. We don't know, \nand we have to get serious here. It is our responsibility. When we are \ntalking about trillions, we are talking about real money.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today with full and \nhumble appreciation for the critical scrutiny a Senator's maiden speech \nusually attracts. I am also aware of the somewhat forgotten tradition \nhere in which freshmen Senators took some considerable time before \nthrowing caution to the wind, opening their mouths, and hoping to \nenlighten their wiser and more experienced colleagues. That tradition \nlike many others has eroded over time, such that in recent years \nfreshmen Senators have taken to the floor early and often. I hope my \nwords today will not encourage a revival of the older tradition.\n  I am also aware that many new Senators use the occasion of their \nfirst speech to introduce a specific bill or to\n\n[[Page S1116]]\n\nspeak at length about pending legislation. I hope to do something \ndifferent today. I will not speak about specific legislation, but I \nwill speak about this moment in our country's history, the perils we \nface, and my sincere hope that we will address the critical issues of \nour time in a new way, with less rancor and with a shared commitment to \nbridge the partisan divide that has characterized so much of our recent \npolitical experience.\n  We have inaugurated a new President and a new administration, and a \nnew Congress is taking shape. These developments represent a fresh \nstart, a new start, one in which every American, regardless of party or \npolitical affiliation, can rejoice because if there were ever a time \nwhen our country hungered for a fresh start, it is here and it is now.\n  The American people are impatient with politics, and with good \nreason. Our country is facing significant peril. More of our fellow \ncitizens are losing their jobs and their homes. Credit is drying up. \nBusinesses, large and small, are cutting back. Americans have seen the \nvalue of their college and retirement savings plans reduced \ndramatically. We may be facing the most significant and difficult \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n  This has put me in mind of a great and courageous predecessor, \nSenator Edward Costigan, who served here, from Colorado, from 1931 to \n1937, the very depths of the Great Depression. I have reverence for \nSenator Costigan because he was born of the progressive tradition of \nthe West--a tradition the Udall family has participated in over many \ngenerations. Senator Costigan is largely remembered for his effort to \npass an antilynching law at a time when people of color were under a \nconstant threat of mob violence. He was also a champion of economic \nreform.\n  I found it interesting that Senator Costigan, in this Chamber in \n1932, spoke on behalf of a stimulus bill--which was then called a \nrelief bill--using words that are eerily relevant 76 years later. \nArguing for the bill, Senator Costigan said:\n\n       One almost despairs of the ability of America's industrial \n     and political generals to save America in its present crisis. \n     . . .\n\n  Thankfully, we have not reached a point of economic collapse anything \nlike that which occurred when Senator Costigan spoke. But Americans who \nhave lost their jobs or their savings know this crisis is every bit as \nreal and every bit as devastating.\n  This current crisis is made worse by our continued addiction to oil \nand our dangerous dependence on foreign oil in particular. While the \nglobal market price of oil and gasoline dropped remarkably from record \nhighs of last year, no one should be under any illusion that this price \nslide will continue. Continued instability in the Middle East, combined \nwith ever-increasing demand in China, in India, and other global \nmarkets, will inevitably mean that the price of oil will rise. We have \nnot seen the end of the energy crisis that crippled our economy last \nsummer. We did survive the first wave of this energy tsunami, but we \nmust prepare for the waves to come.\n  This economic crisis is also made more perilous by the fact that our \ncountry is still engaged in two unfinished wars. Mr. President, 150,000 \nof our best and bravest are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our Army \nhas been stretched to the breaking point, and our national security \ndepends on implementing a new strategy that includes rebuilding our \ndefense capability.\n  Elsewhere in the world, in North Korea, in Gaza, in the winding \nalleys of Pakistan, in the shadowy corridors of power in Iran, we face \nthreats from new enemies, the risks of widening conflict, and the \ngravest danger of all in the new century--the potential for a nuclear \nweapon to fall into the hands of terrorists.\n  David Sanger points out in his compelling book, ``The Inheritance,'' \nthat America's response to 9/11 has not been without strategic error. \nAmerica's position in the world, military and economic, has been \nweakened at the very moment we need to lead the world.\n  This list of challenges is daunting, and it does not include other \npressing problems bearing down on us, such as the escalating cost of \nhealth care, a Federal budget deficit that threatens to wash away the \nfoundation for our children's economic future, illusive solvency for \nkey programs such as Medicare and Social Security, a broken immigration \nsystem, and mounting evidence that global climate change is threatening \nour natural environment.\n  In addition to losing influence on the world stage and struggling to \nrestore a wrecked economy, in addition to Iraq and Afghanistan, we may \nalso have a third war on our hands--this one with Mother Nature. If \nMother Nature fails, our list of challenges will seem small by \ncomparison.\n  The question, then, before us is, Will this be a moment of anxiety or \noptimism? In truth, I believe it is both. The challenges we face are \namong the most significant ever faced by a new President and Congress.\n  Although I join the Senate as a proud western Democrat, buoyed by the \nsuccess my party enjoyed in the last election, I think it would be a \nterrible mistake to see the challenge of this moment in purely partisan \nterms. The problems we face are not Democratic or Republican problems, \nthey are American problems, and they will only be met by American \nsolutions. Much lipservice is given to the idea of bipartisanship and \nthe notion of working across the aisle. Frankly, I have to tell you, I \nthink it is cynicism to breathe life and action into these words that \nhamstring us.\n  Like many of you, I was serving in the Congress on 9/11. That tragedy \nawakened a deep spirit, a deep spirit of shared purpose. I call it the \nspirit of 9/11, in the best sense of that term. I want to invoke it \nhere, not to use it as a patriotic bludgeon but to remind us how it \nfelt to know our country had been attacked and that we were united in \nour response and in our resolve. If there were ever a time when we \nneeded to recapture that spirit of 9/11, it is now. Surely we do not \nneed another tragedy to unite us in that common response and resolve. \nWe need only look ahead at the deep challenges we face.\n  I am comforted by our history. A reading of our history shows that we \nhave been through worse. We have endured a terrible Civil War, two \nworld wars, and an economic catastrophe of far greater dimension. With \neach successive American generation, we have worked to cleanse the \nNation from the stain of slavery, bigotry, and racial prejudice. With \neach successive generation, we have grown wiser, more enlightened, and \nmore prosperous. We have seen the great middle class lifted and engaged \nin building the strongest and most creative economy the world has ever \nseen. So if history is our guide, I know we will meet the challenge of \nthis moment.\n  As a son of the West, I am also proud of our special history. Of \ncourse, every region of America has a story to tell and a contribution \nto make to the whole. Among many qualities in the West, we particularly \ntreasure independence and we have little time for brooding pessimism. \nThe great western writer Wallace Stegner put it best when he wrote \nabout the people he called ``stickers,'' those who settled the West \nagainst all odds and obstacles. He called them stickers because they \nwere not quitters and they did not leave the scene of a challenge. They \nstuck to the land because of their spirit, their courage, and their \nhopes for a better community in which to raise their children--and, to \nbe honest, because they were too doggone ornery to give up.\n  We are a country of stickers, and now it is up to the 111th Congress \nto be stickers too. The American people have vested their hopes and \naspirations in us, to serve them well in the institutions of democracy \nwe call the Congress.\n  As I close, I want to return to my predecessor in this seat, Senator \nEdward Costigan, and his long fight against the evil of lynching. In a \nspeech on this subject in 1935, he expressed the hope that partisan and \nsectional division would give way to a true common purpose. He said:\n\n       Ours is truly at last a new South, a new North, a new East, \n     and a new West, unitedly building a new America of common \n     humanity, guarded by just and ever more equal laws.\n\n  Senator Costigan was calling for a new way of looking at the \npolitical challenge in his day, one that looked toward a uniting \npurpose. We have a similar calling today. We may often divide as \nRepublicans and Democrats on\n\n[[Page S1117]]\n\nwhat we think is best for our country. Debate is good. We should \nencourage a vigorous exchange of ideas and not fear disagreement. But \nwe ought always, always to strive for a common purpose.\n  I wish to express my deep thanks to my fell Coloradans who have given \nme the opportunity and honor to represent them here at this challenging \nand important time in our history.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/30/senate-section/article/S1117-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1117-S1118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the recent \ncollege football season and the success enjoyed by our own University \nof Utah football team.\n  First, I want to mention that a while back, during last week's \nfestivities, I had the opportunity to meet with members of the \nUniversity of Utah Marching Band as they were in town to march and \nperform in the inauguration parade.\n  I want to publicly recognize the members of the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter Day Saints in Ashburn, VA, who offered their homes to \nthese musicians and the band, allowing them the once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity to perform for the President of the United States of \nAmerica. The band would not have been able to make it to Washington had \nit not been for the generosity of these private citizens who housed \nthem and took care of them and fed them. I appreciate their willingness \nto help some of my follow Utahns.\n  My meeting with the band out in Ashburn reminded me of what a \nwonderful year it has been for sports fans in my State. I wish to once \nagain publicly extend my congratulations to the Utah Utes on an \noutstanding season.\n  On January 2, the Utes capped an undefeated season with a 31-to-17 \nvictory in the Sugar Bowl over a highly favored Alabama team. Under the \nscrutiny of the national spotlight, Utah played with poise and \nprecision, silencing the naysayers who claimed they could not compete \nwith a national powerhouse such as Alabama.\n  Alabama had been rated No. 1 much of the season. This was Utah's \nsecond undefeated season in 5 years, demonstrating that school's \nfootball team deserves to be considered among the country's elite \ncollege football programs.\n  In particular, I want to congratulate Coach Kyle Whittingham, who, on \nJanuary 13, was named National Coach of the Year by the American \nFootball Coaches Association. What an honor. Coach Whittingham took \nover the head coaching job at Utah 4 years ago, following what was, at \nthat time, the most successful season in school history. The \nWhittingham family is sort of a football institution in the State of \nUtah. So fans and alumni had high expectations about the future of the \nprogram, and Coach Whittingham has not disappointed them. In each of \nhis four seasons, the Utes have finished with a winning record and have \nwon a bowl game. In fact, the University of Utah has won a bowl game in \nsix consecutive seasons and, overall, they have been victorious in \ntheir last eight bowl appearances--the longest current streak in \ncollege football. Coach Whittingham has been on the staff that entire \ntime, first as defensive coordinator and now as the head coach.\n  The Utes have been lead on the field by quarterback Brian Johnson. He \ncapped an outstanding college career this past season by winning the \nMountain West Conference's Offensive Player of the Year Award. He was \nalso a finalist for numerous national quarterback awards. Brian's story \nis actually a very inspirational one. Late in the 2005 season, he \nsuffered what is, in many cases, a career-ending injury when he tore \nhis ACL. This injury forced him to sit out the entire 2006 season. \nThen, in the first game of the 2007 season, he was injured again and \nmissed two more games. But he was able to finish the season, leading \nthe Utes to a winning record and an impressive victory over Navy in the \nPoinsettia Bowl. He returned for his senior season, fully healed and \nready to take the team on his shoulders for what proved to be a \nhistoric season.\n  One of the most popular members of the Ute squad has been kicker and \npunter Louie Sakoda who, in each of the last three seasons, was the \nMountain West Special Teams Player of the Year and named to several \nAll-America teams. Nicknamed ``King Louie,'' this 5-foot-9, 178-pound \nteam captain is something of a celebrity in Salt Lake City. Last year, \nhe offered himself as a date for a campus charity auction and drew the \nhighest bid of any item on sale--though NCAA restrictions kept him from \nactually going on the date. His parents, according to news stories, can \njoin any pregame party in the parking lot outside Rice Eccles Stadium \nif they just mention their son's name. He has also lent his celebrity \nto an ad campaign started by Utah First Lady Mary Kaye Huntsman aimed \nat combating teenage drinking and driving. Louie can be seen in TV \ncommercials in Utah urging teens and anyone who's been drinking to \n``punt the keys.''\n  Indeed, the entire University of Utah football team has become the \ntoast of every town in my State--even among those who typically root \nfor the Utah's other fine football programs. They have also become one \nof the most talked about teams in college football nationwide.\n  Unfortunately, the success enjoyed by the Utah football team has been \nmarred somewhat by the controversy surrounding the Bowl Championship \nSeries. The Utes were the only football team in NCAA Division I to \nfinish the season 2008 undefeated. Their season included victories \nagainst a powerhouse team at Brigham Young University, Oregon State, \nTexas Christian University, and Alabama, all of which finished the \nseason ranked in the Associated Press Top 25--the latter two in the Top \n10. In fact, Alabama spent much of the regular season ranked number one \nin the country before losing to Florida near the end of the season.\n  Yet despite these accomplishments, even with its perfect record and \nimpressive schedule, the University of Utah finished the season ranked \nsecond in the country. Florida, the team that won the so-called BCS \nChampionship Game, had a very good year. But unlike Utah, they were not \nundefeated; they had one loss, as did at least three other teams in the \ncountry. Yet under the BCS system, this unbeaten Utah team was denied \nan opportunity to even play for the national championship. One has to \nwonder what more Utah could have done with its season in order to get \ninto the national championship game. It is interesting that the former \nUtah coach under whom Coach Whittingham served, Urban Meyer, had a \nchampionship team. We all admired him. He was a great coach at Utah and \none of the greatest coaches in America today. Unfortunately, the answer \nto this question is even more disheartening than the question itself: \nnothing. The fact of the matter is that the Utah team was left out of \nthe national championship picture, not due to any competitive \nshortcoming, but because the BCS system categorically excluded them \nfrom consideration.\n  Under the BCS, the champions of six athletic conferences receive \nautomatic bids to play in the five most lucrative and prestigious bowl \ngames. Collectively, those six conferences include 66 of the 119 teams \nin NCAA Division I football. So, in short, nearly half of all college \nfootball teams begin the season virtually left out of the BCS picture, \nyet the BCS still wants to call the winner of its championship game the \n``national champion.'' I don't know about you, Mr. President, but that \nstrikes me as odd.\n  Of course, it needs to be acknowledged that teams from non-BCS \nconferences can play their way into a BCS game. The University of Utah \ndid so both this year and in 2004. In other years, teams from Boise \nState and Hawaii have earned bids to play BCS bowl games. But in doing \nso, these teams had to overcome serious competitive disadvantages. For \nexample, it is virtually impossible for a school from a non-BCS \nconference to get a BCS bid without going undefeated in the regular \nseason, and even that is not a guarantee. Yet this past season, each\n\n[[Page S1118]]\n\nof the six BCS conference champions had at least one regular season \nloss--three of them had two or more. Two non-BCS teams--Utah and Boise \nState--were undefeated after the 2008 regular season. In addition, \nTexas Christian University, another non-BCS team, had only one loss and \nwas higher in the BCS rankings than two of the conference champions \nwith automatic berths. Yet of these three teams, only Utah was invited \nto play in a BCS game.\n  These are the disadvantages non-BCS teams must face just to get into \none of five prestigious BCS bowl games. While mere participation is an \nuphill battle, the system makes it virtually impossible for a non-BCS \nteam to win the national championship. The BCS relies on a combination \nof polls and computer formulas to determine its rankings. For decades, \nthese polls have almost invariably tended to favor teams from the \nbigger BCS conferences, evidenced by the fact that no team from an \noutside conference has finished a season atop a major college football \npoll since 1984. So unless a team from a non-BCS conference begins the \nseason with a very high national ranking in the polls, they stand \nvirtually no chance of getting ranked high enough to play in the \nchampionship game, even if they go undefeated. This system excludes \nteams like this year's Utah team, which began the season unranked and \nspent the season shocking opponents and exceeding expectations, from \nnational championship contention.\n  The flaws of the BCS system might not be so bad if it helped to clear \nwhat traditionally had been a muddled national championship picture. \nBut unfortunately, that is not the case. In at least 6 out of the last \n10 years, there has been substantial controversy over the selection of \nthe teams to play for the championship. So the system is not only \nbiased, but ineffective as well.\n  Mr. President, the BCS system is anti-competitive, unfair, and, in my \nopinion, un-American. I am not just saying that because my team was \ntreated unfairly. I am making the case that many teams are not treated \nfairly. In no other sport in this country are champions selected by \narbitrary and biased polls and computer ranking systems. Much worse, \nthe BCS ensures that the millions of dollars paid to the participants \nof these prestigious games remain concentrated among a few elitist \nconferences. Such exclusionary practices put teams from non-BCS \nconferences at a monetary, recruiting and competitive disadvantage. \nThis may not only be unfair in the normative sense, it may very well \nviolate our nation's antitrust laws.\n  In 1984, in NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, \nthe Supreme Court determined that NCAA is not exempt from the \nrequirements of the Sherman Antitrust Act. That being the case, college \nfootball, like most other industries in this country, must conduct \nbusiness in a manner that does not intentionally stifle competition or \nsystemically favor specified competitors. Specifically, in the words \nthe Sherman Antitrust Act, no ``contract, combination, or conspiracy'' \nmay be undertaken to exclude competitors.\n  In my opinion, it is quite probable that the BCS violates the Sherman \nrequirements. In 2003, I chaired a series of Judiciary Committee \nhearings to investigate the antitrust implications of the BCS. I stated \nat that time that I believed the BCS was anticompetitive and in dire \nneed of reform. Shortly thereafter, the BCS added another bowl game \nand, to some extent, expanded the field of eligibility. However, as \nthis past season demonstrates, these changes leave much to be desired \nin terms of fairness and competition. Utah Attorney General Mark \nShurtleff shares this view and is consulting with lawyers and \ninvestigators to determine whether the BCS system constitutes an \nantitrust violation. Indeed, it appears that litigation over this \nmatter may be on the horizon. Also, on at least two separate occasions, \nPresident Obama has publicly stated his concern about the fairness of \nthe BCS and his hope to see the creation of a playoff system. \nTherefore, it is not unreasonable to predict that a Justice Department \ninvestigation into the potential antitrust violations of BCS will be \nforthcoming.\n  Mr. President, I would prefer that reforms take place without putting \nthe matter before the courts. In addition, given the many problems \nfacing our nation, I hope that the Justice Department will not have to \nget involved in this issue. And while some have proposed a legislative \nfix, this also would not be my preferred solution, though ultimately, \nthis may end up being the only effective means of addressing these \nproblems. Instead, I would hope that those with the power to change or \neliminate the BCS, including NCAA President Myles Brand as well as the \nuniversity presidents and the conference commissioners in the BCS \nconferences, will hear the public outcry against the BCS and \nvoluntarily work to reform the system to ensure that, as in every other \nAmerican sport, championships are decided on the field and not in \narbitrary polls and computer calculations. While a playoff seems like \nthe most natural solution, other means may be available.\n  That said, I want to say that I believe the University of Utah \nfootball team are champions in the truest sense of the word. They won \non the field against worthy competition in a year when literally \neveryone else proved unable to do so. Once again, I want to \ncongratulate University President Michael Young, Coach Whittingham and \nevery member of the team for what proved to be an exhilarating and \ntremendous season. I also congratulate other teams that qualified for \nbowl games who were winners and deserve certainly the plaudits of all \nof us.\n\n  I hope this helps to bring this matter to a head. I hope we can \nchange this system that is an unjust system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me say, first, what a pleasure it \nis to hear the distinguished Senator from Utah speak about his \nbeautiful State and his beloved Utes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/30/senate-section/article/S1118-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1118-S1120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND THE BAILOUTS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a different topic \ntoday. This speech is about a stove, a jet, and $40 billion.\n  The stove belonged to Margarita Fuentes, and a local deputy sheriff \nin Florida repossessed it for the finance company. The case went all \nthe way to the Supreme Court, and became the famous case of Fuentes v. \nShevin, which every first year law student has to read.\n  The court held that you couldn't take away Ms. Fuentes' stove, not \nwithout giving her a hearing; that she had a constitutional right to a \nhearing. The court stated:\n\n       [T]he constitutional right to be heard is a basic aspect of \n     the duty of government to follow a fair process of decision-\n     making when it acts to deprive a person of his possessions.\n\n  Important rule: The finance company may well have been right about \nthe stove, but the sheriff still cannot take property without due \nprocess.\n  That is the stove. Now the jet.\n  Citigroup has received billions and billions in Federal funds--$45 \nbillion in preferred stock purchases alone--to prevent Citigroup from \nfailing. What did they do? Bought a $50 million French-made luxury \nprivate jet.\n  It took the new Secretary of the Treasury to personally talk them out \nof it, with a helpful push from our colleague, Senator Levin. And \nthat's not all. Here's how Maureen Dowd reports they spent the money on \nexecutive office furnishings at Merrill Lynch, just bought by \nCitigroup:\n\n       . . . big-ticket items included curtains for $28,000, a \n     pair of chairs for $87,000, fabric for a ``Roman Shade'' for \n     $11,000, Regency chairs for $24,000, six wall sconces for \n     $2,700, a $13,000 chandelier in the private dining room and \n     six dining chairs for $37,000, a ``custom coffee table'' for \n     $16,000, an antique commode ``on legs'' for $35,000, and a \n     $1,400 ``parchment waste can.''\n\n  A lot of executive compensation goes to the same executives who led \ntheir companies into this mess, while reaping vast sums.\n  For example, Wells Fargo, which received $25 billion in bailout \nmoney, is planning layoffs but is keeping its CEO and chairman who were \npaid $12.5 million and nearly $23 million in 2007, respectively.\n  JP Morgan received $25 billion in bailout money, but is keeping its \nCEO who was paid $28 million in 2007.\n  Capital One bought and closed GreenPoint mortgage--1,900 layoffs, \n1,900 families where someone lost a\n\n[[Page S1119]]\n\njob--received about $3.5 billion in bailout money, and is keeping its \nCEO who was paid more than $73 million in 2007.\n  And this week's New York Times reports that despite ``crippling \nlosses, multimillion dollar bailouts and the passing of some of the \nmost important names in the business,'' an estimated $18.4 billion in \nbonuses were paid out to Wall Street employees in 2008--the sixth \nhighest total in history--in what was most certainly not the sixth best \nyear in Wall Street's history.\n  In other words, firms on the brink of extinction that were saved only \nby the U.S. taxpayer still saw fit to reward people who created the \nmess with over $18 billion for their performance this past year. \nPresident Obama rightly called this shameful.\n  So that jet is symbolic of a Wall Street culture of unrestrained \nself-indulgence that now, because of the bailouts, begins to happen at \npublic expense and shows no signs of abating.\n  And now we come to the $40 billion.\n  According to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal, the executive-\ndeferred compensation obligations of bailed out Wall Street firms \namount to more than $40 billion. As shown on this chart: Banks Owe \nBillions To Executives. Financial giants getting injections of Federal \ncash owed their executives more than $40 billion for past years' pay \nand pensions as of the end of 2007, a Wall Street Journal analysis \nshows.\n  By the way, this whole executive-deferred compensation scheme is \nnothing but a big tax dodge to begin with.\n  Banks participating in the bailout program carried these obligations \non their books, and the cash from our bailout is being used to pay \nthem, or will be used to pay them. Mr. President, $40 billion in \ntaxpayer dollars will end up in the pockets of the very executives who \ntanked those firms.\n  How much is $40 billion? Here is how it breaks down State by State \nbased on population.\n  If you are the Governor of California, you can look forward to $4.780 \nbillion as your State's share of that $40 billion bailout.\n  If you are, as the wonderful new Presiding Officer is, from Colorado, \nyou can look forward to $636 million as your State's share of deferred \nexecutive compensation for Wall Street.\n  If you are from Missouri, as is the distinguished Senator in the \nChamber, you are looking at $768 million as Missouri taxpayers' share \nof the $40 billion bailout.\n  Generally, when a company goes into bankruptcy, the executives who \nare owed the $40 billion in deferred compensation would have become \ngeneral unsecured creditors and have to wait in line with other such \ngeneral unsecured creditors.\n  Experts report that in most cases this means losing all deferred \ncompensation or recovering pennies on the dollar. Executives at Lehman \nBrothers, which was allowed to go into bankruptcy, will probably lose \nout on their deferred compensation.\n  By contrast, nothing has been done to address the deferred \ncompensation obligations of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, \nJP Morgan, and other banks that have been given a lifeline.\n  As shown on this chart, you will see the estimated debt to executives \nat Goldman Sachs is actually bigger than the capital injection. It is \nan astonishing sum of money.\n  I should throw in my own home State of Rhode Island. We are a small \nState. Here is our share of it: $140 million. That is our entire budget \nfor our two 4-year State colleges for a year--the entire State budget \nfor them; $140 million out of Rhode Island to pay for $40 billion in \ntax-dodged, deferred executive compensation.\n  As people who are on the floor will recall, that is more than the \nentire program we spent so many hours fighting about for the U.S. auto \nindustry. Remember that. That was sort of $18 billion to $35 billion. \nThis is $40 billion, and nobody is even talking about it. And we fought \nfor days about whether to support our own domestic auto industry.\n  Well, I think the jet shows that the Wall Street culture of lavish \nself-indulgence is not likely to change. But something very important \nhas changed, and that is the taxpayers are now starting to pay for it, \nand they are not going to stand for it for long.\n  If something is going to change, we in Congress have to change it; we \nneed to do it now, and we need to do it in a way that sticks. That's \nwhere Ms. Fuentes' stove comes in.\n\n       The constitutional right to be heard is a basic aspect of \n     the duty of government to follow a fair process of decision-\n     making when it acts to deprive a person of his possessions.\n\n  That is the case of Ms. Fuentes' stove.\n  If it takes due process before poor Ms. Fuentes can have her stove \ntaken away, then it takes due process before certain adjustments can be \nmade to the obscene and grotesque executive compensation paid for by \nbailouts.\n  It takes some due process before anything can be done about this $40 \nbillion in executive-deferred compensation.\n\n  Without a due process forum, we have unilaterally disarmed the powers \nof Government that can make those adjustments. That is a choice we make \nto unilaterally disarm the powers of Government that could do something \nabout the $40 billion.\n  I submit if we don't make some reasonable adjustments, that failure \nwill so damage public credibility and faith in the entire exercise; in \naddition to being profoundly unfair, in fact, that it will eliminate or \ndiminish our ability to manage the crisis. People will not want to hear \nany longer from us.\n  The ordinary due process forum for troubled companies, bankruptcy \ncourt, is not the best forum for this, for the very reasons that \ncorporations need rescue: they serve a public utility for us in the \neconomy. But the fact that they provide that vital public utility \nfunction is no reason to say these other things cannot also be \nadjusted. That does not mean they should not have to change their ways.\n  As I said, the only way to change their ways, it appears, is to make \nthem change. So, I will shortly be filing legislation to create a \nTemporary Economic Recovery Oversight Court, a forum that could provide \ndue process, short of a full bankruptcy filing, and empower Government \nto take reasonable steps to restrain the lavish self-indulgences to \nwhich these masters of the universe have become accustomed. I am also \nexploring other ways of addressing this critical issue.\n  But I encourage colleagues of mine who are interested in this issue \nto talk to me about how we can make this right. There are technical \nissues. If anybody is interested, please contact me. I think this is a \nbipartisan issue. I do not think a Republican is any happier about $40 \nbillion in deferred executive compensation coming out of the public \nfisc than a Democrat, and if we do not take action, the swelling river \nof the righteous and proper anger of the American people will rise up, \nand overswell its banks. I have lived through difficult economic \nsituations in Rhode Island, where public anger overswelled its banks. \nIt is not a good place to be.\n  The people's confidence in their Government's ability to treat them \nfairly will be justifiably compromised, and we will have lost their \nconfidence, the old-fashioned way: We will have earned it.\n  The poet William Blake spoke of times when we should not let our \nsword sleep in our hand. American Government gives us a vital sword, \none that can trim away the lavish excesses of the lotus years, and \ntreat all Americans fairly, not create a favored taxpayer-supported \nWall Street class that is treated differently than workers in Michigan \nand elsewhere. I submit we must not let that sword sleep in our hands.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. McCaskill pertaining to the introduction of S. \n360 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

JOHN LOGAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a well-respected \nKentuckian, Dr. John Logan. Mr. Logan's outstanding dedication to \nKentucky history is truly immeasurable as is his devotion to the \nCommonwealth itself.\n  Recently the Gleaner in Henderson, KY, published a story highlighting \nDr. Logan's new book about the extraordinary history of Methodist \nHospital in Henderson, KY. The story highlights not only Dr. Logan's \nallegiance to the medical industry but his unknown talents as an \narchivist. Dr. Logan was able to compile such a vast amount of research \nfor his new book because, as he says, he ``lived'' it. Having been \ninvolved with the hospital since 1962, Dr. Logan has certainly seen his \nshare of history firsthand. Without Dr. Logan's remarkable efforts to \npreserve history, the triumphant story of this great Kentucky \ninstitution would be lost forever.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Logan \nas a true patriot and Kentuckian whose legacy will forever be \nremembered, and I further ask unanimous consent to have the full \narticle printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Gleaner, Jan. 17, 2009]\n\n  Time To Tell the Story: Local Physician Administers Dose of History \n                  With New Book on Methodist Hospital\n\n                           (By Judy Jenkins)\n\n       It wasn't so much a want as it was a need.\n       And it wasn't so much a need as it was a deep conviction \n     that time wouldn't wait forever and something important could \n     be lost.\n       That's why, five years ago, Dr. John Logan began a long-\n     contemplated project that required the patience of a saint, \n     more than a few detective skills, and the excavation of \n     nearly half a century of his own memories.\n       The result, just off the press, is the 192-page ``History \n     of Methodist Hospital, Henderson, Ky., 1948-2008.''\n       The hardcover volume, published by McClanahan Publishing \n     House, Inc. of Lyon County, Ky., is chock full of photographs \n     and doesn't merely chronicle the development of the hospital \n     from a simple, one-story brick building with 12 doctors and \n     35 employees to the towering complex it is today.\n       It also pays tribute to the legions of people of all ages, \n     races and socio-economic backgrounds who have done everything \n     from polishing the floors and baking the bread to utilizing \n     space age diagnostic technology and performing life-saving \n     procedures.\n       ``I decided it was time to tell the story,'' says John, who \n     has served as the hospital's medical director for 22 years, \n     been president of the medical staff, and completed 19 terms \n     as chief of the medical staff.\n       His thought, he said, was, ``If I don't tell it, it's \n     gone.''\n       He couldn't let that happen because ``It's a great story. \n     That this hospital all these years has survived across the \n     river from hospitals twice our size. That says we're doing \n     something right.''\n       Because he has been associated with the hospital since 1962 \n     and has witnessed its growth and advancements, he didn't have \n     to spend all of his time in a basement room with dusty boxes \n     of scrapbooks and loose clippings.\n       ``I've LIVED the research,'' he said, grinning.\n       He came to this area as a brand new physician, hanging out \n     his shingle in Sebree in his wife Jackie's home county.\n       Probably no one in his native Edmonson County had expected \n     him or his brother Tom to become doctors. Their family was \n     thick with attorneys, but the siblings opted to follow the \n     medical path.\n       John's mentor was a country doctor named Sidney Farmer, who \n     hired him at age 14 to clean his offices. When John got a \n     driver's license, he drove Farmer to make house calls.\n       A year after the youthful family practitioner came to these \n     parts, he was introduced to a dynamic 31-year-old named \n     Charles ``Chuck'' Jarrett, who had accepted the post of \n     Methodist Hospital executive director.\n       Chuck, who was a former Marine and ``a dreamer'' who had \n     the unique ability to persuade others to dream with him, soon \n     was plotting a tall, gleaming modern hospital on that hill \n     off Twelfth and Elm Streets.\n       When he died, far too young, in 1973, the institution had \n     four sprawling wings and was just as he had envisioned it.\n       Since that time, his successors Ron Chapman and Bruce \n     Begley have kept the dreams alive and the hospital is flanked \n     by a North Tower and South Tower.\n       In his book, John fleshes out what otherwise could be the \n     bare bones of history. For instance, he relates that in \n     addition to being a popular veteran pediatrician and hunter, \n     Dr. John Jenkins is a pig farmer.\n       The author says Jenkins once told him, ``If I work very \n     hard practicing medicine, I can almost cover my losses in pig \n     farming.''\n       John also writes about the late Dr. M.G. Veal, a fellow \n     with a well developed sense of humor and hobby sideline as a \n     trumpet player in several area bands. He smoked, though he \n     knew better, and ``His trademark was a cigarette with an inch \n     of ashes hanging.''\n       (I can vouch for that mischievous sense of humor. Once he \n     passed me in the hospital lobby and loudly congratulated me. \n     When I, confused, asked why he was congratulating me, he \n     said, ``I just heard that you're expecting your tenth child, \n     Mrs. Jenkins!'' Heads turned, believe me. For the record, I \n     only had three kids at the time and the fourth and last was \n     born a year later).\n       As I read the book, I was reminded of the tragic losses the \n     hospital medical staff has suffered over the years.\n       Among them, the death of the young and much-revered Dr. \n     W.B. Blue, who practiced in Henderson's East End. He died in \n     a vehicular accident here.\n       And there was Dr. Elton House, who was reaching the height \n     of his career when he drowned during an outing on Barkley \n     Lake.\n       And Dr. Joe McGruder, who had brought so many babies into \n     the world, lost his life while scuba diving on vacation.\n       John is proud of the fact that he unearthed photos of every \n     Methodist Hospital physician--but one--who was on the \n     original staff, or who had served at least 20 years.\n       His only failure was Dr. Ira Cosby, an original staff \n     member who regularly made house calls and was never known to \n     drive faster than 35 mph.\n       John and his faithful helpers searched high and low, \n     contacting relatives and doing everything possible to come up \n     with a likeness of the doctor, but had to admit defeat.\n       There are numerous photos of hospital employees who have \n     made their own marks on the institution. They include the \n     late Bill Beck, director of materials management. He was a \n     soft-spoken man who never minded going above and beyond the \n     call of duty to honor a request.\n       James ``Rip'' Van Winkle was like that too, and I don't \n     recall an instance when the late director of building and \n     grounds left a room without relating an anecdote or witticism \n     that had everyone laughing.\n       John himself could fill a book, but because space is \n     limited we'll just say he played a major role in many things \n     we take for granted here, including the spacious YMCA, the \n     Henderson Fine Arts Center, the Depot/Tourism Center--and the \n     hospital's Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Unit that makes \n     it possible to care for most of the tiniest and sickest \n     babies right here.\n       He's not happy about everything related to the hospital. It \n     just irks him that while the facility regularly performs \n     cardiac catheterizations and has a staff of 24 cardiologists \n     as well as a dedicated telemetry unit, it hasn't yet been \n     able to obtain a state Certificate of Need to permit \n     angioplasty procedures or stent placements here.\n       He'll keep pursuing that, no doubt, as he has, at 71, no \n     immediate plans to retire.\n       Nor does he plan a sequel to the history.\n       ``I've done the first 60 years. Somebody else will have to \n     do the next 60.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/30/senate-section/article/S1120-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1120-S1121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SPENCER COUNTY FFA DAIRY JUDGING TEAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Spencer \nCounty FFA Dairy Judging Team for winning the 2008 National FFA Dairy \nCattle Judging Contest. This team is comprised of four outstanding \nyoung ladies: Whitney Owen, Cassandra Peterson, Kelli Smitha, and \nMichella White.\n  After countless hours spent preparing for the Kentucky FFA Dairy \nJudging Contest, they were awarded top honors at the State competition \nlast August. The team then had the privilege of representing the \nCommonwealth at the 2008 National FFA Dairy Cattle Judging Contest in \nIndianapolis, IN, where they were again victorious.\n  Founded in 1928 as the Future Farmers of America, the group that is \ntoday known as the National FFA Organization brings together students, \nteachers, and members of the agribusiness community to promote \nagricultural education. In Kentucky, the National FFA Organization has \nover 15,000 members spread across 145 chapters. And over 24,000 \nKentucky middle- and high-school students are enrolled in agricultural \neducation programs.\n  Agriculture is obviously an important sector of the economy for my \nState, and I am proud of the many young people and adults who work with \nthe National FFA Organization in Kentucky to ensure that the Bluegrass \nState remains at the forefront of agricultural education and innovation \nfor years to come. Members are always recognizable during their visits \nto our Nation's Capitol by their distinctive blue jackets.\n  By securing a first-place finish at the national competition, the \nSpencer County FFA Dairy Judging Team now has the opportunity to \nrepresent America this summer at the International Dairy Judging \nContest in Scotland. FFA is known for producing many of our Nation's \nfuture leaders, and I won't be surprised to see that trend continue\n\n[[Page S1121]]\n\nbased on the success Whitney, Cassandra, Kelli, and Michella have \nalready achieved.

(This \n     figure does not include 13 alleged violations from the \n     previous year carried into 2008.)\n       (2) The number of alleged violations that were dismissed--\n       (A) For lack of subject matter jurisdiction or in which, \n     even if the allegations in the complaint are true, no \n     violation of Senate rules would exist: 52. (This figure \n     includes 5 matters originating in the previous year.)\n       (B) Because they failed to provide sufficient facts as to \n     any material violation of the Senate rules beyond mere \n     allegation or assertion: 21. (This figure includes 4 matters \n     originating in the previous year.)\n       (3) The number of alleged violations in which the Committee \n     staff conducted a preliminary inquiry: 10. (Th(s figure \n     includes 4 matters from the previous year carried into 2008.)\n       (4) The number of alleged violations that resulted in an \n     adjudicatory review: 0.\n       (5) The number of alleged violations that the Committee \n     dismissed for lack of substantial merit. 4. (This figure \n     includes 1 matter from the previous year carried into 2008).\n       (6) The number of private letters of admonition or public \n     letters of admonition issued: 2.\n       (7) The number of matters resulting in a disciplinary \n     sanction: 0.\n       (8) Any other information deemed by the Committee to be \n     appropriate to describe its activities in the previous year.\n       Between January 4 and February 25, 2008 the Committee staff \n     conducted mandatory ethics training for all Senate employees: \n     8 training sessions for Members, 19 training sessions for \n     staff, and 1 training session for Member spouses.

Mr. President, I believe I am speaking on behalf of \nAmericans who value their second amendment personal right to own their \nown firearms. I also believe I am speaking on behalf of Americans who \nfavor justice over political patronage. Finally, I believe I am \nspeaking on behalf of Americans who realize we are in a war on terror \nand want to continue the strong efforts to bring terrorists to justice. \nI am opposed to the appointment of Eric Holder to be the next Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  I take particular interest in this nomination because I, as well as \nthe voters of the State of Oklahoma, feel strongly that the rights \nconferred upon us by the second amendment of the Constitution guarantee \nan individual freedom that no government regulation can take away. Eric \nHolder's record and his true beliefs about the second amendment are \nclear. In a brief filed in the Heller case, Holder joined other past \nDepartment of Justice officials by saying: ``[t]he Second Amendment \nDoes Not Protect Firearms Possession or Use That Is Unrelated To \nParticipation In a Well-Regulated Militia.'' The brief also stated that \nthe ``recognition of an expansive individual right to keep and bear \narms for private purposes will make it more difficult for the \ngovernment to defend present and future firearms laws.'' During his \nconfirmation hearing, Eric Holder noted the importance of the Heller \ndecision and recognized it as precedent. But I certainly do not believe \nthat the decision in Heller has changed the underlying beliefs held by \nEric Holder, and his leadership as the chief lawyer of the United \nStates will be a detriment to the gun ownership rights of American \ncitizens.\n  I am also very uncomfortable with Mr. Holder's judgment and record on \npardons and clemency during the Clinton administration. He apparently \nchose to circumvent the standard process by which all pardons are \nconsidered and granted, and clouded this process with the appearance of \nimpropriety. If the pardon of Mark Rich was not impropriety, and I \nbelieve it was, then it was at the very least extreme negligence, and \nsuch negligence has no place in any level of government. Mark Rich, \nwhom many label a tax evader, is in fact even more than that. Rich was \nindicted in 1983 on 65 counts of not only tax evasion, but also fraud, \nracketeering, and trading with the enemy. Rich fled to Switzerland \nbefore he could stand trial, which is perhaps the most egregious \nelement of this case--he was a fugitive and a regular fixture on the \nFBI's Ten Most Wanted List. How can one justify recommending a pardon, \nbypass the Department of Justice and the hundreds of individuals who \nworked to bring Mark Rich to justice, when the man who is being \npardoned is not even willing to face the same justice system to which \nevery other American must answer? In fact, Holder admitted during his \nconfirmation hearing that he did not adequately acquaint himself with \nthe facts of the case. The United States Senate should not allow such \ninjustice to go unanswered.\n  Equally egregious, Holder was Deputy Attorney General in an \nadministration which granted clemency to 16 members of the Armed Forces \nof National Liberation, or FALN. This is a group which not only carried \nout violent protests, FALN set off bombs several times in New York City \nand Chicago and were convicted for conspiracies to commit robbery, \nbomb-making, and sedition. The Clinton administration granted clemency \ndespite opposition from the U.S. Attorney's Office, FBI, and most \nimportantly, the victims of FALN terrorist activities.\n  Finally, we continue to be in a war on terror, however, Holder is an \nindividual who is opposed to the military commissions which have tried \nterrorists and is opposed to the Guantanamo Bay detention facility for \ndetaining terrorists. This Senate and the American people should know \nthat since October 2001, the U.S. has detained almost 800 al-Qaida and \nTaliban combatants at GTMO. Currently, 60 more are ready for transfer \nor release to another country, 70 have either been tried or in process, \nand 130 are a high threat to the U.S. Since 2002, more than 525 \ndetainees have departed GTMO for other countries. Today, there are \napproximately 240 detainees at GTMO. If GTMO is no longer a prison, \nsome U.S. domestic or overseas prison will have to house these men \nwhile they await a habeas hearing and trial. All the while, the \nmilitary detention facilities at GTMO meet the highest international \nstandards. The Pentagon spends $2.5 million each year on Korans, prayer \nrugs, and special meals for prisoners. There are on average two lawyers \nfor every detainee at GTMO. He believes our military commissions \ncurrently in place would have to be substantially revamped and even \nholds the position that U.S. interrogation techniques should be \npublished for the world to see.\n  For at least these reasons, I cannot vote to support the nomination \nof an individual who holds opinions on a wide range of issues which I \nfind so objectionable and objectionable to my constituents. I will be \nvoting a definitive no on the Holder nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/30/senate-section/article/S1121-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1121-S1122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to express my optimism \nthat with a new administration and a new Congress, we will finally be \nable to achieve what was left unfinished last year: the expansion of \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. Though we are in difficult \neconomic times, we can\n\n[[Page S1122]]\n\nnever afford to squander our Nation's most precious resource--our \nchildren.\n  From 1994 to 2000 I served as the State of Florida's elected \ntreasurer and insurance commissioner. During my tenure, I oversaw the \nimplementation of the SCHIP program, or the Healthy Kids Program, as it \nis known in Florida. There is no doubt in my mind that this program \nworks. Nationwide, in 1997 23.3 percent of low-income children were \nuninsured. By 2006, this number had dropped to 15.4 percent.\n  However, much remains to be done. The rate of uninsured children in \nFlorida is nearly 19 percent--the second worst in the country. Around \n8.6 million children in America are uninsured; nearly 900,000 of these \nchildren are in Florida. One of the reasons I support this bill so \nstrongly is that it expands coverage and offers incentives for States \nlike Florida to find and enroll uncovered children. During difficult \neconomic times such as these, there are more children in need of the \nCHIP program, not fewer.\n  While I am very satisfied with the progress this legislation would \nmake in covering children, I do have concerns about its financing. I \nwant to emphasize that increasing the tobacco tax is an appropriate \nfunding mechanism for this legislation. It will have significant \npositive impacts on health, save untold millions in health care costs, \nand reduce the prevalence of smoking among the children whom this bill \nis designed to protect. However, I am concerned that the tax is applied \nunequally across different tobacco products.\n  Under the current legislation, there is a much higher tax increase \nfor large cigars than for other tobacco products. This is no small \nproblem for Florida--90 percent of large cigars in the U.S. are either \nmanufactured or imported through Florida, accounting for approximately \n3,000 jobs. While I remain opposed to placing an unfair tax burden on \nany one product, I still feel we have a strong bill on the whole, one \nthat will improve health care dramatically for America's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/30/senate-section/article/S1122-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1122-S1124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       You are asking Idahoans to write about gas prices? You mean \n     you do not know? I think Washington D.C. may as well be \n     registered as another planet because I think your colleagues \n     are so far from reality of the rest of the people it is \n     absolutely outrageous.\n       [Some of] your colleagues [suggest that] Americans use \n     alternative [modes] of transportation and that it is a good \n     thing that gas prices force people to take the bus, ride \n     bikes, or walk to their destination because it helps reduce \n     global warming.\n       I have something [for you to share with your colleagues]:\n       I am a driver for a living. I deliver products right here \n     in Boise. I have to drive I have no choice. I am also a \n     salesman, and a night supervisor. I live in Idaho. I do not \n     have the option of riding the bus. I cannot walk my \n     deliveries or ride my bike with my products.\n       I find it absolutely insulting [to think this suggestion \n     can be taken seriously. Too many liberals] love these high \n     gas prices because they want to use it as an excuse to make \n     us live how they want us to live to fight so-called global \n     warming, while [they make no sacrifices in their own personal \n     travel behaviors.] That is eco-socialism in my opinion.\n       Senator Crapo, I have three jobs!! Three jobs, and I am \n     still having problems fueling up. I have had to open credit \n     card accounts for the first time in my life, and my debt is \n     still going up!\n       You would think with three jobs and three paychecks for one \n     person! I am not married, no kids. I would be starving with \n     fuel prices if I had a family. I am just barely paying my \n     bills on time as they are, to about $1,500 a month, not \n     including gas prices!\n       Starting in 2005 till 2007, I did very well financially. I \n     was saving up and putting money away in my savings account. I \n     loved myself for putting money away. This month [June 2008], \n     I had to take one-quarter of my life savings out of my bank \n     to pay for bills, including gas because the price skyrocketed \n     from $3 to $4 a gallon in one month. This is outrageous!\n       I think it is 80 percent the government's fault for this \n     and 20 percent the oil companies. The only thing the oil \n     companies are doing wrong is speculating the price of oil for \n     really dumb reasons.\n       Congress has done this because [legislation to drill for \n     oil in ANWR has been blocked because of environmental \n     concerns that do not exist.] Congress is more worried about a \n     stupid deer than they are about [the lives of Americans]? \n     More worried about the mating season of the caribou than they \n     are about the economy? My jobs? My gas prices? My bills? My \n     lifestyle?\n       You will not allow drilling off shore? Well, did you know \n     that China is drilling for oil off the coast of Florida? But \n     we cannot. Why? This is outrageous!\n       Do not listen to those radical environmentalists. They were \n     wrong about the second Ice Age in the 70s. When I was kid in \n     school in the 1980s, my teachers told me by the year 1999, \n     New York would be underwater and Los Angeles would be a bunch \n     of Islands. It has not happened. Of course, the earth's \n     temperature changes and jumps over time. The earth's climate \n     changes all the time, has been since the earth cooled and \n     formed. The earth's temperature does not stay the same all \n     the time. There are so many scientists and people who \n     disagree with Al Gore, but if we disagree, we are labeled \n     ``flat-earthers'' and ``Holocaust Deniers.''\n       My question for [conservatives] is this. Why did you not \n     approve drilling for oil when you [controlled Congress and \n     the White House]?\n       You want to help me? A person with three jobs and \n     struggling with gas prices? I have not had a vacation since \n     March of 2007. I cannot even take a one-day vacation to \n     Jackpot anymore. I work all seven days a week, get no \n     weekends and I still struggle to pay gas prices of about $15 \n     a day, not a week, a day!\n       Drill here, drill in ANWR, drill in America!\n     Aaron, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you, Senator, for your sincere concern for Idaho \n     residents. I am 58 next month and on disability from a very \n     severe fire I was trapped in several years ago. Though I do \n     get an income, this is where it goes:\n       I receive $625 a month.\n       1. $200 a month mobile home space rent.\n       2. $156 a month mortgage payments for my mobile home . . . \n     which without the owner of the mobile home, I would not be on \n     my way to being a first time home owner!\n       3. $48 a month mobile home insurance.\n       4. $40 a month vehicle insurance . . . it is a 1988 \n     Plymouth Voyager van that I have had since 1988.\n       5. $39 phone bill. which was supposed to reduced several \n     months ago through my social worker, and still remains at the \n     normal price and I do not have long distance.\n       6. $30-40 electricity monthly; I do not have an air \n     conditioner for summer but do open my windows and use my \n     ceiling fans that helps.\n       7. $125 and up in winter for gas to run my heater monthly. \n     That is after I receive fuel assistance which for some reason \n     only lasts 1-2 months and only use the heater to warm up the \n     area so can start my wood stove which is usually one-half \n     hour.\n       So, if I am lucky, all I can afford to do is put up to $20 \n     a month in gas, which gives me almost 1/4 tank and that has \n     to last the month. I have medical problems that mean many \n     trips to the doctor and pharmacy, and with such a low amount \n     of gas I have to depend on others for rides when I run out of \n     gas. Thank you for your sincere concern and we are all hoping \n     and praying that gas will once again come down to where \n     people like me can afford to purchase more.\n     Loretta, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       From your letter on gas prices that you sent me, you are \n     starting to understand that the Congress holds most of the \n     blame for high oil (and thus gas) prices. Congress has failed \n     to act in the thirty years since the last gas crisis, \n     continually failing to take responsible action to make sure \n     domestic supplies are developed and used to reduce dependence \n     on foreign oil.\n       It should be clear that the single most deleterious action \n     of Congress over the last forty years was the Environmental \n     Protection Act. It has desperately needed revision since the \n     early seventies and because it was not, the economic impact \n     on America has been extreme. The inability to build domestic \n     gas refineries, increase domestic oil production and take \n     advantage of resources in ANWR are only a few of the \n     unintended and disastrous impacts of that act. An \n     environmentalist has only to write a single letter to cause \n     the price of any such proposal to escalade exponentially. The \n     latest case of the proposed nuclear reactor in Idaho is an \n     example. One man writing one letter can cause the waste of \n     hundreds of thousands of dollars to ``prove'' the lack of \n     environmental\n\n[[Page S1123]]\n\n     impacts of such a proposal. The price of a house in Idaho has \n     risen by 10-15 percent, for instance, because of the \n     ludicrous and technically flawed environmental studies and \n     reactions on the spotted owl.\n       Still, no action in Congress to alleviate the situation. We \n     simply need someone to stand up and take the actions \n     necessary to replace political correctness with what used to \n     be common sense.\n       So the bottom line, Senator, is that Congress bears the \n     responsibility to stop passing stupid laws and start reigning \n     in those that are hurting the nation's ability to do the \n     right things rather than the politically correct things. Do \n     you have the courage to start?\n     Robert, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked what the high gas prices are doing to me. It has \n     become very difficult to even do normal things. I cannot \n     afford to go up town and buy necessary things. Since I am on \n     Social Security Disability, my sister and I have been living \n     off my money. Since my sister does not have a car and I \n     cannot afford to buy one for her, nor could I afford the gas. \n     She would love to go to work. How would she get there? Idaho, \n     and particularly this area has a really horrible public \n     transportation system. It truly is a disgrace to our state. \n     My sister walks as much as possible. Our nation needs to stop \n     depending on foreign oil. I love all the animals and have \n     tried to protect them as much as possible, but we need to \n     start taking care of our families first.\n       The oil companies are making over the profit margin; that \n     is disgusting by itself. I do not trust one thing they say or \n     do. Therefore, we need to have alternative fuel. The wind can \n     run electricity. The air can fuel a car, water can do both, \n     after seeing the pictures of a car that runs on air. America, \n     the greatest country in the world needs to step up to the \n     plate. Oil companies need to step up to the plate before they \n     become the dinosaurs. Therefore, we need to drill. Do it. \n     Many families like mine are being devastated by the high \n     gasoline prices which makes high food prices we cannot \n     afford. Thank you for your time\n     Marian, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       This is in response to a solicitation from Senator Crapo \n     regarding personal stories on how high energy prices are \n     affecting lives. Greed is the source of most of the world's \n     evil. I know I sound like an ideologue, but please read on.\n       It is hard to disaggregate the effects of the high cost of \n     energy from other economic hits our family is experiencing. \n     When construction activity slowed in Valley and Adams County, \n     wage earning families left our valleys looking for jobs \n     elsewhere.\n       The resulting reduced school enrollment (now compounded by \n     the end of Craig-Wyden) in our districts led me to being one \n     of the teachers RIF'd from the Council School District. \n     Fortunately, I found work part-time in the McCall School \n     District. Unfortunately, this 70-mile, round-trip commute (in \n     my 2000 140,000+ mile Dodge AWD Caravan--needed for \n     unpredictable roads) costs me $9.00-$12.00 a trip! I would \n     like to buy a more fuel efficient Subaru--but I cannot afford \n     to.)\n       My school-age children suffer because programs are being \n     severely reduced--shop and art are gone. Some high school \n     courses will only be offered every other year. Summer school \n     for poor learners is truncated. Field trips? Sports? Both are \n     severely reduced. How can our small-town children go out and \n     experience the world when there is not even money for gas?\n       As consumers, our family lives so far from ``the source'' \n     that not only gas, but also milk and other basic commodities \n     seem to cost at least 25 percent more than they did a year \n     ago. Last year I was able to find milk for $2.29 gallon; now \n     milk costs close to $4.00/gallon. Healthy bread costs close \n     to $4.00/loaf. As a family, we certainly have not received a \n     COLA to offset these price increases.\n       As middle-class professionals (my husband is a forester) \n     and as parents, the drain on our budget means belt-tightening \n     for any of ``fun things'' like vacation trips. Additionally, \n     we have experienced a health crisis (and have met our \n     catastrophic limits). I now must commute to Fruitland (140 \n     miles round trip) every 2 weeks for chemo; in the fall I will \n     need to commute 5 days a week for radiation for 6 weeks! (My \n     doctor cavalierly denied me two prescriptions for drugs since \n     they are also available OTC. ``They only cost a few dollars. \n     `` He casually shrugged off my request for RXs. Well, the two \n     drugs cost more than $30 altogether. I do not think that the \n     upper-middle-class and upper-class have a clue that there is \n     an exponential difference between a few bucks (a latte) and \n     $30 (a chance to visit a museum or movie, or halfway fill up \n     a gas tank to make it to a chemo session!)\n       I believe that our tax system rewards the rich on the backs \n     of the poor and middle class. I believe that oil companies \n     and owners of stocks are making fortunes as the little guy \n     suffers.\n       I believe we should take global warning seriously and allow \n     tax credits for the development of alternative energy. We \n     need to take recycling very seriously. We also need to be a \n     world economic partner on a fair playing field (Kyoto \n     convention), quit out-sourcing to countries that do not \n     provide the labor protections we do to our workers, and build \n     respectful relationships among all peoples and all cultures--\n     as a first step to world peace and understanding and a step \n     away from the ugliness of war.\n       I also believe that limiting population growth and sharing \n     the world's resource's equably is the only way we will ever \n     establish peace on earth.\n       Locally, for our family, what have been the effects of high \n     energy costs? Higher food and medical costs, loss of job, \n     reduced school programs for my children, dwindled savings, \n     ``making do'' with older cars and housing needs, fewer \n     amenities, no vacation.\n       Glad you asked.\n     Lynn, Fruitvale.\n                                  ____\n\n       I read your letter sent out today. Glad to hear that at \n     least one of our Senators in Washington gets it. I hope there \n     are more of you in DC that can support the policies you want \n     to support in your letter.\n       We do need to start drilling again in the US and offshore. \n     We need to make sure that we take precautions to avoid damage \n     to the environment. We cannot sacrifice one for the other. \n     But we must start drilling again, and do so in a respective \n     manner of Mother Nature.\n       And we are going to need some new refining capability. \n     Again, do it new technology and with respect to our \n     environment. Build it in Eastern Idaho--we have the space and \n     we could use the jobs and economic boost. Tough to get oil \n     here, but if they need a place for it, bring it here.\n       We must start the nuclear programs again. We need to build \n     some new reactors soon. I do not know for sure, but I am \n     betting some of our older reactors are getting long in the \n     tooth, and if they go off the grid, then what happens? \n     Besides we need more power and money spent to renew our grid \n     system.\n       We need to take a serious look at Ethanol. I am not sure it \n     is all it is being promoted to be. I am not sure the benefits \n     outweigh all of the costs. With the flooding in the Midwest, \n     I wonder what the cost of corn will be now? But it is not \n     just food issues, but the processing issues as well.\n       Wind Power should be promoted as well. But a Nuclear Power \n     Plant is much easier on the eyes than 1000 wind towers, and \n     not as susceptible to the changes in the wind.\n       Coal alternatives should be looked at as well. We need to \n     check if the benefits we can gain from technology like coal \n     gasification are valid and have low impact. Some of the \n     claims you hear and read about look promising. But as I am \n     learning with Ethanol, there may be some significant costs to \n     chase this type of technology.\n       But the short of it--we need to develop our energy and \n     become more independent. The amount of jobs created would be \n     incredible in the process. You want a better health care \n     system and less unemployment and less government care \n     programs--just set the energy companies loose and see this \n     economy rebound in a heartbeat. These energy companies can \n     afford health care plans and benefits for their workers. Our \n     current policies are killing us--and I really hope there are \n     enough in Congress to turn this around. We have been shooting \n     ourselves in the foot for more than 20 years.\n       Good Luck.\n     Stephen, Rigby.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for inviting me to share how the increased gas \n     prices has affected my daily life. I have begun carpooling \n     and eliminating unnecessary trips, and have really saved a \n     lot of money, not to mention reducing the pollution my daily \n     commute had been producing. Though it has not always been \n     convenient, I look at it as one small step that I can do to \n     help our world for future generations. You opposed the \n     proposed climate change legislation that would further hike \n     gas prices up, though I called and wrote your office to ask \n     you to support it. I feel that the higher the gas prices are, \n     the more people will look to limit extraneous trips which \n     will help reduce emissions (greenhouse gases). I also think \n     that the more you reduce the prices on gas, people will use \n     more gas and will choose not to conserve.\n       Measures I want you to support would be to develop a \n     larger, stronger infrastructure of public transportation so \n     that people do not have to worry about getting to work the \n     traditional way of driving singly in their own vehicle. We \n     should encourage production and development of non-fossil \n     fuels, such as cellulosic ethanol, which does not take from \n     the food supply, but does give work to both the scientific \n     developers as well as the laborers necessary to move this \n     idea to fruition. Also, you should support solar, geothermal, \n     and wind production. If measures could be discovered that \n     would allow for the long-term safe storage of nuclear waste, \n     as well as safe practices of running plants on a daily basis, \n     no matter the weather conditions (i.e., drought), keeping in \n     mind the larger picture of our environment, including fish \n     and other natural resources, I would be supportive of that \n     method as well. I know these newer methods are not as easy or \n     convenient as just simply reducing gas prices, but your \n     legacy for truly caring about the environment would be \n     something that would be worth the extra work.\n       Thank you for reading this, even though it probably goes \n     against what you are looking for.\n                                                     Susan, Boise.\n\n[[Page S1124]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/30/senate-section/article/S1124-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          ADDITONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING HARRY MAGNUSON\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on January 24, a man whose life was \nintricately woven into Idaho's history passed on. Harry Frank Magnuson, \nson of an Italian immigrant mother and Polish immigrant father, was \nborn in Idaho in the early part of the 20th century in the small Idaho \nmining town of Wallace. As a young man, Harry sought and obtained his \neducation, first at the University of Idaho. After completing his \nmilitary service with the U.S. Navy during World War II, he obtained a \nmaster's degree in business administration at Harvard University. Harry \nreturned to his hometown of Wallace, ID, and opened an accounting firm \nthat was active for 60 years. At the time of his death, Harry Magnuson \nwas known well beyond Idaho's borders for his leadership, philanthropy \nand business acumen.\n  Harry was a devoted father and husband and committed man of the \ncommunity. He was first and foremost an Idahoan. His work brought him \naccolades from the University of Idaho, Gonzaga University, and Idaho \nState University. In 1990, our State's largest newspaper, the Idaho \nStatesman, named him Idaho Citizen of the Year. He chaired the Idaho \nCentennial Commission from 1987 to 1991. In 1999, Harry received the \n``Esto Perpetua'' award from the Idaho State Historical Society, an \naward that honors an individual's lifetime contributions to the history \nof Idaho.

A bill to allow for certiorari review of certain cases denied \nrelief or review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed \nForces; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with \nSenators Specter and Feingold in introducing the Equal Justice for U.S. \nService Members Act. The Act would eliminate an inequity in current law \nby allowing all court-martialed U.S. servicemembers who face dismissal, \ndischarge or confinement for a year or more to petition the United \nStates Supreme Court for discretionary review through a writ of \ncertiorari.\n  The bill is a simple one, and would do the following: allow a writ of \ncertiorari to be filed in any case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Armed Forces has denied review; and allow a writ of certiorari \nto be filed in any case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nArmed Forces denied a petition for extraordinary relief.\n  In our civilian courts today, all person convicted of a crime, if \nthey lose on appeal, have a right to petition the U.S. Supreme Court \nfor discretionary review. Even enemy combatants have the right to \ndirect appellate review in the Supreme Court.\n  In contrast, however, our men and women in uniform do not share this \nsame right. Our military personnel can apply to the U.S. Supreme Court \nonly if the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces actually \nconducts a review of their case or grants a petition for extraordinary \nrelief. That only happens about 10 percent of the time.\n  In other words, in 90 percent of their case, our U.S. servicemembers \nare prevented from ever seeking or obtaining direct review from the \nSupreme Court.\n  This disparity is not limited to our civilian and military court \nsystems. A similar disparity exists within our military court system \nrelief. The Government routinely has the chance to petition the Supreme \nCourt for review of adverse court-martial rulings in any case where the \ncharges are severe enough to make a punitive discharge possible. But \nour military personnel do not share the same rights to petition the \nSupreme Court as the military prosecutors on the other side of the \naisle.\n  This is wrong, and this inequity was recently noted by the American \nBar Association, which passed a resolution calling on Congress on fix \nthis long-standing ``disparity in our laws governing procedural due \nprocess.''\n  Every day, our U.S. service personnel place their lives on the line \nin defense of American rights. It is unacceptable for us to continue to \nroutinely deprive our men and women in uniform one of those rights--the \nability to petition their Nation's highest court for direct relief. It \nis a right given to common criminals in our civilian courts, to the \nGovernment, and even to some of the terrorists who we hope to prosecute \nas war criminals.\n  The bill is supported by the American Bar Association, the Military \nOfficers Association of America, and the National Institute of Military \nJustice. Robinson Everett, the former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of \nMilitary Appeals, the predecessor to the Court of Appeals for the Armed \nForces, also supports the bill.\n  It's long past time we give them the same rights as the American \ncitizens they fight, and sometimes die, to protect.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to give \nequal justice to our U.S. servicemembers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 357\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Justice for United \n     States Military Personnel Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish the Hawai'i Capital National Heritage \nArea, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nestablish the Hawaii Capital National Heritage Area.\n  National Heritage Areas allow residents, government agencies, \nnonprofit groups and private partners to collaboratively plan and \nimplement programs that recognize and preserve America's defining \nlandscapes. Of the 40 National Heritage Areas established, only a few \nare west of the Mississippi River. This will be Hawaii's first official \nHeritage Area.\n  I believe that Hawaii's unique cultural make up coupled with its \nhistorical significance will surely attract both residents and visitors \nto this special place. The proposed area is rich with cultural sites, \nmuseums, historic buildings, art galleries, performing arts venues, \nethnic markets, and restaurants that will surely provide the average \nperson with an experience of a lifetime.\n  This makes Hawaii Capital Cultural district an ideal candidate for a \nHeritage Area designation.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 359\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hawai`i Capital National \n     Heritage Area Establishment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to limit compensation to officers and directors of \nentities receiving emergency economic assistance from the Government; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I could not agree more with my \ncolleague from Rhode Island. There are a lot of things we need in this \ncountry right now. We need jobs. We need something to stimulate our \neconomy. We need certainty in the credit market. But probably more than \nanything what we need in this country right now is confidence, \nconfidence that we can face down these problems and move forward like \nAmerica has always done.\n  What do we have instead of confidence? Raw anger. I am mad. Everyone \nI work for is mad. Anger can be constructive. It can be channeling. I \nam here today to say it is time we channel this anger and change the \nlaw. We do not need anger. We have a bunch of idiots on Wall Street who \nare kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer. My colleague \ntalked about some of them. Let me review. These financial institutions, \non the brink of extinction, come to the American taxpayer for hundreds \nof billions of dollars at the very same time they think they are going \nto buy a $50 million corporate jet. They are going to pay out $18 \nbillion in bonuses. They paid an average of $2.6 million to every \nexecutive at the first 116 banks that got taxpayer money under TARP. \nLet me say that again: An average of $2.6 million in executive pay to \nthe folks at the first 116 banks that got money from the taxpayers.\n\n  They don't get it. These people are idiots. You can't use taxpayer \nmoney to pay out $18 billion in bonuses. Merrill Lynch is unbelievable. \nThey saved $3 billion to $4 billion from the pot of money that was \ngoing to Bank of America, the sale that was going to close the first \nweek in January. They always gave bonuses in January. Do you know what \nthese sneaky guys did? They decided to give their bonuses in December \nbefore the Bank of America took over. They paid out $3 billion to $4 \nbillion in bonuses in December, and that quarter, Merrill Lynch lost \n$21 billion. What planet are these people on? What could they be \nthinking about?\n  So here is what this bill is going to do. This is called the Cap \nExecutive Officer Pay Act of 2009, and it is very simple. Going \nforward, you want taxpayers to help you survive? You want the people at \nyour financial institution to have a job tomorrow? Then you are going \nto have to limit everyone's pay at your company to the same salary the \nPresident of the United States makes. Is that so unreasonable? It is \neight times the median household income in the United States of \nAmerica--$400,000 a year. I don't think that sounds like a bad deal. \nShould these people be making more than the President of the United \nStates? Now, really, should they? They should not be making more than \nthe President of the United States. So every executive going forward \ncould not make more than $400,000 a year, and they have to limit that \nexecutive compensation for everyone in their company until they pay \nback every dime to the taxpayers.\n  Now, once they are off the public dole, once the taxpayers aren't \nfooting the bill, then it is not as much our business what they get \npaid. But right now, they are on the hook to us, and they owe us \nsomething other than a fancy wastebasket and a $50 million jet. They \nowe us some common sense. If any of them think it is a hardship to take \nthe salary of the President of the United States, I dare them to say so \nout loud right now because that is not going to instill confidence.\n  What is going to instill confidence is for the men and women in these \ncompanies to realize it is time for everyone in this country to tighten \ntheir belt. It is time for everyone to realize we must have our \nfinancial institutions survive but not with a culture that thinks it is \nOK to kick the taxpayer in the shins while they drink champagne and fly \nin fancy jets. It doesn't work; not in the United States of America.\n  I ask my colleagues to sign on to this bill. I think it makes sense. \nWe should have done it in the first place, but I don't think any of us \nthought these guys were this stupid. I don't think any of us believed \nthey would take billions of dollars of bonuses while their institutions \nwere literally days from being wiped out, but they did, and we have \nlearned our lesson.\n  So I hope all my colleagues will sign on this bill. I hope we can get \nit passed quickly so that from this day forward, the President of the \nUnited States will make the same amount of money as the executives of \nthese companies who owe the taxpayers hundreds and hundreds of billions \nof dollars.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Webb, Mr. Brown, Ms. \n        Mikulski, and Mr. Sanders\n  S. 362. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \ncollective bargaining rights and procedures for review of adverse \nactions of certain employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce \nlegislation designed to fix the personnel laws that\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\ncover the Department of Veterans Affairs health care professionals, \nincluding registered nurses, physicians, physician assistants, \ndentists, podiatrists, optometrists, and dental assistants. I am proud \nto have the support of my colleagues, Senators Webb, Brown, Mikulski, \nand Sanders.\n  Whenever I visit VA Medical Centers and meet with veterans, I hear \nwonderful stories about nurses and other VA health care professionals \nwho work long and hard to provide care to our veterans. Too often, our \nhealth care professionals are working under real stress due to lack of \nfunds or staff shortages. Almost 22,000 of the registered nurses caring \nfor our veterans will be eligible to retire by 2010. Even more stunning \nis that 77 percent of all resignations of nurses occur within the first \n5 years. This is a clear signal that more must be done to retain VA \nnurses and quality health care staff. Anyone involved in health care \nunderstands the important role that nurses play in the quality of care \nand patient satisfaction.\n  The goal of this bill is to support the VA health care professionals \nwho work hard to provide quality care to our veterans. The bill seeks \nto return to the partnership agreement of the 1990s between VA \nmanagement and workforce. Flexible scheduling and basic fairness from \nmanagement are key issues that must be addressed to recruit and retain \na strong workforce. Morale is important in every workplace, and \nparticularly in a VA Medical Center.\n  West Virginia has four VA Medical Centers, each with a dedicated team \nof health care professionals. I have met with the nurses and other \nprofessionals to hear their requests for flexible scheduling. I believe \nthat we should restore the management partnership and work hard to \nretain our dedicated team of health professionals for our aging \nveterans, and those newly returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, with \nboth physical and mental wounds of war, that deserve experienced VA \ncare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/30/senate-section/article/S1128-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 98.
