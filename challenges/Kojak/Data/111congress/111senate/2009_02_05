After we completed the voting last night, the \nmanagers of the bill moved a number of other pieces of legislation. \nSenator McCain is going to offer the first amendment today. This will \nbe the 14th amendment that is pending, and I think we need to dispose \nof all or part of these amendments before we start adding more \namendments. We are happy that was the agreement made last night--for \nSenator McCain to offer his amendment. It is an important amendment, \none that needs to be debated, and we look forward to that.\n  However, I would tell Senators, I think we should dispose of some of \nthese amendments before we start on any more after Senator McCain. \nThere will be plenty of time to do that. Everyone has agreed to time \nagreements on these amendments, is what I am told, and I am confident \nthat is right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/05/senate-section/article/S1615-7", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1615-S1616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say a few words about the pending \nlegislation. I hear comments all the time that this is the greatest \nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression. I have asked myself: Well, \nis this worse than the Depression that started in 1928? The answer is \nno. That situation was worse than what we find ourselves in today. In \nthat period of time, the stock market dropped 89 percent, with more \nthan 25 percent of the population without work, and there were millions \nof\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\nothers who were underemployed. It was an extremely difficult time in \nthe history of our country. We do find ourselves in a very difficult \nposition now, and we need to do what we can to work our way out of this \nsituation so we don't have a depression but just a bad recession, and I \nam confident and hopeful we can do that.\n  Now, as I mentioned last night, we are going to work our very best to \ncomplete this legislation as soon as we can. But I was terribly \ndisappointed to see in the newspaper this morning ``GOP Reconsiders Use \nof Filibuster.'' It is a long article, but among other things it says:\n\n       A number of Republicans say they believe leadership may \n     need to bring back the use of procedural filibusters.\n\n  Well, all filibusters are procedural, so I don't know what that \nmeans. Then, on the carryover page, the headline, ``Filibusters May Be \nBack on Menu.'' And among other things, it says:\n\n       Using a procedural vote muddies the issue for the public \n     and can allow Senators to stick with their party and block a \n     bill while still being able to say they didn't technically \n     vote against the legislation.\n\n  President Obama has given the Congress a charge: Help America work \nour way out of the economic downturn we find ourselves in. Now, there \nisn't a Senator, Democratic or Republican, who doesn't acknowledge we \nhave a tremendous problem, but the question is, How are we going to \nwork through this problem? Of course, every one of us might suggest we \ncould write a better bill. We all have an ego, and so we think we could \ndo a better job than President Obama and his people. But we are at a \npoint now where we have, as I have indicated, 13 amendments pending--\nsoon we will have 14--and I have no problem with that--but there comes \na time when we need to work to complete the legislation.\n  Now, I am not in a hurry to finish this legislation. However, I would \nlike to get it done because we have to get to a conference report. I am \na little troubled, I have to acknowledge, by seeing that a number of \nRepublicans now are talking about the use of the filibuster. I can \nunderstand, when we were an evenly divided Senate, that people \ncomplained because they didn't have an opportunity to offer amendments. \nBut no one can complain about that now. So I say to everyone who is \nreconsidering the use of the filibuster: What more in the world could \nwe do to be cooperative than to try to move legislation through this \nbody? We have not tried to use the power of numbers. We simply want to \nget this legislation completed.\n  I say to everyone within the sound of my voice there are only 58 \nDemocrats. If they decide to have a filibuster on this or block it \nprocedurally, we still need two Republicans, and I am hopeful and \nconfident Republicans of good will recognize the hole we are in and \nwill help us get out of this.\n  I feel pretty good about the work we are trying to do. There were \nsome important amendments dealt with, as I indicated, last night, and I \nhave been told more are going to be offered, one by the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona and another by the junior Senator from Nevada that are in \nkeeping with the many statements the Republican leader has made dealing \nwith fixing the housing problems in America today. So I don't know of \nmore that we could do to try to make the Republicans feel a part of \nwhat is going on around here.\n  I do think most Republicans feel we are doing fine. But remember, it \nonly takes a few to get started again and then we have to file cloture \nand have a cloture vote Saturday or Sunday. I think it would be a shame \nto do that and wait 30 hours, as we did about 100 times in the last \nCongress. I hope we don't need to go through all that. We have too much \nto do for this country that is so vitally important to get hung up on \nsome procedural quagmire.\n  I only say this because I can read. I can read and I understand what \nappears to be coming at us on this legislation. I hope not because it \nwould be a real shame, seeing what our problems are, but a few \nRepublicans are bound and determined to throw a monkey wrench into \nPresident Obama's recovery plan. That would be too bad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/05/senate-section/article/S1616-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, briefly, I didn't see the article the \nmajority leader is referring to, but I will say again publicly today \nwhat I said publicly yesterday and privately to him as well. We are \npleased with the way the amendment process is being handled. We have \nmany additional amendments to be offered today.\n  The majority leader said earlier in the week, and I certainly agree, \nthat we know that the final vote will meet the 60-vote threshold. But \nregardless of what the article may have said, my view is we proceed as \nwe did yesterday, get as many votes as we can in, and later in the day \nwe can discuss what the endgame might be.\n  Now, the effects of the economic crisis are inescapable. Every day we \nhear about some of America's most venerable companies slashing jobs. \nThe longer we wait, the worse this crisis could become. But action \nsimply for the sake of action is always unwise. What is needed is the \nright action. The stimulus plan that Democrats in the House and Senate \nhave proposed is not the right action.\n  First, it is too costly. Including interest, the proposal before us \ncomes to a staggering $1.3 trillion, a figure that makes most people's \nhead spin. It includes billions in wasteful spending and it increases \npermanent Federal spending. Let me say that again: This bill, which is \nsupposed to be temporary, timely, and targeted, increases permanent \nFederal spending by nearly $300 billion, locking in bigger and bigger \ndeficits every year.\n  Apparently, the authors of this bill couldn't resist inserting scores \nof long-cherished pet projects. That is how you end up with $70 million \nfor climate research, tens of millions to spruce up Government office \nbuildings here in Washington, and $20 million for the removal of fish \npassage barriers in a stimulus package, as I indicated earlier, that \nwas supposed to be timely, temporary, and targeted.\n  The President said Sunday night we need to ``trim out things that are \nnot relevant to putting people back to work right now.'' It seems some \nin Congress haven't been listening. The bill's remaining defenders say \nit contains a number of projects essential to our long-term economic \nhealth. But with millions of struggling Americans learning to live with \nless, Congress needs to resist the temptation to load this bill with \nunnecessary spending that doesn't create jobs or which only touch on \nthe problems that demand long-term planning and serious thought.\n  Yes, now is the time to act. But it is not the time to act foolishly. \nThis week, Republicans have tried to improve this bill in a number of \nways. One goal was to cut out the waste and bring down the total cost. \nSo far, Democrats have rejected these efforts. Yesterday, they said no \nto cutting $25 billion from the bill. That used to sound like a lot of \nmoney, but in the context of this bill, it was a relatively paltry \namount. They said no to turning off spending on newly created programs, \nand they said no to turning off spending once the economy recovers.\n  In fact, throughout this entire debate, the two parties seem to have \nbeen guided by two different philosophies. The Democrats, it seems, \ndecided on a random dollar amount of about $900 billion and have spent \nmost of their time either defending it or adding to it. Republicans, on \nthe other hand, have thought all along that what we needed to do was to \nidentify the core problem first and then see how much money it would \ncost to fix it.\n  In our view, and in the view of most economists, the root problem of \nthe current crisis is housing--housing. It just so happens that fixing \nthat problem would cost a lot less than $1 trillion. In his op-ed in \nthis morning's Washington Post, the President wrote that in this debate \nwe can ``place good ideas ahead of old ideological battles, and a sense \nof purpose above the same narrow partisanship.'' I couldn't agree more. \nBut this bill doesn't do either one of those things.\n  Republicans remain committed to working with the President and with \nour friends on the other side to address this crisis. We agree \nsomething must be done, but it will require a lot more\n\n[[Page S1617]]\n\nwork. Today, Republicans will present in greater detail our ideas for \nmaking this stimulus work. Our friend and colleague, Senator McCain, is \nhere now to explain his proposal.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Arizona is eagerly \nawaiting the opportunity to offer his amendment. I only have a couple \nof words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/05/senate-section/article/S1617-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, to set the stage a little for today, to \ngive Senators an opportunity to know the lay of the land, yesterday the \nSenate put in quite a long day, as we all know. By my count, we \nconsidered 28 amendments, we conducted 8 rollcall votes, and we \naccepted a number of amendments by voice vote.\n  I want to highlight one amendment adopted, the Isakson-Lieberman \namendment, which provides Federal income tax credit for home purchases. \nThis amendment addresses one of the central points that Senators on the \nother side of the aisle have been raising, namely that we need to \naddress the housing market.\n  I might say, Senators on both sides of the aisle are concerned about \nthe degree to which we are addressing the housing market. We adopted \nthe Isakson-Lieberman amendment that does just that, and I am proud we \naccepted their idea.\n  I want to clear up the record on the Cornyn amendment. Yesterday I \nraised a pay-go point of order against the Cornyn amendment. After the \nSenate failed to waive the budget provisions, the Chair ruled the \namendment violated the budget.\n  The budget rules require both the Presiding Officer and myself to \nrely on the Budget Committee to determine whether an amendment violates \nthe budget. Budget Committee staff advised my staff and the \nParliamentarian that there was a pay-go point of order against the \nCornyn amendment. But in reality the amendment did not violate the pay-\ngo rules.\n  I apologize to the Senator from Texas for raising that point of \norder. But as the vote to waive the budget was 37 in favor, 60 opposed, \nraising the point of order did not change the result and I hope my \nstatement now will clear up the record.\n  Looking forward, we expect another busy day today. I expect we will \nprocess a number of amendments. We may have rollcall votes throughout \nthe day. We may well work late into the evening. But I have good reason \nto hope we might finish this bill this evening, and that is a goal \ntoward which we are working.\n  For the information of Senators, 14 amendments are now pending. Those \namendments are: the underlying Finance-Appropriations Committee \nsubstitute amendment, No. 98; the Murray amendment No. 110; the \nFeingold amendment No. 140, regarding earmarks--I might add, the Murray \namendment No. 110 is with respect to infrastructure--again, the \nFeingold amendment No. 140 is with respect to earmarks; Thune amendment \n197, that is a House Republican alternative; Dorgan amendment No. 200, \nrunaway plants; Ensign amendment No. 353, substitute housing; Dodd \namendment No. 354, executive pay; Barrasso amendment No. 326, \nenvironmental laws; DeMint amendment No. 189, religious freedom; Boxer \namendment No. 363, environmental laws; Harkin amendment No. 338, auto \ntrade-in; Dodd amendment No. 145, foreclosure mitigation; McCaskill \namendment No. 125, CEO pay; McCaskill amendment No. 236, as modified--I \nthink that is with respect to the inspector general.\n  That is it so far. This morning we expect to hear from Senator McCain \non his substitute amendment. Thereafter, we expect to hear from \nSenators Ensign, Wyden, and Cantwell about amendments they intend to \noffer. Once again, I ask Senators to let the managers know about \namendments they intend to offer. The more we know, the more quickly and \nexpeditiously we can proceed. A little notice helps a lot here.\n  We had a great day yesterday. I expect another one today. Mind you, \nwe must move quickly because the recession is so deep. Americans are \ndepending on Congress to act. Let's act, let's get the job done. Other \nproblems that are very important can be pushed off to later dates, but \ntoday let's get this bill passed and in conference with the House so \nthe President can sign it and people can get some relief.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator has an urgent matter, I will be happy to \nyield.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Will the Senator from Montana answer a question? We have \nan amendment with Mr. Grassley that we wish to bring up. Can we get it \nin order as well?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Senator, offer your amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 364 to Amendment No. 98\n\n                   (Purpose: To propose a substitute)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the pending amendments be set aside \nand ask consideration of an amendment that I have at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S1618]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] for himself, Mr. \n     Graham, and Mr. Thune, proposes an amendment numbered 364 to \n     amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment I have is a product of a lot \nof work from a number of Senators on this side of the aisle. I \nespecially thank Senator Martinez of Florida, a great leader on this \nissue, along with Senator Thune, Senator Graham, and many other \nSenators who have been involved in this discussion. This is an \nalternative we believe would truly create jobs and stimulate our \neconomy. The total cost is around $421 billion.\n  I wish, before I describe the amendment--and I know others of my \ncolleagues want to discuss this amendment--I wish to point out it is \nvery clear that public opinion in this country is swinging against the \nproposal that is now before the Senate and was passed by the other \nbody. They are opposed because they see now in the Senate a $995 \nbillion package which could reach more than $1.2 trillion. Many \nAmericans, certainly now a majority, do not see it as a way to create \njobs and to stimulate our economy. They see it loaded down with \nunnecessary spending programs. They see it, very correctly, with policy \nchanges which deserve extended debate and voting on their own, such as \n``Buy American'' provisions, Davis-Bacon, giving Federal workers new \nwhistleblower protections. Some of these policy changes may be \nlaudable, others are not, at least in my view, but all of them deserve \ndebate and discussion rather than being placed in a piece of \nlegislation that is intended to stimulate our economy and create jobs.\n  I think it is time that we also understand how we got where we are. I \nhave been around this body long enough to recognize that we are now \nentering the final phase of consideration of this package. Whether it \nbe today or over the weekend or early next week, this bill will be \ndisposed of one way or another by the Senate. So how did we get to \nwhere we are today, with a $995 billion package, at least, or $1.2 \ntrillion, or perhaps more than that, with a bill that probably would \ncreate, in the view of the administration--and I do not agree with it--\n3 million jobs, which would mean that each job that is created by it \ncosts the taxpayers $275,000. I do not think many Americans believe \nthat each job created should cost $275,000 of their hard-earned tax \ndollars.\n  In fact, the response my office is getting borders on significant \nanger when we talk about many of the funding programs that are in the \nstimulus bill. I will go through several of them later on, but $400 \nmillion for STD prevention; $40 million to make park services more \nenergy efficient; $75 million for smoking cessation. It is hard to \nargue that, even though these provisions, many of them, may be \nworthwhile, they actually create jobs. So we have strayed badly from \nour original intent of creating a situation in America to reverse the \nterrible decline and economic ditch in which we find the American \neconomy, to the point we have had spending programs and policy \nprovisions which have nothing to do with stimulating the economy and \ncreating jobs. It may be Government--let me put it this way. It may be \nlegislative activity, possibly, at its worst.\n  We are offering today an alternative at less than half the cost that \nwe think creates jobs and stimulates the economy. I remind my \ncolleagues, despite the rhetoric about bipartisanship, this bill \noriginated in the House of Representatives, as is constitutionally \nappropriate. There was no Republican input whatsoever. It passed the \nother body on a strict party-line basis with the loss of 11 Democrats \nand came over to this body, where in both the Appropriations and the \nFinance Committees, almost every Republican amendment was rejected on \nparty lines.\n  I appreciate very much that the President of the United States came \nover to address Republican Members of the Senate and Republican Members \nof the House. The tenor of his remarks I think was excellent. But the \nfact is, we did not sit down and seriously negotiate between Republican \nand Democrat. I have been involved in many bipartisan efforts in this \nbody, for many years, that have achieved legislative result. The way \nyou achieve it is not to come over and talk to a body. The answer is to \nsit down and seriously negotiate and come up with compromises which \nresult in legislation which is good for the country.\n  That has not happened in this process. Again, the American people are \nfiguring it out. I am confident, because of the way this process has \ntaken place, that gap, which is now 43-37, the majority of the American \npeople opposing this package, will grow.\n  A majority of the American people still believe we have to stimulate \nthe economy and create jobs. I agree with them. But to spend $1.2 \ntrillion on it, and have no provision for when the economy recovers to \nput us back on the path of fiscal sanity and stability--as the \namendment that I had last night was rejected; we got 44 vote--does not \nprovide the American people with confidence that spending will stop at \nsome time.\n  One thing they have learned is that spending programs that are \ninitially supposed to be temporary become permanent. They become \npermanent. That is a historical fact.\n  So we have initiated nearly $1 trillion--many in new spending, some \nhundreds of billions of dollars in new spending--with no provision, \nonce the economy has recovered--and the economy will recover in \nAmerica--this is no path to balancing the budget. Instead, we laid a \n$700 billion debt on future generations of America in the form of TARP, \nwe are laying $1.2 trillion additional in the form of this bill, and \nanother half a trillion dollars in the omnibus appropriations bill, and \nthen we are told there will be a necessity for another TARP, which \ncould be as much as $1 trillion, because of our declining economy. Yet \nthere has been no provision whatsoever, once the economy recovers, to \nput us back on a path to balancing the budget and reducing and perhaps \neliminating--hopefully eliminating--this debt we have laid on future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  I used to come down to the floor here, and have over the years, and \nargue against provisions in appropriations bills--which, by the way, \nhas led to corruption. I notice there is another individual staffer who \nis being charged today, or yesterday, for inappropriate behavior with \nMr. Abramoff.\n  There used to be hundreds of thousands and sometimes thousands. Now, \nthey are in the millions and billions, tens of millions and billions. \nMy how we have grown.\n  Do we need $1 billion for national security at the Nuclear Security \nAdministration Weapons Activities to create jobs? We may need $1 \nbillion for National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Activity, \nbut to say it will create jobs and will stimulate the economy is a \nslender reed.\n  There is nobody who appreciates more than this person the \ncontribution that Filipino war veterans made to winning the Second \nWorld War. We are going to give millions of dollars to those who live \nin the Philippines. Do not label that as job stimulation.\n  Smoking cessation is something that we all support. How does $75 \nmillion for smoking cessation create jobs within the next years that \nwould justify expenditures of $75 million?\n  This body, in the name of increasing health care for children, raised \ntaxes by some $61 billion, I guess it is, on tobacco use. So we now \nhope people will use tobacco in order to pay for insurance for \nchildren. But the fact is, $75 million for smoking cessation should be \nan issue that is brought up separately and on its own. And the list \ngoes on and on and on.\n  Our proposal--I am grateful for the participation of so many \nSenators--would allocate approximately $275 billion in tax cuts. It \nwould eliminate the 3.1 percent payroll tax for all employees for 1 \nyear and use general revenues to pay for the Social Security \nobligation.\n  It would allocate $60 billion to lower the 10-percent tax bracket to \n5 percent for 1 year. It would lower the 15-percent tax bracket to 10 \npercent for 1 year. It would lower corporate tax brackets from 35 \npercent to 25 percent for 1 year.\n\n[[Page S1619]]\n\n  We alarmed the world with the ``Buy American'' provisions which are \nincluded in this bill. The reaction has been incredible, and the fact \nis, jobs flee America for a number of reasons. But one of them is we \nhave the highest business taxes of any nation in the world. We used to \nhave among the lowest.\n  So if we really want to create jobs in America and attract capital \nand investment for the United States of America, we need to lower the \ncorporate tax bracket. We need to have accelerated depreciation for \ncapital investments for small businesses. We need to assist Americans \nin need, there is no doubt about that. There are Americans who are \nwounded and are hurting today. It is not their fault.\n  We need to extend the unemployment insurance benefits. That is a $38 \nbillion pricetag. We need to extend food stamps. We need to extend \nunemployment insurance benefits, make them tax free. That is a $10 \nbillion pricetag. And, of course, we need to provide workers with \ntraining and employment. That is a $50 billion cost.\n  We need to keep families in their homes. We needed, and we did adopt \nlast night, the $15,000 tax credit. But we also need to fund the \nincrease in the fee that servicers receive from continuing a mortgage \nand avoiding foreclosure. We need to have GSE and FHA conforming loan \nlimits. That is $32 billion. We also, by the way, need to do more in \nthe housing area.\n  You know, it is interesting in all of these spending proposals we \nhave, there is not one penny for defense, not one penny. Obviously, we \nare going to have to reset our military. We need to replace the aging \nequipment that has been used so heavily in Iraq and will be needed in \nAfghanistan.\n  We need to improve and repair and modernize the barracks, the \nfacilities and infrastructure that directly support the readiness and \ntraining of the Armed Forces. We do not have that in the now $995 \nbillion package that is before us. Obviously, we need to spend money on \nmilitary construction projects which will create jobs immediately. \nThose people who say that is not the case, I can provide for the record \nadequate information that many of our military construction projects \ncould begin more quickly than those that are not on our military bases \nbecause of environmental and other concerns.\n  We need to spend $45 billion on transportation infrastructure. There \nare grants to States to build and repair roads and bridges, including \n$10 billion for discretionary transportation grants, and $1 billion for \nroads on Federal lands. Public transit, obviously, we need to fund, and \nairport infrastructure improvements are necessary, along with small \nbusiness loans. That is about $63 billion in our proposal.\n  Finally, the American people believe, and I think correctly, spending \nis out of control in our Nation's Capital. We continue to spend and \nspend and spend. We not only have accumulated over a $10 trillion \ndeficit, this will add another $1 trillion or more. I mentioned the \nTARP of $700 billion, all of which is being paid for--we are printing \nmoney in order to fund it.\n  At some point we are going to have to get our budget balanced or our \nchildren and our grandchildren are going to pay the bill. I recommend \nthat this body hear as much as possible from David Walker, former head \nof the Government Accountability Office, in the Congress of the United \nStates. He paints a stark picture. In my view, it is also time that we \nestablish entitlement commissions: one for Social Security and one for \nMedicare-Medicaid and make recommendations so we can act on what is a \nmulti-trillion-dollar deficit in Social Security and over a $40 \ntrillion debt on Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Unless we address these long-term entitlement issues, there is no way \nwe are going to be able to prevent the majority of Americans' taxes \nfrom being devoted to those two programs. So we need to establish those \ncommissions and we need to put them to work and we need to put them to \nwork right away.\n  Now, I am told there is general agreement. Why not do it now? Why not \ndo it now? We also need better accountability, better transparency, \nbetter oversight, and better results. Among many disappointments we \nhave over TARP, one was that we were told the Congress and the American \npeople would have oversight and transparency, and they would know \nexactly how that initial $350 billion was being spent.\n  The American people and Members of Congress have been bitterly \ndisappointed as TARP shifted from one priority to another. Funds went \nto the automotive industry, which none of us had anticipated when we \nvoted for and approved it. We need more transparency and accountability \nand oversight of how this, probably the biggest single emergency \nspending package in the history of this country, is being spent.\n  I notice I have other Members here who wish to speak on this issue. I \nhope we can pass this alternative, some $421 billion, to what has now \nsurged to over $1 trillion. It probably may not pass for the reasons of \nnumbers, but if we do not sit down and negotiate and come up with a \npackage that is more than a $50- or $60- or $80 billion reduction, when \nwe are talking about $1.2 trillion, the American people will not be \nwell served.\n  They will not be well served by requiring Davis-Bacon, they will not \nbe well served by requiring ``Buy American,'' they will not be well \nserved by spending their hard-earned dollars on unnecessary programs \nthat even though in the eyes of some may have virtue, have no or very \nlittle association with job creation and relief for Americans who are \nstruggling to stay in their homes and either keep their jobs or go out \nand find a new one.\n  I believe the United States of America will recover from the economic \ncrisis. I have a fundamental faith, belief, that American workers are \nthe most productive, the most innovative, and the best in the world. \nBut they need some help right now. What they need is the right kind of \nhelp.\n  I urge my colleagues, when you see the money that is being spent in \nthe name of job creation and stimulus that is laying a debt burden on \nour children and our grandchildren, we need to have serious \nconsideration of this kind of spending because it is not fair, not only \nto this generation of Americans but to future generations as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the Senator \nfrom Arizona, in particular on his amendment, but I also would like to \nrespond in a most general way.\n  Let's have the right starting point. Barack Obama has been President \nof the United States for 2 weeks and 2 days. He did not create this \neconomic crisis; he inherited this economic crisis. This economic \ncrisis we face in this country has brought down growth of our gross \ndomestic product, which is the measurement of the value of all goods \nand services in the United States, to the lowest point of growth in 25 \nyears.\n  Did Barack Obama create that? No, he inherited that. We know we have \nlost jobs, dramatic losses of jobs--500,000 in December, 600,000 in \nJanuary. I do not know where this will end. Did Barack Obama create \nthat situation? No, he inherited that situation.\n  What led us to this point? Well, there are a litany of things to \nwhich you can point. Some of it goes back to the failed policies of the \nprevious administration. When we identified the weakness in the \nAmerican economy last year, President George W. Bush came to the \nDemocratic Congress and said: I know the solution. It has been the \nsolution all along. It will work again. We need tax cuts. If we can \nsend $300 to every American citizen, the economy will recover. The \nDemocratic Congress accepted George W. Bush's solution for the problem, \nenacted a program of tax cuts, $150 billion worth of tax cuts, sent the \nmoney to families across America, who I am sure appreciated it.\n  How much did they spend? About 15 percent. They used the remainder of \nthe money to put into savings and to pay off their credit cards. Well, \nfor each family that was a blessing. It was helpful. From the viewpoint \nof the economy, it did not work. We continued to go downhill.\n  This notion from the other side of the aisle that tax cuts solve \neverything has failed. It is part of the failed policies of the \nprevious administration that have brought us to this moment in history.\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\n  When President Bush was elected to office, he inherited a surplus in \nthe Federal budget from the Clinton administration, a surplus. And he \ninherited the accumulated debt of the United States of America from \nGeorge Washington until George W. of $5 trillion.\n  What happened to the national debt under the Bush administration's 8 \nyears? It more than doubled. It more than doubled because the President \ninsisted then in sending tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America \nand in waging a war without paying for it. We dragged ourselves deeply \ninto debt with not only the complicity but the cooperation and with the \nenthusiastic approval of the other side of the aisle. That is where we \nare today, with a debt over $10 trillion, with an economy flat on its \nback, with the failed policies of the last 8 years creating the \neconomic crisis we face today. President Barack Obama, in office for 2 \nweeks and 2 days, did not create this crisis. But the people of America \nsaid last November 4: Do something about the way you are running the \nGovernment. Bring real change to this town. Find solutions to our \nproblems and, for goodness' sake, work together. We are tired of all \nthe squabbling on Capitol Hill between Democrats and Republicans. \nFinally, accept this challenge of setting the economy straight and work \ntogether.\n\n  President Obama in 2 weeks and 2 days in office went to the \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives asking for their \ncooperation and their assistance. When this measure of stimulus \nrecovery was called in the House, not one single Republican \nRepresentative would join in that effort.\n  Now it comes to the Senate, where we need 60 votes. We will need \nseveral Republicans to step up and hear the lesson from the last \nelection and help us move forward. This is the measure before us. It is \nvoluminous. It costs about $900 billion, a substantial sum of money. \nBut it has been calculated to try to get the economy moving forward, to \ntry to save and create 3 to 4 million jobs in America. It is about the \njobs.\n  Now we have a proposal from Senator McCain to spend less than half. \nWhat will that cost us--1.5 to 2 million American jobs. They are \nprepared on the other side of the aisle to accept what I consider a \nhalfway response to a major American problem.\n  Then they have their bill of particulars, their objections to this \nmeasure, President Obama's recovery plan. I have listened carefully and \nmeasured and added up their arguments against these measures. It turns \nout, if I could do this in a symbolic way, that their measures account \nfor one page of this bill. Listen to the things they list that they \nfind so objectionable. They account in dollar terms to about one page \nof this bill. Listen to what they have to say. Let's go into some of \nthe particulars we have heard repeatedly. Smoking cessation, $75 \nmillion. I happen to believe passionately in this issue, passionately \nbecause I lost my father to lung cancer when I was a little boy, \npassionately because I have fought the tobacco companies as long as I \nhave been in public life, passionately because I know tobacco-related \ndisease is the No. 1 killer in America. I believe in this. I have given \nmy public career to it. But we decided, because of the objection to one \npage, to remove it.\n  My message to the Republican side of the aisle is: Read the bill. \nSmoking cessation programs are no longer in the bill. That is a fact.\n  Let me also note, Senator McCain said something which is not \naccurate. I want to call his attention to it, as he is in the Chamber. \nSenator McCain said there is not one penny for defense in this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was incorrect in that statement. I was \nonly speaking about the reset. We need a lot more. I would like to \nacknowledge that I was incorrect in that statement.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Senator McCain suggests $4 billion in defense spending in his \namendment. The bill contains $4.5 billion in defense spending already. \nI acknowledge that we all make mistakes, but we have done well by \ndefense. We can do better, but we have not ignored our national \nsecurity nor the men and women in uniform in this important stimulus \npackage.\n  Let me also say, there have been arguments made that we need more \noversight in this bill. I don't want to waste a single taxpayer dollar. \nI want to make sure that money is well spent. I call the attention of \nSenator McCain and the Republican side of the aisle to page 9 of the \nbill. On page 9--and those that follow--there is item after item where \nwe are providing additional funds to inspectors general in each of the \ndepartments to keep an eye on the spending in this bill.\n  Let me read what it says:\n\n       In addition to the funds otherwise made available, hereby \n     appropriated are the following sums to the specified offices \n     of inspectors general to remain available until September 30, \n     2013, for oversight and audit of programs, grants, and \n     projects funded up under this act.\n\n  Oversight is important, but oversight is included in this bill.\n  I heard Senator McConnell. I have heard Senator McCain. They object \nto the idea of making Government buildings more energy efficient. How \nshortsighted can they be? If you own a home, is it worth insulating the \nhome, if it costs a little bit of money this year, knowing that it will \nsave you money in heating costs for years to come? Would you put in \nthermal windows? Would you insulate your home? It is a practical \ndecision made by families every day. When we suggest including money in \nthis bill so that the Government buildings we pay for and the heat and \nair-conditioning in these buildings we pay for is done in an energy-\nefficient way, it is ridiculed--in the words of Senator McConnell, \n``money to spruce up buildings.'' We are not talking about planting \nflowers, we are talking about energy efficiency. The notion that that \nis wasteful? Is it wasteful for your family if you get rid of the \nincandescent bulbs and buy fluorescents? No. It is smart. We need that \nkind of approach when it comes to energy.\n  Then Senator McConnell criticized $70 million, using the money for \nresearch in climate change. There is at least one Republican Senator \nwho calls climate change a hoax, but I think only one. Most of us \nunderstand something is happening in this world. The climate is \nchanging and not for the better. Global warming is happening, and it \nchanges weather patterns--hurricanes in months of the year when we have \nnever seen them, storms we have never seen before. Should we just \nignore this and say: Maybe God will take care of it or do we have an \nobligation to do something about it? Will it affect our economic \nfuture? Of course it will. They ridicule the $70 million in this bill \nfor global warming and climate change. I don't understand that.\n  Let me also say, Senator McCain has suggested in his bill that there \nwill be $276 billion in tax cuts. I say to him, in the bill we have \nbefore us from President Obama, there is $370 billion in tax cuts \nalready. Senator McCain is reducing tax cuts for American families. \nDoes that make it a stronger bill, a better bill for revitalizing the \neconomy? I don't think so.\n  The bottom line is this: President Obama inherited the worst economic \ncrisis in 75 years. It is the product of many factors, but it also \nclearly is the product of failed policies of the past. Returning to \nthose policies over and over is the definition of insanity, to do the \nsame thing over and over when it fails. That is what this amendment \ndoes. It returns to the same worn, unfortunately, unsuccessful concepts \nfrom the past.\n  What President Obama brings us today is an opportunity to step \nforward, to work together and do something about this economic crisis. \nThis bill not only provides a helping hand to the unemployed, giving \nthem additional money each week, it provides an opportunity for many of \nthem to have health insurance which they have lost when they lost their \njobs. It provides a helping hand for the poorest among us who are \nstruggling to get by in areas such as food stamps. It provides a safety \nnet for the most unfortunate circumstances facing Americans. But it \ninvests in good-paying jobs, too, building roads and bridges and \nhighways, the infrastructure that builds the economy of the 21st \ncentury, making certain we invest billions of dollars into health care \ntechnology so we can computerize medical records so that we have better \noutcomes in medical care and so that it is a safer experience for\n\n[[Page S1621]]\n\nmost Americans. There is more money as well in education. If we don't \nput money into education, how can we ever believe we are going to have \nthe leaders we need tomorrow? There is more money for 21st-century \nlibraries and laboratories and classrooms. Isn't that what we want for \nour children and grandchildren? There is money for energy research and \nenergy efficiency so we can lessen our dependence on foreign oil and \nbuild this economy with homegrown energy. These are the things included \nin the Obama plan.\n  This plan will fail without the help of Republican Senators. At some \npoint, I am hoping that at least a handful of Republican Senators will \nsay: We are willing to step forward and help.\n  They have 1 page of grievances out of a bill of more than 900 pages. \nThey should remember what one of the patriarchs and saints of the \nRepublican Party, Ronald Reagan, used to say. Ronald Reagan used to \nsay: If I can go into a negotiation and end up with 80 percent of what \nI wanted, it is a successful negotiation. Now we have Republicans, who \nsay kind words about the Gipper, the former President, saying that 80 \npercent isn't enough; 99 percent isn't enough. It has to be 100 \npercent. If we can find one page of grievances in this bill, it is good \nenough for us to walk away from it.\n  We cannot walk away from this crisis. We cannot walk away from this \nchallenge. If there was ever a time for us to come together with a \nsolution--not just a debate, bold action instead of tentative action \nwhich will accomplish half the job when we need to do the whole job, to \nbring about real change and reform--this is the day to do it.\n  I encourage colleagues on the other side of the aisle, please don't \nlet the perfect be the enemy of the good. Let's work together as the \nAmerican people asked us to on November 4 and do something about this \ncrisis. Let's not leave this effort on the floor of the Senate at the \nend of the day undone. Too many Americans are counting on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in an effort to get some order and move \nthings along, I would like to lock in the order of speakers, continuing \nour practice of alternating back and forth. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the next speakers recognized be the following Senators in the \nfollowing order: Senator Kyl, Senator Sanders, Senator Thune, Senator \nBaucus, then Senator Graham--actually, Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am here to speak in favor of the Sanders amendment. I \nwould like to speak right after him for a couple minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, with all \ndue respect to the Senator from Vermont, we should stay on this \namendment and have the speakers on this amendment, then move to the \nSanders amendment. The pending business is my amendment before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I may ask the Senator from Arizona, Senator Grassley \nand I will be pretty brief. I don't think we need more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sorry, but I will object. We are on this amendment, \nand the regular order of the Senate is this amendment at this time.\n  Mr. SANDERS. We would like some definitive time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will withdraw the request, and we will \nwork that out while Senator Kyl is speaking.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For the information of the Senator from Vermont, we have \na number of speakers over here, so I am not prepared to enter into a \ntime agreement on the debate on this amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if the Chair would please notify me when I \nhave spoken 4 minutes, I will be, in fact, that brief.\n  The Senator from Illinois quoted the Gipper, Ronald Reagan. That \nalways gets Republicans' ears perked up. When he said: I am always \nhappy to take 80 percent; I don't need 100 percent--Republicans would \nbe happy to take 80 percent. We would be happy to take 50 percent. In \nfact, probably most of us would be happy to take 30 percent. But so \nfar, virtually every Republican amendment has been defeated.\n  So when there is talk about the President ushering in an era of good \nfeeling by having us down to the White House and talking to us and \nlistening to us, that is great. We have all commented on our \nappreciation for the President's efforts. At some point, however, since \nRepublicans do have some good ideas, that has to be translated into \nsome of our ideas being a part of this bill.\n  I think the American people agree with us. A Gallup poll, a week ago, \nsaid 38 percent of the people would pass the bill; 54 percent would \neither reject it or require major changes in the bill. We are \nreflecting the mood of the Republic.\n  According to a Rasmussen survey, a poll from February 4: Support for \nthe stimulus has fallen now to 37 percent; 43 percent oppose. Two weeks \nago, 45 percent supported it. Last week, 42 percent supported it. Now \nit is down to 37 percent, and 43 percent oppose it.\n  So that is the reason Republicans are standing before this body \nasking that--because the American people want major changes in it, \nbecause a majority now oppose it--we should not have to take 100 \npercent or even 98 percent of the bill and then be accused of \npartisanship.\n  Republicans have good ideas, and one of them is the amendment pending \nby my colleague from Arizona. Without going through all of the \nelements, since I am very limited in my time, let me just note one of \nthe most important.\n  The Democratic Speaker of the House has said over and over, this bill \nneeds to be timely, targeted, and temporary. The Senator from Arizona \nis focusing on temporary. What he says, very briefly, is, when the \neconomy begins to recover, then all of this spending that otherwise \nwould be permanent should cease. So the amendment he has pending would \nrequire that once we have had two consecutive quarters of economic \ngrowth greater than 2 percent of inflation-adjusted GDP, then all of \nthe stimulus spending would cease and the unobligated funds would \nreturn to the taxpayer. At that point, then we would need to reduce \nspending to accommodate the huge cost of this legislation.\n  Now, that is a real test of where we are in this legislation. Is this \na question of getting all of this spending we wanted for the last 8 \nyears and we are going to spend out the majority of that spending after \nthe year 2011 or is this truly a stimulus bill that is targeted at \ngetting the economy moving again, and once that happens, then the \nspending for the future under this legislation ceases?\n  There are 34 new programs in this bill, new Government programs. \nThere is $180 billion-plus on mandatory--in other words, permanent--\nspending. That is not temporary. One of the things Senator McCain's \namendment stresses is, let's focus on the temporary. Once we begin \nrecovering, then stop spending all of this stimulus money.\n  Mr. President, there is a reason Republicans want an opportunity to \nhave our amendments debated and, hopefully, accepted, and that is \nbecause the American people have told us they want this legislation \nfixed. That is why I support the amendment of my colleague from \nArizona, which will go a long way toward that end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, later today I will be offering an \namendment with Senator Grassley, which I think is an extremely \nimportant amendment, which, in fact, deals very fundamentally with the \nunemployment and job crisis facing this country. There is no debate the \nAmerican people are furious at what happened on Wall Street, where a \nsmall number of executives have acted in an incredibly greedy manner, \nwith extreme recklessness, and perhaps illegal behavior, in plunging \nour country into a major and very deep recession.\n  As every American knows, we are losing huge numbers of jobs. What we \nare trying to do now on the floor of the Senate is do everything we can \nto prevent this country from falling into a deep depression. In the \nmiddle of all of this, in the middle of the greed and recklessness \nbeing shown by the major financial institutions of our country,\n\n[[Page S1622]]\n\nat a time when the taxpayers of this country are spending $700 billion \non a bailout, when the Fed is lending out trillions of dollars, what we \nsee is many of those bankers are providing huge bonuses to themselves. \nThey are furnishing their offices in lavish ways. They are buying jet \nplanes. They are doing all of these things which suggest to me they do \nnot know what world they are living in; they do not know what is going \non in America.\n  I want to point out today, with Senator Grassley, another part of \nthis terribly destructive behavior on the part of these financial \ninstitutions. During the last 3 months of 2008, the largest banks in \nthis country--because of the economic downturn especially on Wall \nStreet--have announced 100,000 job cuts within the financial industry \nitself. So 100,000 Americans are out on the street. What has been the \nresponse of Wall Street to the loss of 100,000 of their own workers? Do \nyou know what they have done? What these banks have announced is they \nare requesting 21,000 foreign workers over the next 6 years through the \nH-1B program to fill those jobs.\n  So let me repeat, Wall Street causes a crisis, causing millions of \npeople to lose their jobs, including 100,000 in financial institutions \nas well, 100,000 people who on average were making quite good wages \nwith decent-paying jobs. So what they are now trying to do is bring in \nforeign workers through the H-1B program, and they have requested \n21,000 H-1B visas over the next 6 years. Talk about adding insult to \ninjury.\n  The amendment Senator Grassley and I are offering is pretty simple. \nIt is essentially saying there will be a suspension of the H-1B program \nfor any institution that is receiving TARP funds for just 1 year. I \nwould have gone further, but we are just going to make it for 1 year.\n  Let me finish my remarks by quoting from a recent AP article just \npublished on Monday. This is what the AP writes:\n\n       Even as the economy collapsed last year and many financial \n     workers found themselves unemployed, the dozen U.S. banks now \n     receiving the biggest rescue packages requested visas for \n     tens of thousands of foreign workers to fill high-paying \n     jobs. . . . The major banks, which have received $150 billion \n     in bailout funds, requested visas for more than 21,800 \n     foreign workers over the past six years for senior vice \n     presidents, corporate lawyers, junior investment analysts and \n     human resources specialists.\n\n  Presumably Americans are unable to do these jobs.\n  The article continues:\n\n       The average annual salary for those jobs was $90,721, \n     nearly twice the median income for all American households. \n     During the last three months of 2008, the largest banks that \n     received taxpayer loans announced more than 100,000 layoffs.\n\n  The amendment is pretty simple. I hope we will have bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Grassley standing, and I would be happy \nto yield for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support the amendment that has just \nbeen described by the Senator from Vermont prohibiting banks which get \nTARP funds from hiring H-1B guest workers for this year. I support the \namendment because these companies should be hiring American workers \nduring these tough economic times, particularly when there are so many \nqualified Americans on the streets looking for jobs. The American \ntaxpayers who will be footing the bill on the stimulus money would \nagree with me. Banks that are getting taxpayer funds need to hire \nqualified Americans first before hiring foreign guest workers.\n  Many banks participate in the H-1B visa program. Over 6 years, the \nbanking industry has requested visas for over 21,000 foreign guest \nworkers. The purpose of the H-1B visa program is to assist companies in \ntheir employment needs where there is not a sufficient American \nworkforce to meet their technology and expertise requirements.\n  I am very OK with an H-1B program if American companies cannot find \nenough qualified Americans to do certain jobs that need that particular \nexpertise. Then we need to help those companies with those resources. \nHowever, H-1B and other worker visa programs were never intended to \nreplace qualified American workers. We do not want to put Americans at \na disadvantage. And now that many qualified, hard-working American bank \nworkers are unemployed, banks that want to hire workers will not have a \nhard time finding what they need from the American workforce.\n  I am concerned companies going through layoffs that currently employ \nH-1B workers will be retaining those guest workers rather than \nsimilarly qualified American employees. We hear announcements every day \nabout companies cutting large numbers of jobs. Yet many of these \ncompanies continue to advocate for H-1B visas and apply for them.\n\n  I am pretty sure these work visa programs were never intended to \nallow companies going through layoffs to retain foreign guest workers \nrather than similarly qualified American workers. I think in \nimplementing layoff plans, companies should ensure that American \nworkers have priority in keeping their jobs over foreign guest workers \non visa programs. I recently sent a letter to Microsoft asking a series \nof questions about the makeup of their layoff plan and encouraging the \ncompany to ensure that Americans are given priority in job retention.\n  Our immigration policy is not intended to harm the American \nworkforce. I firmly believe companies going through layoffs that employ \nH-1B visas have a moral obligation to protect American workers by \nputting them first during these difficult economic times. So I plan on \nlooking into this issue further and exploring whether legislation is \nnecessary there.\n  Again, I support the amendment Senator Sanders and I have put in. The \nbottom line is, employers should recruit qualified American workers \nfirst before hiring foreign guest workers. If banks are going to be \ngetting TARP money from the American taxpayers, then they should be \nhiring American workers. I want to emphasize, once again, I am not \nagainst the H-1B program. I think when we do not have workers in this \ncountry, we need to keep it going, but it is how it operates. That is \nalso why Senator----\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. After one sentence. That is why I also support Senator \nDurbin and I working together on a reform of the H-1B program.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor for a question or whatever the \nSenator might want.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \ndebate has concluded on the McCain amendment I be allowed to set aside \nthe McCain amendment so I can call up the Sanders-Grassley amendment \nNo. 306.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I feel constrained to object because there \nwas an understanding, an agreement, that the Ensign amendment would be \nthe amendment that would come up after the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Can we come up after the Ensign amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to the Senator, let me work this out with you \nprivately. I will find a way to accommodate the Senator.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain amendment. \nBefore I speak a little bit to the amendment itself, I want to remind \nmy colleagues why this debate is so important and why the McCain \namendment is so important to this debate.\n  Again, we are talking about a $1 trillion bill--$800 billion, up now \ninto $900 billion. When you add in interest, it is $1.2 trillion and \nchange. It seems as if every amendment that has been offered--we have \nhad a lot of Republican amendments that have attempted to cut out some \nof the wasteful spending, eliminate some of what I think is probably \nmost egregious about the bill, none of which has been accepted, \nironically. Ironically, the only amendments that have been accepted so \nfar have not decreased the size of the bill. They have added to the \nsize of the bill. This bill has gotten bigger.\n  I remind my colleagues--and I think it is important for the American \npeople to tune in because we throw numbers around here in Washington in \nan abstract way: millions, billions, trillions of dollars--exactly what \nthe dimensions are of what we are talking about.\n\n[[Page S1623]]\n\n  A trillion dollars: If you took one-hundred-dollar bills and lined \nthem end to end, you could literally go around the Equator almost 39 \ntimes; 969,000 miles of one-hundred-dollar bills lined end to end, \ngoing around the entire Earth right at the Equator almost 39 \ntimes. That is what we are talking about when we talk about the \ndimensions of $1 trillion. I might also add that if we look at where \nthis is coming from, we are borrowing. Let's be honest with the \nAmerican people. We are borrowing this money from future generations. A \nlot has been said on the floor about who is going to get hurt if we \ndon't do this, and I agree there are a lot of people hurting. \nUnemployment is high. Frankly, let's think about the people who are \ngoing to be hurting the most, and that is the next generation of \nAmericans who are going to inherit this enormous debt we are passing on \nto them.\n\n  To put it into perspective, between the Revolutionary War and Jimmy \nCarter's Presidency, the United States of America borrowed $800 \nbillion. From the entire time of the Revolutionary War to the Carter \nPresidency, there was $800 billion worth of borrowing. We are borrowing \nmore than $800 billion for this one piece of legislation, not to \nmention what comes next. We know we have a $1 trillion catchall \nspending bill coming at us which is the first time that the \ndiscretionary appropriations bill is going to exceed $1 trillion. We \nknow we are going to have a request for additional moneys coming from \nSecretary Geithner to stabilize the financial markets to the tune of \nseveral hundred billion dollars. We know there is going to be a \nsupplemental spending bill request for the ongoing conflicts in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Ironically, according to CBO, the bill that was passed \npreviously on SCHIP actually leads to $41 billion of deficit spending.\n  So all this spending we are doing, all this borrowing we are doing is \nbeing passed on to the next generation, and they are the people who are \ngoing to feel the brunt and the impact and hurt the most if we don't do \nthe responsible thing here today.\n  I think it is important that this particular amendment Senator McCain \nhas put forward and a number of us are cosponsoring be heard and fair \nconsideration be given because I think there are several things about \nit that differentiate and distinguish it from the bill we are debating, \nthe Democratic proposal that is on the floor.\n  One of the most important distinctions--and Senator McCain already \nmentioned it--is it comes in at less than half the cost: $421 billion. \nSo we are talking about borrowing over $800 billion--all the time from \nthe Revolutionary War to the Carter Presidency is the equivalent of \nwhat we are doing here--versus a much smaller approach and, in my view, \nmuch more fiscally responsible approach and, frankly, much more \ntargeted. Because the criteria that has been laid out at the beginning \nof this debate for what makes sense in terms of a stimulus is it should \nbe targeted, temporary, and timely. What we have before us is none of \nthe above. It is slow, it is unfocused, and it is unending. Mr. \nPresident, $140 billion of this bill is going to be very difficult to \nshut off because it adds to the baseline as a lot of mandatory spending \nis included.\n  I wish to also show my colleagues what the President's chief economic \nadviser, Larry Summers, said. He said this in the Financial Times on \nJanuary 6 of this year: ``Poorly provided fiscal stimulus can have \nworse side effects than the disease that is to be cured.''\n  Now, we have all talked about what is in this bill, and all the \nspending in it, including the $600 million for cars for Federal \nemployees, the money that goes into the seven-point-whatever-billion-\ndollars it is here that goes into Federal buildings--all good things. \nSenator McCain talked about smoking cessation. That is something we all \nsupport and believe in. But that ought to be handled in regular order. \nThose are not stimulus. Those are things that do nothing to contribute \nin the short term to creating jobs and helping get our economy back on \ntrack. In fact, the CBO said that 12 percent of the total amount in the \nbill we have before us would be spent in this year--2009--and less than \nhalf in 2009 and 2010, so much of what we are talking about is going to \nbe pushed off into the future when it is not going to do anything to \nstimulate the economy.\n  It does create some jobs--most of them are jobs here in Washington, \nDC--at great cost. For example, there are some jobs created at the \nState Department. The average cost per job created at the State \nDepartment according to this is over $1 million. On average, you take \n$900 billion and you divide it by about 3 million jobs, which is the \nestimate of what this would create, and we are talking about $300,000 \nper job.\n  Now, I might add that the average annual salary in my State of South \nDakota is under $30,000. Imagine how difficult it is to explain to my \nconstituents that we are going to borrow $1 trillion from their \nchildren and grandchildren to create jobs at a cost of $300,000 per \njob. That is an awfully difficult sell, particularly when they look at \nhow a lot of this money is spent. We have some requests from mayors and \ncity officials around the country, and these are all good things. I am \nnot downplaying at all the importance of many of these projects, but \nthere are requests here for 42 swimming pools, water slides, golf \ncourses, all sorts of things that you can't argue we ought to be \nborrowing $1 trillion from our children and grandchildren to fund and \nto support. So it is important we have something we can be for and that \ndoes, in fact, create jobs; that does, in fact, add to the economic \nrecovery, and that is fiscally responsible.\n  I wish to point out, as Senator McCain mentioned in his opening \nremarks, some of the things that are in his bill. It is appropriately \nfocused on housing because we believe--and I think rightly so--that \nhousing got us into this recession and housing is going to lead us out \nof this recession. It is focused on getting dollars into the hands of \nthe American taxpayers. The debate about whether you want to have \ngovernment spend the money or the American people spend the money is a \nvery simple one. I happen to believe if you allow the American people \nto spend the money, you get a much better return. When we get money \nback into the hands of Americans, they will help grow the economy. Two-\nthirds of our gross domestic product is in the form of consumer \nspending. You provide incentives for small businesses which create two-\nthirds or three-fourths of the jobs in our economy and that helps get \nthe economy back on track. That is in this bill.\n  Reducing marginal income tax rates from 15 down to 10, 10 down to 5, \ncutting the payroll tax in half for a year for employees gets money \nback into the hands of the American people so they can go out and help \nstimulate the economy and create jobs.\n  It also, as was noted earlier, makes some changes with regard to the \nunderlying bill where defense is concerned. We have some very serious \nneeds. Senator McCain mentioned this in his remarks and he talked about \nthe defense spending in his bill. There is some, frankly, defense money \nin the Democratic proposal--about $10 billion--mostly for military \nconstruction projects, but there is no money for reset. We have serious \nneeds out there. Senator McCain's amendment adds $7 billion for reset, \nto repair military equipment and replace direct battle losses, \nincluding $6.5 billion for the Army, $600 million for the Marines, $62 \nmillion for the Navy, and $83 million for the Air Force, which adds \nmoney for direct repair of military infrastructure and facilities. \nThese are things that need to be done and can be done quickly that will \nput money to good use, that do create jobs and serve an important \nnational purpose.\n  Now, the other thing his bill does is it puts money in for \ninfrastructure. Infrastructure arguably is something that does create \njobs out there, if they are shovel-ready projects that you can actually \nget going quickly. I think that is a good use in a reasonable way, not \nadding all kinds of projects that you are not going to do for many \nyears to come. But if you are getting money out there that actually can \nhelp fund projects that can get done in the short term, that is a good \nthing.\n  Unfortunately, much of the money in the Democratic proposal, as I \nsaid earlier, isn't going to get spent out for years. I offered an \namendment last night not to fund new programs, assuming it was going to \ntake new programs a long time to get implemented and up and running. \nThat amendment was defeated. The point of all this is to\n\n[[Page S1624]]\n\ndo things that in the short term create jobs. So there is $45 \nbillion in the McCain proposal for infrastructure.\n\n  The other thing I will say, which I think is critical--critical--in \nthis debate, because I said earlier that if we don't put some \nrestraints or some safeguards in here, this is going to get--the \nspending is going to go on forever. Senator McCain's proposal includes \na hard trigger so that when we recognize two consecutive quarters of \neconomic growth, positive GDP, this funding terminates. It is a \nfiscally responsible approach. He offered a freestanding amendment last \nnight that received 44 votes. I haven't seen any evidence in this \nChamber yet that anybody here is serious about adding any measure of \nfiscal responsibility or sanity to spending $1 trillion of our \nchildren's and grandchildren's money.\n  I think it is important that this amendment get a vote. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides to support this amendment, to try and do \nsomething that is fiscally responsible, that reduces the overall size \nof this, that addresses substantively the things in the bill--the \nshortcomings in the Democratic proposal--and do some things that \nactually will help stimulate the economy and create jobs. Senator \nMcCain's proposal represents a much better direction in which to head. \nIt costs a lot less, it does a lot more, so I hope my colleagues will \nbe able to support it.\n  One of my colleagues on the Democratic side got up a little earlier \nand said, Well, if it costs a little bit of money this year to do this \nor that, there isn't anything in this bill that costs a little bit of \nmoney. Everything in this bill costs a lot of money, and the people who \nare going to get hurt the most are the next generation who are going to \nbe handed the bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will, in fact, support the McCain amendment, and \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill that is before \nus, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It is designed to save \njobs, create jobs, and restore a sense of confidence and hope to the \npeople of this country.\n  We have seen extraordinary deterioration of the economy in this \ncountry. This morning, job figures released revealed an additional--\nover 600,000 jobless claims. In the last two months, we have lost \n500,000 jobs in each of the two preceding months. We have to act \ndecisively, dramatically, and with a scale that will have an effect on \nthe overall economy. That is I think inherent in the proposal President \nObama has sent us.\n  I salute Senator Inouye, the Appropriations Committee chair, and the \nsubcommittee chairmen and Chairman Baucus for their work in bringing \nthis bill to the floor. We have to not only revitalize our economy but \nrestore hope to the American people.\n  President Obama has set out a very ambitious goal. He wants to \nweatherize 2 million homes. It is not only to put people to work in \nAmerica with the skills of craftsmen and craftswomen, but in the future \nit is going to save us money. So this is not only an immediate response \nto a problem, but it is a long-term increase in our productivity and \nour ability to be competitive in a very difficult world economy.\n  I have also introduced an amendment which I will not call up, but it \nwould increase the weatherization funds and the LIHEAP funds and other \nfunds, but I hope in conference we can raise those totals.\n  We need these investments. This is the most perilous economic \nsituation a President has ever faced since the 1930s. This is the \ninheritance of 8 years of poor policy. This is the inheritance of a \nhuge increase in our national debt in the last 8 years. Under President \nBush we have seen our national debt explode. That is the legacy that is \nfacing the next generation of Americans today, and unless we revive \nthis economy, this situation will deteriorate, it will not stabilize, \nand it will not grow. That is our challenge. It is a more difficult \nchallenge today than it has been at any time in the last several \ndecades.\n  This is not a cyclical downturn. This is not an imbalance of supply \nand demand. This is not a situation where it will work itself out. We \nhave to take decisive action, and that is a big part of President \nObama's plan. Our crisis today has its roots in the last 8 years of \nmismanagement: an economic doctrine of tax cuts funded by deficit \nspending, skewed toward the rich, not toward working Americans; \ninadequate supervision of our financial markets; a lack of adequate \nrisk assessment by financial institutions throughout not only the \nUnited States but the world; and the very difficult and costly and \nunfunded war in Iraq and operations in Afghanistan.\n  We have to focus our attention on the present, but it is important to \nunderstand how we got here. President Bush inherited a $236 billion \nFederal budget surplus. His first order of business was to cut taxes \nwhich benefitted proportionately the wealthiest Americans, enacting \nthree major tax cuts between 2001 and 2003. These tax cuts added to the \nnational deficit, reduced our capacity to make much needed investments \nin infrastructure, education, and health care, and exacerbated income \ninequality. The median family income actually fell $2,000 between the \nyear 2000 and the year 2007. Families lost $2,000 of their income, \ndespite strong productivity and growth. Americans were working harder, \nbeing more innovative, more creative, and yet average families were \nlosing income.\n  In terms of jobs creation, the 2003 tax cut actually reduced job \ngrowth below the estimates the President was using to justify his tax \nproposals. As the wealthy thrived and corporate earnings skyrocketed, \ncapital investments did not keep pace. Instead, many corporations \ndecided to dole out handsome salaries and use their profits to buy back \nstock in pursuit of short-term boosts to share prices. This made the \noptions these executives enjoyed that much more valuable.\n  Corporate profits grew by 66 percent between 2000 to 2006, despite \nthe fact that annual national investment in nonresidential structures--\nlargely commercial structures such as factories and office buildings--\nfell by $130 billion or more than 30 percent. Overall investment in \nbuildings, equipment, and software grew by less than 6 percent.\n  Not only is there a fiscal deficit, there has been an investment \ndeficit in the United States in the last 8 years.\n  Over the past year, we have witnessed the long-term consequences of \nthese failed economic policies. Since the start of the recession, in \nDecember 2007, the number of unemployed individuals has grown by 3.6 \nmillion, and the national unemployment rate has risen to 7.2 percent.\n  In Rhode Island, it is particularly difficult. We have an \nunemployment rate of 10 percent, second only to Michigan. We have lost \na huge number of jobs. In fact, we have also seen a complementary \nincrease in foreclosures; as people lose their jobs, their ability to \npay their mortgages declines.\n  The lack of oversight in the financial markets in many ways fueled \nthe subprime mortgage crisis and led to the failings of Wall Street. We \nsaw rating agencies deficient and negligent in judgment and lacking \nindependence, which in turn led to a poor assessment of bond rating \nrisk. Investment banks took advantage of this system reaping windfall \nprofits through the creation of complex financial instruments, such as \ncollateralized debt obligations, which hid underlying risk. All of this \nfinancial engineering did not provide opportunities and hope for \nworking Americans.\n  Throughout this process, where were the principal regulatory \nagencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission? Simply put, \nthey were asleep at the wheel.\n  The environment of lax oversight and poor lending practices created a \nbubble in housing prices. The collapse of that bubble resulted in home \nloan defaults and falling housing values. The companies that owned \nthese assets saw their value plummet. All of this is contributing to \nthe dilemma and the crisis we see today. We are in a very dangerous \nsituation, with weak housing markets, stagnant wages, impaired consumer \nspending, which leads to further erosion of housing prices and further \nerosion of the economy. It is a vicious cycle and we have to break that \ncycle. We have to do it with this legislation.\n  We have seen a situation where Americans have to put off essential \nand important purchases, such as medicine, and they may have to defer \neducation for their children. They have to make these very difficult \nchoices. We have to make difficult choices. Spending on durable items, \nsuch as cars, appliances,\n\n[[Page S1625]]\n\nand furniture has plunged at a rate of 22.4 percent last quarter.\n  We have to get the economy moving again. We are in a situation where \nthis is not only our problem, it is an international problem. The \nglobal economy is in uncharted waters. According to the IMF, in 2009, \neconomic growth across the world will fall to 0.5 percent from 3.4 \npercent in 2008--the lowest rate since World War II. It is a worldwide \nphenomenon.\n  In response, we have to act quickly and decisively to pass this \nlegislation. It is estimated that with the plan President Obama has \nsuggested, we can provide 13,000 additional jobs in Rhode Island. That \nwill be good news.\n  With banks failing, automakers on the verge of bankruptcy, and \npervasive unemployment, the American people are rightfully asking us to \nrespond, and do so quickly and decisively. We have to also recognize \nthat this action is integrally related to the financial markets, the \nbanking system, the financial system, and without increased consumer \ndemand and increased consumer confidence they will fall further and \nrequire additional help. In order to provide support to financial \ninstitutions, in addition to the TARP funds, we have to pass this \nlegislation to get people back into the marketplace. We also have to \nrecognize that as we get the economy moving, we have to modernize our \nregulatory system. Our regulators need to have the tools and resources \nto get the job done. We have seen the problems with the unregulated \nhedge funds, private equity concerns, and the lack of enforcement by \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. That has to be changed. The \nAmerican people will not tolerate business as usual. The first act is \nto get our economy moving forward. This legislation proposed by the \nPresident will begin to do that.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 78 percent of the \nfunding in this bill could be spent in the next 18 months. This is \ntimely; it is responsive.\n  According to JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli, the Recovery \nAct would add about 4 percentage points to the second and third quarter \nGDP growth. He recognizes that a lot of infrastructure projects we are \nproposing will take some months to get off the ground. The first major \ninput will be the tax breaks, transfer payments, and State and local \ngovernment aid. We will see a growth in terms of the GDP. We will also \nsee the effect of this program taking hold in our economy. It is \nnecessary to pursue this approach.\n  This bill gets the most ``bang for the buck,'' with funding to \nmodernize unemployment insurance, increase unemployment insurance \nbenefits, and extend the existing Federal unemployment insurance \nextensions on the books to cover those recently laid off. It will \nprovide immediate help to unemployed Americans and provide an immediate \nboost to consumer spending.\n  Tax cuts comprise about one-third of this legislation. But unlike the \nBush tax cuts, this legislation provides targeted relief to 95 percent \nof working Americans. An estimated 470,000 Rhode Islanders alone would \nreceive tax relief. This is all extremely important.\n  We also are going to make improvements to a whole range of \ninfrastructure--roads, bridges, highways, public housing. All of these \nprograms will receive additional attention. We are going to bolster \nState and local governments, because if we don't provide them \nadditional resources, they will begin to cut back vital programs and it \nwill be contradicting what we are trying to do at the Federal level. If \nthey cut back, that won't help us move the economy forward. This \nassistance to State and local governments is important.\n  Rhode Island is prepared to receive, under this legislation, $220 \nmillion to help local school systems and communities pay for critical \nservices, $46 million to improve local drinking water and sewer \nsystems, and $132 million for road and bridge repairs. Right now, \nregarding the major interstate highways through Rhode Island all \ntractor-trailers are required to detour, get off the road, and drive \nmiles out of the way through local streets and then get back on the \nhighway; and at the same time it is required that the State provide \nState police officers in both directions 24 hours a day to ensure that \nthey do that. That is inefficient. That is a waste of resources. If we \ncan fix those roads and bridges, we can provide for a more efficient \nuse of our highways and put the money more appropriately to generate \njobs and productivity. That is one example.\n  Also, there is going to be strict accountability and transparency in \nthis proposal. Part of this legislation will provide for hiring \nadditional auditors to track where the funds are going. There will be \npublic acknowledgment of what projects are funded and the process of \nthe projects.\n  This legislation is absolutely essential. We have to do it. We have \nto move decisively, quickly, and I hope we can do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, while we are debating this trillion \ndollar bill, we need to keep our eye on the ball. We have a preliminary \nstudy that I have referred to a couple times in previous debates by the \nCongressional Budget Office, which shows that jobs created by the \neconomic stimulus legislation being debated in the Senate would cost \nthe taxpayers between $100,000 and $300,000 apiece.\n  These numbers should be contrasted to those under the January \nbaseline of the Congressional Budget Office, in which there is no \nstimulus, that shows that the gross domestic product per worker is \nabout $100,000. In other words, without the bill, the new analysis \nindicates that the cost of each stimulus job to be as much as three \ntimes more than jobs created without the stimulus bill.\n  There has been a lot of talk about getting the most ``bang for the \nbuck,'' but there is no talk about actually making sure it happens so \nthat Americans get the help they need. Before Congress spends another \ntrillion dollars, we ought to make sure we are getting our money's \nworth. I will reiterate a caution that I gave the other day. Before \nthis bill passes the Senate, we ought to have the full analysis of the \nCongressional Budget Office that they said would take a few days to get \ndone. We need to know what these jobs are going to cost so we get our \nmoney's worth. We are the caretakers of the taxpayers' dollars--tossing \nmoney at a program, when you figure that our gross domestic product \nwould produce about $100,000 per worker--and we have in this bill these \njobs costing up to $300,000 apiece.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to enthusiastically support the \nbill of my good friend and colleague Senator John McCain. Let me \naddress one thing that was said. My good friend Senator Jack Reed said \nwe are in this deficit problem because of the way George Bush spent \nmoney. I happened to look back at the last two Congresses. There was \nnot an appropriation bill that Senator Reed voted against.\n  The President cannot spend money; only the Congress can spend money. \nThat is one of the reasons we are here today having alternatives \npresented; it is because Congress is in charge of the purse. There are \nobjections and disagreements and different ways of looking at \neverything. I think most Members want to look at this legislation \ncalled a ``stimulus''--I call it a ``spending'' bill--and try to get it \nback to something that is targeted, timely and, more important, \ntemporary. That is what Senator McCain's substitute proposal does.\n  As a matter of fact, the differences we have today are over economic \nrecovery. The question that Americans should ask is: Is economic \nrecovery the result of how much Congress spends or is economic recovery \nabout how targeted our spending is and how we use those dollars to \nleverage job creation and investments in job creation? I believe it is \nthe latter. I believe we have to encourage investment.\n  Senator Thune did a great job of talking about the trillion dollar-\nplus on this bill--$900 billion plus in spending, at a very crucial \ntime, plus interest, comes to about $1.2 trillion. I point out to my \ncolleagues that several weeks ago, we appropriated $350 billion to the \nTARP. This week, I am convinced that this Senate and this Congress will \nhand to the President that $1.2 trillion spending bill. It is my \nunderstanding that appropriators plan to\n\n[[Page S1626]]\n\ncome to the floor in the next couple weeks with an omnibus spending \nbill of a trillion dollars. It is also my understanding that the \nSecretary of the Treasury will suggest to the President that the \nadministration come back to the Congress in the very near future to ask \nfor at least a half trillion dollars in additional TARP money, meaning \nthat over a 60-day period this Congress could spend almost $3 trillion.\n  Let me put that in perspective. If you extrapolate that almost $300 \nbillion is the interest on this bill alone, that means that the \ncommitment, the obligation, the debt to the next generation that we \nwill do in this Congress over the next 60 days is almost a trillion \ndollars in interest. Ask yourself, can your children retire that debt \nover their lifetime, much less pay back the money we have spent?\n  It is clear that the McCain proposal will fail. I hate to start a \ndebate with an admission that that is going to happen. But when one of \nthe key elements of this bill is rejected, with only 44 members \nsupporting it, I think the die is pretty well cast.\n  What was that key point of the McCain proposal? It simply said this: \nAfter two quarters of positive growth over 2 percent, adjusted for \ninflation against GDP, that an amazing thing would happen in \nWashington: we would stop spending money. If for some reason we still \nhad money left out of the $1.2 trillion commitment, it would stop; that \nthere is no longer a reason to fuel growth if, in fact, we have growth \nthat is happening and that we would do a rescission on the rest of the \nmoney. In other words, we would pull back the commitment we made, and \nwe would reserve that money for reduction of our debt.\n  In addition to that, he said we will automatically go in and make \nsure that every new program that was created, 30-plus programs, were no \nlonger there, they would be eliminated. For the people who follow \ninside-the-park way we do things in Washington, we would go to the \nbaseline of spending and we would take all of that new spending out of \nthe baseline so we did not automatically start next year's \nappropriations at a higher point, reflective of what is supposed to be \ntargeted, timely, and temporary. It did not pass.\n  More Members said: We understand we said we want it targeted, timely, \nand temporary, but we really didn't mean it on the temporary part; we \nwant to expand permanently the size of spending for the Federal \nGovernment. When we do that in a deficit situation, we have compound \ninterest. Just as many of us as we grew up understood and learned, \ncompound interest was something we gained on deposits. This is compound \nexpenses, obligations to future generations.\n  What Senator McCain's substitute does is it focuses how much we spend \nand where we spend it.\n  We have been criticized because Senator McCain's substitute proposal \nonly spends a little over $400 billion. You have to ask yourself: Who \ncame up with $900 billion? I haven't heard an economist saying: If you \nspend $900 billion, you will solve the economic crisis in America. This \nis a number that has been pulled out of the sky. It was constructed \nbased on where people wanted to spend money.\n  I compliment the chairman because last night he accepted--this body \naccepted by voice vote an amendment in Senator McCain's substitute \nwhich jump-starts housing again, and this bill was deficient on jump-\nstarting housing. I think this is a good amendment they accepted. It is \npart of the core of the McCain substitute.\n  Part of the core of the McCain substitute, though, is also making \nsure we leave money in the pockets of the American people--$275 billion \nthat has been proven over time to stimulate growth, to go into the \neconomy, not targeted at rich people. We have had that debate way too \nmuch. It is targeted at individuals by eliminating the payroll tax for \n1 year going away. It is targeted at people at the 15-percent tax rate \ngoing to 10 and the people at the 10-percent tax rate going to 5. It is \ntargeted at the individuals who have an income, who are likely to \nspend.\n  I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. What we have \nto do, in addition to stabilizing the financial markets, is get us \nparticipating in the U.S. economy again. This alternative proposal is \ntargeted to leave that $275 billion in the pockets of the American \npeople. It is targeted to put $50 billion into programs that help those \nwho have been most affected by job loss, by the need to feed their \nfamilies. It has targeted $32 billion to restart this housing market, \nand it has targeted $64 billion in a combination of infrastructure in \ncommunities across this country and our military installations and the \nreset of programs that are absolutely vital.\n  Let me end where I started by saying that the single most important \nthing the McCain substitute does is it has a 3-year sunset. It says \nthat in 3 years, everything goes away. If, in fact, this bill \naccomplishes what its author says it will, then we will not wait 3 \nyears, if you accept this spending proposal, because after two \nconsecutive quarters of economic growth, everything would stop.\n  I believe the American people deserve sunsets such as this. They \ndeserve triggers in bills that say once we accomplish what we set out \nto accomplish and we all agree we need, let's stop it there. Let's not \njust consider because we authorized it to be spent that we are going to \ncontinue to open the spigot and the next generation suffers. We will \nnot be here. I don't think there is a parent in America or a \ngrandparent in America who is not willing to make sure the next \ngeneration and the next generation and the next generation has as good \nan opportunity as we had.\n  I am going to tell you, Mr. President, over the next 60 days, we will \nspend, we will appropriate, we will authorize over $3 trillion. If we \nlook at the portraits that are around the Senate and the Capitol, our \nforefathers would be turning in their graves today if they could. They \ndid not even envision what a trillion dollars was, much less that \nCongress would talk about spending over $1 trillion in one bill or $3 \ntrillion in 60 days, almost a trillion dollars' worth of interest \nobligation to the next generation. But we are doing it like routine \nbusiness. We are going to rush through this in less than a week.\n  I remember when there was an energy bill in the Senate. We spent 3 \nweeks, not stalling but debating different types of solutions to the \nproblem. That is what we are doing today, offering substitutes, \noffering amendments. But the die is cast. They are not going to be \naccepted. As Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, said, and I think \nher remarks are embraced over here: We won; therefore, we have a right \nto do it exactly like we want to do it.\n  It is time for bipartisanship. It is a time for compromise. \nCompromise is not ``take ours and not have yours heard.'' Compromise is \nalso not ``you can offer all of yours, and we will just routinely \nobject to them, vote them down.'' Who loses then? It is not me. It is \nnot the minority. It is the American people. This is a debate that is \nworth having. It is a debate for the American people and for the next \ngeneration. So understand, if changes are not made, it is not that the \nminority lost, it is that the American people lost. What we are trying \nto do is targeted, it is temporary, and it hopefully is timely.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nspeakers be recognized in the following order, honoring our time-\nhonored tradition of going back and forth: first, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Inouye; second, Senator Graham; \nthird, myself; fourth, Senator Alexander; fifth, Senator Schumer; next \nis Senator Coburn; next is Senator Cantwell; next is Senator Inhofe; \nfollowed by a Democratic Senator; followed by Senator Hutchison from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in the presentation of the bill before us, \nthe Senator from Arizona singled out one group--Filipino war veterans--\nand suggested that these were men from foreign countries and that we \nare providing funds for them. If I may, I would like to spend a few \nmoments discussing this matter.\n  On January 26, 1941, the President of the United States, Mr. \nRoosevelt, issued a military order through General MacArthur calling \nupon Filipinos to volunteer to serve in the Army, to\n\n[[Page S1627]]\n\nserve in the Navy, to serve in the Air Force, because the President \nsensed, correctly, that there was much instability and much violence in \nAsia. He felt the time had come for the United States to be prepared \nfor any eventuality. As a result of that call, 470,000 Filipinos \nstepped forward and volunteered to serve in the military, under the \ncommand of General MacArthur.\n  As we all know, on December 7, 1941, war came to our shores, to my \nState of Hawaii. Pearl Harbor was bombed, and then the forces of Japan \nbegan advancing toward the Philippines. The first major target was the \nBataan Peninsula. The 14th Japanese Army surrounded the peninsula. That \npeninsula contained at that moment 80,000 troops. We all assumed that \nthe 80,000 were American troops. No. About 18,000 were American troops; \nthe rest were Filipinos. Yes, the majority of the troops in Bataan were \nFilipinos, but somehow, if you look at Hollywood on the Bataan death \nmarch, you hardly see a Filipino marching. Of the survivors of the \nBataan, 15,000 were Americans, 60,000 were Filipinos. The march took a \nlittle over a month. They were not given medicine or water. By the time \nit ended, 54,000 survived. Very few Filipinos survived.\n\n  Then we had Corregidor. The same thing.\n  So in March 1942, the Congress of the United States--the Senate and \nthe House--passed a measure thanking the Filipinos for their gallantry, \nfor their heroism, and said: If you wish, you may become a citizen of \nthe United States and get all the benefits of a U.S. veteran.\n  The war ended, and in February of 1946, this Congress passed a bill \nrescinding, repealing that act of 1942. Believe it or not, it declared \nthat the service the Filipinos had rendered was not Active Duty. I \ndon't know what it meant by that. It was not Active service.\n  The Filipinos have been waiting all this time. We have had measure \nafter measure presented. We did so in the proper fashion, and we got \nfilibustered, we got ruled out, and everything else.\n  At this moment, out of the 470,000 who volunteered, 18,000 are still \nalive--18,000. The average age is 90. At this moment, while I am \nspeaking, hundreds lie in hospitals on their death beds. And I am \ncertain, while I am speaking, some are dying. Two weeks from now, we \nwill have 17,000 surviving.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona. This is not a stimulus \nproposal. It does not create jobs. But the honor of the United States \nis what is involved.\n  It is about time we close this dark chapter. I love America. I love \nserving America. I am proud of this country, but this is a black \nchapter. It has to be cleansed, and I hope my colleagues will join me \nin finally recognizing that these men served us well. They died for us. \nThey got wounded for us. And they deserve recognition.\n\n  Incidentally, this bill doesn't contain a penny for the Filipinos. It \nrecognizes them. And we will provide the money later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator aware of my strong support for the \ncompensation that our great Filipino allies in World War II rendered to \nthis Nation and to the country?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And is it also clear that there are many wrongs that need \nto be righted through funding, including our own veterans, including \nhospitals, including medical care, including PTSD?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. A long list.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So does the Senator believe that compensation for that \nwhich is not under the label of stimulus to our economy and restoring \nour economy or creating jobs is not what is needed to be addressed in \nthis bill?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I could not agree with the Senator from Arizona more.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So could I finally ask the Senator, is there any question \nof anybody's patriotism or love of country or the outstanding and \nmagnificent service rendered in World War II by our brave Filipino \nallies?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator for answering my questions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Now, Mr. President, if I may ask the Chair to let me know \nwhen I have used 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this is one of the most important \ndecisions the Congress is going to make and that the new administration \nis going to make in the first 4 years of the Obama administration and \nthe Democratic-controlled Congress.\n  My good friend Senator Durbin, from Illinois, whom I look forward to \nworking with in solving hard problems, came to the floor and said some \nthings to which I would like to respond. Knowing that we are going to \nget this behind us one day and go on to other hard subjects, such as \nSocial Security and Guantanamo Bay, and try to find some bipartisanship \nthere, I would say that to talk about inheriting Bush's problems is \nrelevant to a certain extent. But this is America's problem. And you \ncan blame George Bush all you want, but he didn't write this bill. You \nall did. This is your bill, and it needs to be America's bill.\n  Now, you may get three or four Republicans to vote with you, but let \nme tell you what the country is going to inherit if we pass this bill \nin terms of substance and process. We are going to lose the ability as \nMembers of Congress to go to the public and ask for more money--let us \nborrow more of your money to fix housing--because this bill stinks. The \nprocess that has led to this bill stinks.\n  The House did not get one Republican vote. Maybe every Republican is \njust crazy, but I don't think so. I think there are some Republicans in \nthe House who understand we need a stimulus package and believe we have \nto do more than cut taxes. I believe we have to do more than cut taxes. \nBut the reason you didn't get a Republican vote in the House is because \nNancy Pelosi's attitude is: We won, we write the bill. Well, let me \ntell you, this ain't about one party winning, this is about America. \nAnd America needs the Congress and the new President to be smart and \nwork together. We are not being smart. We are spending money on things \nthat have nothing to do with creating a job in the near term, and the \nspending will go on long after this economic crisis is solved. It is \nnot smart to say no to an amendment that would stop the spending when \nthe economy gets back on its feet.\n  I want the American people to know there was an amendment offered \nyesterday that said when the economy starts to grow again--2 percent \nover inflation for two quarters in a row--we are going to stop any \nspending that is left to be done in this bill and reevaluate where we \ngo. If we don't have a trigger or some brakes, we will keep spending \nthe money no matter what the economy is doing because there are some \npeople in this body who cannot spend enough. Now, if you feel \nRepublicans spent too much of your money, guilty as charged. But this \nis not the solution. This makes us look like misers.\n  America believes--75 percent of the American people--that we need a \nstimulus. Almost 60 percent of the people believe this bill needs to be \nchanged. Count me in that group. We need to be smart and we need to \nwork together. We are doing neither. We are not working together.\n  There are 16 of my colleagues in a room somewhere in the Capitol--5 \nRepublicans and the rest Democrats--trying to find a compromise. God \nbless them, but that is not the way you spend $800 billion. You don't \nget 16 people in a room trying to find a compromise to get to 60 votes \nand say that is good government.\n  Ronald Reagan had a saying: If I get 80 percent of what I want, then \nI should be satisfied.\n  Lindsey Graham is an 80 percent guy. I hope you believe that because \nI have tried to show you that I am an 80 percent guy, when you \nnegotiate. There is no negotiation going on here. Nobody is \nnegotiating. We are making it up as we go. The polling numbers are \nscaring the hell out of everybody and they are in a panic. They are \nrunning from one corner of the Capitol to the other trying to cobble \nvotes together to lower the cost of the bill in order to say we solved \nthe problem.\n  This is not the way to spend $1 trillion. This will come back to bite \neverybody in this body because when we go\n\n[[Page S1628]]\n\nto the public and say: We need money to get rid of toxic assets that \nare clogging up the banking system, they are going to say: Why should I \ngive you a penny more; look what happened with TARP and look what \nhappened in this monstrosity of a bill. And I think, quite frankly, we \nare going to need to go back.\n  But this $800 billion, $900 billion process has done little for \nhousing and nothing for banking. So we are destroying the one thing I \nhoped we could regain: credibility, confidence, and trust.\n  As to President Obama--nice man, great potential--he really has a big \nplate of problems. And I wanted to help him. I want him to succeed, \nwhere we can find common ground to make America succeed. I am begging \nhim to get involved. Doing news shows and coming to lunch is not what \nRonald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did to solve the Social Security problem. \nI know we have to act urgently, but I also know the public is not going \nto let us do this over and over and over.\n  We need a timeout--not months; days, hopefully; not weeks--where we \ncan get in a room, and not with 16 people but with the leadership of \nthe House, the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, and the White House, \nto find a way to spend less and do more because this will not be the \nend of the spending required to get this economy back on its feet.\n  There is so much in this bill--not 1 percent. There is $75 billion in \nthis bill earmarked to the States that has no strings attached, and \nwhat has that to do with stimulating the economy? I know my State has a \nbudget shortfall, but if we are going to take a bankrupt Congress and \nborrow money to give to States and take care of their economic \nproblems, that is one politician helping another with their political \nproblems, but it is not creating a job for you and your family.\n  We are not being smart, we are not working together, we are making \nthis up as we go, and we are losing the good will and the trust of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to call to the Senator's attention two amendments \nthat have been adopted, both of them initiated by Republican Senators \nand both of them now in the bill, the first by Senator Grassley and \nSenator Menendez in committee that added about $70 billion in cost to \nthe bill--the alternative minimum tax relief. It is something we both \nsupport, but it clearly was an effort to engage Republican Senators in \nchanging the bill in a positive way. The second amendment adopted \nyesterday was by Senator Isakson of Georgia relative to a tax credit \nfor home purchases, and I believe the cost of that is $19 billion. \nThose two amendments account for $89 billion out of the $900 billion in \nthe bill. So about 10 percent of the bill comes from Republican \namendments.\n  To suggest that we are not open to amendments from the Republican \nside, I would say to my colleague, I think we are trying. We could do \nmore and we want to do more, but we don't want to lose what we hope \nPresident Obama is asking for here--something that will have a \nsubstantial and dramatic impact on the economy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for his comments. If you believe this \nis a good process, to spend $800 billion, we are on different planets. \nWe are literally making this up as we go. If this is such a good \nprocess, why are 16 Senators meeting in a corner trying to figure out \nhow to keep this from stinking up with the public? The idea that the \nmarkup lasted 1 hour 40 minutes and one amendment is accepted--is this \nthe way we are going to solve Social Security?\n  Look at this bill. This bill has to be done by tonight, and we are \nfiguring out as we go what is in it. There is a COBRA provision in this \nbill. What is COBRA? Well, if you lose your job, there is an ability to \nmaintain health care insurance through a program called COBRA. People \nare losing their jobs, and they may need COBRA benefits. The bill says \nwe will pay 65 percent of the COBRA premium for anybody who loses their \njob. That makes sense to some extent, but what if you are the CEO who \nhas been fired from one of these banks and you are worth $20 million? \nShould we pay 65 percent of your premium? That is not smart.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think it is amazing that the Senator is \nholding up a bill--holding up a bill. Very theatrical. Did you ever do \nthat when George Bush was President and he sent down a bill twice as \nbig as that? Did the Senator ever do that? Because you can do that. \nThat is theatrical. You can do that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will put my ability to speak my mind to \nmy party up against anybody, including you, Senator. I have been on \nthis floor many times arguing with the past administration about \npolicies I disagreed with. I don't recall you doing that a lot, but I \ndon't question your motives as to why you are doing what you are doing.\n  I am here today----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No, it is my time.\n  I am here today to point out the fact that this is not \nbipartisanship. This process we are engaging in is not smart. We are \nnot working together. We are about to spend $800 billion or $900 \nbillion and nobody has a clue where we are going to land, and we have \nto do it by tonight.\n  So I am telling you right now that if this is the solution to George \nBush's problems, the country is going to get worse. If this is the new \nway of doing business, if this is the change we can all believe in, \nAmerica's best days are behind her.\n  I want to meet you in the middle. I want to find a way to spend money \nbeyond cutting taxes that will help people who have lost their jobs. \nBut I don't want to throw a bunch of money into a system that is not \ngoing to create a job in the near term, knowing that I have to work \nwith you and the Senator from Illinois to put money into the housing \nmarket because people are losing their houses; knowing that I have to \ncome back and ask for more money from the American people to fix the \nbanking system when we have done nothing with banking.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around here. There is plenty of blame. \nIf you want to look back and say this is all George W. Bush's fault, \nyou can do that. I am choosing not to do that. I am urging this body to \nsit down in some methodical way, with a sense of urgency, to come up \nwith a product better than this. I am urging a rejection of the \nmentality ``we won, we write the bill.''\n  Now, if you want to do it this way, we are going to lose the ability \nto go back to the American people. The American people understand this \nbill is not working for them. The process we are creating is not \nworking for them. I want to work with you to work for them. I feel shut \nout. Maybe it is just me. Maybe I am the problem. But I don't think so. \nI think people are figuring out pretty quickly that this Congress, the \nold one and the new one, is making this up as we go, and we are running \nout of good will. We are running out of capital. We don't need any more \nnews conferences. What we need is getting more than 16 people in a \nroom. We need to slow down, take a timeout, and get it right.\n  I support the McCain amendment, but I am willing to do more. I am \nwilling to spend more if it makes sense. I am willing to cut taxes more \nif it makes sense. But I know this: What we are doing in this bill does \nnot make sense and we are not doing it together. We are going to miss a \nchance to start over again, I say to my good friend from California, to \nwipe out the past, and to start with a new way of doing business. What \nwe are engaging in, in my opinion, is all of the wrong things of the \npast. There is nothing new about this bill or this process. Finally, \nAmerica wants something more. America deserves something new. This is \nnot it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized, under \nthe previous order.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first I want to correct--I know it is a \nvery minor mistake the Senator made--the markup of the Finance \nCommittee took over 11\\1/2\\ hours, not 1\\1/2\\ hours, as the Senator \nrepresented.\n  But, frankly, the main question is, how do we get people back to \nwork?\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\nHow do we get our economy moving? That is the question.\n  There are lots of ideas. A lot of people have spent a lot of time \nworking, trying to find the best solutions--a lot of economists, a lot \nof experts. It is true we are in, probably, the deepest recession this \ncountry has faced since the Great Depression. That is true. It is also \ntrue the economy is much different now than it was back in the 1930s. \nThat is also true. The banking system is different. We now have an \ninternational dimension. It is greater today than was the case back in \nthe Great Depression. So, therefore, it is true to some degree we are \nkind of learning as we are doing. Nobody has all the answers--nobody \ndoes. Most of us working on this recognize that. All of us are doing \nthe best we can, on both sides of the aisle. We are trying to figure \nthis out and do the best we can with the resources we have and with the \nGovernment we have.\n  Different people, of course, have different estimates. Let me tell \nyou what the basic estimates are from the people I have talked to. They \nsay there is about a $1 trillion gap between the potential American \neconomy and the actual economy--about a $1 trillion gap. The real \nquestion is, how do we fill in that gap? What do we do to make sure the \nreal economy matches up to the potential economy?\n  There are three basic components, most people agree: One is to do \nwhat we can to unfreeze the credit markets. Banks are not loaning. It \nis an issue that has been discussed at length in the last many months. \nThe question is, what do we do to unfreeze the credit markets in this \ncountry so banks start to loan money, start to loan money to \ncreditworthy borrowers? That is one challenge, and that is the reason \nfor all these programs, such as TARP.\n  We can debate whether they are perfect. They are probably not \nperfect. But that is a part of the solution, do what we can to get \nbanks to unfreeze the credit markets.\n  Another component is housing. What do we do about all these houses \nwhere the mortgage is much greater than the actual market value of the \nhouse? The common term, it is called ``underwater.'' Estimates are \nbetween one in four, maybe one in five American houses is underwater. \nWhat do we do to help address housing? We are working on that.\n  There are many features in this bill that address housing. For \nexample, the $15,000 tax credit offered by the Senator from Georgia, \nMr. Isakson, and the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, adopted \nby the Senate--that is going to help. It is a $15,000 tax credit for \nthe purchase of a home. There are many other housing provisions enacted \nby the Banking Committee. Some are in this bill. Others are in other \nbills. Of course we have to go further.\n  The third component is consumer demand. What can we do in this \ncountry to help people feel a little better about things so they can \nstart spending--people can start spending some money? First, they have \nto have money, and that gets to jobs. We also want to encourage people \nto spend money so the economy starts to loosen up, and that also \ncreates jobs. That is the problem to which the bill is addressed. That \nis the third component, which is basically on the demand side, to help \npeople spend money.\n  How do we do that? One way is to get measures passed to create jobs. \nIt is bridges, it is roads and infrastructure, and so forth.\n  Without being too simplistic, what has happened in this country in \nthe last several years is, we have become way over leveraged. Banks \nhave borrowed way too much. Hedge funds, private equity funds have \nborrowed way too much--leveraged maybe 30, 40 times. American credit \ncard debt has gone up. Individuals have become overleveraged. \nBusinesses have become overleveraged. When you borrow much more than \nyour assets, clearly when times start to constrict a little, it is a \nhuge problem to pay off your loans, to pay off your debt, especially \nwhen you are leveraged in an amount that is 40 times your assets. That \nis really a problem.\n  That is what has happened in this country. So in a certain sense, \nwhile the private sector is deleveraging, the public sector is starting \nto leverage to fill the gap, to keep things going. That is the reason \nfor the borrowing.\n  We are all concerned about how far this is going to go, how much debt \nit will be. Will we be able to pay off the debt? Is it going to work or \nis it not going to work? The answer to that is, first, we have to spend \nto make things happen. I do believe, frankly, it is better to spend \nmore than less because if we spend more, there is a psychology, in \naddition to an actual multiplier dollar effect, that there is light at \nthe end of the tunnel, and we are going to find a solution--compared \nwith being tepid, being timid, just putting our toe in the water a \nlittle bit. I think that is not a good idea.\n  So the $800 billion--this bill is close to $900 billion right now. \nSome suggest maybe $800 billion is where we should end up. I think that \nwould be fine. But will this help create jobs, this $800 billion? That \nis the basic question. And how do we fill the $1 trillion gap between \nthe potential economy and the real economy? Most people I think, and \nmost economists who are reputable, I think, will say that if we do \nnothing, that $1 trillion gap will double to about $2 trillion. These \nare rightwing economists, leftwing economists--there is a basic \nagreement among almost all economists that we have to spend some money \nto get things back on track again.\n  I have a summary of a letter from the Congressional Budget Office--\nreleased yesterday--trying to determine the effects of this bill on \njobs. What is the effect of the bill we are considering on gross \ndomestic product? Let me just give you some highlights. This is a \nletter from the Congressional Budget Office. It is a nonpartisan \norganization.\n  Let me say, a lot of economists have their incomes paid for by people \non one side of an issue or the other. That is one reason things get \nslanted sometimes. But this is the Congressional Budget Office. They \ndon't make a lot of money, but these guys and women are very good, and \nthey are public servants. They want to do this job. What do they say?\n  They say between now and the fourth quarter of 2010, the number of \njobs created under the underlying bill, plus the number of jobs saved, \nis in a range between 1.3 to 3.9; basically between 1.3 million to 4 \nmillion jobs created and saved between now and the fourth quarter of \n2010. That is CBO's best estimate. Granted, there is a range. We don't \nhave a precise number, but it is a range.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona cuts that in half. \nSo let's cut it in half; the resulting range is 0.6 million jobs to \nabout 2 million jobs, roughly. That is not close to beginning to fill \nthe $1 to $2 trillion gap between the real economy and the potential \neconomy.\n  CBO also says that under the Senate bill, GDP would increase by 1.2 \npercent to 3.6 percent by the end of 2010. The unemployment rate will \ndecline between 0.7 percentage points and 2.1 percentage points. Let's \ntake a midpoint. That is roughly a 1.5-percentage point reduction in \nthe unemployment rate. The midpoint for the increase in GDP is about \n2.4 percent. And the midpoint for the number of jobs created or saved \nis about 2.6 million. It is 2.6 million jobs created or saved under \nthis bill.\n\n  Let me just read a sentence from the letter. The letter says:\n\n       For all of the categories [of spending or taxes] that would \n     be affected by the Senate legislation, resulting budgetary \n     changes are estimated to raise output in the short run, \n     albeit by different amounts.\n\n  That gets to my next point. Different dollars spent differently have \ndifferent effects. They all are stimulative, some more stimulative than \nothers. The letter goes on to say:\n\n       . . . direct purchases of goods and services [by Uncle Sam] \n     tend to have large effects on GDP.\n\n  The letter then lists the numerical stimulative effect of each \ncategory of new spending and tax cuts. For purchases of goods and \nservices by the Federal Government, the multiplier effect is between $1 \nand $2.50. The midpoint is $1.75. For transfers to State and local \ngovernment used for infrastructure, the effect is about the same: \nbetween $1.00 and $2.50. For transfers to State and local governments \nfor programs other than infrastructure, it is less, from 70 cents to \n$1.90 on the dollar.\n  For transfers to persons who are receiving unemployment benefits the \nreturn on a dollar is higher. Transfers to\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\npeople who are unemployed are most likely to be spent, not saved. The \nreturn on a dollar is between 80 cents and $2.20.\n  For Making Work Pay--that tax cut is a key feature of this bill--the \nmultiplier effect is between 50 cents and $1.70 on the dollar. The \nmidpoint of the return on the dollar is $1.10\n  I might say, the effect for the 1-year patch to the AMT, the return \non a dollar is between 10 cents and 50 cents. There is not a lot of \nmultiplier effect for the AMT. And for the loss carryback business \nprovisions, the multiplier effect is between zero and 40 cents.\n  Basically, what CBO is saying is what a lot of us intuitively \nbelieve: a dollar spent on roads and bridges and infrastructure will \nhave a pretty high effect. Dollars transferred to low-income people, \nsuch as dollars for unemployment benefits, also have a very large \neffect.\n  Why do I say all this? I say this in part because I think it is \nhelpful for us to know what the Congressional Budget Office believes. \nThere are so many opinions here in Washington, it is just up to us to \nseparate the wheat from the chaff, to listen to the music as well as \nthe words, to try to read between the lines, to try to figure out what \nis really going on, and I think the Congressional Budget Office's \nestimates are a pretty good indicator.\n  We are concerned about the long-term debt--clearly, we are. There is \nnot a Senator here who is not concerned about the long-term budget \neffects of what we do. We don't know exactly what the long-term effects \nare going to be, but we are concerned about them.\n  The President is going to have a fiscal summit on this very issue. He \nis inviting a good number of people; it will probably last 3 or 4 or 5 \nweeks. It is obviously a concern to the President, and it is obviously \na concern to all of us.\n  Let's also remember the President is going to submit a budget \nsometime this month. It is going to be a blueprint for the President's \nprograms and plans. Clearly, he is going to have to be thinking about \nthe long-term debt too. Obviously, I think it will be very important \nfor us to see what the President's budget is, and then to work with the \nBudget Committees, in this body and in the other body, to put together \na blueprint and to try to get a handle on long-term debt.\n  This amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, tries \nto get at this long-run debt problem by setting up two entitlement \ncommissions. One is to address Social Security and the other is to \naddress Medicare and Medicaid. I think on the surface that is \ninteresting, but let's look at the facts. These entitlement commissions \ncould make recommendations which Congress could amend but on which \ndebate could be limited. The limit on debate greatly concerns me.\n  And let's look at the basic entitlements people talk about. What are \nthey?\n  One is Social Security. Back in 1983, I think it was, the Social \nSecurity trust fund was about to go belly up. It was going kaput. I \nthink there were enough funds in the Trust Fund that when added to new \ntaxes coming in, full benefits could be paid for only 6 months. There \nwas that little in the Social Security trust fund. The idea of a \ncommission was raised. President Reagan called it together, it had both \nRepublicans and Democrats on it. At the end, they agreed to do about \nthe only thing they could do, and that was to cut benefits and raise \ntaxes. That was put together based on a handshake between Tip O'Neill \nand Jim Baker.\n  There was a famous telephone conversation--hey, Mr. Speaker, if you \nagree to lower benefits, we will agree to raise taxes. We will greet \neach other, shake hands on it, and neither will attack each other. That \nwas the deal. They didn't attack each other. That is what happened: \nbenefits were cut a little and taxes were raised a little. Again, there \nwas the gun at the head of everybody, especially seniors, because \nSocial Security was about to go belly up in 6 months.\n  What is the situation today? Is the Social Security Trust Fund in \ndire jeopardy? No.\n  The Social Security trust fund is solvent, all of the actuaries say, \nto the year--I do not know the exact date--2041, 2042, something like \nthat. So I wonder. Sure, we should start early on things. But there are \nonly two ways to make the Trust Fund solvent beyond 2041, to say 2090 \nor 2100, and that is by cutting benefits and raising taxes.\n  Now, when times are tough--we are in a recession right now--I do not \nknow how wise it is to talk about raising taxes and cutting benefits \nfor a problem that is not real, not now. Maybe in a couple of 3 years \nwhen the economy is doing better, then we could tackle the Social \nSecurity trust fund. I do not think it is wise to have an entitlements \ncommission tackling Social Security at this point.\n  What is the bigger problem? Medicare. That is the big problem. The \nMedicare trust fund is not going to last much longer, 6, 8, 9, 10 \nyears, something like that. And what is causing such a problem? We have \nsuch a problem because health care costs in this country are rising at \nsuch a rapid rate, close to two times the rate of inflation. And, as \nyou know, we spend about twice as much per capita in health care in \nAmerica than do people in other countries.\n  So does an entitlements commission cutting Medicare make a lot of \nsense? Well, on the surface, yes. The costs have gone up, so the \ncommission would cut Medicare. But the only way to cut Medicare is to \ncut benefits. I do not know if that is wise because health care costs \nare already such a problem for seniors and others today. Similarly, I \ndon't know if it is wise to do a myriad of other things to the Medicare \nprogram that one might be able to do.\n  My point is, an entitlement commission is not qualified to address \nhealth care reform. Health care reform is an incredibly important, \nincredibly complicated matter. If we get health care reform on track, \nthat is, legislation to start to reform our health care system, that \nwill include getting significant reductions in cost. That is the way to \naddress Medicare. Health care reform includes coverage of 46 million \nAmericans who do not have health insurance, it includes health care \ndelivery reform, it includes a lot of reimbursement reform. There are \nlots and lots of ways we should embark upon to address health care \nreform.\n  In fact, I asked the President yesterday about his agenda. After, \nthis bill before us, we will probably get involved in some financial \nregulatory reform. The health care reform is one of his top priorities. \nHe wants it done this year. And it has to be done this year, because \npart of economic recovery is health reform.\n  Look how much in costs this health system is adding to the problems \nof individuals in our economy, because their costs are going up. And \nthere are costs to companies that have to lay off people, not hiring \npeople, to some degree because of health care costs, and certainly not \nincreasing health benefits for employees. There also are costs to \nbudgets for the States, localities, and the Federal Government.\n  I suggest it is not wise, the provision in the McCain amendment, to \nset up a Medicare commission but, rather to tackle head-on health care \nreform. I do believe the President is going to announce a health care \nsummit in the not too distant future as a way to get this going. \nSenator Daschle is all lined up and keyed up to get health care reform \ngoing. He wrote a book on it. I know the administration is dedicated to \nmaking sure that health care reform does not slip, that it is very much \nfront and center.\n  Another provision I want to touch upon in the McCain amendment which \nI think Senators should know about, because it has a real effect, is \nthis provision: essentially, the McCain amendment lowers the tax in the \n10- and 15-percent brackets. So as a consequence of this McCain \namendment, were it to be enacted, then people who pay income taxes \ntoday would pay less in incomes taxes. All Americans would--all \nAmericans who pay income taxes, that is. Americans who pay income taxes \nwould not necessarily in all brackets pay less because of the way our \nsystem is set up. Well, that sounds good. But what is of concern here?\n  The concern here is about 49 million Americans who would get no \nreduction in their taxes, none. Who are they? Well, they are people who \ndo not pay income taxes, who tend to be low-income people. The \nunderlying bill before us reduces taxes for those people who\n\n[[Page S1631]]\n\nwork. It is payroll tax related. If you work, under the underlying \nbill, you are going to get a reduction in your taxes, your income \ntaxes. You will get a check basically, if you do not pay income taxes. \nAnd if you work, you get a reduction in your income taxes.\n  There are 49 million Americans who will not receive a tax break under \nthe McCain amendment but who do receive a tax break in the underlying \nbill. And those 49 million Americans are lower income people basically, \nbecause they are not earning enough to pay income taxes. They pay \npayroll taxes, because they are working, but they do not pay income \ntaxes.\n  I do not think that is fair. CBO and others point out lower income \npeople, middle-income people who get a rebate or break will spend the \nmoney to stimulate the economy. Again, we are trying to address the \ndemand side here in this bill, getting people to spend the money.\n  Credit markets are one issue; housing is another issue. But this bill \nbasically addresses the demand side. I think we do not want to shift \ndollars away from those 49 million people over to the higher income \npeople as is accomplished in this amendment.\n  The underlying bill has what is called an alternative minimum tax \npatch; that is, your alternative minimum taxes will not increase in \n2009 compared with what they may have been earlier. Basically it is a \ndeflationary factor so you do not pay more.\n  The underlying McCain amendment does not have that. In the McCain \namendment, millions of people are going to end up paying more taxes \nbecause he does not have the so-called AMT patch or fix in it.\n  My main point is this bill, according to economists, will help. We \nare, down the road, going to find ways--in the President's budget, \nfiscal summit, et cetera--to address the long-term debt questions. So \nwe can only do things one step at a time. We cannot solve all of the \nworld's problems in one bill. But we can take one bite of the elephant \nhere, a pretty good bite, a good bite of the elephant here, that is \ngoing to help stimulate demand and help create jobs as we work our way \nthrough the economic recovery.\n  Madam President, the Senator from New York was called away. I ask \nunanimous consent that after Senator Alexander speaks, the next Senator \nto speak will be Senator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, this morning a number of us went to \nthe National Prayer Breakfast--I saw the Senator from North Carolina \nthere--which is always a wonderful event. It was especially a good \nevent today because our new President was there for the first time. I \nthink we would agree that he got a tremendous reception. We prayed for \nhim, we cheered him. We recognize he has become President at a \ndifficult time in our Nation's history. And we want him to succeed. \nBecause if he succeeds, our country succeeds, which is why this debate \non this bill is so disappointing. This is the first big proposal by the \nnew administration.\n  One New York Times columnist said, it is the first test. And what is \nthis about? We all know what is it about, the economy is in tough \nshape. Many people have lost their jobs. Homes are being repossessed. \nIRA accounts are lower. People are worried.\n  So we are hoping that in this first test we--the President and the \nCongress--will get an A-plus, flying colors. What are we seeking to do? \nWe are seeking to get the economy moving again. Is that not right? Is \nthat not what this is about? Is that not what a stimulus bill is?\n  We have got a bad economy. We have housing foreclosures. Whatever \naction we take, we want to get the economy moving again. And we want to \nkeep in mind while we are doing this that we have a big debt in this \ncountry. I do not mean just the Federal Government has a debt, because \nit is a Government debt owed by the people of this country.\n  USA Today the other day did an estimate that showed each of our \nAmerican families has a share of about $500,000 of that debt and future \nobligations based on promises the government has already made. So the \nAlexander family has got a $500,000 share of that debt and future \nobligations. The Grassley family does. The Hagan family does. The \nBaucus family does. We each have that. So we have to keep that in mind.\n  What shall we do? The Senator from Montana said, everyone seems to \nagree, we need to spend some money. And the proposal that has come \ntoward us certainly does meet that test. It would spend $900 billion. \nAnd if you add the interest to that over 10 years, which is the way we \nusually think about things, that is $1.2 or $1.3 trillion.\n  How much money is this we are talking about spending? Well, the \nformer chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Domenici, called me yesterday. He has been doing some figuring, and \nhe figured it took from the beginning of the Republic when George \nWashington was the President until the early 1980s for the United \nStates of America to pile up a cumulative debt of $850 billion.\n  What we are proposing to do is to spend in this one bill, by the end \nof this week or next week, as much money as the debt this country piled \nup between George Washington's Presidency and Ronald Reagan's \nPresidency. That is a lot of money. According to the newspaper \nPolitico, it is more than we have spent in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is \nmore money than we have spent, in today's dollars, going to the Moon. \nIt is more money than the Government spent on the New Deal in today's \ndollars. It is almost as much money as NASA has spent in its entire \nexistence. We are proposing to spend that in this one bill, nearly $1 \ntrillion.\n  The Senator from Montana said, well, we are all concerned about the \ndebt. I wonder if we are if the first thing we are going to do is \nborrow $1 trillion. This is not money we have in the drawer here. It is \nnot over here in the Senate cloakroom. It is out in the future \nsomewhere. We are going to borrow half of it from the Chinese and other \npeople around the world, and then somebody--us, our children, and our \ngrandchildren--is going to have to pay it back.\n  So what standards should we use if we are going to borrow some money \nto get the economy started, money that we are going to have to pay \nback, a lot of money? Well, the Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, gave \nus a standard for what a real stimulus package is. Last year, when we \nsaw the beginnings of this downturn and we acted in a bipartisan way to \nswiftly try to spend some money to be of some help, she said: It must \nbe timely, targeted, and temporary.\n  This is timely. But it is not targeted. It is not temporary, which is \nwhat I wish to talk about. Last night we had a chance to help make it \nmore targeted and more temporary. Senator McCain offered an amendment \nto the Senate that said, we are for a stimulus package. We believe it \nought to be targeted, for example, on housing and letting people keep \nmore of their own money, and on plans and programs that will create \njobs in the first year. That would be what we are for in terms of \nstimulus.\n  But he said, let me make one other suggestion, and he offered an \namendment to us which would say this: When the economy recovers, the \nstimulus spending stops. That was the McCain amendment. When the \neconomy recovers, the stimulus spending stops. Because if what we are \ndoing here is borrowing money from every American family and spending \nit with a hope that it helps the economy get going this year, once the \neconomy gets going, has not the rationale disappeared for spending that \nmoney?\n  We spend a lot of other money around here. We know that we have \nannual appropriations bills. We have got banks in trouble. We have got \nhousing in trouble. So the McCain amendment said: After two quarters of \na 2-percent increase in the gross domestic product, the money that we \nhave borrowed to spend to get the economy going again stops.\n  That got 44 votes. So this body has already decided that this is not \na temporary stimulus bill.\n  It is ongoing. So let no one think the trillion dollars proposed to \nbe spent is temporary. Let no one think it is about stimulus. I guess \nevery time you spend a government dollar, there is a little bit of \nstimulus, I suppose. But I asked\n\n[[Page S1632]]\n\nmy staff working on appropriations to go over the $900 billion. Here is \nwhat they found. They said there is approximately $135 billion of \nspending that will directly create jobs, including building \nconstruction, road construction, locks and dams, environmental cleanup, \nand national cemetery repair. And only $53 billion of the $135 billion \nis spent in the next 18 months. If this is a bill about creating jobs \nthis year, if that is the reason we are taking this extravagant debt \nand adding more to it than we spent in the entire New Deal in today's \ndollars, that is not very targeted. The bill is neither temporary nor \ntargeted.\n  What is our responsibility on the Republican side to deal with this? \nOur responsibility is to offer a better idea.\n  Our President has said--and we agree--that one way we need to change \nWashington is that we need to work across the aisle to get results on \nbig issues, results that work. That is why I am in government. I did \nthat when I was a Republican Governor in Tennessee with a Democratic \nlegislature. I believe I have a good record of bipartisan cooperation \nin the Senate, whether it is President Bush or President Obama. I \nworked with Senator Lieberman and now with Senator Barrasso and Senator \nPryor to create a bipartisan breakfast every Tuesday morning. The \nSenator from North Carolina came to the breakfast the last 2 weeks. We \nhave talked about the debt and how the entitlement programs--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid--are creating a crisis in that debt. \nSocial Security is a part of the problem. Medicaid and Medicare is a \nbigger part. Almost 70 percent of all the money we spend in the Federal \nGovernment within about 7 or 8 years will go to Social Security, \nMedicaid, and Medicare. That leaves only 30 percent for everything \nelse. It also suggests that by the year 2015, we will be spending 100 \npercent of our annual gross domestic product; it would take that much \nmoney to pay off our debt.\n  Let me remind colleagues that the United States produces year in and \nyear out about 25 or 28 percent of all the money in the world. So we \nare headed toward a situation where, in a few years, it would take 25 \npercent to 28 percent of all the money produced in the world in 1 year \nto pay off the national debt of the United States.\n  In a budget hearing the other day with Senators Conrad and Gregg, we \nasked the witnesses: What is the problem? How much debt can you have? \nThey said: That is kind of general, but 40 percent is where the United \nStates is, 40 percent of GDP. All of this we are talking about in the \nnext few weeks may take us up to 60 percent. That is getting close to \ntrouble. Eighty percent is trouble, and 100 percent is a big problem.\n  Unlike the 1960s or the 1970s, when we owed our debt to ourselves, \nwhen it was much smaller, now we owe half of it to people around the \nworld who may or may not want to continue buying our debt.\n  Our debt has to be in our minds when we think about borrowing money. \nWe need to apply the Pelosi principle to the stimulus. Temporary? No, \nit is not. Yesterday, 44 votes said yes. The rest said no, we would \nlike for it to go on a long time. Targeted? No, it is not. Only $135 \nbillion out of $900 billion is aimed toward creating jobs. Only $53 \nbillion of that is spent in the next 18 months.\n  So what can we do to improve this? On our side, we have a number of \nproposals to do that. The pending amendment of Senator McCain is one. \nThe amendment by Senator Ensign, which will be voted on today, is \nanother. The amendment by Senator Isakson that was agreed to yesterday \nis the third.\n  Here is basically what we think we should be doing with this borrowed \nmoney: No. 1, we would fix housing first. We would reorient the \nstimulus bill away from spending money indefinitely, mostly on programs \nthat do not create jobs in the first year, and spend it instead to \nrestart housing because housing is what got us into this problem. \nHousing will help get us out of the problem. We have some specific \nideas about doing that.\n  Second, we would let the American people keep more of the money they \nhave. That is stimulative. Letting them keep it permanently is the most \nstimulative thing we could do. Senator McCain proposes reducing the \npayroll tax and reducing the lowest level of income tax rates. Those \nare for working people, people who make less--not more--money.\n  The third thing we would do is cut the size of the bill and focus it \non those projects that create jobs now.\n  When we say fix housing first, we mean, to begin with, the $15,000 \nhousing credit. If you want to buy a house during the year 2009, you \nget a $15,000 tax credit. That is real money. You can put it in your \npocket this year, if you buy a house.\n  The second thing we would propose is the Ensign amendment, which \nwould lower mortgage interest rates for all creditworthy Americans. \nForty million Americans could take advantage of a rate that would be \nbetween 4 and 4.5 percent. We would put a cap on it, so it would not \ncost taxpayers more than about $300 billion, but most economists with \nwhom we have talked say it is more like $30 billion.\n  What would be the value of a lower interest rate backed by the \nTreasury? It would mean, all across the country, instant jobs. People \ncould borrow money. They would have incentive to do so because the \naverage savings of someone who refinanced their home and got a 4- to \n4.5-percent interest rate would be approximately $400 a month for 30 \nyears, over the 30-year term of the rate. That is like a permanent tax \ncut. That money would be in their pockets. It could be spent. It would \nhelp stabilize the value of that home. That would help stabilize the \nvalue of homes on that block. That would put to work builders and \ncontractors and plumbers and brokers and bankers. That would give banks \norigination fees so they could have income. And having income, they \nmight have enough money and confidence to start lending. Then this \neconomy could keep moving at a relatively small cost. That is what we \nmean by fixing housing first.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Graham have in their proposals legislation \nto help those individuals whose homes are being foreclosed.\n  If we could sit down in a bipartisan way and agree that we want to \nfollow the Pelosi principle and make this temporary and targeted and \nthat we should start by fixing housing first, I believe we could agree \nacross the aisle to deal with housing and create instant jobs. We might \nhave less debate about tax cuts, although the President has suggested \nthat we reduce some middle-income taxes. We have suggested the same.\n  The third thing would be, as Alice Rivlin, former Budget Director for \na Democratic President, said: We really ought to have two bills. One \nwould be a bill for long-term investments, many of which I fought for \nfor years in terms of American competitiveness. They are good for the \ncountry but don't take effect right away. The other bill, which we need \nto move on quickly, would be those programs, such as road construction, \nbuilding construction, locks and dams, and national park maintenance, \nthat would create jobs today. Then we could come to the American people \nand say: Mr. and Mrs. America, you have a big debt, $500,000 per \nfamily, but we, across party lines, have looked at the situation. We \nneed a stimulus. Perhaps it should be $400 billion or $500 billion at \nthe start. But we will not start with how much we are going to spend; \nwe are going to start with what can we do that would work.\n  Fix housing first, lower interest rate mortgages, a $15,000 tax \ncredit for home buyers, help for those in foreclosures. Next, keep more \nof your own money in your pockets. That is the payroll tax and cutting \nrates. Finally, we might spend $100 billion or $150 billion by \naccelerating Government programs we will have to do anyway and get \nthose jobs coming this year. That would be a responsible, bipartisan \nway to go about this.\n  This bill, as it is presently headed toward passage, is a colossal \nmistake. It is not temporary. It is not targeted. It is not primarily \ncreating jobs. It is not a stimulus bill. It is mostly a spending bill. \nIt is not money we have; it is money we are borrowing. It is a huge \namount of money, more money in today's dollars than the Government \nspent on the New Deal, on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on the war \nin Vietnam, almost as much as we have spent on NASA over its life, a \nhuge amount of borrowed money not targeted. Although it is timely, we \nare rushing it through.\n\n[[Page S1633]]\n\n  I am disappointed. I had expected better. I have heard the President \nsay he wants to work on entitlements. We take him at his word. We have \nhad two straight Tuesday morning breakfasts where we have sat around \nthe table and said: This is going to be hard to do. We trust the \nPresident to get in here with us, and we will figure this out. But this \nis a bill written in the House. It looks as if they just got down in \nthe drawer, and every spending program they could think of for the last \n40 years that didn't pass, they stuck it in. It might be good 20 years \nfrom now. It might be good tomorrow. But it is in there.\n  We won the election. We will write the bill. ``We won the election, \nwe write the bill'' may technically work on a few pieces of \nlegislation. But it will not help move our country forward. It will not \nbe the basis for a successful Presidency. We won the election. We write \nthe bill. This is easy, spending a trillion dollars. The majority just \nsays: Hey, we have some money to spend. Let's grab all the programs we \ncan think of and off we go. But what is coming is really hard.\n  Next week, the Secretary of the Treasury is likely to tell us we need \nseveral hundred billion to deal with toxic assets in banks. I am one of \nsix Republican Senators who voted to give the new President the second \namount of $350 billion so he could have that in his pocket to deal with \nthis crisis. But it doesn't increase my appetite to help with the next \n$400 or $500 billion if we are going to start out by wasting nearly a \ntrillion on programs not needed to fix the economy today.\n  And probably, since we are not dealing with housing in any \nsignificant way in this bill, the new administration may say: We \ndecided we need to get housing going again. I think I would be inclined \nto say: Mr. Democratic Leader, Mr. President, that is what we said last \nweek. But you said we had to pass a bill in a week. Why didn't we wait \na week and see what the Treasury Secretary had to say about banking \ncredits or about housing?\n  Then the next week we have $900 billion on an appropriations bill. \nAnd then, as Senator Baucus has said--and he is exactly right--health \ncare is coming down the pike. I can't figure out a way that the health \ncare bill, even the one I cosponsored with Senators Wyden and Bennett, \nis not going to cost us a lot more.\n  So why don't we put this all on the table and work across party \nlines? Technically, you don't have to do it. Technically, President \nBush didn't have to have congressional approval to wage a war in Iraq. \nBut he found and our Nation found that he would have a much more \nsuccessful Presidency and we would have probably had a much easier war \nif we could have found some way to work together.\n  I am disappointed with this, beginning on a stimulus bill that does \nnot meet the Pelosi principle of timely, targeted, and temporary. It is \na colossal mistake in the way it is headed. We should fix housing \nfirst. Let people keep more of their own money. Strip out the spending \nprograms that don't create jobs now. Deal with them separately, and get \nin the habit of accepting each other's best ideas on dealing with the \nbiggest problems. We stand ready to do that.\n  We admire the new President and the tone he has set. We want him to \nsucceed. This bill will not help our country succeed unless it is \ndrastically amended this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I am on the floor to speak about the \nCantwell-Hatch amendment. I would call it up, but I know there will be \nobjection on the other side. I want to say that we will be asking for a \nvote on this amendment at some point in time. So for my colleagues to \nknow, we will be demanding a vote on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Levin, Brown, Alexander, \nCarper, Menendez, and Udall of Colorado as cosponsors of amendment No. \n274.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, we are here today to find ways to \ninject capital, confidence, and construction into our economy. That is \nwhy I have worked so hard collaborating with Senator Hatch and Senator \nStabenow who is now on the floor now and I think Senator Hatch may come \nat some point later today--and with Senator Kerry and many stakeholders \nacross the country to develop what is an economic recovery and \nreinvestment opportunity that leverages the incredible potential of \nplug-in electric vehicles.\n  I would like to thank my colleague from Utah for his willingness to \nwork across the aisle on what we think is one of the biggest economic \nopportunities for our country in manufacturing.\n  If this stimulus bill is about figuring out ways to create tens of \nthousands of jobs and economic growth in the short term, and millions \nof sustainable jobs in the long term, then plug-ins are a big winner \nfor the United States economy.\n  According to a recent report by McKinsey & Company, the opportunity \nfor electric vehicles could be a very attractive U.S. investment. They \nnote that the total market for electric vehicles in North America, \nEurope, and Asia could be as much as $120 billion by 2030.\n  I know President Obama recognizes this opportunity, that is not a \nsurprise since he sat down with Senator Hatch and I in 2007 to actually \nwrite the original plug-in vehicle incentives bill.\n  The President understands that plug-in vehicles are a game-changing \ntechnology. They can change the way we consume energy for our \ntransportation needs. Instead of paying the exorbitant prices we were \npaying for gasoline, over four dollars a gallon just last summer, plug-\nin vehicles will allow us to transform the electricity grid into a fuel \nsource and be paying about a dollar a gallon for our fuel costs. That \nalone is probably the most effective way to help our Nation get off our \noverdependence on foreign oil.\n  That is why President Obama, in his goals for his administration, has \nsaid he wants to put 1 million plug-in electric cars on the road by \n2015. This amendment helps make that a reality.\n  Within a 3-year stimulus window, our amendment would allow people \nmanufacturing plug-ins or their component technologies, such as \nbatteries, to expense that capital investment. What we are doing is \nallowing that taxpayer to cover its cost, not by depreciating it over a \nlong period of time, but rather to make its investment work faster in a \nshort period of time. In other words battery technology and components \nbecome a more attractive investment in the United States.\n  Our provision is very similar to what we are doing in the underlying \nbill with small business equipment and expensing. We are trying to say \nthose investments will help create economic opportunity and stimulus \nright in the United States for small business. Well, here is a large-\nscale opportunity as it relates to battery technology and components \nand we need to grab it before our international competitors do.\n  As President Obama said of the stimulus bill:\n\n       That's why this is not just a short-term program to boost \n     employment. It's one that will invest in our most important \n     priorities like energy and education, health care and a new \n     infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and \n     competitive in the 21st century.\n\n  I could not agree with the President more, as I look at my State, the \npriorities of my constituents, to make sure we are creating stimulative \nactivity, but we are also looking to those areas of our long-term \nfuture where our country can benefit the most.\n  Manufacturing battery technology and components is game-changing \ntechnology. If we can create that kind of opportunity here at home, it \nwill create tens of thousands of construction jobs, engineering jobs, \nmanufacturing jobs, and not only in the near term, but lead to millions \nof jobs in the future. This is the type of investment we need to be \nputting in a stimulus package.\n  Now, I know my colleague from Michigan is on the floor and that she \nis very interested in making sure the battery technology gets built in \nthe United States.\n  Ford, for example, announced that the cells for the battery system in \nits first series of plug-in hybrid production vehicles are going to be \nmanufactured in Nersac. Now, Nersac is not some upper Midwest town. It \nis a city in France. I think they being manufactured in Nersac \nhighlights the fact that if we do not act, our competitors will.\n\n[[Page S1634]]\n\nIn fact, if we look at this issue, in the United States we are already \npretty far behind. The United States does lead in the research and \ndevelopment of lithium-ion battery technology over countries such as \nChina, Korea, and Japan, but they are the countries that are actually \ncommercializing and producing the product using this technology.\n  In fact, China has over 120 companies involved in the production of \nlithium-ion battery technology, and their battery manufacturing \nindustry supports over 250,000 jobs already in this area.\n  We, in the United States, have no comparable lithium-ion facility in \nour country--none. U.S. auto executives have taken a look at this \nsituation and have said without homegrown suppliers here in the United \nStates, the United States could become as dependent on Asian-made \nbatteries as we currently are on Middle East oil. Now, if we are doing \nthe R, why aren't we also advancing the opportunity to be a player in \nmanufacturing?\n  It is not only batteries. Asia has the engineers and manufacturing \nexpertise and capacity to make many of these component parts. In fact, \nSouth Korea is a great example of seizing on this opportunity. A few \nweeks ago, their Prime Minister announced that South Korea will invest \n$38 billion over the next 4 years on environmental projects related to \nenergy and the economy to create a million jobs.\n  Now, we think of $38 billion compared to the package we have on the \nfloor today. But $38 billion--for a country whose GDP is one-tenth the \nsize of ours--that would be like the United States putting $400 billion \nto match South Korea's downpayment on a clean energy future.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, will my friend be willing to yield for \na question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes, I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you.\n  Madam President, I want to ask a question of the Senator from \nWashington State. But I first want to thank her for her vision. She has \nbeen the person who has understood this is more than just about \nresearch and development, that this is about actually putting assets in \nAmerica, in jobs here in America through manufacturing. I thank her for \nher vision. It has been my honor and pleasure to work with you on this \nissue.\n  But I am wondering if the Senator is aware, in fact, of other \ncountries such as South Korea which certainly has been investing in \nthis. But Germany, last summer, developed what they call the Great \nBattery Alliance. Japan created the first batteries. Ford Motor \nCompany, in doing their first Ford Escape Hybrid, their first Escape \nHUV, while we are proud that was done in America, in fact, the battery \ncame from Japan. So China, Japan, South Korea, Germany--India now has \nannounced a manufacturing strategy.\n  So I ask, as you look at this, if she has looked at those other \ncountries as well?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Michigan, and \nI thank her for her leadership on this issue as well, because she has \nbeen vocal in saying the United States needs to create manufacturing \nincentives in the plug-in area and to lead the future of the automobile \nindustry here in the United States. So I thank her for her question. \nShe is absolutely right.\n  The United States has fallen behind. We have no battery production \nfacilities in the United States. So we can pat ourselves on the back \nall we want about how we are leading in R in battery technology, but \nthat is not translating into manufacturing leadership and homegrown \njobs. The time has come when Americans and people around the globe \nbelieve we have to get off of fossil fuel and that the electricity grid \nholds great promise. The advent of these new battery technologies is \nallowing consumers to go an average of 100 miles per gallon. As my \ncolleague mentioned, Europeans are already boost to their economies by \npromoting that kind of manufacturing. And I want to emphasize that our \namendment does not say which companies would produce this battery \ntechnology. We are simply saying we should have some of this \nmanufacturing in the United States.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I wonder if my colleague will yield \nfor one more question.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I just came from a very large conference called the \nBlue Green Conference with about 2,500 people who are in town from \nenvironmental groups, labor organizations, business organizations, \nfocused on exactly what the Senator is talking about. I wonder if the \nSenator is aware we have had people on the Hill actually supporting \nthis wonderful amendment and arguing that, in fact, there are jobs, \ngood-paying jobs, available from doing exactly what she is talking \nabout? I wonder if my colleague is aware of the extent to which there \nis such a broad coalition of people across this country now supporting \nexactly what she is talking about?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I think the electrification of automobiles as an energy \nsource is gaining a lot of attention. There is a growing understanding \nthat building a smart grid and allowing plug-ins to fill up when \nelectricity prices are cheapest and when there is a lot of unused \nelectricity capacity, turning our cars into additional storage capacity \nmakes a lot of sense. People believe we could create hundreds of \nthousands of jobs in the near future and that we would be able to \nbenefit from that as a basis of an infrastructure.\n  I look at China and think of the 250,000 jobs they have already \ncreated just in battery manufacturing. And that 120 companies are \nfocusing just on manufacturing lithium-ion batteries. They have already \ncreated an economic opportunity, an edge for Asia in this marketplace \nthat will continue to sustain them for the future in the automobile \nmanufacturing industry.\n  We are at a totally new day, where we should pause and reassess all \nnew opportunities to strengthen our country, and yet we are not \ncapitalizing on the economic opportunity that is going to fundamentally \nreshape automobile transportation for the better.\n  I thank my colleague from Michigan for pointing those facts out and \nraising those questions because, again, she has been steadfast in this \nand understands this is about a manufacturing opportunity for the \nfuture of the United States as a manufacturing base. Whether those are \nforeign competitors, whether those are new domestic companies that have \nnever been on the radar screen, whether they are the domestic \nmanufacturers that are working hard to make the transition to this new \nopportunity, this amendment would address all of those.\n  In conclusion, today the United States is home to about 35,000 less \nfactories than in the year 2000. In that short period of time we have \nlost around 4 million manufacturing jobs. Clean energy technologies, \nand particularly electric vehicle manufacturing, is a keystone \nstrategic opportunity that could help change that around. That is why I \nam offering this amendment with my colleague, Senator Hatch, and \nothers, because it can be effective stimulus today, but pay long-term \ndividends for the future of the U.S. economy.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, at the center of our Nation's current \nfinancial crisis are our Nation's automakers and our homeowners. These \nare our two areas that we cannot afford to ignore, if we are to have \nany hope of an economic recovery.\n  I would like to focus on our automakers. Some economists have \nremarked that as our automakers go, so goes our Nation. Other \neconomists have complained that the auto industry has been too slow to \nmodernize and too slow to prepare for the future.\n  We all know that 97 percent of our vehicles run on gasoline and \ndiesel. But what you don't hear often enough is that American \nautomakers are actually poised to lead the world into the next era of \nvehicle technology. They are prepared to produce flexible, affordable, \nattractive, and long-range vehicles that run on an alternative fuel \nthat is much cheaper, much cleaner, more abundant, and completely \ndomestic. That alternative fuel is electricity from our electric grid. \nOther than natural gas, there is no other alternative fuel that comes \nclose to having so many of these qualities.\n  Last Congress, Senator Cantwell and I came together to introduce the \nFreedom Act, and with the assistance of Chairman Baucus and Senator \nGrassley, the committee's Republican ranking member, we were able to \nget major provisions of that bill passed into law, including tax \ncredits for consumers who purchase the plug-in electric and plug-in \nhybrid vehicles.\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\n  I was the author of the CLEAR ACT, which promoted hybrid and \nalternative vehicles and which passed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. \nIt was pretty clear at the time that the Japanese automakers had the \njump on this technology. However, I was pleased to see that it didn't \ntake too long for our American automakers to respond and to produce \nvery good and very efficient hybrid electric vehicles.\n\n  The next step of using electrons off the grid is a more revolutionary \nshift, because it will have a more dramatic impact on our Nation's \ndependency on oil.\n  Many of my colleagues may not be aware that American automakers and \nAmerican technology companies are poised to lead the world in plug-in \nelectric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In the next 2 years, General \nMotors will be offering two new plug-in vehicles for commercial sale. \nThese will be vehicles developed and manufactured right here in \nAmerica. American lithium ion battery makers lead the world in \ntechnological advances, and are also ready to set up major \nmanufacturing operations here on our shores. American companies also \nlead the world in electric motor technologies, ultra-capacitors, and \nother important electronic controller technologies.\n  Senator Cantwell and I are offering an amendment that would ensure \nthat this manufacturing stays here at home. In most cases, these \nAmerican companies are prepared to begin manufacturing immediately. So \nthis amendment is timely and goes to the heart and soul of the stimulus \nbill we are now considering.\n  I personally do not believe our auto industry will survive on old \nideas and past technologies. What could be more important in this \nstimulus bill than to assist the auto industry as it attempts to lead \nthe world in a new era of vehicle technologies. I am very grateful to \nSenator Cantwell, and Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley for making \nthis proposal a priority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \norder we have set up that following Senator Hutchison, the majority \nhave time, then Senator Wicker have time, then the majority have time, \nand then Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I have been listening to the debate this morning. I \nwant to make one point. How did we get where we are? We have seen all \nthis finger pointing. We have said that President Bush got us where we \nare, that we do not want to take responsibility for the fact he could \nnot spend a penny we did not give him, and the vast majority--97 \npercent of the majority--voted for every appropriations bill that came \nthrough this place.\n  So when we point to other people, where we need to be pointing is to \nus. The vast majority of the majority party voted against every \namendment. I offered over $10 billion per appropriations cycle on the \nbills. The vast majority voted against the cut. So I think if we are \ngoing to point to a pox on a house, it ought to come right here--the \nlack of responsibility, where we demonstrate with our actions every day \nwe are much more interested in the next election than we are in the \nnext generation.\n  We heard Senator Alexander today talking about that it is not our \nmoney, it is the taxpayers' money, and we are going to have to pay it \nback. Nobody alive in this room today will pay back any of this money. \nTheir children and their grandchildren will pay back this money.\n  This bill is doing exactly the same thing we did to get into this \nmess. We are about to spend $1 trillion of money we don't have for the \nvast majority of the things in this bill that we don't need.\n  Let me explain to the American people a little bit of the workings in \nthe Senate. There is about $300 billion worth of spending in the bill \nwe have on the floor that has been put in there so we won't have to \nmake hard choices when it comes to the appropriations bills that come \nthrough this body this year. So we take $300 billion that we know \nshould be in the regular appropriations bills and we put it in this \nbill so we don't have to use regular order. That gives us more room to \ndo more Government spending, more interference in the lives of \nAmericans without being responsible for it. When I say $300 billion, \nthe real cost is $600 billion.\n  It strikes me that if you were going to ask the American people how \nbest to stimulate the economy and you are going to spend $1 trillion to \ndo it, the best and smartest allocation of those resources would be to \ngive the money back to the American people. In our wisdom, we think we \nknow better than they do how to spend money. The thing that made this \nthe greatest country in the world is this wonderful market capitalism \nthat said people will serve their own best interests. We have the very \nego to think we can decide for them.\n  I think we need some stimulus--I don't disagree with that--but I \ndon't think we need to do it right now. I think we need to fix the \nmortgage market and the housing market and the credit market before we \ntouch any kind of stimulus. If we do a stimulus, the best stimulus we \ncould do would be to give the money back to the American people and let \nthem allocate it in ways they know are best for them individually. That \nproposal was rejected out of hand. Now, why would that be rejected? \nBecause we have this false sense that Washington knows better. Well, I \nwill tell my colleagues the predicament we are in proves we don't. We \ndon't know better, we don't have a clue, when we bring a $900 billion \nspending bill to the floor and we have accepted one amendment to cut \n$246 million out of it and we have had votes--both voice votes and \nrecorded votes--on less than 20 amendments, and we are told by the \nmajority leader we have to finish so we can get to conference. This \nbill ought to have 1,000 amendments on it, if we are truly going to do \nthe work of the American people. We ought to debate this bill line by \nline. I will not agree to any unanimous consent until the next 15 \namendments I have, have a scheduled time to be brought up so the \nAmerican people can hear about all the stinky stuff that is in this \nbill.\n  The biggest earmark in history is in this bill: $2 billion. There are \ntons of things that need to come out of this bill. As the American \npeople have learned what is in this bill, their common sense--which is \non a one-for-one basis a thousandfold greater than our common sense as \nSenators--is being totally ignored. That is why the people in this \ncountry routinely are rejecting this bill now. You can do all the \npromotion of it you want; you can use all the moveon.org; you can do \nall the Web sites you want, but when they smell a skunk--their \nolfactory senses are quite acute--this is a skunk. This bill stinks. \nThis bill is the biggest generational theft bill that has ever come \nthrough this body. What I mean by that is we have a standard of living \nin this country that is 30 percent greater than anywhere else in the \nworld, and it will guarantee, this bill will guarantee your children \nand grandchildren will lose every bit of that edge, every bit of it.\n  So how did we get here? We got here by us thinking we knew better, by \nus ignoring the very principles that created this great country. Then \nwe refused to admit it. We created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Then we \nblamed an administration when we tied their hands to fix it, and we say \nit is an administration's fault when it is our fault. We tried to \nsocialize the risk so everybody in this country, even if they couldn't \nafford it, could have a home. Now what we are doing is we are going to \ncharge our grandchildren to get us out of it when we were in a business \nwhere we never had any business. If you look at the enumerated powers \nof the Constitution, it gives us no authority whatsoever to do what we \nhave done. So when we abandon the principles we were founded upon, we \nget in tremendously tall, deep weeds. That is where we find ourselves \nnow.\n  The idea that we can borrow more money we don't have to spend on more \nthings we don't need and ignore the wisdom of the average American \ncitizen on how best to spend their money is insane. Yet we have spent \n2\\1/2\\ days--that is all we have spent so far on a $1 trillion bill, \n2\\1/2\\ days--and have had 20 votes, and now we are told by the majority \nleader we need to hurry up. ``Hurry up'' is what got us in this \ntrouble. We need a methodical explanation to the American people for \nevery line that is in this bill--every line item. We need an \nexplanation of why we are putting in Medicaid funds to bail out the\n\n[[Page S1636]]\n\nStates at twice the level of what the Governors actually asked for. Why \nwould we do that? Because we know better. In our ultimate wisdom, we \nknow better? And while we are talking about the States, the worst thing \nwe can do is bail out the States because we will be transferring our \nwonderful illogic to the States and saying you don't have to be \nfiscally responsible. That is what we are going to be telling them, so \nthat in the future, they won't put in a rainy day fund, as Oklahoma \nhas, and plan for the future and control their spending increases. No, \nthey will say: Don't worry about it; the Federal Government will come \nbail us out.\n  I am adamantly opposed to us transferring the absolute economic chaos \nwe have created to the States. The States need to make hard choices \nnow. We need to do what we need to do, which is fix housing, fix \nmortgages, fix the banking system. Then, when we have done that, which \nwill fix all these other problems, then come with a real stimulus that \nallows the American people--the American people--much like what the \nmajority of the McCain bill does--to decide how they are going to spend \nthe money.\n  Since we are so down on the business sector in this country that \ncreates all the jobs, small business and large business alike, why \ndon't we think about maybe having a competitive tax on our corporations \nthat is competitive with the rest of the world. No. What do we do? We \nhave one 10 percent higher than anybody else in the world. Yet it is \nbusiness's fault we are in this mess. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. We are in this mess because Congress put us in this mess; not \nany President, not Bill Clinton, not George Bush, and certainly not \nBarack Obama.\n  Let's be honest with the American people. Let's fess up: We don't \nknow what we are doing. A $1 trillion bill was cobbled together in 4 \nweeks with earmarks like crazy through it for every special interest \ngroup that is out there so we can look good to certain of our buddies \nand especially the ones who give us campaign contributions. That is \nwhat describes this bill, not an ethical, methodical, ``how do we fix \nthe problem we have'' kind of scrutiny that is required. You cannot fix \na problem until you know what the problem is, and the problem is us. We \ncreated this mess, and our actions created this mess.\n  The President signed the children's health program. I am not opposed \nto a children's health program. I am not opposed to helping children \nget the health care they need. But this body rejected a way to do that \nwhich wouldn't have increased taxes $71 billion and would have covered \nevery child. But, no, we are smarter than that because we want to tell \npeople where they are going to get their health care and how they are \ngoing to get it. And then, when we can't afford it, do you know what we \nare going to do? We are going to ration it, just like every other \ncountry that has centralized control over their health care. Then what \nis going to happen to our cancer cure rates which are 50 percent higher \nthan anywhere else in the world? They are going to be the same as the \nrest of the world: They are going to go down. Now we have comparative \neffectiveness that we want to put through that says the Government--\nsome Government bureaucrat is going to tell doctors how to practice \nmedicine. That is in this too. We are going to have them tell us how to \npractice medicine. We forgot one thing on the way to the barn, and that \nis the practice of medicine is 40 percent art and 60 percent science \nand everywhere in the world, where they have a centralized government \nhealth care system, they have thrown out the art of medicine, which \ntends to deal with the whole person and how that interacts with the \nphysical aspects of that person.\n\n  To me, it is deeply disappointing that we find ourselves where we are \ntoday. I don't think pointing fingers anywhere except back at ourselves \naccomplishes anything. Yet I have heard that three or four times this \nmorning on the floor: It is somebody else's fault. No, it is not; it is \nour fault.\n  The first thing to getting healthy as addicts is to admit we have a \nproblem. We need to be in a 10-step program. That is what we need, a \n10-step program that will put us back on the board to where our \nFounding Fathers thought we ought to be and where the average American \nwants us to be. We are addicted to the ego of trying to run other \npeople's lives. We are addicted to the ego of spending money, thinking \nwe know best how to spend it. We are addicted to the ego that when \nsomebody else has problems, we can always fix it. We can't always fix \nit. We can't fix all the problems that are in front of us today. The \nAmerican people, through their own ingenuity and their own sacrifice, \nare going to have to make some hard choices. When we don't make hard \nchoices, we are doubly guilty because what we have done is we have made \nthe choices harder for them that they are going to have to make.\n  My prayer--and it is a prayer--is that we would, as a body, drop the \nwords ``Democrat'' and ``Republican,'' drop the words ``conservative'' \nand ``liberal,'' and that our goal would be what is in the most \nefficient, long-term, best interests of those of us who are here today \nand those who are coming.\n  I ran a campaign to become Senator and the focus of my campaign, \nunfortunately, was we were about to find ourselves where we are today. \nI am so sorry I was right. I am so sorry I was right, but it doesn't \ntake a lot of vision to see where we were going. Nobody has voted \nagainst President Bush and nobody has voted against more appropriations \nbills than me. It didn't have anything to do with party politics; it \nhad everything to do with the future. Yet we find ourselves bogged down \nin debate.\n  I wish to add one other thing. One of the reasons we have to get out \nof here is because we have Members who have booked hotels this weekend. \nTell me how many people in America think that is an important reason \nfor us to hurry up and finish this bill. There is no reason for us to \nhurry up, No. 1. There is no reason for us not to look at every area of \nthis bill and make sure the American people know about it. There is no \nreason for us not to do what the average man would do, and that is make \npriorities.\n  The other problem with this bill, which is extremely disappointing--\nand I know it has to be to President Obama because he campaigned on a \nline-by-line look at the Federal Government to get rid of some of the \n$300 billion every year in waste, fraud, and abuse. That was one of his \ncampaign issues. One of his campaign promises was to do competitive \nbidding on every contract over $25,000. There is not one mandate in \nthis bill to force competitive bidding. That is one of the amendments I \nwish to offer, to force us to do competitive bidding. If we are going \nto pass this stinky bill, at least if we waste $1 trillion, we will \nwaste it efficiently.\n  When I look at my grandkids, as does everybody else in this country, \nwe wish for the best for our grandchildren. I have to tell my \ncolleagues this body has put the first shackle already on their future. \nWhen we pass this bill, we are going to put that lock around their \nother leg and we are going to put a padlock on it and we are going to \nthrow away the key and we are going to hobble them away from the \nAmerican dream.\n  We are going to take it away. We are going to take away the very \nbright light shining on a hill. America, if you are listening, don't \nlet this body do what it is about to do. It will ruin your children's \nfuture in the name of us knowing best rather than you knowing best.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, did the Senator see the AP \nNews release this morning at 11:30 that the chairwoman of the \ncongressional oversight panel for the bailout funds told the Senate \nBanking Committee that the Treasury, in 2008, paid $254 billion and \nreceived assets worth about $176 billion? I think everybody knows we \npassed TARP in a big hurry, just as this legislation has not gone \nthrough the hearings and the normal process. So, apparently, according \nto the chairperson of the congressional oversight panel for bailout \nfunds, in 2008, our Treasury paid $254 billion and received assets \nworth $176 billion. It seems to me that is about $80 billion that the \ntaxpayers lost.\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, the taxpayers lost $80 billion. I voted for the \noriginal TARP money because we were told that money was going to \naddress the toxic assets, which is the problem we need to solve first.\n  I spoke on the floor two nights ago using the corollary of treating \nsymptoms versus treating disease. This bill\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\ntreats symptoms; it doesn't treat disease. I know several colleagues \nare waiting to talk.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lieberman). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have two colleagues waiting to speak. Whoever goes \nfirst, I will ask for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, isn't there a unanimous consent agreement \nthat Senator Schumer goes next, then Senator Inhofe, and then somebody \nfrom the majority side, and then Senator Hutchison, and then somebody \nfrom the majority side, and then Senator Wicker, and then somebody from \nthe majority side, and then Senator Hatch?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is correct.\n  Pursuant to that order, the Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Illinois for \na question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from New York. I would like to \nengage him. I listened carefully to Senator Coburn, my friend, a \nconservative Republican. I think that perhaps some elements of history \nhave been forgotten. We don't want to dwell on the past, but those who \ndon't learn the past are usually destined to repeat the mistakes of the \npast. When President Clinton left office, he left President Bush a \nsurplus and he left him with a national debt, accumulated since the \ntime of George Washington, of $5 trillion. Eight years later, when \nPresident Bush left office, he left President Obama--who has been \nPresident for 2 weeks and 2 days--with the biggest deficit in recent \nmemory, $1 trillion, and a national debt that had doubled under the \nBush administration.\n  I ask the Senator from New York if he is familiar with the fact that \nthe debt incurred under the Bush administration comes down to $17,000 \nfor every man, woman, and child in America, for the 8-year period of \nthat administration? Is the Senator familiar with that fact?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for the question. I am indeed \nfamiliar with that. I have to tell my colleague it sort of astounds me \nhow there is sort of a role reversal. In the past, the Republican Party \nhas been known as the fiscal-and-austere party, and we have been \nlabeled--or accused of being--the tax-and-spend party. When President \nClinton left office, there was a significant surplus, I believe close \nto $300 billion a year. When George Bush took office, he ruined that \nrather quickly. We now have the deep deficit he left President Obama. \nPresident Obama has agreed to deal with that deficit once we get \nthrough the economic crisis.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The second question is this: There are complaints about \nthis recovery reinvestment bill, which is currently at about $900 \nbillion over a several-year period of time. Isn't the Senator aware, \nand haven't we recently been briefed that we expect in the next 2 \ncalendar years $1 trillion less in spending by the American economy, \nand the amount we are talking about to try to put back into that \naccounts for less than half of what we know is lying ahead?\n  If we are going to invigorate the economy, create jobs, and give \nbusinesses a chance and give struggling families a chance, $900 \nbillion, though it seems huge on its face, in comparison to the \neconomic crisis we face, is at least proportional to the challenge.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I think my colleague answers the question right. A $2 \ntrillion shortfall in the economy is not just a number; it is millions \nof people out of work and tens of millions of families whose paychecks \nare squeezed, people not being able to go to college who deserve a \ncollege education by their grades, and it is small businesses going \nunder. I say to my colleagues, there is a lot of talk about little \nitems in the bill that are called ``pork.'' Take them out. Don't use it \nas an excuse not to vote for this bill. I daresay if we took every \nsingle one of those items out, we still would not get any more votes. \nIt is nothing more than an excuse. We ought not to forget that.\n  I was going to speak for 15 or 20 minutes. My colleague from West \nVirginia has been waiting. Is it possible for me to yield 5 minutes to \nhim by unanimous consent and then return to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WICKER. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, then I will speak myself, even though I \nam not as articulate and intelligent as my friend from West Virginia.\n  I wish to address a few topics. First, yesterday, the President \ncorrectly put some limits on excessive compensation payments being paid \nout by financial firms that received taxpayer funds. To me, it is \nplainly unacceptable, at a time when the American public is being asked \nto spend hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out major institutions \nand trillions more to stabilize the financial system, that these \ninstitutions would turn around and reward the very same executives, \nmany of whom created the current crisis.\n  Let me tell you how the average American feels and why this issue \ngenerates such fervor. Very simply, the average American goes to work, \nworks on the factory line, or sits at his or her desk, does nothing \nwrong, and all of a sudden they might be laid off or have their \npaycheck squeezed or their health benefits cut. They are saying: We did \nnothing wrong and we are suffering.\n  Where is the shared sacrifice? Some of these top executives are \ncontinuing to be paid record amounts of money. Nothing bothers the \nAmerican people more than when someone does something wrong and doesn't \nhave to suffer for that, when they are doing nothing wrong and do have \nto suffer. So there is real anger out there. The people in the \nfinancial institutions ought to understand that. Some of the things \nthey are doing, such as the junkets and the jet planes, show a tin ear. \nSo President Obama did the right thing yesterday. Some people said that \nis Government interference. Hello. What about giving these institutions \nmoney? That is Government interference too.\n  The President is not saying there should be limits on compensation \nfor those who don't take the Government funds. He is simply saying if \nyou are going to take Government funds, use them to get the economy \ngoing again by pumping money into the economy, lending to small \nbusinesses, individuals, and others rather than for jets or excessive \nsalaries. So I salute the President, and I support what he did.\n  I think, again, the people in the financial sector have to get with \nit. They have made big mistakes, the people at the top. Everybody is \nbeing hurt by those mistakes and the sacrifice ought to be, at the very \nleast, shared.\n  Second, I want to talk about something in this bill, which is tuition \ntax credits for college for families up to $160,000. I thank Chairman \nBaucus, Senator Grassley, President Obama, and many on both sides of \nthe aisle who supported this provision. I have worked long and hard to \nmake college affordable, particularly for middle-class families. It is \nnot because they deserve it more than others. If you are wealthy, you \ndon't need the help. If you are poor, the Government gives help. I \nwould be very much against cutting the Pell grants in this package. But \nthe families in New York--remember, New York salaries, at least in some \nparts of our State, downstate, are high. The family making $60,000 or \n$70,000, when they get hit with a $20,000 tuition bill, they are like \npoor because they are paying the mortgage, the taxes, and the other \nexpenses, and all of a sudden this bill hits.\n  During this recession, the most severe recession we have had since \nthe Great Depression, there are literally hundreds of thousands of \ncollege students who deserve to stay in college, and hundreds of \nthousands more who deserve to get into college who will not go because \ntheir families don't have the money. When they don't go to college, or \nwhen they drop out of college, or they don't go to the college that \nbest suits them because of financial reasons, not because of academic \nreasons, they lose, their family loses, and America loses as well. That \nis why I worked so hard to get this provision. It is a $2,500 tax \ncredit, partially refundable, so it helps people making $40,000 and \npeople making $80,000, as it should. It will help keep our human \ncapital. This is very important. And I think President Obama showed \nwisdom in making sure there is a power grid that is more efficient that \nwill help us in the future, and wisdom in making sure our health care \nhas IT, which will help us.\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\n  When you read the polls, the American people, once again showing \ntheir wisdom, are saying we would like to have longer term projects in \nhere because when, God willing, we get out of the recession, we would \nlike to have something to show for it, whether it is traditional \ninfrastructure or new infrastructure, including IT and power grid. \nThere is human capital as well. If somebody drops out of college \nbecause they cannot afford it, the statistics show they often never go \nback and we lose as a country. So preserving human capital during these \ndifficult times is important.\n  Again, this proposal has broad bipartisan support. It is not terribly \nexpensive in the scheme of a $900 billion package. I hope we will move \nforward with it.\n  Finally, the last thing I will talk about to my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle is this: I am utterly amazed at the lack of \ncooperation we are getting from so many, the lack of reaching out and \ntrying to meet us part of the way. The bottom line is, we are in the \nmost severe recession since the Great Depression.\n  The great worry is that we go into what the economists call a \ndeflationary spiral. It means prices go downward. Businesses put off \nany expenditures because they think the price is going to get lower and \nlower. The Depression was a deflationary spiral, plain and simple. \nJapan's 10 years of stagnation was a deflationary spiral, less severe \nas a depression but spiral down nonetheless. Unfortunately, the sad \nfact is that economists don't know how to deal with a deflationary \nspiral. If we get into one--which is not likely but possible--we don't \nknow how to get out.\n  So wise, sound economic policy would have us make sure this package \nis strong and gets money into the economy immediately. The kinds of tax \ncuts proposed by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not do \nthat by the admission not of Chuck Schumer but of a conservative \neconomist such as Martin Feldstein. It takes longer for a tax cut to \nget into the economy, and particularly during difficult times people \nsave a lot of the money. I am not saying we should have no tax cuts; 36 \npercent of this package is tax cuts. Yet we hear from our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle that it is not enough. A, it works less \nwell than the spending; B, you need a mix; and C, yes, we did win the \nelection, and the American people are overwhelmingly for this.\n  Frankly, I had expected, given that Senator Reid says we are allowed \nto have amendments and given that he has agreed with Senator McConnell \nthat we should have an old-fashioned conference where amendments are \noffered by people on both sides of the aisle, we would get real support \nand cooperation.\n  This bill has gotten more expensive. The two most expensive \namendments were tax cuts proposed by Republicans, Senator Grassley \nalong with Senator Menendez--Grassley was the lead here--proposed \nadding the AMT, $75 billion; Senator Isakson from Georgia, something I \nsupported although I would like to see it narrowed and more focused, \n$19 billion. If you add those in, the tax cuts are rising, rising, and \nrising in terms of proportion, and still we do not see cooperation from \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  I would like to say to President Obama: Sir, you have bent over \nbackward to listen to suggestions. We have tried as well. But it takes \ntwo to tango. Bipartisanship means two people tangoing. It does not \nmean you should get your way on everything or even half. A third, 40 \npercent is pretty generous.\n  I believe this package will pass because I don't believe the other \nside will want it on its doorstep that it failed. My Republican \ncolleagues in the Senate do not have the luxury of their House \ncolleagues of voting no and the bill would still pass.\n  I am rueful and regretful that we have not seen more real bipartisan \ncooperation at a time when the American people want it, at a time when \nwe need to act quickly, at a time when spending programs--anathema as \nthey may be to some on the other side of the aisle--are the best way to \nget this economy going.\n  I will say--and I am speaking for myself--that the real test here is \nnot how many votes we get, as long as we pass it. That will long be \nforgotten. The real test is whether this proposal puts Americans to \nwork and gets us out of the economic morass we are in--at least begins \nto get us out of the economic morass we are in. I, for one, would say \ndo not decimate this package and make it ineffective to win over enough \npeople so we have 80 votes. That is a distant memory, 80 votes. I know \nit was a hope of the President. Clearly, it is a distant memory. To get \nno votes in the House and to have as little support thus far as we are \ngetting from the Republican side of the aisle shows how out of touch, \nfrankly, my colleagues are with the economy and with the new world in \nwhich we live.\n  I know what it is like. I came to Congress in 1980 when Ronald Reagan \nwas elected to be President. Crime was ripping apart my working-class \nand middle-class district. I got on the Judiciary Committee and the \nCrime Committee. Do you know what I found when I got there? That the \nACLU, an organization I generally support, was writing the crime \nlegislation. They had a view. I respected that. I disagreed with it. I \nthought it was so wrong for the time, that you should lean so far over \non one side that you might let hundreds of guilty people go free lest \nyou convict one innocent person. When I saw that happen, I knew why \nDemocrats had lost. I said the Reagan era was going to be dominant \nbecause we were out of touch.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nthey are just as out of touch today as we were then. The American \npeople want action. They don't want an ideological adherence to no \nGovernment programs, no Government spending, tax cuts, particularly for \nthe wealthy only. They want help with health care, they want help with \neducation, they want help with energy independence. And while they \ncertainly don't want a government to waste money and they certainly \ndon't want the little porky things in this bill, the few--less than \nhalf of 1 percent--that should come out, they want the basis of this \nbill.\n  I make a final plea to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: \nGet with it and help us. Don't stick to your narrow ideological \nphilosophy that served you well in 1981 but doesn't work for the \ngreatest recession we have had since the Great Depression. Maybe in the \ncourse of today, as we work through the amendment process, for the good \nof America and, frankly, for the good of your own party, others on the \nother side of the aisle will come over and truly work with us to get a \nstronger package that will create jobs and get us out of the recession.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have several comments to make on two \ndifferent subjects, one of which was broached by the Senator from New \nYork. Before doing that, I would like to yield to my friend from \nMississippi for no more than 2 minutes and then regain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I was distracted. Is the Senator making a \nrequest?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was making a request to yield 2 minutes to my friend \nfrom Mississippi without giving up the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  Mr. WICKER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I assure my colleagues that I will not \ntake long to ask this question. I had hoped my friend from New York and \nmy friend from Illinois would engage in a colloquy and not have left \nthe Chamber.\n  Much was made in the discussion between the two Senators about the \ndebt President Bush ran up during his administration. I don't know that \nit serves the debate very well to point fingers, but we might as well \nset the record straight for those of us who are paying attention.\n  Congress spends the money, will my friend acknowledge? It is Congress \nthat spends the discretionary funds around here, and it is Congress \nthat sets the spending on autopilot in terms of the mandatory spending. \nThe President\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\ndoes not spend a penny without the consent of this Congress.\n  I hope my friend will also acknowledge that there was not one time \nduring the 8 years of the Bush administration when our friends from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle came forward with their budget proposal \nand proposed a budget that would spend less than was spent by the \nUnited States of America. In fact, in every instance, our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle proposed budgets that spent even more than \nwe actually spent in the end.\n  I just wanted to see if my friend agreed with that point. I thank him \nfor allowing me to make that point.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the answer to the question of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi is yes.\n  Let me make a couple comments.\n  The Senator from New York talked quite a bit about this stimulus \nbill. I contend it is not a stimulus bill, and I will touch on that \npoint in a moment. He was talking about coming here in 1980. I remind \nhim that there are ways you can stimulate this economy. This bill does \nnot do it. This bill spends money, astronomical amounts of money. It is \njust inconceivable that we could be thinking about it. Certainly, if \nyou wind the clock back to 1980, no one ever talked in terms of the \nhundreds of billions of dollars we talk about today.\n  I remind the Senator from New York that back in 1980, the timeframe \nhe was talking about, we had a President who came in 1980 by the name \nof Ronald Reagan. He repeated something that was said by another great \nPresident, who was John Kennedy. Back during the time John Kennedy was \nPresident, they were getting involved in the New Frontier programs. \nThey had a great need for increased revenue. This is a quote from John \nKennedy. He said: We need to increase our revenue, and the best way to \nincrease our revenue is to reduce marginal rates. And he reduced \nmarginal rates, he reduced capital gains rates, and he reduced \ninheritance rates. That resulted in a massive increase in revenue.\n  If you take the decade that is called the Reagan decade of the \neighties, look at 1980, the total amount of money that came in. Revenue \ngenerated from marginal rates was $244 billion. In 1990, it was $466 \nbillion. The revenue that was generated almost doubled in a decade. We \nhad the largest tax reductions, I believe, in the history of this \nNation.\n  Now we are looking at a bill that does not have that. It has two \nlittle, small things that might stimulate the economy in terms of \ndepreciation in small business. The total amount does not even exceed 3 \npercent of the bill.\n  The area where I felt--and I know a lot of people disagree--we could \ndo something to provide jobs for Americans, what should have a greater \npart of this, is road construction and infrastructure. But that did not \nhappen.\n  We are looking at something that right now has a total of $27 billion \nin highways, roads, and bridges. Certainly the occupant of the chair \nunderstands, having served for many years on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, the great needs in this country. We have had several \nstatements made by economists who have said that if there is a way we \ncan provide jobs, do something that is going to have to be done for \nAmerica, this is the time to do it. If you look at the total amount in \nthis bill, out of some $900 billion, we are talking about $27 billion \nis all there is in that area.\n  I say in responding to the comments of the Senator from New York, if \nhe is talking about 1980 and what happened after that time, it is very \nclear that precipitated a decade in the history of this country where \nwe had more revenue generated as a result of taxes being reduced than \nany other time in the history of the country.\n  When we look at what is in this bill that would really stimulate, all \nthe rest of it is spending. I am not going to start reading the list of \nthe $650 million to have people change their TVs and all these things.\n  There are two areas that would stimulate. One would be in the area of \nhiring people--road construction, providing jobs. In my State of \nOklahoma, we happen to have a highway director who I think is the best \none in the Nation. His name is Gary Ridley. He has identified just in \nmy State some $1.1 billion of shovel-ready jobs. They already have the \nenvironmental impact statements. They are projects to get people to \nwork tomorrow. Yet we cannot do that in this bill, and that is the type \nof thing we should be doing.\n  If you add together the tax stimulus and the amount of work that is \nbeing done in terms of roadwork and providing jobs, that comes to \nsomewhere around 7 percent of the total amount. What about the other \n$900 billion? I think it is absurd.\n  The Senator from New York was talking about how Republicans did not \nrespond favorably to the Pelosi bill on the other side. No wonder. It \nis the same type of bill we are looking at here. It actually had $3 \nbillion more for construction than this bill. I think they acted \nresponsibly.\n  I wish Republicans--and I hope this will be the case--would be \nwilling to stand up and jointly, all of us, agree that this is not \ngoing to work and that there is a choice now. We do have a substitute \nthat Senator McCain put forth. It resolves these problems. It has items \nin it that will actually stimulate the economy. I am hoping we will all \nbe able to stick together. I would be very proud if the Republicans are \nable to do that.\n  Now, that is not the reason I wanted to get the floor. I want to \nmention an amendment I have that has not been cleared yet. I compliment \nSenator Inouye. I visited with him, and even though it is something he \nsaid he wouldn't vote for, he would still not object to having it \nconsidered because he thinks it is very important. It has to do with \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  On Monday, I was at Guantanamo Bay, and that was my third trip there. \nThe first was right after 9/11. At that time I realized the statements \nthat were being made about the treatment of detainees were not true; \nthat a lot of the media had misrepresented it. Nonetheless, it is \nsomething that was out there and people felt this was something bad \nthat was taking place in GTMO--Guantanamo Bay.\n  I might mention that we have had that resource since 1903, and it has \nserved us very well. Ironically, our annual lease is $4,000 a year, and \nwe are getting all this for that amount. But I want to share with my \ncolleagues here what we witnessed this past Monday--a few days ago.\n  At this time, we are down now to 245 detainees. Of the 245 detainees, \nthere are 170 of them where their countries will not take them back. In \nother words, what are we going to do with these guys? And by the way, \neven though President Obama came out in his first or second day in \noffice and said two things about Guantanamo Bay--No. 1, we should cease \nall legal proceedings down there; and No. 2, close it within 12 \nmonths--there is a very courageous judge down there who, I guess, felt \nthe separation of powers in the Constitution meant something, so he \nsaid, no, we are not going to do this; we are going to continue with \nour trials for now. He is trying such people as Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, \nthe brainpower behind 9/11, and four of his coconspirators; and Ali al-\nShihri, who is the person who was involved in the USS Cole tragedy that \nkilled many people, including 17 of our brave soldiers. These are the \ntypes of hard-core people who are being tried there. These are military \ntribunals, and they need to continue. That is what the judge said, and \nhe is continuing to this day.\n  By the way, if we ended up starting to try those in our Federal court \nsystem, because of the rules of evidence and because of the nature of \nthe terrorists and the testimony that would come up, they are \nestimating it would take about 12 months to build a courtroom--as it \ndid down there--at a cost of about $10 million.\n  So my concern is this: In the event we were forced to close \nGuantanamo, it would not work to do it at the present time until some \nsolution comes up as to what we are going to do with all these \ndetainees. Some of the detainees are clean, ready to go back, and will \nbe transferred back. But we have about 170 where there is no place for \nthem to go, even if we tried them and turned them loose.\n  There has been a suggestion that if we close Guantanamo, there are \nsome 17 military installations in the continental United States that \nwould be able to accept some of these detainees and so that is where \nthey would end up going. The problem with that is, I don't know of one \nSenator serving in here\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\nwho wishes to say it is all right to go ahead and put them in \nMississippi or put them in Iowa or put them, in my case, in Oklahoma. \nOne of the 17 installations happens to be Fort Sill, located in \nOklahoma. We don't want that. You don't want them in West Virginia. So \nthere is no reason for us unnecessarily to target ourselves in this \ncase.\n  I have to also say that anyone who believes people have been abused \ndown there, all you have to do is go down. I have done tours of prisons \nall over the United States, as well as military prisons elsewhere. I \ncan say without any doubt in my mind that I have never seen a prison \nwhere people are cared for better than they are there. There is one \nmedical practitioner for every two detainees who are down there. The \nmedical facilities even do colonoscopies for anyone over 50, if they \nwant them. None of these detainees would ever have treatment like that \nback in their country of origin. The food they are getting is better \nthan they have ever had before. So it is not true they are being \nabused.\n  In fact, they have six camps, numbered from one to six, starting with \nthose who have the least problems, to those who are ready to be \nreturned someplace, and getting up to the real hard-core terrorists. \nEven in camp six, which is supposed to house the toughest guys, they \nare outside having recreation 3 hours a day. So people are not being \nabused there, and I think it is important that people understand that.\n  That is not, however, where I am coming from on this amendment. I \nknow for a fact, if we can get this voted on, it would pass. Those \nindividuals who believe we should close GTMO are always very careful to \nsay we have to figure out what we are going to do with the hard-core \ndetainees down there, because we can't turn them loose. You can't bring \nthem back and try them in our court system because the rules of \nevidence in a tribunal are different. You can't read them their rights \nwhen you are apprehending them--apprehending a terrorist. It doesn't \nwork. In a tribunal, hearsay evidence is admissible, but it is not in \nour court system. So that is something that wouldn't work.\n  So even though I think we should not close GTMO, now or ever--because \nI think it is a resource and an asset that we have in this country that \nwe can use--for those individuals who feel we should at some point \nclose it, I agree--and I can't find anyone who disagrees--that we \nshould not close it until we determine what is going to happen to those \n110 to 170 detainees where they do not have anyplace to go.\n  Let me explain my amendment, and it is No. 198, which I have not been \nable to bring up for consideration yet. It would prohibit the use of \nany of the funds that are in this stimulus bill--and the stimulus bill \ndoes have money that goes into modernizing and doing things for various \npenal institutions--toward preparing our institutions in the \ncontinental United States to accept these terrorist detainees and \nhousing them in the continental United States instead of at GTMO.\n  I think if you look very carefully at how simple this legislation is, \nit says:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise being made \n     available to any department or agencies of the United States \n     Government by this Act may be obligated to expend it for the \n     following purposes. To transfer any detainee of the United \n     States housed at the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to any \n     facility in the United States or its territories.\n\n  Who is going to oppose that? Is there one person who would vote \nagainst that?\n\n       Or to construct, improve, modify, or otherwise enhance any \n     facility in the United States or its territories for the \n     purpose of housing any detainee described in paragraph 1.\n\n  Those are the guys who are down there--the bad guys; the terrorists. \nAnd thirdly:\n\n       To house or otherwise incarcerate any detainee described.\n\n  I know the Senator from Iowa doesn't want the detainees coming to \nIowa; the Senator from West Virginia doesn't want them coming to West \nVirginia; I seriously question whether they want them in Ohio; and I \ncertainly don't want them in Oklahoma. So that is all this is. It is an \namendment that, should this bill pass--and of course if it goes to \nconference, I don't have any way of knowing what will stay in and what \nwill come out--and I hope it does not pass when we vote on it tonight \nor tomorrow, or whenever that time is--but if it does pass, I want an \namendment in it so that no one will try to transfer those detainees now \ndown in Guantanamo Bay to any of the prisons in the continental United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Inhofe amendment would, in effect, \nprevent implementing the President's decision to close Guantanamo and \nundo the benefits to America's standing that have resulted from \nPresident Obama's decision.\n  The Executive order signed by President Obama last month requires \nGuantanamo be closed within 1 year.\n  The goal of closing Guantanamo has broad support. In this last \npresidential election, both candidates, then-Senator Obama and Senator \nMcCain, supported closing Guantanamo.\n  Last year, five former Secretaries of State, including Colin Powell, \nHenry Kissinger, and James Baker, called for closing Guantanamo. \nPresident Bush has said he would support closing Guantanamo, as did his \nSecretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, and Secretary of Defense Robert \nGates.\n  No one says that closing Guantanamo will be easy. To achieve this, \nthe Executive order signed by President Obama sets up a Special Task \nForce to review the status of the approximately 250 detainees still \nheld at Guantanamo and make recommendations on what to do with these \nindividuals.\n  Currently about one-third of the Guantanamo detainees have been \ncleared for release or transfer to a third country. The State \nDepartment is in the process of trying to find countries willing to \ntake these detainees, where they will not be subjected to torture or \npersecution.\n  For about another third of the Guantanamo detainees, the Defense \nDepartment has declared its intention to bring criminal charges and try \nthese individuals. The military commission process is now under review, \nso it is not clear when these trials will resume or be completed.\n  But we know, right now, that for a certain number of detainees \ncurrently at Guantanamo, we will need to continue to hold these \nindividuals beyond the 1-year deadline for closing Guantanamo. These \ndetainees are too dangerous to be released, and yet the Government is \nnot able to charge them criminally.\n  In some of these cases, the Government cannot bring charges because \nthe evidence we have against these detainees is insufficient for \npurposes of a criminal prosecution. Or, we now know, in some cases the \nevidence may be inadmissible because it was obtained through torture or \ncoercion. The policies of abuse approved by the Bush administration \nhave damaged our ability to bring these individuals to justice.\n  Those detainees too dangerous to release but unable to be tried, will \ncontinue to be held. We will need a place to house these individuals. \nThe Defense Department has already reportedly begun reviewing \nfacilities at military bases in the United States for that purpose. We \nshould await the recommendations of the Special Task Force established \nby President Obama's Executive order on how to handle these difficult \ndetainees.\n  This amendment would undo the benefits of President Obama's action to \nclose Guantanamo. It would harm America's standing and leave our troops \nless safe.\n  It prejudges the review of the task force. It doesn't belong in a \nstimulus package.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Inhofe \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The distinguished Senator \nfrom the State of West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, be the next Democratic speaker \nafter the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might say there is already an order. It is all worked \nout, but I appreciate the Senator's statement. My understanding is that \nwas the case. That was already agreed to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. So I am reinforcing the truth?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will say very briefly that I am \nstunned by the speech from the Senator from Oklahoma. What he is \nbasically saying--and I don't know whether he has ever been on the \nIntelligence Committee, but some of us have and have watched and \nstudied interrogation and detention at Guantanamo, and a lot of other \nthings for a very long time, and watched what happened under the Bush \nadministration, and I choose not to get into that right now.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. No.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the Chair, since I was directly referred to, am I \nnot entitled to ask a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor, \nand he has declined to yield.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. What he is basically saying, in an extraordinary \nstatement, is that there shall be no closing of Guantanamo. But then he \nis saying that if Guantanamo is closed, that there shall be no taking \nof prisoners from Guantanamo and putting them anywhere within the \nUnited States of America, thereby, No. 1, casting extraordinary \ncriticism on some of the toughest, finest and, when necessary, very \ntough prisons in the United States, including in his State, my State, \nand many other States.\n  But what he is really saying is he wants Guantanamo to stay open. And \nby saying that, what he is saying is he wants to create more people who \nhate the United States and more people who go to the cause of al-Qaida, \nand I find that an extraordinary statement, which he has every right to \nmake and every right to believe with a full heart. I just don't run \ninto a whole lot of people who know the situation who think like that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will not.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the $87 billion in \ntemporary, targeted Medicaid relief in this recovery bill. There is an \nundeniable link between health care and our economy, and that is \nobvious. The Federal investment of health care now a part of this \neconomic recovery bill will go a long way to stabilize our economy. \nHealth and economic stabilization, stimulus, or whatever you want to \ncall it, are intertwined. Actually, leading economists have found that \ntargeted aid of this sort--Medicaid--will generate increased economic \nactivity of $1.36 for every dollar that is spent.\n  But there are a lot more important things than that. Our economy is \nworse than it has been certainly in my memory. The tragedies being \nplayed out in West Virginia and other parts of the country are almost \nbeyond belief. We sit here in constant session in the Senate and keep \nin touch with our States. We had another huge business close in West \nVirginia yesterday. The tragedies pile up, one after the other. People \ndon't know where they are going to get their next meal. The human \npsychology begins to work and people begin to spiral downward, just as \nbanks spiral downward. They begin to fold in on themselves. And when \nthey fold in on themselves, they lose their confidence and then they \naren't willing to try things, accept things, to take new steps. So the \nMedicaid money is incredibly important.\n  It is getting very hard for people to put food on their table, and I \nthink it is very easy for people to understand that Medicaid is part of \nthe fabric of America. Hard-working families depend on Medicaid. Our \nfamilies in West Virginia are hard working. Fifty percent of all the \nbabies born in West Virginia are born under Medicaid. That is not the \nfault of the State of West Virginia, that is not the fault of the \npeople of West Virginia, it is simply a reflection of the economic \ntravails that face our State and that we have to deal with. We want to \nhelp them get back on their feet.\n  So we have this $87 billion--and there are going to be attempts to \nlessen it--in FMAP. Estimates from the Government Accountability Office \nsay local and State governments are facing $31 billion in deficits over \nthe course of the next 2 years. I think, personally, that is modest, it \nis underestimated. I was a Governor. I went through the 1982-1983 \nrecession in West Virginia, where interest rates went up to 19 percent. \nIt was a horrible time. We survived it. But State revenues often \nevaporate very rapidly during an economic downturn. One of the first \nthings Governors sometimes do is to cut Medicaid. They sort of cut \nMedicaid because sometimes they think Medicaid is for people who are \npoorer than they are, and therefore somehow it isn't important, it is \nsaying that some people are not as important, which is akin to saying \nsome people are more important than others, depending on their income--\nwhich is a philosophy sometimes that divides the two sides of this \nbody.\n\n  So I say this is important. There will be a variety of amendments \nbrought up to cut it. They will cloak themselves in other words, which \nwill be good, but their purpose will be to cut Medicaid, and when you \nare cutting Medicaid, you are cutting health insurance and all sorts of \nthings that people need in times of tragedy. We are surely in a time of \ntragedy.\n  Having said that, I simply note to the President, with his \npermission, that later in the day--I do have on file at the desk two \namendments, one that would jump start something which is incredibly \nimportant in this country and that is having a GPS digitalized air \ntraffic control system. We are the only country in the modern world--in \nfact we are behind Mongolia in this case--that does not have a \ndigitalized GPS system, where you can downgrade inefficiency in \nlandings and distances of planes apart from each other because of the \nprecision.\n  Our present system is an x ray, an analog. This system is an MRI. \nThat is what we need. We don't have one. We have to start one. It is a \njob creator. I have discussed with my ranking member, Kay Bailey \nHutchison, who has a different way of funding it, $550 million. We have \nto do that. We have to do that for safety in the skies. It is a job \ncreator. We have thousands of airports in this country.\n  I put my colleagues on notice that I plan to go to that. Also, we \nhave to extend the FAA itself. Its authorization is going to run out. \nWe need to extend it for a variety of reasons. I will not go into those \nat the present time. But the extension of FAA reauthorization is in the \ninterests of every Republican and every Democrat in this body. I will \nbe making a case for that, if given the chance, later in the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I know the distinguished chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee has spoken, and we are working very hard on an \namendment that would be an infrastructure amendment. It would be money \nthat we want to spend now, but it will be spent in the future. I think \nif we have infrastructure requirements that we know we are going to \nneed in the future and we can push them up for 2 years, that is a \npolicy all of us can agree to. That is exactly what the distinguished \nchairman and I are working on.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I know that modernization of our air traffic \ncontrol system is certainly something we would like to be ahead of \nMongolia in doing. But in addition to that, we want to make sure we \nhave the efficiencies in the system. Not only will it create jobs in \nthe next 2 years, but it will streamline the system, it will make it \nmore efficient. Prices can come down for consumers and that will also \nhelp jump start our economy.\n  I thank the chairman and I wish to talk now about the McCain \namendment.\n  I am so pleased Senator McCain has come up with an alternative. It \nwill be a substitute for the bill before us. It strikes the balance. It \nis tax relief and increased Government investment in our economy so we \nwill be able to jump start our economy in a fiscally responsible way.\n  The bill before us is not the right approach. I could not possibly \nsupport the underlying bill. I do hope we can come together, though. \nHaving the debate and hearing what people are saying on the outside, I \nthink has made people realize, when we are talking about $1 trillion, \nwe are not talking about a vacuum. We are talking about $1 trillion on \nthis bill, we are talking about another $1 trillion of deficit this \nyear, not counting the bill we are discussing today. The U.S. debt is \n$10.6 trillion already.\n\n[[Page S1642]]\n\n  We are approaching a tipping point whereby creditors are going to be \nincreasingly unwilling to lend to our Government because they are going \nto be concerned about our ability to pay them back. Much of our debt, \n25 percent of our U.S. national debt, is held by foreigners. The \nChinese Government, in particular, owns over $500 billion.\n  We must consider having this much of our debt in foreign hands and \nwhether borrowers will continue to buy our debt. What happens to our \neconomy if they do not? What happens if they do? What would the \ninterest rate be if all of a sudden they decide it is going to be more \nrisky? Interest rates go up. What would inflation do to the economy we \nare in right now?\n  If we are going to do this, we must spend every dollar so carefully. \nWe must make sure every dollar we spend is stimulative. In fact, the \nbill before us, the underlying bill, one-third of it that is supposed \nto be stimulative is not going to be spent in the next 2 years. That \nmeans we would be spending money down the road to solve a problem that \nmay not even exist down the road, and we will be increasing the size of \ndebt without the stimulative effect.\n  I refer to Alice Rivlin, who was the Budget Director in President \nClinton's White House. She recommended we split the plan. She said \nimplement the immediate stimulus now. As she acknowledged, we talk \nabout the plans which may or may not have value at a later time. It \ndoesn't have to happen right now. The McCain alternative has a better \nway to stimulate the economy, put money into the economy immediately, \nand it is a balanced approach. The McCain proposal will lower the 10-\npercent bracket to 5 percent for 1 year; lower the 15-percent bracket \nto 10 percent for 1 year; eliminate the payroll tax for all employees \nfor 1 year. It would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent \nfor 1 year. Recognizing that we have the second highest corporate tax \nrate in the entire industrialized world, we want to encourage our \ncorporations to hire people in America today.\n  We need to look at tax cuts and the history we have had with tax \ncuts. Every time we have had big tax cuts in a depressed situation, \nthey have stimulated the economy. They have worked. President Kennedy, \nPresident Reagan, and President Bush.\n  Assisting Americans in need--the McCain alternative extends \nunemployment insurance benefits, extension of food stamps, extension of \nunemployment insurance benefits that are tax free until 12-31-2009; \ntraining services for dislocated workers. Certainly, we all will agree \nthat is important.\n  The McCain alternative goes to the heart of the problem, which is \nhousing. The underlying bill doesn't address what caused this in the \nfirst place and that is the problem in the housing market. The McCain \nalternative provides a loan modification program, tax incentives for \nhome purchases of up to $15,000, making the GSA-conforming loan limits \nextended at the higher levels to get more help for people who are \nstruggling to make loans. This is a very important component.\n  Last but not least, the spending part goes to infrastructure. It does \nnot have all the programs in it that the underlying bill does, that we \nwill be able to debate in the future. They may be good programs, but \nthey are not going to create jobs.\n  The McCain spending portion is on infrastructure and defense. I am \nthe ranking member on the military construction subcommittee of \nAppropriations. We have a 5-year plan for the Department of Defense. \nThey know what they are going to spend and what they are going to need. \nWe have just had a ramp-up of troop strength to 90,000 more in our \narmed services, the Army and the Marines. We have to accommodate them. \nWe have to build the housing, we have to build the training facilities. \nAll those things are in a 5-year plan that normally we would take 1 \nyear at a time to build out.\n  Why not take the 5-year plan and move it up to 2 years or 3 years? I \nhave an amendment that will do that. But the McCain alternative puts $9 \nbillion into those exact types of military construction projects. That \nis a very important component because it will be jobs in America, it \nwill be jobs that will benefit Americans, and of course it will be for \nthe training and care of our military who are out there on the \nfrontlines, protecting our freedom. What better kind of infrastructure \nbuilding would we want?\n  The McCain substitute has transportation infrastructure. We all know \nthere are shovel-ready transportation projects ready to go all over our \ncountry--bridges, roads, public transit--something I certainly support, \nairport infrastructure improvements. Senator Rockefeller and I are \ngoing to try to increase that in amendments later on. These are the \ncomponents of the McCain substitute I hope our colleagues will \nconsider.\n  The tax cuts have a history--if they are big enough and they can be \nfelt--of stimulating our economy through the worst of times. All \nthrough history, they have done this. I hope we can support the McCain \nsubstitute. Or I will look down the road, and I will say, if the McCain \nsubstitute is not accepted by the majority of our colleagues, let's let \nthat be the benchmark from which we will go. I do not think the \nmajority of America believes that what is in the underlying bill is \ngood for the short term nor is it good for the long term. I cannot even \nimagine putting so much debt into our system without the underlying \nstimulative effect that would bring in revenue to pay for that debt and \nthereby, perhaps, cause a much worse problem in our financial markets \nthan we see today.\n  I hope, during this debate we have had this week, we now will be able \nto see what the good parts of all the different plans are. I hope we \ncan adopt the McCain substitute. If we do not, I hope it will be one of \nthe components of a bill that will be written, that will have the \nsupport of many Republicans and many Democrats. It will be the best \nthing that could happen in our country if this bill passed on a true \nbipartisan basis. It does not give the confidence to our country, to \nhave a plan that is passed just by the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  Yes, Democrats won the election. No one argues with that. But 46 \npercent of the people of our country did vote for Republicans, so if we \nhave a balance here and America sees we are working together, I think \nthat would be a good thing for the overall spirit in our country that \nis searching for bipartisanship. If we can come to a bill that would \nhave tax cuts for every individual and businesses to be able to hire \npeople, if we can fix the housing market by encouraging people to buy, \nif we can give spending plans for our infrastructure to the States so \nthey would be able to hire people for bridges and roads and mass \ntransit, if we can put our money into the Department of Defense, I know \nwe could spend $75 billion in 3 years instead of 5 years, and I know \nthe jobs would be in America and they would be for Americans.\n\n  I think we have an opportunity. I hope we can come to some agreement \nthat we can all be proud would be the best for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Montana for a brief period of time to \ntalk about the disposition of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would say to my friend from Montana, we \nhave two additional speakers on this side. If others desire to speak on \nthe amendment, I ask them to come down or notify us right away.\n  Then I understand there are amendments--there is a tentative proposal \nto have votes at 3:30. So other Members should come down and talk about \ntheir amendments that are pending.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I deeply appreciate the demeanor and the \nmanner and the cooperation of the Senator from Arizona. He has an \namendment he believes in strongly. Many Senators have spoken on behalf \nof his amendment; many have spoken in opposition to his amendment.\n  But he has been very helpful in trying to work out a manner and a way \nand a time agreement where we can deal very expeditiously and fairly \nwith the Senator from Arizona. My intent is to get a vote on the McCain \namendment as soon as we possibly can. The Senator said there are a \ncouple more speakers on his side who wish to speak. I imagine there are \na couple on this side too.\n\n[[Page S1643]]\n\n  I cannot tell the Senator we will definitely have a vote as soon as \nthose four speakers speak. It is my intention to have that vote. I do \nnot know if I can arrange that at this point yet. But plan B would be a \nseries of amendments beginning a little later in the day--not much \nlater, approximately 3:30. And the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Arizona will be the first amendment. His amendment would come up \nfirst. Then votes on other amendments would come up later.\n  My first preference is to vote earlier. If we cannot do that, then \nthe whole package begins at 3:30 with the Senator first.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like for my colleagues to conclude the debate, \nsince we have been on it since 9:30 this morning. I understand the vote \nmay be set for this and other amendments at 3:30. But unless there is \nsomeone who wants to speak on this amendment, the Senator from \nMississippi and the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, are the only ones \nadditionally who want to speak on it.\n  I would encourage my colleagues who want to speak on other amendments \nto come to the floor because there will apparently very likely be a \nvote on at 3:30.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not see the Democratic Senator. She \nis not here to speak. I will go down the list. I think the Senator from \nMississippi should be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy.) Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I do want to speak on behalf of the McCain \namendment and, regrettably, against the underlying legislation. We all \nunderstand the reason we are having this debate. Without exception \nevery person in this Chamber is convinced we need to act to jumpstart \nour economy.\n  People across the country are facing hardship. More than 860,000 \nproperties were repossessed by lenders in 2008, more than double the \nfigure for 2007. American manufacturing is at a 28-year low. Mr. \nPresident, 1.9 million jobs were lost during the last 4 months of 2008. \nThe economy shrank at a 3.8-percent pace at the end of the last \ncalendar year, the worst showing in a quarter century. The unemployment \nrate now stands at 7.2 percent, 7.6 percent in my home State of \nMississippi, with many States even less fortunate than mine.\n  These figures are a sobering reminder of how much we have at stake. \nBut that is also why we need to ensure that we get this right. Part of \nthe reason I voted against the bailout last September was that I \nthought it was rushed.\n  The Senator from Arizona acknowledged it was done in a hurry. We were \ntold if we did not act in a matter of days, the world, as we knew it, \nmight come to an end. I think there are many Members of this body who \nnow wish we had taken more time to ensure that the TARP legislation was \ndone right.\n  Let's learn from that experience. The bill we are debating this week \nis an unprecedented bill. Its magnitude is a staggering $1.2 trillion \nover 10 years. As a matter of fact, when I came over here to wait my \nturn, I was handed a legislative notice. Actually the bill now has a \nnet impact on the deficit of $1.273 trillion, including $389 billion in \ndebt service. That means the interest on this bill is almost four-\ntenths of $1 trillion.\n  I want to take a moment to put into perspective that amount of money. \nMany of us in the Chamber have heard these examples over the last few \ndays, but they are worth repeating to the American people. I can assure \nmy colleagues that the American people are beginning more and more to \nlisten to this debate.\n  The entire Vietnam war had an inflation-adjusted cost of $698 \nbillion. This bill is 1.2 trillion. Our involvement in Iraq has cost \n$597 billion. This one piece of legislation is over $1.2 trillion. \nFDR's New Deal, which many have tried to compare to this plan, pales in \ncomparison, with an estimated 2009 inflation-adjusted cost of $500 \nbillion, less than half the amount of this one piece of legislation in \ncurrent dollars.\n  On top of this massive spending request, let's also remember we are \nbeing told, should this legislation pass, the President will then send \nto the Hill another $500 billion package to prop up the financial \nsector.\n  For those of us keeping score, that would be close to $2 trillion in \nspending when we factor in the cost of the interest. All of that is in \naddition to the $700 billion bailout bill passed last fall. It is hard \nto get a firm grasp of the magnitude of this spending.\n  I will say what other colleagues have said: If you began spending $1 \nmillion per day on the day Jesus was born, and you spent $1 million per \nday every day since that time until today, you would still not have \nspent anywhere near $1 trillion or, to put it another way, if you have \n$1 trillion in one-hundred-dollar bills, if you connected all of those \none-hundred-dollar bills end to end, they would encircle the earth 40 \ntimes to get to $1 trillion.\n  Back in my home State of Mississippi, it has been reported that this \npackage could mean $1 to $2 billion in projects for our State. What \nthat means, though, when compared to the magnitude of the bill, is that \nas little as one-tenth of 1 percent of this spending would make it back \nto my State in projects.\n  One-tenth of 1 percent return is not a good investment for \nMississippi taxpayers, and it is not a good investment for American \ntaxpayers, essentially when, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, \nthis money will have to be borrowed from China or other foreign \ngovernments, if we can persuade them to continue lending us the money.\n  It will need to be paid back by future generations. The Congressional \nBudget Office reported this week that the per-job cost of this plan, \neven if the jobs created are what we are being promised, the per-job \ncost of this plan is from $100,000 per job to $300,000 per job.\n  Now, when you take into consideration the fact that the average \nMississippian earns $31,000 per year, it is hard for me to stand here \nand tell hard-working people back in my State that the most efficient \nuse of their tax dollars is to spend up to $300,000 to create one \nadditional job for Americans.\n  But that is what our own budget office tells us this bill will do. \nThat is not the best use of American taxpayer dollars. We need to get \nthis right. The American people deserve a maturely considered plan. As \nThomas Jefferson reminded Americans in his day: Delay is preferable \nto error. Let's not rush into doing this the wrong way because \ngenerations of Americans, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, \nwill pay for our mistake.\n\n  It has been pointed out on this floor today, and it is worth \nmentioning again, that we Republicans are not alone in expressing \ngrave, profound concerns about the enormity of this spending plan and \nthe effect that it will have on the United States.\n  President Clinton's former Budget Director, Alice Rivlin, agrees. She \nrecently testified we should not rush to spend the amount of money this \nbill will spend on projects with slow spend-out rates.\n  She said:\n\n       Such a long-term investment program should not be put \n     together hastily and lumped in with the anti-recession \n     package.\n\n  And hastily put together is what this program is.\n  Alice Rivlin, President Clinton's Budget Director, went on to say:\n\n       The risk is that the money will be wasted because the \n     investment elements were not carefully crafted.\n\n  These are the words of the Budget Director under President Bill \nClinton.\n  Now, $1 trillion is a terrible thing to waste; $1.273 trillion is a \nterrible thing to waste. Members of the news media understand this too. \nThe Washington Post's David Broder, who has covered Congress for more \nthan 40 years, a respected journalist, wrote on Sunday regarding this \nplan:\n\n       So much is uncertain, and so much is riding on it that it \n     is worth taking time to get it right.\n\n  Yet we are told we need to vote this evening. We need to try to vote \ntoday or tomorrow on this, the largest spending bill ever in the \nhistory of the United States. In order to get it right, this package \nneeds to be laser focused on getting workers back to work, getting our \nhousing market out of the gutter, and doing so in a way that does not \nwaste taxpayer dollars.\n  The Democratic leadership in this Congress said only recently that \nthis package should be targeted, temporary, and timely. I could not \nagree more. Unfortunately, as this package stands today, it could more \naccurately be described as slow, unfocused, and\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\nunending. Americans have real concerns over some of the spending \ncontained in this package: $20 million for the removal of fish \nbarriers; $70 million to support supercomputing activities for climate \nresearch; tens of millions to spruce up Government buildings in \nWashington, DC; $25 million to rehabilitate off-road ATV trails; $600 \nmillion for new Government vehicles; $150 million for honey bee \ninsurance. The list goes on and on.\n  My friend from New York said, a few speakers back: If you want to \ntake this pork out, take it out. We can take it out with his vote and \nwith the votes of his colleagues, but we cannot do it alone. If he says \ntake it out, and he will join us in doing that, then we are getting \nsomewhere.\n  These projects may have merit, but what do they have to do with \ncreating jobs immediately? There is a process for considering those \ntypes of projects, and this emergency stimulus package is not that \nvehicle.\n  I was pleased to hear the President speak recently acknowledging the \ngood ideas Republicans have and saying he wants to make sure Republican \nideas are incorporated in this package. So what are those ideas and why \ndo I support the McCain substitute?\n  First, we need to trim the unnecessary spending that doesn't \nimmediately put people back to work. Second, this package needs to get \nright to the housing problem because housing is what caused the \nsituation we are currently in. Then let's focus more on targeted tax \nbreaks for the working class and for the job creators, the small \nbusinesses. The President initially said 40 percent of this package \nshould be made up of tax cuts. Regrettably, we are no longer close to \nthat goal.\n  Senator McCain has proposed an alternative plan that does all of \nthese. His substitute plan costs half as much, thankfully, and offers \nfocused spending and effective tax cuts. It eliminates the 3.1-percent \npayroll tax for all American employees for 1 year. It lowers the two \nlowest marginal tax rates for 1 year.\n  We also need to accelerate depreciation for capital investments made \nby small businesses for 1 year. We need to improve tax incentives for \nhome purchases. We need to improve early investment in national defense \nand military infrastructure priorities, jump-starting the economy while \nmaking Americans safe, and mandatory deficit reduction after two \nconsecutive quarters of economic growth greater than 2 percent.\n  If the stimulus package works and the economy begins to grow for 6 \nmonths in a row, then we need to rein in this unbelievably large \nspending bill, declare victory, and then start working on a plan to pay \nfor it. We also need to establish an entitlement commission to review \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  I was delighted yesterday when the Isakson amendment was agreed to, \ndoubling the current first-time home buyer tax credit to $15,000 and \nexpanding it to cover all properties and home buyers. It is a small \nstart--it is nowhere near the place we need to be--but I congratulate \nthe Senate for taking that step.\n  This is an important debate, perhaps the most important debate we \nwill have this year. The President was right when he said that \nRepublicans have good ideas. I hope, as the President said, we can \nincorporate those ideas into this legislation. I hope we can make this \npackage much smaller and much more targeted to jobs and housing. That \nis what more American people are beginning to say as they are becoming \nfamiliar with the details of this plan.\n  If we pass anything close to the current proposal and go to \nconference with the House, does anyone really believe the final product \nwill be less expensive? If we pass the McCain proposal and cut in half \nthe price tag of this bill and go to conference with the House, it is \nmy hope and prayer that conference committee can report a package we \ncan support in an overwhelmingly bipartisan manner, that can bring \nabout confidence in the American people and make us all proud.\n  It is time to redirect this package. We need to make it targeted, \ntimely, and temporary. We need to do it today. We have an opportunity \nto strengthen this legislation so that it doesn't waste taxpayer money, \nso that it actually puts people back to work quickly and puts families \nback into homes and Americans back to work. The American people deserve \nto have us do this right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before talking about a very important \namendment introduced by Senators Cantwell and Hatch--and I commend them \nfor their leadership on this very important amendment about jobs in the \nfuture--I believe we are at a critical point. We have seen job loss \nwithin the last 8 years like we have never seen before. In fact, in the \nlast year, we lost 2.589 million jobs. It is accelerating every month--\n500,000 last month, 500,000 the month before. We are seeing new numbers \nthat show acceleration of job loss. Unfortunately, that has come as a \nresult of action and inaction in the last 8 years.\n  We are at a pivotal point. Do we use the same policies of the last 8 \nyears or similar ones or do we do something new? Do we focus on a \ndifferent strategy of investment, focusing on the demand side of supply \nand demand, creating jobs, putting money in people's pockets to pay the \nbills, and grow the middle class of this country? That is what this \npackage is about. It is a change.\n  I understand there is a disagreement and an honest debate of \nphilosophies that occurs in the Senate. I totally understand that \ncolleagues who have been promoting an approach for 8 years with \nPresident Bush would come forward with the same kinds of proposals on \ntax cuts and other approaches, most of those around tax cuts that are \nvery supply-side oriented. I understand that is their philosophy, that \nis their approach. They believe that is what should happen. With all \ndue respect, that has not worked. We are talking about over 2.5 million \njobs lost last year. Critically important to me in Michigan, we have \nlost over 4.1 million manufacturing jobs in the last 8 years. We have \nhad no manufacturing strategy, no focus on good-paying middle-class \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  In this package, we are going to change that. One of the important \nways--and there are multiple items in the bill I will mention--relates \nto an amendment that will be coming before the body, hopefully today. \nIt was offered by Senators Cantwell and Hatch, and it speaks to the \nfuture. I am proud to be a cosponsor. It focuses on manufacturing the \nvehicles, the plug-in electric vehicles that we know we need to get us \noff our dependence on foreign oil, to address global warming, and to \ncreate jobs.\n  We have done a great job on R We are investing in this package as \nit relates to battery development and research and development. We are \ndoing a better job all the time on demonstration projects. We have \npassed tax incentives for consumers. The question is, Where will the \nvehicles be made? Where will the battery technology be made? That is \nthe piece that has not been happening.\n  I am proud that the first hybrid SUV was made by an American company, \nFord Motor Company. They made the Ford Escape hybrid. But they had to \nbuy the battery from Japan. Now we see batteries coming from Korea. We \nwant the jobs making those batteries in America. That is what this \namendment is about.\n  A123, which is a leading battery company, asserts that an investment \nof $4.6 billion over the next 5 years in batteries and electric \nvehicles will create 29,000 direct jobs and 14 million square feet of \nnew U.S. plant capacity. Of the newly created jobs, it is estimated \nthat about 80 percent would be in the advanced battery industry or in \nthe supply chain.\n  I am extremely supportive and pleased to be involved in this \nparticular amendment. I also appreciate the fact that it does something \nincredibly important. In this horrible economy we find ourselves, where \ncapital is not available for startups or for mature manufacturing \ncompanies that are turning to a green economy, this makes sure that \ncompanies in a loss position, that we need to grow the economy and \ncreate jobs, will also participate in creating the new electric \nvehicles. This is the future. Shame on us if we do not make these \ninvestments\n\n[[Page S1645]]\n\nnow and we go from dependence on foreign oil to dependence on foreign \ntechnology, which is, frankly, where we have been headed in the last 8 \nyears. This recovery package changes that. The Cantwell-Hatch-Stabenow \namendment is a very important addition to it.\n  More broadly, let me say that we know we need a change, and we need \naction now from the policies that have put us where we are. We have \nover 11 million people who want to work and who are out of work. Right \nnow, we have more people out of work than there are jobs available. We \nare in a situation where we have to focus on creating jobs. That is \nwhat this recovery package does.\n  What we are talking about is making sure we are rebuilding the middle \nclass. That is not a slogan; that is a reality. We have been losing the \nmiddle class because we have been losing good-paying jobs. Too many \nfamilies find themselves in the middle of this economic tsunami, and \nthey are asking us to focus on jobs and those things that will allow \nthem to pick themselves up, to work, pay the mortgage, put food on the \ntable, send the kids to college, and have the American dream we all \nwant for ourselves and our children. That is what this is about.\n  This package is about jobs rebuilding America, jobs that leave \nsomething behind for the taxpayer--a safer bridge, better roads, better \nwater and sewer systems, the ability for small businesses to connect \nwith high-speed Internet so they can sell their products around the \nworld, the ability for hospitals to cut the cost of health care by new \ntechnology and to move ahead for the future. Jobs rebuilding America \nare essential to this package.\n  Secondly, it is jobs and a new green economy. We know that one of the \nnext things we will have to tackle is what we do about the incredibly \nserious threat of global warming. There is a way to do that that \ncreates good-paying jobs in America by focusing on the new green \neconomy. That is the new green revolution.\n  It was 101 years ago when the Model T Ford rolled off the line. At \nthat time, we created a revolution, people being able to move, to be \nmore mobile with vehicles. We started a revolution that created the \nmiddle class. This is now a time for that next revolution.\n  When Henry Ford created the Model T, he also started another \nrevolution, which was paying his workers enough so they could buy the \nvehicle. He knew that good-paying jobs were part of the equation. You \ncould build automobiles, but if nobody could buy them, it wouldn't \nmatter. He understood the demand side of supply and demand. He doubled \nwages to $5 a day so his workers could buy the vehicles.\n  This package focuses on workers having money in their pockets so they \ncan buy things to get this economy going again.\n  In the green economy, it is exciting to see what we have been able to \ndo. Last year on the floor we passed in our budget resolution a green-\ncollar jobs initiative which I was proud to author. Other than the \nretooling loans, we were not able to fund the rest of it. This package \nfunds the green-collar jobs initiative with $2 billion for grants for \nadvanced batteries. It focuses on green-collar job training.\n  It focuses on weatherization and energy efficiency for buildings, \nwhich we know create 40 percent of energy usage.\n  It focuses on creating a smart grid to improve the security and \nreliability of the electricity grid. If everybody in the United States \nhad an electric vehicle made in America and they plugged it in, we \nwould totally destroy the electric grid. We don't have the capacity. In \nthis bill, we look to the future and say: We want the vehicles. We want \nthe fuel efficiency. We want to stop those carbon emissions. And we \nbetter make sure we have a grid that allows that to work. So that is in \nhere as well. So it is about right now, and it is about where we want \nto go in terms of jobs in so many different areas.\n\n  We are talking about loan guarantees and grant programs and tax \nincentives that combine to create a picture of a future that is based \non a green economy and is based on good-paying jobs in America.\n  I wish to make sure the 8,000 component parts that go into a wind \nturbine--somebody told me it was 1,200 parts, and then somebody said, \nno, it is 8,000 actually--8,000 different parts in one wind turbine. I \nwish to make sure those are manufactured in this country, not just that \nwe use the wind energy, which is important, but 70 percent of the \neconomic activity in using wind energy comes from manufacturing the \nparts. We do that pretty well in Michigan, as well as, I know, around \nthe country. But we are pretty proud of our skilled workforce which \nknows how to make things, manufacture things, develop things, engineer \nthings. The green economy and the incentives in this recovery bill \nfocus on creating those kinds of jobs, and it is very exciting to see \nwhere we can go.\n  We also know there are people who right now we need to be focusing on \nto make sure we have support for our States and communities so they can \nkeep police officers on the beat, schoolteachers in the classroom, and \nkeep jobs--very important jobs--in public service we all benefit from \nevery day. That is in this package.\n  There are a tremendous number of people who are hurt, and certainly I \nspeak for people in our great State who work hard every day and have \nbeen caught in the middle of this economic crisis. We have not seen \nmuch in the last 8 years to recognize the hurt families are going \nthrough and to help them through what we hope will be a temporary \nsituation.\n  Unemployment compensation benefits are increasing as well. Help for \nfamilies to be able to keep their health insurance is in this bill. Job \ntraining and help for people who have lost their jobs because of unfair \ntrade practices is in this bill. Help to put food on the table for \nfamilies is in this bill.\n  This is a very important economic recovery package that focuses \nultimately on making sure we are creating jobs in America. That is what \nthis is about. It is all kinds of jobs, that is for sure. There is not \none silver bullet. It is all kinds of jobs. But it is about creating \njobs, creating opportunities, looking to the future, disregarding the \npolicies that have not worked, saying: Do you know what. We are not \ngoing to do that anymore. The same things that have been proposed that \nrelate to what has happened in the last 8 years, we are not going to do \nthat anymore. We cannot afford to do that.\n  We are in a crisis. We need to act boldly, smartly, and now. This \nbill does that. This is about creating jobs in America. I hope we will \njoin together in a strong bipartisan vote to get it done.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 364\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  I rise in support of the substitute offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona. As usual, John McCain does not mince any words. \nHe says what he believes, and in this particular case, what he is \ntrying to do is make this bill better and also to make it bipartisan so \nit would have an overwhelming vote, including mine. But I cannot help \nbut express concern about the misguided direction we are headed toward \nin stimulating our economy if we go with the bill the majority has come \nup with, even as amended.\n  Our new President recently told the Washington Post:\n\n       The tone I set is that we bring as much intellectual \n     firepower to a problem, that people act respectfully towards \n     each other, that disagreements are fully aired, and that we \n     make decisions based on facts and evidence as opposed to \n     ideology, that people will adapt to that culture and we'll be \n     able to move together effectively as a team.\n\n  Now, I make decisions based on ``facts and evidence as opposed to \nideology.'' That is what our President said.\n  To me, that means we must do what is necessary and what will be \neffective, and I could not agree more with President Obama's statement. \nUnfortunately, in this bill, my friends on the other side of the aisle \nhave not followed the President's leadership and at a time when such \nleadership is critical.\n  There is no doubt we are in a serious recession. There is widespread \nagreement that quick action is necessary to stop our economy's downward \nspiral. The facts are conclusive and Democrats and Republicans all \nagree economic conditions are severe. Both commonly accepted \ndefinitions of ``recession'' have clearly been met, and we\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\nhave seen a constant decline for all economic indicators.\n  Our current economic condition: GDP has declined at 3.8 percent, \nunemployment at 7.2 percent. Manufacturing is at a 28-year low. We had \nthe worst January in over a quarter of a century. These are very \nimportant indicators. I could go on, but we are here today to look \ntoward the future, to look toward recovery and reinvestment.\n  Moreover, I am not here to cast blame as to how we got here. Both \nsides are guilty of making poor decisions on shaping our economy. But \ntoday is critical. We need, as the President has stated, to put aside \nour ideological differences, focus on our economic condition, and make \ndecisions based on what the facts and the evidence indicate will be \neffective.\n  We cannot afford to waste more American taxpayer dollars. We cannot \nafford to advance political dogma at the expense of doing what is \nright. We cannot afford to make a trillion-dollar mistake.\n  If we are going to spend billions to stimulate the economy, we had \nbetter get it right. The central question is whether this enormous \nspending-and-tax bill would be effective, or will be effective, in \nturning around the economy, preventing further layoffs, and creating \nnew jobs. If it will do what is needed, it is worth the money, and we \nmust pass it immediately.\n  While both sides of the aisle agree about what we want to achieve, we \ndisagree about the means and how to achieve them. Despite popular \nDemocratic belief, Republicans are not trying to block the stimulus \npackage. We are trying to improve it, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona has some great ideas and has improved it considerably. \nWhile Senate Republicans have tried to offer our ideas to the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act, we have largely been excluded from \nhelping formulate this bill.\n  The February 2 Los Angeles Times editorial, titled ``The Nation Needs \nJobs, Not a Political Agenda,'' correctly points out this stimulus \npackage--the largest stimulus since World War II--could and should have \nbeen crafted to garner extensive Republican support.\n  Instead, the stimulus is a hodgepodge of liberal-targeted spending \nprojects with a few decent ideas thrown in to try to appease \nRepublicans. The majority of the bill is aimed at promoting mostly \npublic-sector jobs for short-term projects, such as building roads and \ninfrastructure.\n  A large fraction of the proposed stimulus package is devoted to \ninfrastructure projects that would spend out very slowly, not with the \nspeed needed to put the economy on the path to recovery in 2009 and \n2010. While some of these public jobs are necessary, we also must \nprovide incentives for private sector jobs. Furthermore, the stimulus \nneeds to take effect immediately and not continue to provide a stimulus \nonce the economy has turned around.\n  While President Obama has said he believes Government spending \nprovides the most ``bang for the buck'' and that there is ``near \nunanimity'' among economists that Government spending will help restore \njobs in the short term, I must respectfully disagree. I believe, as do \nmany economists, that our problems cut much deeper than what temporary \nGovernment spending will be able to cure.\n\n  Harvard economics professor Martin Feldstein, president emeritus of \nthe National Bureau of Economic Research, wrote in a recent Washington \nPost article:\n\n       The fiscal package now before Congress needs to be \n     thoroughly revised. In its current form, it does too little \n     to raise national spending and employment.\n\n  Gregory Mankiw, another Harvard economics professor and the former \nchairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, notes in a \nNew York Times op-ed that each dollar of Government spending increases \nthe gross domestic product by only $1.40, while a dollar of tax cuts--\nor tax relief, I would prefer to say--raises the gross domestic product \nby about $3.\n  This is based on a study conducted by Christina and David Romer, then \neconomists at the University of California, Berkeley. Christina Romer \nwill now serve as the chair of President Obama's Council of Economic \nAdvisers. President Obama, there is not ``near unanimity'' among \neconomists that Government spending delivers the most ``bang for the \nbuck''--indeed, not even among your own top economic advisers.\n  Democrats have stressed they believe we need solutions that are \ntemporary, targeted, and timely. Beyond spending for expanding \nGovernment projects, there is serious wasteful spending in this bill. \nThe current bill provides up to $500 for individuals and up to $1,000 \nfor families in the so-called Make Work Pay tax credit, which would \nencourage work at the margin only for people who produce and earn less \nthan $8,100 per year.\n  Studies show that in the past, these rebate checks do not stimulate \nthe economy. For instance, studies of the 1975 rebate--and earlier tax \nchanges--suggested that only 12 percent to 24 percent of the rebate was \nconsumed in the quarter it was received. Moreover, it is estimated that \nonly 15 percent of last year's rebate checks was put back into the \neconomy. Based on these estimates, of the $142 billion that would be \nallocated through the ``Making Work Pay'' tax credit--through that tax \ncredit--the average of only $24 billion would find its way back into \nour economy. That is after an expenditure of $142 billion.\n  Now, this is what it says: The Democrats' Stimulus Plan. Make Work \nPay tax credit. Make Work Pay--the cost is $145 billion. Only $24 \nbillion will be put back into the economy. These are important \nestimates.\n  Well, is this the most effective way to spend taxpayer money? The \nMake Work Pay credit is a refundable credit. Anyone who works would be \neligible to receive up to $500, even if that person never paid income \ntaxes. There are other refundable credits in this bill as well, \nincluding a provision increasing the refundable portion of the child \ntax credit.\n  But the bill also creates a new category of tax credit bonds called \n``Build America Bonds,'' in which a State or a local government could \nelect to receive a direct payment from the Federal Government equal to \nthe subsidy that would otherwise have been delivered through the tax \ncredit. Whom are we kidding? This is nothing more than an innovative \nway of delivering more spending through the Tax Code. The majority \nwants to claim these are tax cuts, but these are not tax cuts. This is \nspending. I ask my colleagues: What is wrong with using the \nappropriations process for spending? Some of these projects may fit the \nappropriations process well, but they do not fit in a stimulus bill \nsuch as this and especially one where the American taxpayers are called \nupon to spend so much.\n  Beyond these so-called ``tax cuts,'' we see even more spending for \nState and local governments. Until recently, my friends on the other \nside of the aisle have promoted their ideology to the extent that House \nSpeaker Pelosi suggested that contraception will stimulate the economy \nbecause it is a cost-saving measure for the State and Federal \ngovernments. Even though this measure has been taken out, the bill \nincludes plenty of other Government-expanding and ideology-promoting \nprojects. State aid will only fund temporary projects that would need \nto be funded later down the road. Conversely, spending in the private \nsector would create permanent jobs that would give people more to spend \nand would lead to even more permanent job creation.\n  Look, it is not just Republicans sounding the alarm over this bill. \nEven the very liberal San Francisco Chronicle has characterized the \nbill as a wasteful grab bag of spending. For example, this bill could \nmake available billions of taxpayer dollars to leftwing groups, such as \nthe Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, commonly \nknown as ACORN. The plan further establishes 32 Government programs at \na cost of well over $136 billion.\n  There is a difference between permanent tax cuts and short-term \nstimulative spending. If we base this bill on measures we know will \nwork, it should include a proper balance of both permanent tax cuts and \nshort-term spending. Instead, this bill is tilted toward government \nspending either through appropriations or tax expenditures. Less than 3 \npercent of this bill contains business tax relief. How do we expect to \ncreate jobs in the private sector when you spend that little on the \npeople who can create the jobs?\n\n[[Page S1647]]\n\n  I wish to turn my attention to the health care provisions contained \nin this package. As I have said before, health care reform is not a \nRepublican or Democratic issue; it is an American issue. When we are \ndealing with 17 percent of our economy--and that is what the health \ncare economy is--it is imperative that we address solutions in an open \nand honest, bipartisan process. Although the congressional Democrats \nand the administration have given a great deal of lip service to \nbringing change and bipartisanship to Washington, let us all remember \nthat actions speak louder than words.\n  I am mostly disappointed the Democrats have decided to use the \nstimulus legislation to address health care reform in a partisan and \npiecemeal fashion. Health information technology is a perfect example. \nIt is an area of consensus that should have been part of the \ncomprehensive and bipartisan health care reform dialog.\n  Last Congress, Senator Mike Enzi and I worked very closely with \nSenators Ted Kennedy and Hillary Clinton on the Wired For Health Care \nTechnology Act which resulted in a bipartisan bill that was unanimously \napproved and reported by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions, or HELP, Committee. While the stimulus package before the \nSenate contains provisions on health information technology--that is \nhealth IT--it does not resemble that bipartisan bill we introduced and \npassed unanimously out of the committee last Congress. The most \nimportant difference is that these provisions do not represent a \nbipartisan agreement because Members on both sides of the aisle were \nnot involved in the discussions.\n  Secondly, the stimulus bill undermines the work of former Health and \nHuman Services Secretary Mike Leavitt and the Bush administration by \nfederalizing the National eHealth Collaborative. While I believe the \nFederal Government should play a role in this area, it should not take \nover such an initiative. The intent of our legislation, and the intent \nof Secretary Leavitt, was to encourage a partnership between the \nprivate sector and the Federal Government to improve the quality and \nefficiency of health care. The stimulus legislation dissolves this \npublic-private partnership.\n  Finally, the stimulus bill provides $1.1 billion for clinical \ncomparative effectiveness, including a $400 million slush fund to be \nused by the Secretary at his discretion. Once again, this is a topic of \nbipartisan interest and concern that should have been discussed in the \ncontext of comprehensive reform.\n  We have not even discussed the overall cost of this bill. When \ninterest is included, the almost $900 billion Senate version reaches \nclose to $1.3 trillion. That is enough to give every man, woman, and \nchild in America $4,000, or every person in my home State of Utah \n$480,000. Indeed, $1.2 trillion is more than the cost of the New Deal \nand the Iraq war combined in today's dollars. The interest alone would \nbe costlier than the Louisiana Purchase or going to the Moon adjusted \nfor inflation--in fact, four times the cost adjusted for inflation and \ntime--than the Louisiana Purchase.\n  The bill is estimated to cost $1.3 trillion with interest. The \ncongressional budget authority has estimated that the stimulus bill \nwill produce between 600,000 and 1.9 million new jobs by 2011. That \nmeans it would cost anywhere from $700,000 to $2.1 million to create \none job. That is absurd.\n  To make this bill economically stimulative, we must make decisions \nthat will be effective. Our economy began this downturn when our \nhousing market collapsed. No stimulus will work unless we address the \nroot of the problem. Some of my Republican colleagues are proposing to \nadd the Fix Housing First Act which would refinance and lower fixed \nrate, 30-year mortgages for primary residences and provide a $15,000 \ntax credit for all homebuyers. I support this idea because it would \nencourage people to buy houses and would help homebuilders, and it \nwould put a lot of people to work. In addition, we have offered a \nproposal to permanently lower the corporate income tax rate which again \nwould give the corporations in this country the ability to hire a lot \nmore people, expand their businesses, and do what should be done. We \nneed to enact tax relief that will help save and create jobs now.\n  I believe one way to truly stimulate the economy is by making the \nresearch tax credit permanent. If we lifted the quota on H2B people--\nthese are generally highly educated people, educated in our country, \nwho are forced out of our country to go home and compete with us, where \notherwise they would stay here and help us be more competitive than we \nare. For too long, companies have been waiting on a short-term basis to \nsee whether this vital tax credit will be extended for yet another year \nor two. When 80 percent of the research credit is based on salaries and \nwages, I doubt that anyone in this Chamber could honestly say that \nmaking the research tax credit permanent would not provide a great deal \nof bang for the buck.\n  We should also look at middle-class tax relief by lowering the 15-\npercent bracket to 10 percent and the 10-percent bracket to 5 percent, \nincreasing the capital loss deduction and lowering the capital gains \nrate to encourage investment which would lead to job creation. I think \nI have the right to say these things because I was one of the original \nsupply siders in the Reagan administration. Not only did we have the \narguments that if we reduced taxes, we will have less revenues, not \nonly did that turn around, but we had many more revenues that were \nplanned or contemplated because we did reduce those taxes.\n  The fact that 11 Democrats and every Republican voted against this \nbill in the House is evidence that bipartisanship did not prevail. The \nreason it did not prevail is that there was too much spending in the \nlegislation and not enough incentives to spur job growth and economic \ndevelopment. For this stimulus package to be effective, it should \nincorporate ideas from both sides of the aisle. We should be focusing \non incentives that are permanent and broad, not temporary and targeted. \nWe owe this not only to taxpayers today, but also to future generations \nof taxpayers who will be saddled with this trillion dollar spending \nbill--$1.3 trillion. In short, we owe it to every American to craft a \nbipartisan stimulus package that will rouse the economy instead of \ncoming up with a partisan bill that produces little and provokes \nAmerican anger.\n  Again, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, I wish to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona for the work he has done in trying \nto come up with a reasonable compromise on this approach that will \ncreate many more jobs at much less cost, and for his willingness to \nstand on this floor and the guts he has to be able to take on all of us \nas colleagues in the Senate to try and do what is right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak as well on the bill we are \ndebating from a couple of different vantage points. One is on the bill \nitself and what is confronting the American people and our economy. \nSecondly is an amendment I will speak of briefly.\n  I think in a broad sense we are at a point now where we are getting \nclose to the point at which we will vote on the bill itself--the \nrecovery bill--the Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We have heard a lot \nof debate and discussion about parts of this bill that people don't \nlike--and there is no reason why we shouldn't debate those points of \ncontention--but I think we should also step back and look at what is \ngoing to work from this bill and why this bill is so essential to our \neconomy.\n  The bad news is that this bill is not being debated and these \namendments are not being voted on in a vacuum. The reason why we are \ndebating this bill is because we have about the worst economy that we \nhave seen since the 1930s, at least the worst economy in more than a \ngeneration. That is without question. I know the Presiding Officer as \nwell as others know how bad this is in our own States. I know from the \npeople in Pennsylvania whom I talk to and the stories and accounts that \nI read about our economy, it is graphic. I won't go through all of it, \nobviously, but if you look at it from the unemployment rate, it is more \nthan 7 percent nationally. Some projections are that if we don't take \nstrong decisive action very soon, that number could go up to 10 \npercent--numbers we never would have imagined even 6 months ago. In \nPennsylvania, our unemployment rate is a little less than\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\nthat. As of December--the State numbers tend to lag by a month or so--\nwe were about 6.7 percent, but a month earlier it was 6.2. In our State \nin November we lost more than 27,000 jobs. In December we lost another \n27,000 jobs. We saw the numbers today on claims for unemployment, help \nfor unemployment claims. The number is going way up: well over 650,000 \npeople in this week's tally.\n\n  We can also look at it from the vantage point of a budget. \nPennsylvania has a budget where they have to balance it every year, as \nvirtually every other State. Governor Rendell has worked very hard over \nthe 5 years he has been in office to target investments in priorities \nsuch as education and health care and job creation and creating new \nsources of energy, but at the same time he has done that, he has also \nmade sure that he has tried to hold the line on spending. Despite all \nof that effort, revenues are collapsing. In a State such as ours we are \nfacing almost a $2.5 billion shortfall. The rainy day fund, which has \nbeen built up to three-quarters of a billion dollars, has been \ndecimated or will be in the next year.\n  So we need action, and we need it very soon. We should vote on this \nbill this week, I believe. We can't wait any longer. We shouldn't wait \nanother month or two to continue to debate strategies that we know will \nwork, even with a bill that is imperfect.\n  But what are we talking about in this bill? We are talking about \nhelping people get through this recession with unemployment insurance, \nwhich also has a jump-starting effect on spending and job creation. We \nare talking about health care for people who have lost their jobs so \nthey can take care of their families. We are talking about assistance \nto States so that States don't have to jack up State taxes and so that \nlocal school districts and local communities don't have to increase \ntheir taxes exponentially because we won't help them.\n  Some people want us to do nothing, and doing nothing right now I know \nmeans one thing: It means much higher local and State taxes over the \nnext couple of months. We can't allow that to happen. People are paying \ntoo much already across the country. It has tax cuts that are prudent \nand targeted. It has investments in health care IT which will pay \ndividends short term with jobs and long term with better health care \noutcomes and better quality. It invests in science and technology. It \ninvests in clean drinking water and better ports and rails, better \nenergy strategies, housing, school modernization--the whole range of \nstrategies that we know will create jobs in the short run, but will \nalso have a strong impact on our economy.\n  So we should move forward and we should make sure we do the right \nthing now, and the right thing is to act and to pass a piece of \nlegislation which may be imperfect, but we should emphasize what is \nworking.\n  One note about two amendments, and then I will conclude. Senators \nSpecter, Leahy, Dodd, Schumer, Kerry, and I have an amendment which is \na smart idea for housing. We know that with the leadership of Chairman \nDodd, the chairman of the Banking Committee, last year we passed very \ngood legislation to deal with our housing and economic recovery, the \nso-called HERA Act, which helped to allocate dollars--$4 billion--last \nsummer in emergency assistance to State and local governments to use \nfor the rehabilitation of abandoned and foreclosed properties across \nthe country. What we are asking for in this amendment--the amendment to \nthe recovery bill--is to say that an additional $2.25 billion which is \nalready in the bill for the neighborhood stabilization program will \nallow some flexibility in how those dollars are spent so that under our \namendment, it permits up to 10 percent of the funds to be used for \nforeclosure prevention, which we are not doing enough on right now. It \nalso allows States that are receiving the minimum allocation under the \nstabilization program to use their funds to address Statewide concerns. \nFinally, it sets aside $30 million for legal assistance for low and \nmoderate income homeowners and tenants related to home ownership, \npreservation, home foreclosure prevention, as well as tenancy \nassociated with home foreclosures. So it is a prudent amendment to this \nimportant legislation.\n  But when we step back from the bill overall--and I have amendments as \nwell on stronger oversight--there are lots of ways we can improve it \ntoday and tomorrow, as we did over the last couple of days. But in the \nend, we need to vote, we need to pass this bill and make it as strong \nas we can. The worst thing we could do in a terrible economy right now \nis to say, Well, it is not a perfect bill, and we are going to hope \nthat things work out. If we don't pass a bill, State and local taxes \nare going to go through the roof, our economy will fall further into \nthe ditch. We have to get this economy out of the ditch, create jobs, \nand begin to grow our economy once again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, through the Chair, I ask the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee if I would be allowed to ask unanimous consent, \nnot for a time agreement, but for an agreement on the order of speakers \non our side, going back and forth with the majority, so that they would \nhave an idea of the order.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If Senators wish to speak, they can come to me and we \nwill set up an order. The Senator from Nevada is next, then Senator \nKohl, then Senator Chambliss, then Senator Dodd. We are down that far \nalready. Hopefully, we can get an agreement to start voting very \nquickly.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, without a doubt, the collapse of the \nhousing market is at the root of the economic crisis we are facing in \nour country. Every single American is being affected by this.\n  A few short years ago in Nevada, housing prices were through the \nroof. If you were in the market for a home, you had to act quickly and \nyou had to plan on being in a bidding war. For a while, it seemed there \nwere more realtors and mortgage brokers than blackjack dealers in Las \nVegas.\n  The housing storm blew through many communities in our country at \nhigh force, and the aftermath has been brutal. If you do not live in an \narea with a lot of foreclosures, let me describe the situation. You \ndrive home from work to find one home--or maybe several homes--in your \nneighborhood with a dead lawn. That is the first sign. Then the ``For \nSale, Bank Owned'' sign pops up on the lawn. But the most painful part \nis when you find out how much the foreclosed home down the street from \nyours is going for. It is part of the reason consumer confidence is at \nsuch an all-time low. When you find out that the biggest investment you \npersonally have, the property that gives you leverage in this economy, \nis worth less than what you bought it for, it creates a sense of panic.\n  Much worse off are the people who have lost jobs, have been unable to \npay their mortgages, and soon found themselves losing their homes. \nNevada leads the Nation in foreclosure rates, so these stories are \nreality for too many of my constituents and too many other families \nacross the United States.\n  If we don't figure out a way to get this housing market back on \ntrack, nothing we do in the name of economic stimulus will matter. It \nhas to be our number one priority. If we can fix the problem--and the \nproblem is housing--then we have a chance to fix our economy.\n  To do that, we absolutely must increase home sales and decrease \nforeclosures. It sounds like an impossible task in light of the current \neconomic climate, but if we do not succeed, our economy will continue \nto crumble under the weight of the failed housing market. We really do \nnot have a choice.\n  I have a plan that will jump-start the housing market and breathe \nlife back into our economy. It is very simple. A lower mortgage rate \nwill provide more than 40 million households in the United States who \nare creditworthy or who have a Fannie Mae- or Freddie Mac-backed loan \nwith what amounts to a $400-a-month tax cut for the next 30 years.\n  Here is how it works. American homeowners would be able to refinance \ntheir current mortgages or finance the purchase of a home for somewhere \nbetween 4 and 4.5 percent. Homeowners who hear about this proposal \nimmediately begin to do the math. You can literally see their eyes \nlight up as they realize how this will benefit them. Imagine saving \n$400 per month on a\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\nfixed-rate, 30-year mortgage. This will save $150,000 over the total \nterm of their mortgage. That $400 a month will make a huge difference \nin the budgets of most families.\n  By the way, think of the stimulus effect. If you send a one-time \ncheck of $500 to somebody, they will be unsure whether that is going to \nbe there in the future. Remember, we did this last year and found out \nwhat happened: people spent only 12 cents out of every dollar. It did \nnot help the economy that much. It just added to the deficit. Instead, \npeople saved the money because they saw tougher economic times ahead. \nThey paid down some of their credit card debt, but they didn't go out \nthere and spend it in the economy to generate economic activity. So \njust think of what a family could do with the kind of savings my \namendment would provide. That is almost $5,000 per year that you could \ncount on for the next 30 years. You could build that into your budget \nand you could increase your economic activity with that.\n  Now, banks would issue these Government-backed lower fixed-rate \nmortgages on primary residences, and they would be available between \nnow and the end of 2010. This new lower rate would be based on the \nhistoric spread between the rates of the 10-year Treasury bill and the \n30-year fixed-rate mortgage. We have limited the cost of the program to \n$300 billion. But the economists who have looked at this think the cost \nwill be dramatically less. If you multiply this out across the country, \nit is over $6 trillion in savings for the American people over the next \n30 years. So the Government invests $300 billion, and Americans save, \nover the next 30 years, $6 trillion. That is a pretty good return on \nour investment, I would say.\n  It is also time to expand the current tax credit for first-time home \nbuyers. We need to encourage every potential creditworthy homebuyer to \njump into the market. We should expand the existing credit to cover all \nhomebuyers and cover all properties, not just vacant or foreclosed \nproperties. That is why I strongly supported Senator Isakson's proposal \nto increase the credit to $15,000. Well, since our proposal is a \nsubstitute, we have actually incorporated the Isakson proposal for up \nto $15,000 for those who will buy a home. They will be able to claim \nthat against their taxes either in one year or take 50 percent each \nyear for the next 2 years.\n  We need to have people staying in their homes. The onslaught of \nforeclosed properties in Nevada and across the country is a significant \nhurdle to economic recovery. They bring down property values and drag \ndown consumer confidence.\n  Privately securitized mortgages are at the core of the problem. These \nare mortgages that were originated without a guarantee from one of the \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises. They account for more than 50 percent \nof the foreclosure starts despite accounting for only about 15 percent \nof all the outstanding mortgages. So my bill, the Fix Housing First \nAct, includes temporary incentives for privately held, securitized \nmortgages to be modified. That would allow homeowners facing \nforeclosure to pay lower monthly payments and to stay in their homes. \nIt also provides temporary legal protection for those who do loan \nworkouts in good faith. These two steps eliminate the economic and \nlegal barriers that are currently preventing many homeowners from \nmodifying their loans. This will have a huge impact on families who may \nbe slightly underwater on their loans but who are anxious to stay in \ntheir homes.\n  Unfortunately, more than 860,000 properties were repossessed last \nyear alone. That means that nearly 1 million families lost their homes. \nIt was easy for a while to blame irresponsible homeowners for taking \nout risky loans and gaming the system, but the cancer caused by the \nhousing crisis has spread to every aspect of our economy--the financial \nmarkets, employment, the auto industry, retailers, State budgets, and \nlocal budgets. The list goes on and on.\n  If we want to heal our economy, we have to start first with housing. \nMy proposal--by the way, I call it ``my'' proposal just because I \nhappen to be the lead author. Many people have worked to put this \nproposal together. Our proposal will fix housing. It is the most \ncomprehensive of any of the pieces of legislation out here. It is the \nmost comprehensive piece of legislation to fix the housing crisis in \nthe United States. But along with addressing the housing market, we \nalso need to do properly targeted tax relief for families and small \nbusinesses.\n  The underlying bill has some good proposals in it. They are, \nunfortunately, a small part of the package. But we have incorporated \nsome of those good ideas into our amendment. If there is a good idea \nout there, let's do it in a bipartisan fashion. That is the way we \nshould have done this bill in the first place. That is what the \nPresident called on us to do. Unfortunately, the Democrats in the House \nof Representatives decided to cut Republicans out of the process, and \nthe Democrats in the Senate decided to cut Republicans out when we were \ncrafting this bill. It is unfortunate, but that is what happened. It is \nnot too late, though. We can sit down and take good Republican ideas \nand take good Democratic ideas and help the American people out of this \nterrible economic morass we are in.\n  I believe American taxpayers deserve a break. American families, \nespecially working-class families, need a tax break. So what we have \ndone in our bill is taken the two lowest marginal rates and we have cut \nthem. The 10-percent bracket would be cut to 5 percent, and the 15-\npercent bracket would be cut to 10 percent. The average combined \nbenefit of these cuts for middle-class families would be about $3,200 \nper year for each of the next 2 years.\n  As I mentioned before, we also need to give small business a major \nboost. Small business creates 80 percent of the jobs. We need to \nencourage small businesses. It is not Government that grows us out of \nevery recession, it is small business. That is why this engine of our \neconomy needs some fuel.\n  Extending bonus depreciation, eliminating capital gains taxes for \nstartups and certain small businesses, and investing in broadband \naccess are all measures that will spur job creation and help get this \ncountry back on its feet.\n  Finally, the Fix Housing First Act eliminates the laundry list of \nwasteful spending items in the current stimulus bill. There is also a \nlarge list of spending items that some of us may support. Many are new \nspending programs. But at a time when our country is facing a fiscal as \nwell as a financial crisis, if we are going to have new programs, we \nought to eliminate old, wasteful programs. The underlying bill does \nnone of that.\n  Mr. President, Americans are hurting right now. So many have lost \ntheir jobs, lost their homes, and they need help. They need us. We have \na role to play here. We need to put confidence back into consumers \nacross America so they can start getting back involved in the economy. \nThey understand that a $1.2 trillion spending bill is not the answer. \nThat is why we are seeing support of this bill go down in the polls \neach day.\n  By the way, the bill is not getting smaller. Each day we vote on \namendments, it gets larger and larger and the interest on the bill gets \nlarger too.\n  So I challenge my colleagues, if you do not like the approach we have \ntaken, let us sit down and do it right. Consider the TARP funds that \nwere spent. We were told if we didn't do it that week, the whole \neconomy was going to collapse. When we rush things through, we make \nmistakes. And we have seen the mistakes with the TARP fund. You see the \nheadlines all the time: $20 billion in bonuses for executives who took \nmoney from TARP. And there are all kinds of newspaper stories here and \nthere about the abuses committed with TARP funds. Let's not make the \nsame mistake by rushing through this bill. There is an artificial \ndeadline that has been set on this bill--and that is exactly what it \nis. Should we act quickly? Yes. But doing something wrong quickly does \nnot make it right. Yet that is what some people seem to be saying.\n  I urge us to do what is right for the American people, and let us \njoin together as Americans and figure out what we need to do. Let us \ntake good ideas from both sides and let us help fix the American \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, for months, news about our sinking economy \nhas dominated. The facts are staggering. We now have a 7.2-percent \nunemployment rate. Upwards of 1 million good-paying manufacturing jobs \nwere lost last year, and consumer confidence is at or near an all-time \nlow. Last week brought more bad news. In the last quarter of 2008, the \neconomy shrank by the most in 26 years.\n  At the same time, we now well know about the irresponsibility of some \nfinancial executives who helped to create this crisis and who are now \nbenefiting from Government assistance. While countless families \nstruggle to make ends meet, some Wall Street executives rewarded \nthemselves with bonuses totaling more than $18 billion last year. Such \noutrageous rewards during an economic downturn are without \njustification, and they draw a harsh contrast with the rest of America.\n  Each week without a response from our Government will make that \ncontrast more pronounced--more jobs lost and more families hurting \nacross the country. This is not a partisan issue. Economists agree that \nGovernment needs to act and act now.\n  I support the package before us, but I do have some reservations. The \npricetag on this bill is enormous, and it is true some of the cost is \nin long-term investments such as in education, health care, and energy \nefficiency and independence, which some argue is not immediately \nstimulative. This is a case, however, where the sum is greater than the \nparts. Ultimately, this legislation contains what our economy needs to \nget back on track.\n  The legislation before us combines tax relief, investments in \ninfrastructure, and assistance to State and local governments, all \naimed at putting people back to work and jump-starting our stalled \neconomy. With $342 billion in targeted tax relief, the bill will help \nmiddle-class families. Families in Wisconsin, for example, will get on \naverage a tax cut of $900 just this year. And the bill provides \nimportant tax incentives and benefits for businesses to save jobs and \nstimulate growth.\n  The bill before us also includes funding to get people back to work \nwhile rebuilding our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. For Wisconsin, \nthe bill funds more than $537 million in highway improvements and \nincludes more than $218 million for school modernization.\n  The bill also takes into account the needs of agricultural and rural \ncommunities, funding rural water and waste disposal and farm operating \nloans.\n  Also, the bill provides for our neediest citizens, those who are hit \nhardest by this downturn, through increased funding for Food Stamps, \nWIC, as well as food banks.\n  I am pleased the bill includes funding for two of my priorities--job \ntraining and the COPS Program. Job training is at the core of what this \nlegislation is about: putting people back to work. The $1 billion of \nfunding in the bill will retrain countless workers and prepare people \nfor new job opportunities.\n  In addition, the bill includes nearly $4 billion for Federal and \nState law enforcement programs. These programs have a track record of \nreducing crime, and the additional funding will create jobs quickly.\n  In some ways, this bill is tough to swallow. I understand why there \nare those who may well vote against this bill who argue that it is too \nmuch money. And I understand there are 100 Senators here and each one \nof us would craft this bill differently. But even those voting against \nthe measure would certainly agree that during this time of enormous \nstress on our economy and throughout our land, we cannot afford to do \nnothing. We are in an economic crisis and doing nothing is not an \noption. Indeed, before the final vote, there may well be some \nmodifications to this bill. But we need to vote for a recovery package \nsimilar to the one before us today.\n  I wish to talk briefly about an amendment I have filed that would \nprovide $30 million to the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program. \nThe amendment is offset. I am hopeful this amendment can be included in \na managers' package. The amendment has the support of Senators Snowe, \nStabenow, Brown, Whitehouse, Levin, Sanders, Schumer, and Wyden. MEP \nmakes small- and medium-sized manufacturers more competitive by helping \nthem implement the latest technologies. In 2007, MEP business clients \nreported over 52,000 new or retrained workers, increased sales of $6.8 \nbillion, and over $1 billion in cost savings. As a longtime supporter \nof the MEP Program, I believe this would be a critical addition to the \nbill. A healthy manufacturing sector, as we all know, is the key to \nbetter jobs, increased productivity, and higher standards of living.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of an \namendment to the stimulus bill that Senators Kohl, Brown, Levin, \nSanders, Stabenow, Whitehouse, and I are introducing. The amendment \nwill restore funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, \nto the level included in the House-passed bill. It ensures that $30 \nmillion currently contained in the bill for the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, NIST, go specifically to the MEP to continue \nits critical operations on behalf of small and medium-sized \nmanufacturers nationwide. This would not increase the size of the \nstimulus bill; rather, it would simply reallocate funding to the MEP.\n  If our goal in this stimulus is to create and retain jobs, then there \nis no better program to fund than the MEP. Administered by NIST and \nwith centers in every State, the MEP provides our Nation's nearly \n350,000 small manufacturers with services and access to resources that \nenhance growth, improve productivity, and expand capacity. At a time \nwhen our economy is suffering its worst downturn since the Great \nDepression, the MEP's work is crucial to helping those manufacturers be \nstronger long-term competitors both domestically and internationally. \nThis will, in turn, allow them to create good-paying high-skill jobs.\n  As co-chair of the Senate Task Force on Manufacturing, I have seen \nfirsthand the effect our country's manufacturing industry has on the \nvitality of our economy. By directing $30 million to the MEP, we will \nbe sending a clear signal to small manufacturers that they will \ncontinue to play a vital role in reinvigorating our economy. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 189\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to speak on my amendment that \nprotects religious freedom on college campuses. I start by asking \nunanimous consent to add Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming and Senator Jim \nBunning of Kentucky as cosponsors of amendment No. 189.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, for 2 or 3 weeks now, we have been told \ntime and time again by colleagues and the President that we need to \nmove our country forward, set aside our differences, our ideology, \nremember what unites us, and come together. But the people who are \nwriting our legislation today have not gotten that same message. I will \ntalk about it in just a moment.\n  This morning, I had the pleasure of sitting with a number of my House \nand Senate colleagues, along with about 3,000 other people from all \nover the world, people of faith, and heard President Barack Obama \naddress the National Prayer Breakfast. The President said many great \nthings, but one of them was this:\n\n       The particular faith that motivates each of us can promote \n     a greater good for all of us . . . I don't expect divisions \n     to disappear overnight . . . but I do believe that if we can \n     talk to one another openly and honestly, then perhaps all \n     rifts will start to mend and new partnerships will begin to \n     emerge.\n\n  We heard President Obama, as well as the former Prime Minister of \nGreat Britain, Tony Blair, say faith gave us tools to solve problems \nthat could not be solved without faith. This is a beautiful message, \nand I think we all know it is true.\n  Then we come here and find a provision in this massive spending bill \nthat would make sure that students could never talk openly and honestly \nabout their faith. The fact is, any university or college that takes \nany of the money in this bill to renovate an auditorium, a dorm, or \nstudent center could not hold a National Prayer Breakfast there any \nlonger because of what is written in this bill.\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\n  This bill provides funds to modernize, renovate, repair facilities on \ncollege and university campuses, both private and public. But there is \na phrase in there, a couple of lines that says the facilities that \naccept these funds cannot be ``used for sectarian instruction, \nreligious worship, or a school or department of divinity; or in which a \nsubstantial portion of the functions of the facilities are subsumed in \na religious mission.''\n  Keep in mind that a prayer has been called by our courts to be \nreligious worship. What this means is students cannot meet together in \ntheir dorms, if that dorm has been repaired with this Federal money, \nand have a prayer group or a Bible study. They cannot get together in \ntheir student centers. They cannot have a commencement service where a \nspeaker talks about their personal faith.\n  What this means to universities is legal risk, threats of lawsuits \nfrom the ACLU if they allow any religious activity on a campus that has \ntaken any of this money. It is not just the particular facilities. This \nmoney can be used for electrical wiring, plumbing, and sewer systems \nthat affect every building on campus.\n  This language has been written by very smart lawyers to do what they \ntry to do, and that is intimidate the free speech of traditional \nfreedom-loving Americans. My amendment would just simply strike this \nlanguage and affect no other parts of the bill.\n  The National Prayer Breakfast could not be held in a building \nrenovated with funds from this bill. The Campus Crusade, a fellowship \nof Christian athletes, Intervarsity Christian Fellowship, Catholic and \nJewish student groups who are meeting on campuses all over the country \ntoday could no longer meet in buildings that use funds from the bill we \nare talking about today. Classes on world religions or religious \nhistory, academic studies of religious texts could be banned by \nfacilities that are renovated by this bill.\n  What about a group of teachers or professors who want to start a \nmeeting with a prayer? What about chaplains on campus? What about \nprivate Bible study in a student's dorm room? What about a campus that \nwants to bring a Billy Graham or Rick Warren to speak? Would they be \nbarred from campus? Would the college be sued by the ACLU? What if one \nof us, a Member of Congress, went to speak at a college graduation and \nshared a little bit about the faith in our life, would that college be \nsued?\n  The people who wrote this bill want to create risk and liability and \nput a chilling effect on religious freedom in our country. The most \nimportant thing for us to consider is what is this nonsense doing in \nthis bill in the first place? The courts have decided this issue. \nReligious groups have the same freedom as nonreligious groups. This has \nnothing to do with the economy and even less to do with stimulus.\n  Keep in mind, this bill did not write itself. Someone around here \nthinks it is a good idea to discriminate against people of faith, to \ndeny them educational opportunities and access to public facilities. \nSomeone is so hostile to religion that they are willing to stand in the \nschoolhouse door, like the infamous George Wallace, to deny people of \nfaith from entering any campus building renovated by this bill.\n  This cannot stand. It is in hard times that our society most needs \nfaith. It provides the light that no darkness can overcome. This \nprovision is an attempt to extinguish that light from college campuses, \nfrom the lives of our youth.\n  In the words of the President today:\n\n       Faith . . . can promote a greater good for all of us. Our \n     varied beliefs can bring us together to . . . rebuild what is \n     broken [and] to lift those who have fallen on hard times.\n\n  Our culture cannot survive without faith, and our Nation cannot \nsurvive without freedom. This provision is an assault against both. It \nis un-American, and it is unconstitutional, intolerant, and it is \nintolerable. It must be struck from the underlying bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my very simple amendment, a few lines \nthat just strike this provision that has already been decided by the \ncourts that has no place in this bill. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. Mr. President, how much time do I \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time allocation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There is no time.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I yield all of it then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, can we propound the unanimous consent \nrequest? It has not been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, I commend our good friend and \ncolleague from Montana. He has been on the Senate floor it seems \nendlessly over the last several weeks with a number of bills--SCHIP and \nnow this stimulus package and others. I commend him and his staff for \nthe tremendous job they have been doing. It is a lot of hard work. They \nhave been very patient with all of us. Senator Inouye as well, and his \nstaff on the Appropriations Committee. They have done a good job as \nwell.\n  I have two amendments that will be offered at some point later today. \nI wish to take a couple minutes to describe each of them since we will \nhave limited time during the series of votes that will occur to \ndescribe them in detail.\n  The first amendment I will be offering, along with Senator John Kerry \nwho offered to be a cosponsor of this amendment, involves the \nmitigation on foreclosure issue.\n  It was exactly 2 years ago the day after tomorrow that I held my \nfirst hearing as Chairman of the Banking Committee on the foreclosure \nissue. At that time we had a hearing on this issue. I warned at the \ntime, as did several of my colleagues on the Committee, about the \nserious mounting problems with the threats to the residential mortgage \nmarket in the country and what this could likely do to our economy if \nwe didn't put a tourniquet on this beginning hemorrhage in the \nresidential mortgage market.\n\n  At that time, Martin Eakes, who is President and CEO of the Self-Help \nCredit Union and the Center for Responsible Lending, predicted at that \nhearing there would be over 2 million foreclosures in the United \nStates. This was in February of 2007. The reaction from the Mortgage \nBankers Association and other industry groups was immediate and \ndefinitive that day. No way, they said. They accused Mr. Eakes of \ncrying wolf and exaggerating the problem.\n  Well, the industry was half right. Mr. Eakes and the consumer \nadvocates were very wrong. We weren't facing 2 million foreclosures. We \nnow know we are facing 8 million foreclosures 2 years later. And of \ncourse we are all painfully aware of the condition of our economy \ntoday, the worst since the Great Depression, going back 80 years; and, \nunfortunately, getting worse every day, with 20,000 jobs a day being \nlost in our country, and somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 homes being \nforeclosed.\n  When we wrote the TARP program in the fall of last year, one of the \nmajor provisions was to mitigate foreclosures. Regretfully, very little \nhas been done on that issue, and today we still see the mounting \nforeclosures in our country. In fact, last summer, we passed the Hope \nfor Homeowners legislation. This amendment I am offering today does two \nthings: one, it makes it possible for the Hope for Homeowners bill to \nwork better than we intended it would back in July by eliminating \nseveral provisions in that bill, or at least modifying, including \nlowering the future equity that homeowners must share from 50 percent \nto 25 percent of the original price; reduce the upfront and annual \npremiums charged to borrowers under that program; provide incentive \npayments to servicers who participate in the program; and allow for \nbulk sale of mortgages at discounts to promote a higher volume of loan \nmodifications. Now, these ideas will increase participation, which has \nbeen almost nonexistent. With these modifications, there are many who \nbelieve we will see a substantial increase in people taking advantage \nof that program.\n  The second part of the amendment is one that would require within 15 \ndays of the enactment of this legislation to develop a program in \nconsultation with the Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, and the Secretary \nof HUD to develop a program to mitigate additional foreclosures. We \nwould require and devote no less than $50 billion of the TARP fund--not \nof the\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\nstimulus package, of the TARP funding--to go to a loan modification \nprogram. And the program, I would point out, is expected to prevent at \nleast 2 million foreclosures in the country.\n  The amendment does not dictate any particular loan modification plan. \nI think we owe the administration, which has committed to moving on \nthis matter, the ability to develop the best plan they are able to. So \nI leave it up to them to decide how this can be done. I am particularly \nattracted to the plan Sheila Bair at FDIC has promoted, but I know \nthere are other ideas. But at least here we would commit $50 billion of \nthat $350 billion to do something that will require and mandate that we \nbegin to deal with this problem.\n  I don't know of anyone who believes today that if we don't deal with \nthe foreclosure problem we will not get to the bottom of our economic \ncrisis. I have been saying it for 2 years. We had 30 hearings in the \nBanking Committee, of the 80 we held in meetings on this subject \nmatter, and witness after witness, regardless of ideology or political \nstripe all said the same thing: We have to deal with the foreclosure \nissue.\n  Today, with 8 million homes in jeopardy, 9,000 a day being lost, we \nfinally I think have to say with some certainty that if we are going to \nbe using this next tranche of $350 billion, we have to dedicate $50 \nbillion of it to foreclosure mitigation. So in addition to the \nmodifications to the Hope for Homeowners, the amendment would also \nrequire that $50 billion be spent of the TARP program on this issue.\n  The second amendment I will be offering deals with executive \ncompensation. Now, let me say right at the outset, this issue can be \ntrivialized, if we are not careful. I think a lot of attention has been \npaid to this issue because, obviously, it is infuriating to people when \nthey watch taxpayer money go into an institution and then they read \nwhere top executives walk away with multimillion dollar bonuses or \ncontracts. It absolutely is more than infuriating to people when they \nread about it and hear about it. The problem is, if you don't do \nsomething about this, we are never going to be able to build the \nconfidence and optimism people need to feel about the larger part of \nthis program. So a tremendous amount of heat and understandable anger \nis focused on executive compensation.\n  Again, I emphasize that I think there are other issues we need to \ndeal with, but in order to deal with and build some support for them, \nwe have to deal with the executive compensation issues. This amendment \ndoes so. I realize this is painful for some, and I am not suggesting \neveryone who has been receiving bonuses or excessive compensation is \nnecessarily an evil person at all. Quite the contrary, in many cases \nthey are good people. But there needs to be a sense of reality that if \nyou are literally dumping billions of dollars into these institutions \nto try to save them, when in many cases the very people who mismanaged \nthese operations are walking away with millions of dollars in \ncompensation. You can begin to understand why people in this country \nare so angry.\n  Let me describe a few of the major provisions regarding this. The \namendment would ban bonuses, retention bonuses, and incentive \ncompensation for some of the most senior employees at TARP recipient \nfirms. It would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to increase the \nnumber of executives ineligible for such compensation if he deems it to \nbe in the public interest.\n  Secondly, this amendment is not only about the prospective TARP \nrecipients, it also requires the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a \nretroactive review of past bonus awards, retention awards, and other \ncompensation that TARP recipients paid to employees. If the Secretary \ndetermines any payments were excessive and inconsistent with the \npurposes of TARP or otherwise contrary to public interest, the \namendment directs the Treasury to seek to negotiate a reimbursement to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  Currently, shareholders of public companies may offer proposals on \nexecutive compensation, but it takes an initiative by the shareholders. \nWe apply that provision now to TARP recipients. Under this amendment, \nit would require the TARP recipient of the company to automatically put \na proposal on these cash bonuses and compensation on its annual proxy \nstatement to shareholders without requiring shareholders to make a \nprior request or formulate the proposal. Such proposals would call for \nan advisory shareholder vote on the company's executive cash \ncompensation program. This ``say on pay'' vote would enable \nshareholders of TARP recipients to voice their views. And as the owners \nof the companies, I think they ought to be heard on these matters.\n  Thirdly, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, we included \na clawback requirement, which allows the TARP to recover any bonuses or \nincentive compensation paid to an executive based on reported earnings \nor other criteria later found to be materially inaccurate. This \namendment expands the number of senior employees who would be subject \nto this clawback as well.\n\n  As former SEC Chairman Bill Donaldson wrote not that long ago, and I \nquote him:\n\n       People with targets, and jobs dependent on meeting them, \n     will probably meet their targets--even if they have to \n     destroy the enterprise to do it.\n\n  This amendment ensures that isn't the case for companies receiving \nTARP funds. First, it would prohibit any compensation plan that would \nencourage the manipulation of reported earnings. It would also create a \ncompensation committee composed entirely of independent directors--not \nonly monitoring the objectivity of compensation awards but evaluating \ncompensation plans and their potential risk to the financial health of \nthe company. Finally, the amendment would require the chief executive \nofficer of the TARP-receiving company and the chief financial officer \nof the company to certify compliance with these requirements. We have \nrequired that under Sarbanes-Oxley, and I think in this area we ought \nto do it as well.\n  There will be those who think these are excessive, but unfortunately, \nwhat we have seen is excessive. If we are going to convince the \nAmerican public that what we are trying to do is in their interest, \nthen we have to be certain when it comes to these matters.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to be supportive of this. It is broad, it \nis far reaching, it gives the Secretary additional powers, but it \nallows us to deal with these issues in a comprehensive fashion.\n  Unless we do this, I will tell you that I think it will become \nvirtually impossible to get this Congress, either body, to support any \nadditional funds of this nature that may very well be needed. Unless we \nstart to calm the anger of the American public over how some of these \ndollars are being used, we are never going to succeed in that effort.\n  So while it is not a significant portion of the money overall, it is \na significant cause of the lack of confidence, and therefore I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment when it is offered. The first \namendment is on housing, and this one is on executive compensation.\n  I apologize for taking a little longer. I know other Members wish to \nbe heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was going to respond to Senator DeMint's \namendment, but I see Senator Thune on the floor, and we are trying to \nalternate from side to side. It will take me about 10 minutes, but I \nyield to him.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield to me for one comment. We are \nstill working on a UC for setting up votes, and for the benefit of my \ncolleagues, we think it is roughly sometime shortly after 4 p.m., but \nwe haven't completed the unanimous consent agreement as yet. But for \nthe information of colleagues, we are working on a series of 13 votes \nat least.\n  Thanks.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask Senator Thune if he wants to proceed \nfirst.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I guess my understanding is--and it wasn't \nlocked in, in the form of a unanimous consent request--that we were \ngoing to ping-pong back and forth with speakers. I have an amendment I \nwish to speak to, if that is okay with the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, does the Senator from Illinois wish to \nspeak after Senator Thune?\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. No, I do.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak after whoever speaks on that side, after the next \nDemocrat speaks.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Frankly, Mr. President, I think the next speaker should \nbe you.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I will go with that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You are on. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Well, no, Mr. President. First up is Senator Thune.\n  Mr. President, if the Chair could tell us--I believe Senator Thune is \ngoing now, then a speaker on the other side, and then I will go after \nthat speaker.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That will be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 197\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to speak today in support of my \nsubstitute amendment, which is No. 197. This amendment has been modeled \nafter the substitute amendment that was offered by the Republicans in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  I think the big question we have to ask, and the question before the \nHouse is, if we are serious about doing something for this economy to \nrecover and to create jobs, what is the best and most effective way to \ndo that? We have in front of us a proposal that emphasizes more heavily \ngovernment spending and doing it through government programs. What I \nhave chosen to offer to my colleagues here in the Senate is an \nopportunity to vote on something that does it in a different way. It \nallows the American people to spend the money that we use to infuse the \neconomy with dollars that hopefully will grow the economy and create \njobs.\n  Our Nation has lost millions of jobs over the last several months. \nFamilies are hurting and businesses are struggling to survive. As our \nNation weathers this turbulent economic time, we do have this decision \nto make: Should the Congress take hundreds of billions of tax dollars \nand invest them in an expanded Federal Government or, on the other \nhand, should Congress return tax dollars directly into the economy in \nthe form of tax relief, which will create jobs and economic \nopportunity?\n  The response the Democratic majority has put in front of us is to put \nmore money into Federal agencies, to renovate Federal buildings, and \nbuy new cars for Federal employees. I believe we ought to follow a \ndifferent path and let the people of this country keep more of their \nhard-earned dollars and let them decide how best to spend, save, \ninvest, and to turn this economy around.\n  People know better how to spend their money than unelected \nbureaucrats here in Washington, DC. And tax relief, not government \nspending--reductions in taxes for the American people--will create jobs \nand get us out of this recession. This is what President Kennedy knew, \nthis is what President Reagan knew, this is what I believe the American \npublic, with their lackluster response to the $1 trillion spending \nprogram in front of us, knows as well.\n  This substitute amendment does several things. It shifts, as I said, \nthe focus from government spending to meaningful tax relief in four \nways: First, it provides tax relief for individuals and families; \nsecond, tax relief for small businesses--the job creators in our \neconomy; thirdly, it provides housing assistance; and, finally, it \nprovides temporary assistance to those who are dealing with the current \nrecession.\n  Now, first, the bill provides meaningful tax relief for working \ntaxpaying families. Under the ``Making Work Pay Credit,'' the tax \nprovision in the bill--the majority bill--7 million households are \ngoing to receive a check from the government that is larger than both \ntheir payroll tax and their income tax liability. In other words, \nrather than a one-time credit, what my amendment would do is reduce the \nlowest two marginal income tax rates for years 2009 and 2010. \nEssentially, the 10-percent rate would go down to 5 percent and the 5 \npercent rate will go down to 10 percent. This is a real tax reduction \nand will benefit all income taxpayers in this country.\n\n  In total, there are 100 million taxpayers who would receive, on \naverage, tax relief of $1,250 per filer each year. Married couples \ncould receive up to $3,400 in lower taxes each year.\n  Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. As consumer spending declined for a record 6 months in 2008, \nit is no surprise that our economy contracted over the same period of \ntime. If we want to spur consumer spending, we should not implement \nsingle shot policies like a one-time credit, and we certainly should \nnot pour hundreds of billions of dollars into Government programs. \nInstead, the best way to stimulate consumer spending is an immediate \nmeaningful reduction of marginal income tax rates.\n  With respect to small businesses, the second part of this bill \nfocuses on small business tax relief. Small businesses, as I said, \ncreate up to 80 percent of all new jobs and represent 99 percent of the \n27 million businesses in the United States. If we want to create new \njobs, we should start with helping small business, not expanding \nFederal bureaucracies. This amendment expands small business bonus \ndepreciation and expensing to encourage investment in this current \nyear, which is when we need it the most. The amendment expands the net \noperating loss carryback period, permitting businesses to carry back \ntheir operating loss deductions for 5 years rather than 2.\n  Several of these provisions, granted, are included in the underlying \nbill. This amendment, however, provides an additional $47 billion of \nsmall business tax relief. My amendment includes a new provision that \nwould allow small businesses to deduct 20 percent of their business \nincome. This provision significantly reduces the tax burden on small \nbusinesses which would allow them to continue to hire and retain hard-\nworking Americans. This provision would also allow small businesses to \nmaximize their earnings and increase in value, which will also give \nthem better access to credit markets and another critical component to \na recovery.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and, unbelievably, \nonly 2 percent of the total in this bill, the underlying bill, the \nmajority bill, is dedicated to tax relief for small businesses. The \nlack of small business incentives in this bill, in my judgment, is a \nserious flaw, and my amendment seeks to improve it substantially.\n  I also understand people are hurting on account of the economic \ndownturn. Across America we have hard-working men and women who are \nbeing layed off because of no fault of their own. Today they are \nsitting at the kitchen table wondering how to make ends meet.\n  Earlier this year, Congress acted to extend unemployment insurance to \nprovide a safety net for those who are in need. My amendment would \nextend the expanded unemployment insurance provisions through the end \nof this year. Additionally, the amendment would eliminate the income \ntax on unemployment insurance. This is an automatic increase in the \nreal benefit of unemployment insurance to those who derive it. It never \nmade sense to me that individuals would pay taxes to the Government to \nfund unemployment insurance and, once they are unemployed, receive the \nbenefits and then have to pay taxes on the benefit as well. This \namendment would correct that. It would also make health care more \naffordable for the self-employed and other families without employer-\nprovided health insurance because, for the first time, this amendment \nwould provide an above-the-line deduction for health insurance costs.\n  Finally, with respect to the housing market, this amendment addresses \nour housing market prices. The housing market is what led us into this \nrecession. In fixing the housing market, we will help lead us out. My \namendment would extend the $7,500 home buyer tax credit through \nDecember 31, 2009, while expanding the benefit to all primary \nresidences. This amendment would eliminate the complicated recapture \nrules which currently require home buyers to pay the Government back if \nthey claim this credit. In the end, this provision would help stimulate \nthe faltering housing market and encourage responsible home ownership.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, there are some real \nissues associated with the decision we make about whether to stimulate \nthe economy with Federal spending, with Government spending or with tax \nrelief. I wish to read for you a couple things the CBO has said:\n\n       Reductions in Federal taxes [would] have most of their \n     effects . . . in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\n\n  That is the very period we are targeting to provide the greatest \neconomic stimulus and hope of job creation.\n  They also stated: ``Purchases of goods and services, either directly \nor in the form of grants to States and local government, would take \nyears to complete.''\n  They go on, it will be ``difficult to properly manage and oversee a \nrapid expansion of existing programs.''\n  Finally, they say: ``[M]any of the larger projects initiated would \ntake up to 5 to 7 years to complete.''\n  If we want to approach this problem with a solution that delivers \nassistance quickly, that is quick hitting, that gets money into the \neconomy quickly, that creates jobs quickly, the way to go about doing \nthat is not to have the Government spend the money, to have it come out \nof Washington, send our money to Washington, have the Government take \nmore money out of the economy, and then decide how to spend it here. It \nis to get money into the hands of hard-working Americans and small \nbusinesses, where the real power for job creation exists.\n  Interestingly enough, this legislation, the amendment I offer, was \nrun through an analysis that was used--it is a methodology that was \ndeveloped by the President's chair of the Counsel of Economic Advisers. \nHer name is Dr. Christina Romer and Dr. Jared Bernstein, the adviser to \nthe Vice President. This was a methodology they used back in 2007, that \nconsiders the multiplier effect of various policy decisions and fiscal \ndecisions that are made by the Congress. What they suggested in that \nanalysis is, if you reduce taxes on the American public, you get a 2.2 \nmultiplier in terms of GDP. My amendment reduces taxes as a percentage \nof our gross domestic product by 2.8 percent. If you take that by their \nmultiplier 2.2, you get 6.1 percent in GDP growth as a result of \ncutting taxes.\n  If you go on further, they suggest that for every 1 percent increase \nin GDP, you get three-quarters of a percentage change in jobs. So if \nyou take the 6.1-percent growth in GDP and multiply it by .75 you get a \n4.6-percent increase in the number of jobs. You take the full size of \nour workforce today, about 133,876,000 employees, and you plug in that \n4.6-percent increase and you get a job growth increase--a job increase \nover the course of the next 2 years, as a result of making these \nchanges in tax policy, of almost a 6.2-percent increase in jobs.\n  The proposal we have before us suggests they could get up to another \n3 million jobs, perhaps, from this. But I suggest, if we can create \ndouble that amount, 6 million jobs, as a result of reducing taxes, it \nis a much better solution for our country to get our economy back on \ntrack and is also done at a lot less cost. The overall cost, according \nto CBO, of my amendment, is about $440 billion, compared to the $900 \nbillion it will cost for the proposal the Democratic majority has in \nfront of us; twice the jobs at half the cost. That sounds like a \nsolution that makes a lot of sense. It makes a lot of sense to the \nAmerican people, who understand clearly you do not send your money to \nWashington and hope the Government can spend it to create jobs. The way \nto create jobs is to get money back in the hands of the American \npeople, back in the hands of small businesses. That is what will lead \nus to that growth in gross domestic product, the expanding economy and \nthe job creation associated with that. Twice the jobs for half the \ncost. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It is a much \nbetter approach to dealing with what is a very serious economic crisis \nfor this country. I think the American people believe that. I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will support it as well.\n  Let me say, the cosponsors on this amendment are Senators Kyl, \nDeMint, Johanns, and Hatch. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the stimulus proposal \nadvanced by my friend and Republican colleague from Nevada, Senator \nEnsign. His plan is to have the Government provide fixed mortgages at 4 \npercent to all creditworthy Americans.\n  Senator Ensign has stated publicly he believes the Government should \nseek to help stabilize the housing market during these tumultuous times \nand, as my colleagues all know because I have been speaking about it \nfor months and months, I completely agree 100 percent that we have to \nstabilize the housing market.\n  I have been told the Treasury, under the leadership of Secretary \nGeithner, is working on a plan to get mortgage rates down. It is a good \nidea. But the plan of Secretary Geithner is completely different from \nthe plan offered by Senator Ensign and others. Geithner's plan is a \nplan--I haven't seen the details. I look forward to supporting it. But \nit is different from this plan which I must oppose in a very serious \nway.\n  Let's start from the beginning. We in Washington sometimes seem to \nforget that the root cause of the financial and economic turmoil we are \nnow experiencing, and that is the worst most of us have ever seen, \nexcept those who lived during the Great Depression, is the inability of \nhomeowners to make their mortgage payments on time. Whether it is \nbecause they lost their jobs or suffered unexpected medical costs or, \nas was too often the case in recent years, because they were targeted \nby predatory mortgage lenders and given a loan they couldn't afford or \nbecause they reached too far on their own, there are a large number of \nhomeowners who are staring into the abyss of foreclosure. Of course, \nall Americans know we are now facing potentially the worst economic \ncrisis since Herbert Hoover was in office.\n  On the positive side, I wish to applaud my Republican colleagues, \nboth for embracing the idea of a big stimulus proposal--this is \ncertainly big--and for recognizing the critical importance of helping \nat-risk homeowners. Those are good. But when you look at the specifics \nof this plan, you know it is one you cannot support. I don't care \nwhether your ideology is Republican or Democratic, liberal or \nconservative. Unfortunately, the proposal offered fails miserably at \neither stabilizing the housing market or at providing an effective \nstimulus. It does so at an unthinkably large cost and risk to the \nAmerican economy.\n  The cost of this program is, to put it succinctly, through the roof. \nFor fiscal conservatives to advocate it, I am quite surprised.\n  The Republican proposal is light on details, but it appears to offer \nall Americans who qualify for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conforming \nloans, an interest rate of 4 percent. This is very important. This is \nnot just for new home purchases but also for refinancings as well. So \nanyone who owns a home can refinance at 4 percent, Freddie or Fannie-\nsupported loans.\n  The bottom line is, this idea will be prohibitively expensive and may \njeopardize the credit rating of the United States of America. It is \nthat serious. The Republicans themselves say they will cap the \nprogram's cost at $300 billion--$300 billion for this one program. What \ndoes this even mean? Do they mean the total size is $300 billion? If \nthat is so, it works out to about 2.5 percent of mortgages in America, \ngiving only a tiny handful of Americans an enormous windfall. Mr. \nPresident, 2.5 percent get this break, 97.5 percent do not.\n  More likely the Republicans mean that the program's total losses will \nbe $300 billion, a figure which can only be gotten by using the same \nEnron-style accounting that got us into this mess. This is not a \nrealistic or even possible figure, when you consider how much risk the \nGovernment will end up shouldering. Currently, Fannie and Freddie have \nmore than $5 trillion in outstanding conforming loans, all of which \nwould qualify for refinancing under the Senator Ensign-Senator \nMcConnell plan. You can bet that most Americans who qualify will take \nthis offer. Who wouldn't? After all, what homeowner out there would not \nrefinance into a 4-percent mortgage?\n  So the Government would be the owner of over $5 trillion in \nmortgages. You are telling me anyone can guarantee that the Government \nwould lose only $300 billion on this plan? If you believe that, I have \na hedge fund I would like you to invest in called Madoff Securities, \nLLC.\n  Even if the Republican plan costs $300 billion, it recklessly exposes \nthe country to enormous financial risk. No matter how rosy the \nestimates may be of how much this program will cost in the long run, \nthe fact remains, in the short run, we have to come up with the\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\nmoney to finance these new mortgages, potentially more than $5 \ntrillion. Where will the new money come from? From issuing new debt. \nDoes anyone believe the United States, for this one program, can issue \n$5 trillion of new debt and not jeopardize the dollar, in the midst of \nthe worst crisis in our lifetimes?\n  I believe as much as anyone in the strong creditworthiness of our \ncountry. We can and will repay all of our debts, and investors around \nthe world know this. That is why U.S. debt is sold at a low rate. But \nadd $5 trillion to the debt in a short period of time and see what \nhappens. After 8 years of tax cuts, wars, adding another $5 trillion \ncould break the back of the U.S. dollar. The odds are all too high that \ncould happen. Do you know what then will happen? We will all be in a \nworld depression immediately. This program cannot work.\n  If the Republican plan were able to reverse our housing slide, then \nit might make sense. But even at its goal, it fails. Why? It does not \ncorrectly identify the problem, which is that there is an oversupply of \nhousing right now that is made worse each month by the glut of \nforeclosures occurring driving down home prices.\n  Now, you tell me, you are in your home, you pay your mortgage, you \nnow have an absolute right to refinance at 4 percent, and you are \nstaying in the same home. How does that reduce the glut of housing on \nthe market? How?\n  Furthermore, it does not address the vast majority of homes at risk \nfor foreclosure, the 70 percent that are underwater, where the amount \nowed on the mortgage exceeds the value. Underwater mortgages are high \nforeclosure risks no matter what the mortgage rate is. You can have a \n4-percent rate, a 1-percent rate, an 8-percent rate, and if you do not \nhave enough income to pay your mortgage, you are not going to pay it.\n  So the second problem or the third problem with this is it does not \nmake it any better. If you owe $400,000 on a $300,000 home, as millions \nof American homeowners across the country do, you will not even qualify \nfor this plan, you are not even eligible for refinancing. So it does \nnot get at the problem. Not only does it cost a fortune, but it does \nnot get at the problem because the proposal is vastly skewed toward \nrefinancing rather than toward the purchase of new homes. It will not \nstimulate housing demand much at all. If you are a new homeowner, you \nmay take advantage of the 4-percent rate or you may continue to wait \nand see if home prices bottom out. But if you are a current homeowner, \nyou are going to refinance no matter what. Now, what about it has a \nstimulus?\n  Clearly, this is not a housing plan. It is a way to put money into \npeople's pockets--something I am not against--through the refinancing \nof mortgages. But will this provide the economic shot in the arm we \nneed to get our economy back on track? Unfortunately, there again, the \nanswer is no. We know that most people, when given tax cuts during a \ndownturn such as this, do not respond by spending money but by saving \nit and paying down their debt. The poor and the working class spend \nmore of the tax cuts they receive; they are less likely to be able to \nuse this program. The program targets its largesse at homeowners who \nhold mortgages of up to a value of $625,000, and the more expensive \nyour home, up to that limit, the more money you get back. So, \nironically, the people getting the most money back are the people less \nlikely to spend and stimulate the economy. It is highly inefficient.\n  Furthermore, guess who is going to take a big slice of this money--\nthe bank that would do the refinancing. Everyone knows points. We all, \nwhen we have gone for a mortgage, hate points. Points mean you have to \npay $5,000, $10,000, whatever. So the final point is, while we are \nputting money in people's pockets, which is an admirable goal, we are \nletting every bank doing the refinancing take a big cut on points. If \nyou have a $150,000 mortgage you are going to refinance, about $1,000, \n$2,000, $3,000, depending on the bank, will go to them. So even if this \nis not a housing stimulus, which we know it is not, even if it is a way \nto get money into people's pockets at a cost of at least $300 trillion \nand an immediate outlay of $5 trillion, why are we giving every bank in \nAmerica that does the refinancing a cut? That makes no sense. It is \ndone willy-nilly.\n  With all due respect, I wonder at the depth of the thinking that went \ninto putting this proposal together. Perhaps if it were limited to \nfirst-time home buyers, perhaps if the bank's points were limited, \nperhaps if we would say there would be an income limitation because \nanother problem with this is multimillionaires--this is another point: \nIf you make $5 million a year, you get the reduced rate and the Federal \nGovernment pays for it. Do we want to give multimillionaires the \nability to refinance? So perhaps if there were income limitations. So \nthe nub of this idea might be supportable. The way it is put together \nhere on paper, because it costs so much, because it is not going to \nstimulate housing, because it is a very inefficient way to get money \ninto the economy and get the economy going, because the banks take a \ncut, and because very wealthy people can apply for this, who do not \nneed any help, it makes no sense to enact it now.\n  What I would suggest to my good friend from Nevada is this: Take the \nnub of this proposal and go back to the drawing board and refine it. \nThe administration is coming up with a housing proposal next week. We \nwill work on housing. We have to. And then you can have your proposal, \nwe will see what their proposal is--which I believe is significantly \ndifferent, although the intention, at least for home buyers, is to \nbring mortgage rates down--and maybe we can come up with an agreement \nor a compromise. But to vote for this plan now with its high cost, lack \nof an income limitation, money that goes to the banks right off the \ntop, and lack of ability to move the housing market--this amendment \nshould not and cannot pass.\n  So I would urge my Republican colleagues to come up with a new, \nbetter plan that gets to the root of the housing crisis, and then we \ncan begin to work on solutions. We certainly need to tackle the \nproblem. We need to tackle it on the demand and the supply side. But \nthe demand side needs to be targeted at ways to boost new home \npurchases only, not extend refinancing to all of them. On the supply \nside, we need to adopt measures that will efficiently prevent \nforeclosures and reduce the excess supply of homes, enhance FHA-insured \nlending, bankruptcy reform, and the extension of FDIC loss mitigation.\n  I am confident we can come up with a good plan that is more targeted, \nless costly, and that will begin to get us out of the housing morass. I \nwould hope that my colleagues again scrap this proposal, go back to the \ndrawing board, and, after we finish the stimulus, work with us in a \nbipartisan way to produce that result.\n  I yield my remaining time back to my colleague from Montana, the \nchairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Policy Act are completed on an \n     expeditious basis and that the shortest existing applicable \n     process under the National Environmental Policy Act is \n     utilized,\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand.) The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will speak for a couple of minutes about what the \nSenator from Montana talked about, the Congressional Budget Office \nreport today. Basically, it says that this present legislation before \nus, the stimulus package, would increase employment at that point in \ntime by 1.3 million to 3.9 million jobs. I did the math on that, and \n1.3 million jobs by the end of 2010 comes to $680,769 per job. If the \nmost optimistic estimate of 3.9 million new jobs created between now \nand the last quarter of 2010, it is only $226,923 per job.\n  Interesting comments by the Congressional Budget Office, which says \non page 5:\n\n       In principle, the legislation's long-run impact on output \n     also would depend on whether it permanently changed \n     incentives to work or save. However, according to CBO's \n     estimates, the legislation would not have any significant \n     permanent effects on these incentives.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       CBO estimates that by 2019 the Senate legislation would \n     reduce GDP by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent on net.\n\n  That is easy to understand because we will be paying interest on a \nhuge debt of multitrillions of dollars as a result of this legislation.\n  As the CBO says:\n\n       To the extent that people hold their wealth as government \n     bonds rather than in a form that can be used to finance \n     private investment, the increased debt would tend to reduce \n     the stock of productive capital. In economic parlance, the \n     debt would crowd out private investment.\n\n  Again, what we are doing is mortgaging our children's and our \ngrandchildren's futures.\n  The President today said:\n\n       They [talking about those of us who support my amendment] \n     are rooted in the idea that tax cuts alone can solve all of \n     our problems.\n\n  They are rooted in the idea that tax cuts alone can solve our \nproblems. I urge someone to tell the President of the United States \nthat we have $421 billion of tax cuts and spending in this proposal, \nand spending that is meaningful and creates jobs, not loaded down with \nporkbarrel projects and certainly not one that approaches over $1 \ntrillion on future generations of Americans.\n  We ought to change Washington. We ought to change the way we are \nconducting this legislation, especially in partisan, nonconsultative \nfashion. If the leadership can peal off two or three Republicans, that \nis an accomplishment they will make, but it is not bipartisanship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 6 minutes to the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, when we began this process in November, \nthe Appropriations Committee worked with the incoming administration \nand our partners in the House to identify the primary goals for \nlegislation that would help America regain its financial footing.\n  Based on those discussions, we identified one overwhelming priority--\nputting as many Americans as possible back to work as quickly as \npossible. We also identified two further fundamental priorities: \nassisting the States so they would not face insurmountable budget \ncrises that would in turn force significant layoffs at a time when they \nare facing unprecedented demand for services; and making the right \ninvestments that will not simply create temporary jobs, but will repair \nand strengthen our physical and cyber infrastructure, so that this \nNation has the foundation it needs to enable strong economic growth for \nyears to come.\n  I have listened to the debate over the past 2 days, and I fear that \nwe are losing sight of the key goal.\n  Several of my Republican colleagues have suggested that the measure \npending before us will spend $888 billion and produce 3.5 million jobs, \nso that each job created costs $255,000.\n  However, they don't take into consideration how investments in roads, \nbridges, railroads and other mass transit systems will actually cut \nback on one of the most wasteful expenses that Americans deal with each \nand every day--traffic congestion.\n  According to the Texas Transportation Institute:\n\n       Gridlock costs the average peak period traveler almost 40 \n     hours a year in travel delay, and costs the United States \n     more than $78 billion each year. At a time when fuel is \n     increasingly costly, traffic jams are wasting 2.9 billion \n     gallons of gas every year.\n\n  Also, it is important to remember that the cost of labor when it \ncomes to construction projects like roads and bridges is, I believe, \naround 15 percent. The rest of the budget goes for supplies like steel \nand concrete, the costs of acquiring rights-of-way, the drafting of \nplans and, of course, the costs of necessary planning and environmental \nimpact studies.\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\n  Another form of construction contained in this bill is sewer repairs. \nLet me give a specific example. This bill recommends $125 million, to \nbe matched at 100 percent with local funds from ratepayers, to continue \nimplementation of the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority \nLong-term Control Plan.\n  The Water and Sewer Authority has identified up to 40 specific near-\nterm activities that would create more than 250 jobs. Under the logic \nthat is being used by some of the opponents of this bill, this would \nequate to some $500,000 per job. This is terribly misleading. What \nabout the costs of tunneling, the cost of the pipes, the cost for all \nof the heavy equipment, insurance costs, and many more, I am sure.\n  With due respect to those who oppose this bill, the cost of a \nconstruction job is not the cost of labor. If we are to have an open \nand honest debate on the merits of this legislation, let us at least \nstart with the facts.\n  Our objective here is not to create make-work jobs for 1 year having \npeople count paperclips. Our goal is to create real jobs that will last \nfor many years and that will in turn create more jobs. Our goal is to \nensure that America will remain the strongest economy in the world for \nmany years to come.\n  While our short-term tactic is to pass a bill that will have an \nimmediate stimulative impact and help us through the current crisis, we \nmust not lose sight of the fact that our short-term tactics can have a \nlong term impact--rebuilding our infrastructure and adapting to new \ntechnologies today that put us back on track to being competitive in \nthe global economy for generations to come.\n  Reinvesting in the infrastructure that underlies our Nation--roads, \nmass transportation, sewers and sidewalks--is not glamorous, but this \ninvestment puts Americans to work building for the future.\n  I stand by the original vision of this bill--create jobs, support \nState and local governments, and invest in our basic infrastructure. \nThese are the priorities that will ensure that America emerges from \nthis crisis stronger and better able to compete in the global economy.\n  During the past 2 days opponents of this bill have spoken about the \nprimacy of tax cuts over all other policies. They have spoken of the \nneed to cut spending on programs that create jobs now, good jobs, real \njobs, jobs that preserve the environment, improve education, and lead \nus toward true energy independence.\n  And opponents of this bill have spoken about cutting programs that \nprovide a lifeline to those who have been hit the hardest by this \ncrisis.\n  One thought comes to my mind. This bill is about change, and their \nopposition is about simply responding to the biggest crisis since the \nGreat Depression with more of the same.\n  More of the same hasn't worked for the past several years. It is time \nto act, and to pass this measure.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I remind my colleagues to support the \nMcCain amendment on which I spoke earlier. I also rise to say a word \nabout the Thune amendment which deserves our support. According to the \neconomic models developed by the President's economic advisers, this \nproposal would create twice as many jobs for half the cost, about 6.2 \nmillion new jobs for $480 billion, as opposed to the alleged 3 to 4 \nmillion jobs for $888 billion under the Democratic proposal. One of the \nbest parts is a 7-percentage-point rate cut for small businesses done \nexactly the way we did for corporations under the FSC/ETI bill. This \nwould apply to businesses with fewer than 500 employees, precisely the \nkind of businesses that create jobs.\n  Finally, it contains a provision that expresses our policy that the \nUnited States should not increase its marginal income tax rates while \nthe unemployment rate is above the level of 2008, and taxes should not \nbe increased to pay for the impact this stimulus will have on the \ndeficit which we know is large. That is precisely what caused the \nsecond half of the Great Depression and slowed down the economic \nrecovery in Japan.\n  I urge colleagues to support the McCain amendment and the Thune \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. May I ask how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes 4 seconds and 24 seconds.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise in support of the McCain \namendment and in opposition to the underlying bill. I was listening to \nmy friend from New York talk about the housing amendment that Senator \nEnsign has offered, and he now speaks in opposition to that, but he \nsupports a proposal that is coming from the administration next week \nthat aims to try and fix the housing issue. I ask my friend from New \nYork, where was he last week when, as a member of the Finance \nCommittee, he voted out the underlying bill that does absolutely \nnothing to fix the housing issue? What got us into the economic \ndownturn we are in today is the housing crisis that got worse and worse \nand continues to get worse every day.\n  What they are now talking about doing from the Democratic side is \nproposing a housing fix next week, and the details of which are not \nknown by anybody. They are also saying that we need to spend $800 \nbillion, $900 billion, whatever the size of this bill is now, and we \nneed to spend the $500 or so billion dollars that Secretary Geithner is \ngoing to come for relative to TARP III, plus whatever hundreds of \nbillions of dollars are relative to the housing fix, plus the trillion \ndollars in the omnibus bill, which is laying out there, that we \nunderstand has already been approved and is going to be coming forward.\n  The American people ask one simple question: When is all of this \nspending going to stop? We have had many worthy amendments to this \nunderlying bill. I commend the majority leader for allowing both sides \nto bring forward amendments. The problem is, as these amendments have \ncome forward, the size of the bill has grown. That is the problem. The \nproblem is, we are now seeing both sides of the aisle come forward with \namendments that operate on a top-down basis, where we have the base \nbill that spent some $919 or $920 billion. The numbers are so \nastronomical we tend to forget, but it is right at $1 trillion. The \namendments are seeking to reduce that number. Rather than doing that, \nwhich is a poor way to do business, the McCain amendment is a \nsubstitute for that base bill. It is a bottom-up approach to try to fix \nthe crisis.\n  It does so with three simple components. First, the housing issue is \nwhat got us into this crisis. Unless we fix the housing issue, all of \nthis $1 trillion the folks on the other side of the aisle are proposing \nto spend will be spent for naught. In the McCain amendment, we directly \naddress the housing issue. The Isakson amendment is in there. There are \nother provisions relative to housing that are going to allow this \nmarket to turn itself around and the free market to operate. If we \nclear out this inventory of foreclosed homes as well as incentivize the \npurchase of other new homes, housing construction can begin once again.\n  Second, the McCain amendment is going to increase jobs. It is going \nto do so in a direct way. It will increase jobs by reducing the \ncorporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. There will be more \nmoney in the pockets of corporations so they can expand their \nbusinesses, which will automatically create jobs. Again, there is \nnothing in the underlying bill that directly focuses on increasing \njobs. The other thing from a tax standpoint in the McCain amendment, \nwhich is going to go toward stimulating the confidence of people as \nwell as the market itself, is the temporary elimination of payroll \ntaxes so that when every hard-working American gets their paycheck--\nwhether it is weekly, biweekly, or monthly--it will be bigger. They \nwill have more money in their pockets, which we know that they so \ndesperately need.\n  Thirdly, there is a compassionate part to this bill. There is a large \nnumber of Americans out there today who have lost their jobs through no \nfault of their own. They are hard-working men and women who were doing \na good job but, because of this crisis, they have lost their jobs. They \nneed help, and they are looking to the Federal Government. There is an \nextension of unemployment benefits in the McCain\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\namendment. That is the right thing to do.\n  Lastly, as we have talked about this bill, there is one issue that \nhas not been talked about, one issue that has not been mentioned by the \nfolks on the other side, and that is, here we are, once again, after \nraising the debt ceiling in recent months, once again we are seeing the \ndebt ceiling raised by almost a $1 trillion. What are we going to do \nnext week when the Treasury Secretary's proposal comes down on TARP III \nand on housing which the Senator from New York mentioned? What are we \ngoing to do when the Omnibus appropriations bill comes down, either \nbefore the break for President's Day or afterwards? Will we have to \nraise the debt ceiling once again?\n  I go back to the question I asked at the start, which I hear time and \ntime again from people in Georgia: Senator, when is the spending going \nto stop and there be some focus on trying to make sure we grow jobs as \nwell as fix the housing issue?\n  I urge passage of the McCain amendment and opposition to the \nunderlying bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 24 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 140\n\n  Madam President, I oppose the Feingold amendment which would require \nthat any allocation of funds in an appropriations bill have a prior \nauthorization. There is only one authorization bill that passes here, \nand that is the Defense authorization bill. There are no other \nauthorization bills that pass.\n  This amendment represents a massive shift of power to the executive \nbranch. It is not a transparency amendment. We did that last year. This \nis a shift-of-power amendment which should be defeated.\n  Under this amendment, while all earmarks identified in the \nPresident's budget could be funded in our appropriations bills without \nauthorization and not be subject to the proposed point of order, \ncongressional projects that are not authorized would require a \nsupermajority vote in order to be included in the legislation. This \nbecomes more extreme because that disparate treatment of Presidential \nand congressional projects even applies when a Senator seeks to offer \nan amendment subject to a rollcall vote during debate on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The President's budget each year includes many earmarks to direct \nspending for targeted projects. The President uses his budget to target \nFederal expenditures to local areas for projects he supports, most of \nwhich are not specifically authorized. Under this amendment, Congress \nwould have to meet a higher standard, a super majority in the Senate, \nin order to do the same thing.\n  This amendment clearly weakens Congress's power of the purse. The \nvast amount of funding levels for programs in appropriations bills are \nthe same as those in the President's budget. However, this amendment \nprovides that if an allocation of some of the program funding is \nrejected on point of order, the overall program funding amount will be \nreduced, although it is just as likely, and probably more likely, that \nCongress merely intended to have the relevant agency allocate that \nfunding, thereby keeping the overall funding amount the same instead of \nallocating it by congressional earmark. The amendment states over and \nover again that if the point of order is sustained, the unauthorized \nappropriations shall be stricken from the bill or amendment; and ``any \nmodification of total amounts appropriated necessary to reflect the \ndeletion of the matter struck from the bill or amendment shall be \nmade.''\n  For example, assume that $100 million is allocated in the President's \nbudget for a State assistance grant program, and an appropriations bill \nincludes a provision to direct that $2 million of this funding go to a \nspecific city or project. If the $2 million allocation is stricken, \nonly $98 million would remain, so even if it were the intent of \nCongress to provide $100 million for these grants, the funding would be \ndecreased.\n  The requirement for prior authorization means that Congress could \nonly allocate funds for projects if Congress were to take up every \nCongress authorization bills covering all Federal agencies and \nprograms. In the absence of such authorization bills, all \nappropriations initiated in Congress would be ``unauthorized \nappropriations'' subject to a point of order. Congress would be able to \nappropriate funding for programs and priorities proposed by the \nPresident, but Congress would not be able to fund congressional \nprograms or priorities that are not included in the President's budget, \nor even to shift funding between programs in the President's budget, \nbecause all such appropriations would be ``unauthorized.'' The result \nwould be a serious weakening of Congress's power of the purse.\n  At present, the only Senate committee that enacts an authorization \nbill every Congress is the Armed Services Committee, which I am \nprivileged to chair. So under this amendment, Congress would \nessentially severely weaken its power of the purse over all Federal \nagencies other than the Department of Defense.\n  It may be the intent of this amendment to force other Senate \ncommittees to go through the same process that the Armed Services \nCommittee goes through to enact an authorization bill every Congress. \nBut I want to warn my colleagues: this is not an easy process. The \nArmed Services Committee spends most of every year reviewing hundreds \nof programs and activities in the Defense budget on a line-by-line \nbasis. Subcommittee and full committee hearings and markups take weeks. \nOur bill then generally consumes about 2 weeks of Senate floor time. \nThere is nowhere near enough floor time available to enact every \nCongress the dozens of authorization bills that would be necessary to \nreplicate this authorization process for all of the civilian agencies.\n  Moreover, as currently written, this amendment would very likely \ncreate a point of order against congressionally initiated Defense \nappropriations, even if those appropriations are specifically \nauthorized in our bill. The reason is that the amendment provides that \nan appropriation is not considered to be authorized unless the \nauthorization has already been enacted into law or passed by the \nSenate. There has not been a case in recent memory in which our Defense \nauthorization bill has been enacted into law before the Senate took up \nthe Defense appropriations bill.\n  While the amendment makes an exception for authorizations that have \nalready passed the Senate, it makes no exception for authorizations \nthat have already passed the House. That means that a point of order \nwould lie against all House-initiated items, but none of the Senate \nfunding items, in a Defense appropriations bill. If the Senate were to \nsustain the point of order, we would be in the position of sending a \nbill back to the House which funded all of our priorities and none of \ntheirs--a bill that could not possibly be approved in the House.\n  The bottom line is that this amendment, if enacted, would make it \ndifficult for Congress not only to establish its own spending \npriorities with regard to the civilian agencies and programs that are \nnot subject to an annual authorization process, but even with regard to \nthe Defense agencies and programs that are subject to such a process. \nThis would include items on the unfunded priorities list submitted to \nCongress by the Joint Chiefs of Staff each year. This list, which in \nthe past has included items like MRAPs and body armor, reflects the \nhighest priorities of our uniformed military. Congress would place a \nmajor obstacle on itself from exercising the power of the purse, \nplacing itself in the position of approving or disapproving programs in \nthe President's budget without the power to establish its own \npriorities without a super majority.\n  In 2007, Congress passed meaningful ethics and lobbying reform which \nincluded strong earmark reform to ensure transparency in the process by \nproviding greater disclosure and requiring information on earmarks to \nbe available to the public online. These disclosures allow the public \nthe opportunity to know where their tax dollars are being spent and \nwill help ensure the quality of the projects which are funded.\n  The sponsors of this amendment have asserted that this amendment \nwould\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\nbuild on and strengthen those reforms. But this amendment goes way \nbeyond that and places extensive hurdles for congressionally directed \nspending. I don't believe that the executive branch has a monopoly on \nthe wisdom of spending Federal dollars. I believe that the elected \nrepresentatives of the people in Congress are often in a better \nposition to decide where the people's money is spent than the \nadministration's political appointees in Washington.\n  This is not a transparency amendment. We brought all earmarks into \nthe full light of day in 2007. This amendment attacks the very heart of \nCongress's constitutional power of the purse. I urge my colleagues to \nvote against this extreme and unworkable measure that would enhance the \nspending power of the President and weaken the congressional power of \nthe purse. It is not a transparency measure. It is an extreme power-\nshifting amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 364\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n364 offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the stimulus package would be a disaster \nfor our children and our grandchildren. According to CBO, it would \ncreate 1.3 million to 3.9 million jobs between now and the end of the \nyear 2010. That is a huge expenditure. It has fundamental policy \nchanges, and it is the biggest spending bill probably in the history of \nthis country.\n  We have legislation which creates jobs, which cuts taxes and spends \non infrastructure, more on Defense and the reset, and I believe that is \nthe best for this country.\n  Madam President, we all know we have to stimulate this economy and \ncreate jobs. The question is how you do it: profligacy versus, I \nbelieve, a mature and responsible approach to reversing and saving our \neconomy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, it goes without saying we are now living \nin extraordinary times. This country has not seen a recession as bad as \nthis--there are many people who have lost their jobs, as we have seen--\nsince the Great Depression. Extraordinary times require extraordinary \nactions.\n  It is true no one knows exactly the precise prescription, how to get \nthe economy back going again. But this underlying bill is certainly the \nbest efforts of some of the brightest people to try to find that \nsolution. Economists all say--all say--we need to do something like \nthis to get us going.\n  With the gap between the real economy and the potential economy \nalways about $1 trillion, if we do not pass this legislation, we will \nprobably lose another $1 trillion. The underlying bill is much better \nthan the alternative. The alternative is basically: Don't do it. If we \ndo not do it, gosh, the jobs lost--what you see now, as bad as it is, \nis just going to pale in comparison to what otherwise is going to \nhappen.\n  So I urge us to stick with the underlying bill, not adopt a \nsubstitute which has not been thought through, not aired, but, rather, \nlet's stick with the program we think is going to work.\n  Madam President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I move to waive the applicable portion \nof the Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Dorgan \namendment be temporarily set aside so the next vote will be on the \nFeingold-McCain amendment and Dorgan will be following that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 140\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this amendment establishes a new 60-\nvote point of order against unauthorized earmarks on appropriations \nbills and requires recipients of Federal funds to disclose their \nlobbying expenses. Opponents argue this point of order does nothing \nabout so-called Presidential earmarks or earmarks on authorizing bills. \nI am happy to consider a proposal targeting those things, but taxpayers \naren't going to buy the excuse that I voted against it because it \nwasn't tough enough.\n  Last year, President Obama said:\n\n       We can no longer accept the process that doles out earmarks \n     based on a Member of Congress's seniority rather than the \n     merit of the project. We can no longer accept an earmarks \n     process that has become so complicated to navigate the \n     municipality or nonprofit group has to hire high-priced D.C. \n     lobbyists.\n\n  My colleagues, if we want to do something about earmarks, vote for \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator's time has \nexpired. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, we should keep in mind that there are no \nearmarks in this bill before the Senate. Therefore, this amendment is \nnot relevant.\n  No. 2, we should keep in mind the Constitution gives the power of the \npurse to the Congress, and it is our job to use this power responsibly. \nWe have already put procedures in place to make the process transparent \nand to hold Members accountable for their spending decisions.\n  But most importantly, we should keep in mind that if an item has not \nbeen authorized by September 1, 2009, and it is moneys that had been \nappropriated, that money is taken out. Keep in mind that, as of this \nmoment, the Intelligence Committee has not had authorization bills for \nthe last 3 years.\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\nThe same goes for many other committees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand all time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 200 \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have cleared this amendment on both \nsides. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to substitute \namendment No. 138, as modified, requiring economic impact reports for \nmy amendment No. 200 for purposes of the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 138, as Modified, to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 138, as modified, \nbe called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 138, as modified, to amendment No. 98.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for reports on the use of funds made available \n    under this Act and the economic impact made by the expending or \n           obligation of such funds, and for other purposes)\n\n       Strike subtitle C of title XV of division A, and insert the \n     following:\n\n        Subtitle C--Reports of the Council of Economic Advisers\n\n     SEC. 1541.

Such comments shall be due \n     within 7 days after such reports are submitted.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator \nInouye and Senator Cochran. It is a simple amendment. A voice vote will \nbe satisfactory. I think it has been cleared on both sides.\n  It simply asks for reports about who is receiving this money we put \nout in an economic recovery program. Did you receive the money? How did \nyou use the money? And how many jobs do you believe were created with \nthe money? I hope the full Senate will agree with those objectives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. We accept this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, has amendment No. 200 been withdrawn?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 200 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I ask for a vote on amendment No. 138, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n138, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 138), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 354\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on Dodd amendment No. 354.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I may not need the full minute. This is the \namendment dealing with executive compensation. There are a number of \nproposals. This is one that would set some limits, basically allowing \nfor some reaching back if, in fact, TARP businesses are found to have \nviolated\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\nvarious provisions of law. It would allow the Secretary to negotiate \nresources to come back if there has been excessive compensation.\n  I say to my colleagues, our colleague Senator Vitter in the Banking \nCommittee made a point I wish to repeat. This is not the single most \nimportant issue. In fact, it could be trivialized. We all appreciate \nwhen we talk to our constituents about the TARP program, many of our \nconstituents are so angry with what they see in executive compensation, \nit is difficult to have a conversation about the larger questions. We \nare trying to deal with this issue in a thoughtful way that does not \nimpinge upon their ability to compensate people, but simultaneously we \nare not reading about compensation going to executives where billions \nof dollars have gone to those companies abusively.\n  This amendment is to deal with that particular problem. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have no opposition to the amendment and \nagain recommend its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 354.\n  The amendment (No. 354) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 189\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the previous order, the next \namendment is DeMint amendment No. 189.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, are we considering the DeMint amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I encourage all my colleagues to listen \nfor a moment. This is a very simple amendment that strikes some \nlanguage that should not be in this massive spending bill. It is \nlanguage that discriminates against religious freedom on college \ncampuses.\n  Right now in the bill, any college campus that uses these funds to \nrenovate a student center, a dorm, an auditorium, cannot allow prayer, \nany religious activity, or worship. This is not language that should be \nin this bill. This is an issue that has been decided by the courts.\n  Arbitrary language is going to create doubt and risk and liability \nwhich will put a chilling effect on religious freedom on campuses.\n  The only thing most of us need to know is that the ACLU opposes this \namendment. Any freedom-loving American should know they should vote for \nthis amendment if it is opposed by the ACLU.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the provision in the bill states that \nFederal funds cannot be used to support facilities in which a \nsubstantial portion of the functions of the building are involved in a \nreligious mission.\n  I say to the Senator from South Carolina, this language has been in \nthe law for 40 years. It is the result of three Supreme Court \ndecisions.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, I won't. It was signed into law in the Higher \nEducation Reauthorization Act signed by President Ronald Reagan, \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush, and President George W. Bush.\n  The DeMint amendment is opposed by the Jesuit universities. We have \nstruck a balance here helping religious schools on buildings that are \nnot primarily for religious functions. We will continue doing that and \ncontinue honoring our Constitution's establishment clause.\n  I hope everyone will support me in opposing the DeMint amendment and \nstand by the language that has been time tested and approved by the \nSupreme Court in three separate decisions.\n  Mr. DeMINT.

That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 338--Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I still believe we need a strong auto \nindustry in this country. I think the best way to do that is to get \npeople to buy cars. The best way to do that is to give low-income and \nmoderate-income individuals and families the wherewithal to buy those \ncars. That is what this amendment was about.\n  However, I must say, in the current desire to reduce the size of the \nbill, I am going to ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment, \nbut it will come back at some time in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n353, offered by Senator Ensign.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the chairman of the Finance Committee mind if I go \nsecond so I can answer any of the charges that may come out?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would rather the proponent go first.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I would rather the chairman of the Finance Committee go \nfirst.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield my time to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My colleagues, it is a great idea to help with housing. \nListen to what the amendment of my friend from Nevada does. It costs \nbetween $300 billion and $1 trillion. Second, it applies to people of \nany income. Do you want to have the Federal Government spend its money \nto give a multimillionaire a break on their mortgage? Third, the banks \ntake a cut. Every time there is a refinancing, there are points. If we \nwant to give people money, don't let the banks take a cut. Fourth, it \ndoes nothing about the housing market because, A, most of it will go to \nrefinancing--people who are in a home stay in the home--B, the people \nwho really need help do not qualify because they do not get Fannie, \nFreddie, or FHA.\n  It doesn't help housing, it costs a fortune, it helps the banks, and \nit is one of the most expensive things before us. If you are a fiscal \nconservative, there is no way you can vote for this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, that is absolutely incorrect. The mortgage \ninterest we target is between 4 and 4.5 percent. Right now in the \nmarket, it would be between 4 and 4.5 percent. We capped the program at \n$300 billion. It is impossible to do what the Senator from New York \nsaid because we put a cap on it. It could cost no more than that. The \nTreasury cannot authorize any more than that.\n  Regarding the second untruth he just spoke--this amendment is not \njust for millionaires. These are for homes that are not above the \nconforming loan limit, so it is no home over $729,000. Only homes under \nthat would qualify for it.\n  We have over 600 organizations that build homes in this country--\nplumbers, cabinetmakers, homebuilders, and everything else--that \nsupport this amendment. This amendment will get the housing industry \ngoing in the country.\n  And it is not just about lowering interest rates--another untruth \nsaid by the Senator from New York. We also do foreclosure mitigation \nbecause we help modify loans for those homes that are underwater right \nnow. There are tax credits for businesses to get the economy going. We \nfix housing first, and then we get the economy going.\n  I urge a ``yea'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if Senator Ensign prevails on his \namendment, I will seek to further amend his amendment. I would offer \nthe Grassley amendment patch amendment. The amendment would be in \nidentical form to my amendment adopted in the Finance Committee markup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Nevada has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 302(f) of the Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I move to waive the applicable provisions with respect to \nmy amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing \nto the motion. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

On this vote, the yeas are 35, the nays are \n62. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having not voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the vote has been reported?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for all Members, everyone should be advised \nwe are going to be working late tonight. We have a lot of work to do. \nWe are going to work to get a solution. We are going to work within the \nbroad outline that President Obama has given us, a program that has the \nwide support of the American people.\n  If necessary, we are going to work through the night. I repeat, we \nare going to work until we get it done. There are a number of Senators \nworking in good faith to try to come up with a proposal that will pick \nup a number of Republican votes. There are a number of Republicans \nworking in that group--I do not know how many but as many as eight \nRepublican Senators--trying to come up with a proposal they believe \nwould improve this legislation.\n  As I have indicated to each of those Senators individually, we would \nbe happy to take a look at this. If it is in keeping with what I \nbelieve everyone is trying to do; that is, to improve this legislation, \nof course we will take a look at it, and we will take a good positive \nlook at it.\n  This legislation is very important. The reason we need to work \nthrough the night is, I cannot imagine what would happen to the \nfinancial markets tomorrow if it was reported that this bill would go \ndown. This bill is not only important to our great country, it is \nimportant to the world. We are the largest economic machine in the \nworld by far.\n  People a lot of times refer to Japan and the trouble they had in the \n1990s. But, remember, their economy, even though theirs is the second \nlargest economy in the world, it is a very small economy relatively \nspeaking compared to ours. So around the world, everyone is looking at \nwhat we are going to do tonight.\n  I want to make sure everyone understands that everyone is working in \ngood faith. This is a very large piece of legislation. I understand why \npeople would want to change it, and certainly we are in the process of \ntrying to do that with these multitude of amendments that have been \noffered.\n  We will finish this. We have about four votes left in this tranche. \nThen we will move on to others. On the Democratic side, we have more \namendments lined up. I am sure the Republicans have more lined up on \ntheir side. But I would hope everyone would work in good faith to move \nforward on this legislation.\n  If at the end of the day people cannot vote for it, that is a \ndecision people will have to make. But I want everyone\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\nwithin the sound of my voice to understand that what we do here is \nextremely important not only to the people in Las Vegas, Reno, and \nNevada but all over this country and the financial capitals of the \nworld.\n  The small towns all around the world are looking to see what we do. \nIt is not a pleasant picture to think what would happen if this \nlegislation, which was put together--I have used the term before--in \ngood faith by President Obama and his people, is, in effect, turned \ndown.\n  Now, we have never said you have to rubberstamp what we have done. \nThat is why we started on Monday a process of amending this \nlegislation. A lot of amendments have been offered. A lot of them have \nnot been accepted or approved, but a number of them have. A couple of \nthem that were approved I really did not like very much. But this is \nwhat the legislative process is about. Legislation is the art of \ncompromise, consensus building. That is where we are. So it is 6:15 \ntonight. I would hope in the next 12 hours we can have a piece of \nlegislation that we can feel good about after having worked on it for \nthese many hours that we have.\n  I failed to say one thing. I extend my apologies to my friend. One of \nthe things I wanted to say is, Senator McConnell, the Republican \nleader, has been very open with me. We have had a number of meetings \nduring today. He has been very understanding of some of the problems I \nhave. I am understanding of some of the problems he has.\n  I want the Record to reflect he has been very cooperative. I \nappreciate that very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add briefly, it strikes me that \none of the core problems in spite of the new President's popularity \nwith Americans is, there is a growing discontent among the public, as \nillustrated by the Gallup poll, which 4 or 5 days ago indicated roughly \n53 percent of Americans thought this particular proposal was a good \nidea, and it is now down to 38 percent a mere 5 or 6 days later.\n  The American people have serious questions about the composition of \nthis package. I think virtually everybody on our side of the aisle \nbelieves that some action by the Government is necessary. We have heard \nfrom a lot of economists who are thought of as conservative economists \nwho think that action is necessary.\n  The question is not doing nothing versus doing something. The \nquestion is the appropriateness of an almost trillion dollar spending \nbill to address the problem. I agree with the majority leader. We ought \nto continue talking. Hopefully, there is a way to restart the process \nin a way that would be more fundamentally bipartisan in nature. We hope \nthat conclusion can be reached in a positive way for the American \npeople sometime in the near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am probably different than most every \nSenator. I wish we could outlaw polls. I think they are one of the \nthings that hurt the body politic. I don't believe in them. I don't \nwatch what they say. I don't care about them. But I can read them. We \nwere all present at a meeting yesterday where in-depth polling has been \ndone on this. The polling for President Obama's package, as of \nyesterday, was approved by nearly 70 percent of the American people. I \ndon't know what the Gallup poll is, but it should underscore what I \nsaid about polls. Everybody forget about the polls. Forget about them. \nDo what we think is good for the American people based on what we are \nhearing from constituents, constituents rich and poor, big businesses \nand small businesses. If we listen to them, we have to come forward \nwith a robust package in keeping with the needs of the country.\n  I appreciate the comments of my friend, the Republican leader. We are \nall working to do the best we can. We have some disagreement as to what \nthe right thing to do is. I hope we will not be determining what we do \nbased on a poll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know we would all rather be voting than talking. \nRepublicans are no less interested in doing the right thing for the \ncountry than Democrats are. I don't question the motives of our friends \non the other side of the aisle, and I know they don't question ours. We \nhave some serious differences about what we ought to do. Those \ndiscussions have been ongoing, and we will continue them throughout the \nevening and maybe well into the weekend until we get some kind of \nconsensus about what is the most appropriate thing to do to help jump-\nstart our ailing economy.\n  Mr. REID. I have stated clearly and unequivocally that I believe \nthose eight Republicans who are--I think that is the number; I haven't \nbeen in on the meetings--working very hard to try to come up with an \nalternate proposal, I appreciate that. Does that mean the other 33 \nRepublican Senators aren't working in good faith? Of course they are. \nBut I very much appreciate those Republicans who are openly trying to \ncome up with something different. All of us are trying to do the right \nthing for the American people. There isn't a single Senator who has \ncome to this floor who hasn't said that this economy is in deep trouble \nand we have to do something to fix it. My comment was, I hope we can do \nthat. That is the reason I have said we have to work through the night. \nBecause if we don't and the Friday financial markets look at us not \nhaving been able to accomplish anything, it is a bad day not only for \nAmerica but the rest of the world.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 236, As Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 197 offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, with my amendment we get more with less, \nmore job creation at less cost. What this amendment would do is \nsubstitute the underlying bill with an amendment that consists \nprimarily of tax relief for families and small businesses. Specifically \nthe legislation would provide $444 billion of tax relief, more than the \ntax relief contained in the Senate stimulus bill. It provides $34 \nbillion in spending which is $598 billion less than the underlying \nbill. According to the economic models developed by the President's \neconomic advisers, this proposal would create twice as many jobs for \nhalf the cost. It would create 6.2 million new jobs at $480 billion, \ncompared to the 3 million or so which, with the latest from CBO, may be \na lot less than that under the Democratic proposal. I urge support for \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. It is more for \nless--more tax breaks for upper income Americans, less tax breaks, in \nfact, no tax breaks for low-income Americans; 49 million Americans will \nget no tax benefit under this amendment, and 49 million Americans do \nget some tax benefits from the underlying bill. It eliminates the rest \nof the substitute--nothing for energy, nothing for education and the \nother parts of the bill. I urge rejection of the amendment.\n  I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section \n311(a)(2)(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable provisions \nunder the Budget Act with respect to my amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 363, as Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n363, as modified, offered by the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, just for the information of all Senators, \nthese are two amendments that are paired: the Boxer amendment, which \nthe Chair just stated, and also the Barrasso amendment No. 326. It is \nour understanding those two amendments will both be voice-voted. \nSenator Boxer will speak about her amendment, and Senator Barrasso will \nspeak about his. But the thought is, these are two paired amendments on \nroughly the same subject. We hope to have a voice vote on each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I think I can explain this \namendment in 2 minutes, and then we can take a voice vote.\n  I thank Senator Barrasso. He and I have a little different view on \nthe importance of the National Environmental Policy Act in relation to \nthis bill. Late last night he offered an amendment to essentially \npretty much waive the protections of that act from this bill. Needless \nto say, as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nI was concerned about the amendment. He and I have had extensive \ndiscussions, along with our staff, and we have reached an agreement on \nthe way to proceed tonight.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to begin by carrying that out by \nsending a modification of my amendment to the desk that Senator \nBarrasso has approved. So if I might do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 363), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place:\n\n\n                                findings\n\n       1. The National Environmental Policy Act protects public \n     health, safety and environmental quality: by ensuring \n     transparency, accountability and public involvement in \n     federal actions and in the use of public funds;\n       2. When President Nixon signed the National Environmental \n     Policy Act into law on January 1, 1970, he said that the Act \n     provided the ``direction'' for the country to ``regain a \n     productive harmony between man and nature'';\n       3. The National Environmental Policy Act helps to provide \n     an orderly process for considering federal actions and \n     funding decisions and prevents ligation and delay that would \n     otherwise be inevitable and existed prior to the \n     establishment of the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\n\n                               Section 1\n\n       1. Adequate resources within this bill must be devoted to \n     ensuring that applicable environmental reviews under the \n     National Environmental Policy Act are completed on an \n     expeditious basis and that the shortest existing applicable \n     process under the National Environmental Policy Act shall be \n     utilized.\n       2. The President shall report to the Senate Environment and \n     Public Works Committee and the House Natural Resources \n     Committee every 90 days until September 30, 2011, following \n     the date of enactment on the status and progress of projects \n     and activities funded by this act with respect to compliance \n     with National Environmental Policy Act requirements and \n     documentation.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. I also thank--in addition to Senator Barrasso for \nworking with me on drawing this up, I\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\nwould say, perfecting this amendment--a lot of the groups out there who \nhave been very worried and working and calling all my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \nminute, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the list of these organizations, from the League of \nConservation Voters to the American Lands Alliance; and there is even a \ngroup from Alaska that got involved.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Tiernan Sittenfeld; Legislative Director; League of \n     Conservation Voters; tiernan_sittenfeld@lcv.org.\n       Marty Hayden; Vice President, Policy and Legislation \n     Earthjustice; mhayden@earthjustice.org.\n       Pamela A.

I conclude by saying what I do in this amendment is to \nsay that adequate resources within this bill must be devoted to \nensuring that the applicable environmental reviews under NEPA are \ncompleted on an expeditious basis, and that we require a report every \n90 days just to make sure these projects are moving forward with the \nprotections of NEPA but no undue delays.\n  So with that, I would ask for a voice vote, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 363), as further modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 326\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 326, offered by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I appreciate the modifications of the \namendment by Senator Boxer. The Boxer amendment rightly states that we \nshould try to expedite NEPA. I appreciate the improvements she has made \nto that.\n  My amendment, which I urge Members to support, is amendment No. 326, \noffered by Senators Enzi and Vitter and Crapo and Risch and Bennett and \nRoberts as well as myself. The amendment is a practical, moderate \nsolution to a real problem, as every school, road, bridge or dam funded \nunder this bill will require compliance with the National Environmental \nPolicy Act.\n  The Congressional Budget Office and countless business leaders agree \nwe must address NEPA in this legislation. My amendment would not waive \nNEPA, it would only require that it be completed in 9 months. I \nappreciate Senator Boxer's efforts to do this in an expeditious way. \nThis amendment goes further and says 9 months. If projects are truly \nshovel ready, this should be no problem.\n  This amendment prevents bureaucratic delays and will put people to \nwork. I am asking my colleagues to vote in favor of amendment No. 326 \nand I would appreciate a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 326) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As clarification, the Boxer amendment that was \nagreed to was as further modified.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 176 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside to call up amendment No. 176.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 176.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require the use of competitive procedures to award \n  contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements funded under this Act)\n\n       On page 431, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n              prohibition on no-bid contracts and earmarks\n\n       Sec. 1607.  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to make any payment in \n     connection with a contract unless the contract is awarded \n     using competitive procedures in accordance with the \n     requirements of section 303 of the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253), section \n     2304 of title 10, United States Code, and the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, none \n     of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this \n     Act may be awarded by grant or cooperative agreement unless \n     the process used to award such grant or cooperative agreement \n     uses competitive procedures to select the grantee or award \n     recipient.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a straightforward amendment. What \nthis amendment says is that all the money we are going to spend in this \nbill, the American taxpayers are going to get value.\n  I am not going to win the debate on this bill. We are going to spend \nsomewhere between $750 billion and $1 trillion, but the one thing we \nought to be able to assure the American people is that when we go to \nspend the money, they are going to get value for it. This is an \namendment that says there will be competitive bidding on all the \ncontracts, all the agreements so we get real value. As malodorous as \nthis bill is in terms of the spending that is not going to produce the \nfirst job, the one thing we ought to make sure of is that the American \ntaxpayer is protected.\n  What we know from 40 hearings in the Federal Financial Management \nSubcommittee is the biggest problem we have in the Government today, \nbesides waste, fraud, and abuse, is the fact that many of the \nGovernment contracts, in violation of Federal law, are never \ncompetitively bid. That does a couple things. One is it puts people who \nare connected to the Government in line to get a contract that is not \nnecessarily the best value for our country. Whether that is lobbying \nhere or lobbying at the executive branch, what we know is that at least \n$50 billion a year right now is wasted because we don't do competitive \nbidding.\n  All this amendment says is that if you are going to spend the money, \nif it is greater than $25,000--which is what President Obama has asked \nus to do--you competitively bid it. You don't play favorites; you make \nsure we get great value.\n  So my hope is nobody can find a fault with this agreement and this \namendment that would say in common sense:\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\nEverybody out there who is in business who is going to do something \nsuch as that, spend any significant amount of money, is going to get \nvalue for what they pay on their money. Every household is going to try \nto do that as they try to make decisions on how they spend money. So as \nwe spend $900 billion on the items that can be let for contract, we \nought to insist that there is competitive bidding.\n  What do we know right now in the Federal Government as far as waste \nwhere we have not competitively bid? Here is what we know. We spend as \na government $64 billion a year on IT contracts--on IT contracts. The \nvast majority are not competitively bid. Some people may say: Well, \nthat is no problem. Well, when you hear that 40 billion of them are in \ntrouble, way outside the cost that we thought things were going to \ncost, what we see is the American taxpayer doesn't get any value when \nit comes to IT purchasing in the Federal Government. Whether that is \nthe Pentagon, whether it is Homeland Security, whether it is the Small \nBusiness Administration, whether it is the Department of Energy, we get \nno value because 50 percent of the money we spend on IT ultimately gets \nwasted because we don't competitively contract it and competitively bid \nit.\n  Out of this $900 billion, there is somewhere around $400 billion of \nthat which can, at one point or another, be competitively bid. To not \ncompetitively bid it says, first of all, we are not going to be able to \nspend it to create as many jobs as we would like if, in fact, we don't \nget value when we competitively bid it. So my hope is the chairman will \nconsider this amendment take it under advisement. I would also relate \nthat even in spite of the fact that sections 303 of the Federal \nProperty and Administrative Act, 10 U.S. Code 2304 all require it, the \nFederal Government doesn't do it. Last year, in the Consolidated \nFederal Funds Report, the Federal agencies issued $1.2 trillion in \nfinancial assistance in 2008.\n  Mr. President, $400 billion of that was in grants, so that means \ngrants need to be competitively bid; $453 billion in contracts and $22 \nbillion in direct loans. A large portion of that was never \ncompetitively bid.\n  I will shorten the time I spend on this amendment. I ask for its \nconsideration, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 359\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be set aside so that I may call up amendment No. \n359.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Udall] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 359.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To expand the number of veterans eligible for the employment \n                  tax credit for unemployed veterans)\n\n       On page 485, strike lines 23 through 26, and insert the \n     following:\n\n       (I) having been discharged or released from active duty in \n     the Armed Forces during the period beginning on September 1, \n     2001, and ending on December 31, 2010, and\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, as I rise today, our Nation \nis in the midst of a deep recession. Families across America are losing \ntheir homes and business owners are being forced to close doors. In my \nhome State of New Mexico, local workforce solutions offices are \nbesieged with calls from people who need help. Customer service centers \nare cutting jobs and parents can't pay for their kids' school lunches.\n  Our responsibility is to act, and we must do so with the \naccountability and oversight the American taxpayers deserve.\n  For months, I have been advocating for an economic recovery package \nthat puts the American people first, one that is carefully targeted to \ncreate jobs and stabilize our economy by making the long-term \ninvestments economists have said we need now. For years we have \nneglected to make the needed investments in energy and in conservation, \ninfrastructure, health care, and so much more. Today we have the \nopportunity to change course. We have the opportunity to make these \nnecessary investments and help shore up our economy at the same time.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Inouye and Chairman Baucus for their hard \nwork in bringing this bill before us.\n  Make no mistake, the package we have before us is not perfect. There \nare many improvements that, after all the hours of work and all the \nhours of debate, could make it better. I rise to bring forth one more \nimprovement we can make now.\n  Today I am offering an amendment which both helps address our current \neconomic crisis and takes care of the very individuals who have been \nfighting for us: our veterans. My amendment, which I am proud to be \njoined in offering by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu, will help ensure that our veterans returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan are remembered as we push for job creation in our country.\n  The current language in the substitute amendment provides a tax \nincentive to employers hiring veterans who have been discharged from \nthe armed services in 2008, 2009, and 2010. I strongly applaud this \namendment and thank Chairman Baucus for his leadership on this issue. \nHowever, the numbers show veterans discharged before the years included \nin the underlying language are also struggling to find employment. In \nfact, in September 2007, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that of \nthose veterans who served in our military since September 2001, 6.1 \npercent were unemployed. As we know too well, since the study was \ncompleted in September of 2007, the economy has only worsened.\n  Therefore, I offer this amendment to expand the tax incentive to \nemployers to include veterans discharged from the armed services \nbetween September 2001 and December 2010, including veterans of \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Those soldiers \nleaving the military after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, serving \nwith great distinction and honor, are finding themselves back in a \nshrinking workforce. Yet we know from study after study that these men \nand women have substantial capabilities in technology, mathematics, \nmanagement, crisis response, and so many other areas that are critical \nto employers. Expanding the tax incentive to cover employers who hire \nany veteran who has served since September 11 will help ensure that we \ndo not leave these veterans out of our recovery package. It ensures \nthat employers are encouraged to hire these men and women and put them \nback to work for our Nation.\n  The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America are strongly supportive \nof this expansion. I urge my colleagues to join me in adopting it \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is Senator Coburn's time or another Republican \namendment. Senator Coburn should be recognized; then Senator Sanders \nafter that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 309\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the chairman \nfor his kindness. I agree we should be going back and forth.\n  Whatever we do with this bill, we ought to determine what is most \nimportant and what is least important. When we take $900 billion and \nare about to spend it, we ought to do that in a way that again promotes \nvalue. We as a body oftentimes are resistant to make hard choices; I \nknow that, but every family out there in our country today is making \nhard choices.\n  I found it peculiar, when this bill came to the floor, that it didn't \ninclude a prohibition that was in the House bill. Somewhat strange. \nWhat was in the House bill, which was passed by the House and agreed to \nby the House, was a prohibition on any funding to pay for aquariums, \nzoos, golf courses, swimming pools, stadiums, parks, theaters,\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\nart centers or highway beautification projects. Somehow, strangely, it \nwas left out of the Senate bill.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside to \ncall up my amendment No. 309.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 309.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that taxpayer money is not lost on wasteful and \n                       non-stimulative projects)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMIT ON FUNDS.\n\n       None of the amounts appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used for any casino or other \n     gambling establishment, aquarium, zoo, golf course, swimming \n     pool, stadium, community park, museum, theater, art center, \n     and highway beautification project.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. What this amendment does is it prohibits stimulus funding \nto pay for casinos, museums, aquariums, zoos, golf courses, swimming \npools, stadiums, parks, theaters, art centers or highway beautification \nprojects. I am not necessarily against those, but if we are going to \nspend money, we ought to spend money on the highest priority things \nfirst, not the finer things that we can't afford.\n  We cannot afford to spend a penny on a museum right now with the \ntrouble we are in. We cannot afford to spend a penny on a golf course \nwith the trouble we are in. We cannot afford to spend a penny on \ntheaters or art centers or highway beautification. Those are not a \npriority. Plus, most of those won't generate near the jobs as if we \nwere spending it on something more substantive. There are billions of \ndollars in this bill for various grant programs for State and local \ngovernments, for supposedly local shovel-ready projects. How do we know \nthat? Because the U.S. Conference of Mayors has a wish list of shovel-\nready spending projects entitled Main Street Recovery Ready-to-Go \nInfrastructure Report. It includes billions in questionable and \nwasteful projects that should never be funded by the taxpayers, even if \nwe had extra money--which we don't--and certainly should not be funded \nat this time, with the limited dollars we have and the way we are \nfunding. We are not borrowing--no, we are stealing this money from our \ngrandkids.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr COBURN. I will.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, let me ask my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from Oklahoma this. We all know we have to address the \nproblems we face in our economy. It is becoming a crisis. The majority \nleader said that, the minority leader said that, and everybody who has \noffered an amendment has said that. But it seems to me we have \nfundamental differences with the President of the United States, who \ncalled some of our concerns picayunish in an op-ed in the Washington \nPost, and with our colleagues across the aisle, as to what constitutes \nan effective stimulus. The Senator from Oklahoma is introducing an \namendment that I wish more Members could listen to--and they should \nbecause it would be in their best interest.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is offering an amendment that introduces an \noverdue criteria not only regarding whether the mayors' wishlist, and \nthe programs he is going to enunciate, fit the role of a stimulus, but \npublic outrage? These are the kinds of things that become fodder on \nlate night talk shows, and we could do that--we could sort of do a late \nnight talk show. We could go back and forth and he would mention a \nproject and I would say: Do you mean there is money going for that? But \nI will skip all that and congratulate the Senator regarding his \namendment.\n  Can the economy be best revitalized through a massive and \nunprecedented increase in Government spending? Or is it better to \npursue progrowth policies that put money more directly into the pockets \nof families and businesses?\n  There is no question, I can answer that. Putting money back in the \npockets of American families and businesses stimulates the economy. \nWhen they have additional money in their pockets, they can use that \nmoney as they see fit--to save, to purchase a home or a car, to make an \ninvestment or hire workers. So I think what the Senator from Oklahoma \nis trying to do--I know what he is trying to do and what I am trying to \ndo in asking him to yield, which is to urge my colleagues to take a \nhard look, please, at the spending in this bill. We have already asked \nyou to do that. There have been many amendments to do that. Ask \nyourselves: Is this stimulative? Do the programs in this bill truly \npromote economic stimulus? Do they create jobs? Do they put meaningful \ndollars directly in the pockets of families and businesses to encourage \nthe economic growth of our country, or does the bill simply spread the \nmoney around to many Federal programs, or Members' requests, in the \nhope that such spending will solve our economic problems?\n  If we cannot honestly demonstrate the stimulative effect of the \nprograms in the bill, then it is clear to me that taxpayer dollars \nwould be best spent elsewhere or, better yet, returned to the \ntaxpayers.\n  With all due respect to President Obama, in the article he wrote for \nthe Washington Post, the op-ed, these matters are not picayunish--they \nare not.\n  The economic stimulus mantra from last year--targeted, temporary, and \ntimely--which should also apply to this year's effort, seems no longer \nto be the drumbeat of the majority. I don't know if the Senator is \naware, but one estimate is that this bill would cost $2,700 for every \nman, woman, and child in the United States. While this bill is touted \nas creating or conserving jobs, some of the costs of the proposed job \ncreation in the bill are truly astounding, not picayunish.\n  A program at the State Department would create 388 jobs at a cost of \n$524 million. There are others that create jobs that would cost \n$480,000 per job and $333,000 per job. I know the Senator from Oklahoma \nis interested in that because that is the very kind of thing he likes \nto bring up to make us adhere to our job responsibilities.\n  I know Oklahomans are outraged, and I know Kansans are outraged at \nthis reckless spending, when the vast majority of them live within \ntheir means, pay their bills, and make their mortgage payments on time. \nWhere is their benefit under this bill? Where is their $333,000 or \n$480,000 job?\n  Many constituents who have contacted me have said, ``Just send me a \ncheck.'' They are very concerned that their tax dollars are not being \nused wisely here and that this bill won't get the job done. That is \nwhat the Senator from Oklahoma is trying to accomplish.\n  The bill is not targeted. The appropriation portion of the bill \nspends taxpayer dollars on everything from smoking cessation programs, \nall-terrain vehicle trails, and $600 million to buy new cars for new \nGovernment employees.\n  Again, these matters are not picayunish. As the spending in this bill \ngrows, it has become a honey pot for every conceivable special interest \ngroup in this unprecedented environment of national crisis. I am \nconcerned that we are well on our way to federalizing State and local \ngovernments, as many elected officials are setting up what I call \n``bucket commissions.'' Our Governor in Kansas is doing that, and \nothers are as well. I know we have problems in Kansas, and I know they \nhave problems in Ohio, and I know they have problems in Oklahoma. But \nthey are coming to Washington to fill these buckets. People have \nactually lobbied for and want the projects the Senator from Oklahoma is \ntalking about. If you want a new county jail, don't pass a bond issue; \nask for it in the stimulus. If you want a Frisbee park--I am not making \nthat up--don't ask local taxpayers to foot the bill; ask for it in the \nstimulus.\n  With this Federal honey pot and the lure that is now out there to \ncome to Washington and make funding requests--and some requests do have \nmerit; I won't quarrel with that. But this is not the right time or \nplace for them. Another danger here is that Federal money too often \nbecomes Federal control--Federal intervention further into the daily \nlives of Americans. You hear a lot about that back home.\n\n[[Page S1668]]\n\n  To all of those who hear the siren song lure of coming to Washington \nand obtaining free stimulus money, with apologies to Homer:\n\n     Circe warned all those lured by the siren songs and to too \n           many who ignored the warning and ended up on rocky \n           shoals:\n     Once he hears to his heart's content, sails on a wiser man.\n     Like as Vlisses wandering men,\n     In red seas [or in the case of this stimulus, red ink] as \n           they pass along.\n     Did stoppe their ears with wax as then,\n     Against the suttle Mermayds [or shall we say Senator's \n           stimulus song.]\n     So shall their crafty filled talk,\n     Here after find no listing ear.\n     Like Circe, I byde them go back and walk,\n     And spend their words some other where.\n\n  Again, with apologies to Homer, with this siren stimulus song that we \nsing, those attracted by the lure will bring themselves and all \ntaxpayers to rocky shoals.\n\n  We are currently in the throes of February cold, with only \nValentine's Day as a respite. This bill will have its first effect \namidst the winds of March. Those projects that my distinguished friend \nfrom Oklahoma is trying to bring to the attention of the Senate will \ncome true in the winds of March. My colleagues and taxpayers all, \nbeware of the Ides of March. Under this massive spending bill, the \ntaxpayer will become Caesar and the Government will become Brutus. ``Et \ntu, Senator Brutus''--a role no Senator should wish to play.\n  While some funding requests may be worthy of Federal dollars, such \ndecisions should be made as part of the annual appropriations debate, \nrather than circumventing that important process by adding funding to a \nbill that is intended to provide short-term stimulus to the economy.\n  This bill is not timely, I say to my friend from Oklahoma. CBO \nestimates that only 15 percent of this stimulus package will be spent \nin 2009, and only another 37 percent spent in 2010. The remaining part \nwill be spent in 2011 and beyond. That means that less than half of the \nmoney will be spent by the end of next year. This is not the immediate \nrelief families and businesses desperately need now to help get the \neconomy back on track. Rather than looking at more Federal spending and \nprograms to fix our economy, we have tried to redirect this spending to \ntax relief. We need to return to families more of their hard-earned \ndollars and allow businesses to keep more of the money they earn, so \nthey can reinvest and grow their businesses. This is particularly true \nof small business. Unfortunately, only $21 billion, or 3 percent of \nthis bill, goes to small business. I know the Senator from Oklahoma \ncertainly cares about small businesses. They are the Nation's job \ncreators. How can we call this an economic stimulus bill, when only a \nfraction of this bill is going to help small businesses?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I forgot what the question was.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. We had seven questions, and I am going to have one, and \nthen I will cease and desist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor. He \nyielded for a question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am trying to find a fair way to go back \nand forth here.\n  Mr. COBURN. Does the Senator have another question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Yes, I do. We have had before us--and more to come, I \nthink--well-thought-out alternatives to meet the commonsense test. As I \nsaid before, we have had amendments to strip out billions in spending \nin the bill that will not stimulate the economy. It is my understanding \nthat the Senator's amendment deals with smaller programs and, as I have \nindicated, the public reaction to these programs and these relative to \nthe stimulus package are unbelievable, is that not true?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is true.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. We have and will have amendments to provide permanent \ntax relief for middle-income taxpayers. Is anything in there having to \ndo with that?\n  Mr. COBURN. No.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Basically, we have considered amendments to address the \nproblems in the housing market, to fix housing first. Does anything on \nthat list have anything to do with fixing the housing market?\n  Mr. COBURN. No.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. These suggestions would improve this bill. Can we \nimprove it, I ask the Senator from Oklahoma, to provide the right \nincentives to stimulate the economy and create private sector jobs?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Let us beware of the Ides of March and the siren songs \nof the stimulus, I say to the Senator from Oklahoma. I thank him for \ndoing an outstanding job to warn the majority of the sand trap they are \ngetting into with these projects. Would the Senator not agree?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yielded for a question. The \nSenator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank my fine friend from Kansas for \nthose questions.\n  As I was saying before I was interrupted for a question, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors has a wish list. I would do the same thing. But I \nwant my colleagues to hear what is going across the legislatures of all \nthe States right now: How much of this money can we get so we don't \nhave to do the hard job in our legislature right now to make cuts we \nneed to make? How much of this money can we get?\n  They just happened to have 31,000 requests totaling $73.2 billion. I \nthought the American people would like to hear what some of them are \nbecause I guarantee you, we will fund them. We are going to fund them. \nIf this bill passes, we are going to fund them unless we accept this \namendment.\n  How about $192.6 million for 12 projects directed to stadiums, \nincluding $150 million for a Metromover extension to Marlin Stadium in \nMiami, FL, where their average attendance is less than 45 percent, less \nthan 16,000 fans? Is that a priority for the country right now? It is \nnot a priority. Unless we agree to this amendment, that kind of stuff \nis going to get funded.\n  How about $87 million for 56 projects on paths? Right now, when we \nare stealing $1 trillion from our grandchildren, is it a priority for \nthis country to build bicycle paths? Tell me that is a priority. Tell \nthe American people that is a priority.\n  How about $700,000 to plant 1,600 trees along the sidewalks in \nProvidence, RI? Is that a priority? Because once this bill moves out of \nhere, it is out of your control, and the bureaucrats are going to grant \nit based on the pressure you put on them, not on a competitive basis \nbut based on what greases the skids the most.\n  How about $500,000 for eco-friendly golf course improvements in \nDayton, OH? We like that one?\n  How about $8.4 million for a brandnew polar bear exhibit at the zoo \nin Providence, RI? Is that really a priority? When we are in this kind \nof trouble, we are going to be building zoos? That is what the Senate \nsays we should do with this money, allow zoos to be built?\n  I like this one: $6.1 million for corporate jet hangars in \nFayetteville, AR. Those are the kinds of jobs we want to create? We \nwant to create that kind of program?\n  How about $100,000 to rehabilitate a skateboard park in Alameda, CA? \nWe are going to take $100,000 from our kids to rehabilitate a \nskateboard park. That is what the American people want us to do with \nthis money to put people to work?\n  How about the Sunset View Dog Park in Chula Vista, CA? Just half a \nmillion dollars. That is on this list.\n  If we do not accept this amendment, then tons of this stuff is going \nto go through--low priority, not high priority job creating but \neverybody's wish list in the country. When they heard this bill was \nfirst coming, every city across this country said: Well, what can we \nget? When you run a country that way, you can expect to get these kinds \nof requests.\n  In this request is a new museum for Las Vegas, a mob museum. We will \nspend $50 million on a mob museum? That is really a priority right now \nfor American citizens, especially their grandchildren who are still in \nthe womb who are going to come out owing $500,000 as soon as they hit \nthe ground? If we do not add this amendment to this bill, tons of stuff \njust like this is going to be included.\n  Let me tell you the other justification for this. One of the best \nfunctioning things we have is a library and\n\n[[Page S1669]]\n\nmuseum grant-seeking body. They have done a wonderful job through the \nlast few years, except when we earmark around them, which we do \nroutinely every year. But they go through an ordered process.\n  What is going to happen is this is going to go around the ordered \nprocess again, and we are going to take away competitive grants. They \nare the only agency in the Federal Government that 100 percent follows \nup on every grant. They know the quality of the grants they give, and \nthey never give another one if it was not quality. They make people pay \nback if it was not quality. There is nothing in this bill that will \nrequire us to get back the money from people who abuse the process.\n  In the next appropriations bill--probably the one that is coming in \nthe next week or so--we are going to have well over $100 million for \nmuseums. I guarantee you, it is probably in the omnibus that is coming. \nI bet you we have $100 million in there in spite of this $900 billion \nbill. I guarantee you we have $100 million in it. Maybe by me \nmentioning it we will not have it when it comes to the floor. I don't \nknow.\n  There is nothing in here that would say, if you are a highly endowed \nmuseum, you cannot get this money. Are we going to give the same amount \nof money to any museum, even when several have $1 billion or $2 billion \nin endowment? There is no direction in this bill. None.\n  The golf course industry in the United States boasts approximately \n12,000 golf courses. There is no prohibition in this bill that any of \nthis money will not be spent building golf courses. Again, if you don't \nbelieve me, ask your 6-year-old grandchild: Do you think we ought to \nborrow your future to pay for a golf course in this country right now? \nThere is no prohibition on that. It is going to happen. We all know it \nis going to happen.\n  To go back to the mayors' wish list: $5 million for golf course \nrenovations in Shreveport, LA; $1.2 million for a new golf park \nrestoration in Brockton, MA; $1.5 million to replace the golf clubhouse \nin Roseville, MN; $2.1 million for Forest Park and urban golf \nrenovation in St. Louis; $3 million for golf clubhouse replacement in \nLincoln, NE; $500,000 for an environmentally friendly golf course in \nDayton, OH; and $3 million for renovation of a golf course building in \nHawaii.\n  I know it is hard to put a bill such as this together, and I am not \nmeaning to be overly critical, but I believe that unless we put a \nprohibition on what the money can go for, the money is going to go for \nlow-priority items. I think it is reprehensible that we would not put a \nlimit on the worst tendencies of local governments, the worst \ntendencies of State governments, and our own worst tendencies to spend \nmoney, especially when it is 100 percent borrowed; that we would not \nlimit ourselves, that we would not put a choke chain on us to make sure \nwe don't allow projects to go this way.\n  I have talked about this long enough. I appreciate the indulgence of \nthe chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 306, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for his \ncosponsorship of this amendment. I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment so I may call up the Sanders-Grassley amendment \nNo. 306 with the modification that I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Does the Senator from \nNorth Dakota have an objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, is there an order that has \nbeen entered with respect to the offering of amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There has been a general understanding, after Senator \nCoburn spoke on his amendment, Senator Sanders would be able to call up \nhis amendment. After Senator Sanders, Senator Cornyn will call up his \namendment. Then Senator Feingold is after that, and then a Republican \namendment after that.\n  I would like to, frankly, get a consent agreement fairly soon to at \nleast vote on a small number of amendments--say, four, five \namendments--get that out of the way, and while we are voting on those, \nwe can figure out how we get the rest of the amendments processed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is it possible to get on this amendment train? Senator \nGraham and I have an amendment. He is the lead, so it would be a \nRepublican amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to be right after the end of the list you just \ngave.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont still has the floor. \nThe Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I reserved the right to object. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself, and \n     Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 306, as \n     modified, to amendment No. 98.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require recipients of TARP funding to meet strict H-1B \n   worker hiring standard to ensure non-displacement of U.S. workers)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. HIRING AMERICAN WORKERS IN COMPANIES RECEIVING TARP \n                   FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Employ \n     American Workers Act''.\n       (b) Prohibition.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, it shall be unlawful for any recipient of funding under \n     title I of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-343) or section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act \n     (12 U.S.C. 342 et seq.) to hire any nonimmigrant described in \n     section 101(a)(15)(h)(i)(b) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(h)(i)(b)) unless the \n     recipient is in compliance with the requirements for an H-1B \n     dependent employer (as defined in section 212(n)(3) of such \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(3))), except that the second sentence \n     of section 212(n)(1)(E)(ii) of such Act shall not apply.\n       (2) Defined term.--In this subsection, the term ``hire'' \n     means to permit a new employee to commence a period of \n     employment.\n       (c) Sunset Provision.--This section shall be effective \n     during the 2-year period beginning on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Baucus and his staff for \nworking with us on what I believe are significant improvements to the \noriginal amendment Senator Grassley and I offered. This amendment has \nbeen cleared by both sides with a modification. This amendment, as \nmodified, would simply require recipients of TARP funding to meet \nstrict hiring standards to ensure nondisplacement of U.S. workers.\n  I thank Senator Grassley for working with me on this amendment. I \nyield to him. If not, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second. The yeas and nays have not been \nordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont still has the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I was wondering if we could voice vote this amendment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes, that will be fine.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be called up for consideration: Coburn No. 176 and 309; \nSanders No. 306, as modified; Cornyn No. 268; Feingold No. 486; Baucus-\nGrassley 404; Grassley 297; and Harkin 397; that no amendments be in \norder to the amendments prior to a vote in relation thereto; that the \ntime until 8 p.m. be for debate with respect to these amendments; that \nat 8 p.m. the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the amendments in \nthe order listed, with 2 minutes equally divided for each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, that is very unfortunate. The reason for \nthe objection is unfortunate because of the amendment Senator Grassley \nand I\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\nare offering. We are going to have to work this out because I am not \ngoing to allow the quorum call to be called off until it is worked out.\n  This is about the Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits. Basically, at \nthis time in our history, with a recession going on, with unemployment, \nit is extremely important that American workers who lose jobs on \naccount of trade be given a break and they get some benefits, including \nhealth benefits.\n  The objection, I have been told, is basically because there are some \nSenators who want to tie this amendment--the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance amendment--to either passage of or a date certain on which \nwe would take up the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. I think that is not \na good thing to do, and the reason is, the more the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement is tied to Trade Adjustment Assistance, the more it will \nengender opposition to the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.\n  I personally favor the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, and I also very \nrespectfully suggest that the circumstances under which that agreement \ncould be brought up are a lot better if Trade Adjustment Assistance is \nalready passed and into law because that will enable more people in the \ncountry, particularly folks who are concerned about being potentially \nlaid off, to have some comfort here with the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance. Then it is easier for this Congress to bring up the \nColombia Free Trade Agreement. I suspect the President is going to be \nbringing up free trade agreements. I respectfully say that he almost \nhas to. Perhaps some of these may need to be negotiated, but clearly \nthe United States of America is going to enter into free trade \nagreements, and the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, in my judgment, is \none that should be agreed to and adopted.\n  So I say to my very good friend from Arizona, who I think is the one \nprimarily objecting to this provision, that if he would withdraw his \nobjection so we could at least get the Trade Adjustment Assistance \npassed, then I will work with him to find a way at an appropriate time, \nwhen the time is right, to bring up the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. \nBut to tie it to a date or to make a connection is going to, with all \ndue respect, make it more difficult for the Senator to accomplish his \nobjectives.\n  Mr. President, without losing my right to the floor, I ask if the \nSenator from Arizona has a question--but without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to respond to Senator Baucus.\n  First, I think the staff on the majority and minority side are \nattempting to put together a tranche right now of perhaps six--four \namendments, two on both sides?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Eight amendments, including this one.\n  Mr. KYL. Well, I will complete my thought. They are trying to put \ntogether a list of at least four amendments that would be equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Right, four and four.\n  Mr. KYL. And what I suggest is that we proceed on this basis and not \ntry to interject the TAA process, because I think that will cause this \nto grind to a halt here. We can discuss, as I told you, the appropriate \nproceeding on TAA. I am certainly not trying to tie proceeding to TAA \nto a date certain to vote on Colombia, but I do think it is appropriate \nthat a plan be worked out, with the President, as you have noted, and \nthe Members of Congress who are concerned about this to try to find a \nway to go forward, as we originally did, so everyone can be assured \nthat both Trade Adjustment Assistance and the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement can proceed to a successful conclusion.\n  Now is not the time to negotiate that, and that is why I object to \nthe idea of going forward with this at this time. In order to keep this \nprocess moving forward tonight, and get as many of the Democratic and \nRepublican amendments up and voted on, I suggest we keep proceeding as \nwe have been, in good faith, and not confuse it with this extraneous \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 176\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to table Coburn amendment, No. 176. \nI ask that be the pending amendment, and I move to table that \namendment, the Coburn amendment, No. 176.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, for his inclusion of an important provision \nregarding State eligibility for the FMAP increase in this bill. If it \nwere not for this provision, my State of Rhode Island may not have been \neligible for the relief because a State law effective on July 1, 2008 \nchanged eligibility, but the change was not implemented until the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, approved a waiver on \nOctober 1, 2008. The timing of the State's decision, not the approval \ndate by CMS, should be the controlling factor.\n  I ask the chairman, does section 5001(f)(1)(C)(ii) of the bill \nspecifically address this situation?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes. That provision specifically addresses the unique \ncircumstances of Rhode Island. It should not matter when CMS is able to \nmake a change in a waiver. What matters here is that Rhode Island had \nclearly determined that it would make the eligibility change on July 1, \n2008. The decision to do so was made well in advance of congressional \nconsideration of an FMAP increase, so Rhode Island has not been trying \nto game the system. Under this provision, Rhode Island will certainly \nbe eligible for the FMAP increase.\n  Mr. REED. I agree and again thank the chairman.\n\n\n                             emr technology\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as you know, H.R. 1 provides critical \nincentives for the adoption of meaningful EMR technology. Adoption of \nthis technology is essential to improving care and reducing costs.\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\n  Michigan hospitals have been at the forefront of critical advances in \nhealth information technology such as e-prescribing and developing an \nElectronic Medical Record. In fact, its ambulatory sites have been \npaperless for almost 5 years. Many of my hospitals are spending \nsignificant resources in this difficult economic environment to convert \ntheir hospital records to electronic format and upgrade EMRs to contain \nClinical Practice Guidelines.\n  Section 4201 (a)(1)(C) of the bill seeks to prevent double payments \nby excluding certain physicians who practice substantially in hospital \nsettings and use hospital-owned EMR equipment. To clarify the intent of \nthis section, the bill lists specific examples of hospital-based \nprofessionals to be excluded. This makes sense.\n  But I am concerned that this language may also inadvertently exclude \nmany physician group practices associated with hospitals may not \nqualify for EMR incentives under H.R. 1. The way the provision is \ndrafted may many outstanding medical groups such as the Billings Clinic \nin your great state from receiving incentive payments because they are \nclassified as ``provider-based'' entities. Because of this designation, \nI am concerned that HHS may consider such professionals as ``Hospital-\nBased Eligible Professionals'' who are prohibited from receiving \nincentive payments under this section of the bill.\n  I am sure it is not our intent to exclude such physician group \npractices from incentives. I hope the Chairman will work with me and my \nstaff to ensure that Congressional intent will be carried out and early \nchampions of HIT are eligible for EMR incentives in the H.R. 1.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stabenow for raising this \nissue with me. It is not our intent to exclude those early EMR \nchampions from HIT incentives in the Stimulus bill. My staff and I will \nwork with you to clarify our intent, which is to reward early adopters \nof HIT like integrated health systems.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chairman and look forward to working with \nhim on this important issue.\n\n\n             Investing in Home and Community-Based Services\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss the \nimportant subject of home- and community-based services for older \nadults and individuals with disabilities with my distinguished \ncolleague Senator Baucus, who--along with Senator Inouye--is doing a \ncommendable job of leading the Senate's discourse on the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. I would be pleased to enter into a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Wisconsin on this subject.\n  Mr. KOHL. As you and many other Senators are aware, home- and \ncommunity-based services, or HCBS, are critically important to millions \nof older and disabled Americans who rely on Medicaid, which today is \nour country's most important publicly financed system for nursing home \ncare and home-and community-based services. But there is a critical \ndifference in the legal status of these services. Under Federal law, \nnursing home services are a mandatory benefit that must be offered by \nall States to all individuals who meet stipulated eligibility criteria. \nIn contrast, HCBS services are not a mandatory benefit. Rather, they \nare offered by States under waiver programs granted by the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services for limited time periods and \nfor limited numbers of individuals.\n  States across the country have obtained multiple HCBS waivers over \nthe last 20 or so years. These HCBS programs tend to be extremely \npopular, often because they provide a considerably wider array of \nnonmedical support services than are otherwise offered under the \nMedicaid statute.\n  The State of Wisconsin has invested a great deal of time and effort \nin their waiver programs, many of which have been very successful. \nNevertheless, because waiver programs are capped in terms of the number \nof beneficiaries who can be enrolled, there has been substantial growth \nin the size of waiver waiting lists, which in Wisconsin reached an \nunacceptably high level of more than 11,000 people. Many other States \nalso have large waiver waiting lists.\n  Concerned about the State's high level of unmet need, Wisconsin has \nembarked on a program to try to eliminate waiver waiting lists and also \nabsorb the projected increase in demand for services during the next \ndecade. This program is called Family Care, and it is a good example of \nhow a State can take on the challenge of organizing long-term care \nservices more cost-effectively. Other States are undertaking planning \nefforts as well. I am pleased to say that recent research has found \nthat States that began expanding their HCBS programs in the mid-1990s \nexperienced initial upfront costs as their level of services expanded, \nfollowed by a leveling off of costs--with the result that aggregate \nspending was controlled.\n  We have reached a critical juncture with regard to the development of \nHCBS services. In the context of the stimulus package we are now \nconsidering--which provides States with an additional $87 billion in \nMedicaid funding--I believe we should urge States not to reduce these \npopular and needed services but, rather, to maintain and strengthen \nthem. Does the Senator from Montana concur?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator for the question. My State is making \nan investment in home- and community-based services for individuals 60 \nyears and older, and I applaud these efforts. In 2007, the legislature \nestablished the Older Montanans Trust Fund that will enable more \nindividuals to access these services in the long run. As the population \nages, there will be greater pressure on the long term care system, and \nStates like Montana face additional challenges responding to the needs \nof seniors and individuals with disabilities in rural and frontier \nareas. I join the senior Senator from Wisconsin in urging my \ncolleagues, along with State programs, to carefully monitor HCBS \nservices and spending, not to reduce the commitment to these very \nvaluable and needed services.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment that I have \nfiled to address some important renewable energy issues that should be \nresolved before the Congress sends the final economic recovery plan to \nthe President.\n  I do not plan to force it to a vote because I have great confidence \nthat we will be able to work out most, if not all, of these issues \nsatisfactorily in conference and with the new administration. That is \nprovided we can get enough votes to move this critical bill through the \nSenate.\n  As my colleagues know, the recession has hit every sector of the \neconomy hard. The growing renewable energy industry is no exception. \nOne recent headline was ``Dark Days for Green Energy.''\n  Solar, wind and even geothermal businesses are caught in the credit \ncrunch. Installations have slowed, despite the extensions of important \nproduction and investment tax credits that we included in the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program and the promise of the new renewable and energy \nefficiency incentives and loan guarantee programs that we have included \nin the economic recovery legislation the Senate is debating now.\n  The number of investors for new renewable projects, like other \nindustries, has dwindled due to the disruption in tax equity markets. \nSo, to keep making progress toward a clean energy revolution, making \nour Nation and my home State of Nevada more energy independent and \ncreating thousands of new jobs and sustainable economic growth, we need \na temporary substitute for those tax credits and incentives.\n  My amendment is similar to the temporary DOE grant program included \nin the House-passed bill, which works in lieu of the investment tax \ncredit. However, I have modified it to be certain that it also works \nfor utility-scale solar and geothermal projects which take slightly \nlonger than wind or other renewable energy production facilities to \ncommence operation.\n  Clearly, this grant program will not and should not remove the strong \npreference of most project sponsors to use the traditional tax equity \nmarkets once those markets are reestablished and functioning. The grant \noption is less valuable to these investors than the investment or \nproduction tax credit because it does not fully replace other tax \nbenefits such as accelerated depreciation. But the grant program is a \nnecessity in today's troubled market\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\nthat will get renewable project developers through these difficult \ntimes, creating thousands of jobs in the course of months instead of \nyears.\n  The amendment does a number of other things, including pushing and \nfunding the Departments of Energy, Interior and other agencies to work \ntogether more constructively and more quickly to process renewable \nenergy projects and related transmission permits on public lands. It \nalso raises the cap to $2.5 billion on third-party financing for \ntransmission capacity developments that the Western Area Power \nAdministration and the Southwestern Power Administration are allowed to \naccept.\n  Lastly, the amendment includes a nod toward the problems faced by \nsolar and other renewable technologies that might not easily fall into \nthe two categories of guaranteed loan eligibility in the substitute, \ncommercial vs. non-commercial. My amendment would add a new category of \n``new or significantly improved'' technologies that would be eligible \nfor the new loan guarantee program created in the underlying bill. This \ndefinition was part of the final rule for the title XVII loan guarantee \nprogram published in October 2007.\n  Nevadans and all Americans are eager to get back to work and clean \nenergy investments are one of the best ways to ensure they can get back \nto work and prosper.\n  Nevadans pay billions of dollars every year in energy bills. Much of \nthat money goes to other States or other countries in fuel costs and \nenriches them, but does not add equivalent and long-lasting value for \nNevada or provide much help to diversify our economy or prepare for a \nsafer and more affordable future.\n  Fortunately, this economic recovery plan, with the help of the new \nadministration, is going to start the transformation of our national \nenergy policy that Nevada needs to become a net exporter of clean \nrenewable energy.\n  This bill will stimulate the economy in the short-term, but its \nenergy spending will have long-term benefits for Nevada and the Nation.\n  The entire list of potential benefits to Nevada are too numerous to \nlist, but at my and the President's strong urging, the economic \nrecovery bill will, for example: accelerate renewable energy project \nand transmission line development; stimulate the growth of businesses \nmaking energy efficient and renewable energy products and services; \nimprove energy efficiency of schools, hospitals, public buildings and \nlow-income housing; maintain, repair and improve critical water supply \nand quality projects in urban and rural areas; promote conversion of \nvehicle fleets to clean and efficient alternative fuels to reduce oil \nconsumption; and, enhance energy security at military installations \nthrough renewable energy and energy efficiency investments.\n  Some of the specific items currently in the bill and their benefits \nfor Nevada:\n  A 3 year extension of the renewable energy production tax credit. The \nlong-term extension of this tax credit are critical to ensure \ninvestment in Nevada's geothermal and wind energy potential. $3.25 \nbillion in new borrowing authority for the Western Area Power \nAdministration to finance and facilitate development of renewable \nenergy transmission capacity. The new borrowing authority should \nfacilitate access to Nevada's vast solar and geothermal resources. \n$22.1 million through the Weatherization Assistance Program, with \nchanges to the income level percentage formula for determining the \neligibility, an increase in the assistance level per dwelling unit, and \nan increase in the funding ceiling for worker training. $5.4 million \nthrough the State Energy Program for energy efficiency, conservation \nand renewable energy projects. A new Advanced Energy Investment Credit \nfor facilities that manufacture advanced energy property like solar \ncells or mirrors, wind turbines, technology that can access geothermal \ndeposits, or energy storage systems for electric and hybrid-electric \nvehicles. $1.6 billion in Clean Renewable Energy Bonds that Nevada's \ncities, counties, and electric cooperatives will be able to compete for \nto finance renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. A 2 year \nextension and expansion of the 10 percent energy efficiency tax credit \nfor existing homes to 30 percent. Approximately $20 million for energy \nefficiency and conservation block grants for Nevada's communities. \nHundreds of millions of dollars that will make military installations \nmore energy efficient and more energy secure through greater use of \nrenewable power and alternative fuel vehicles. $2 billion that Nevada's \npublic housing agencies will be able to compete for so that they can \ninvest in energy conservation. $1.6 billion that Nevada's hospitals and \nschools will be able to compete for so that they can invest in energy \nefficiency\n  I should note that nothing is final until the Senate has had a chance \nto pass and conference this bill with the House and President Obama has \nsigned it. Many Senators have filed or are considering amendments to \ncut some of these important energy programs. So we will have to see \nwhat happens.\n  But I am committed to making sure that the renewable energy business \nin Nevada and elsewhere continues to grow through this legislative \npackage, the next energy bill and beyond. The economic, energy, \nenvironmental and national security benefits are just too important to \nmy State, to the Nation and the world.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my friend from Montana referred to the \nCBO analysis of this bill. He rightly pointed to some proposals in the \nbill that will have some stimulative effect. The Chairman also talked \nabout CBO's analysis of years 1 through 3--all relevant data. But we \nneed to know what happens in years 4, 5, and years 6 through 10. I have \nasked that question because there is a reasonable fear that the \nspending might have a negative effect on the economy from years 4, 5 \nand so forth.\n  The spending might ``crowd out'' investment and that crowding out \ncould adversely affect economic growth later.\n  It is kind of like the difference between a carbohydrate diet and a \nprotein diet. Under this bill, there is a lot of carbohydrate-spending. \nThe spending is like eating a sugary doughnut. It tastes good going \ndown, but shortly thereafter the effect wears off and you are hungry \nagain. In this case, we have a spending surge, but we might face the \neffects of too much spending with crowdout.\n  On our side, we would prefer a protein-type of stimulus. We want \ninvestment nourishment up front. Like protein, the economic body will \nbecome stronger after the investment stimulus is digested.\n  Now, I am not saying there shouldn't be any spending stimulus. What \nwe need is a balanced stimulative diet. This bill's stimulus diet is \ntoo carb-oriented. It needs more protein investment stimulus.\n  I am afraid the detailed CBO analysis of years 4, 5 and 6 through 10 \nmay confirm that this bill will show that we pay the price for a \nstimulus package that is too far tilted towards spending.\n  On the AMT patch point made by Senator Durbin, I agree the AMT patch \nis not in the McCain admendment. As one who pushed for it in the \nFinance Committee, I agree the patch would be a good addition.\n  Senator McCain would be glad to add the AMT patch. But I would ask my \nfriends in the Democratic leadership a question. If the patch were \nadded, would they support the bill?\n  They were supporters of the House bill and the Chairman's mark. Both \ndocuments did not contain the AMT patch. If we add the patch here, will \nthey support Senator McCain's amendment?\n  If Senator McCain's amendment passes, I will seek to add the AMT \npatch in conference so that 24 million American families do not get hit \nwith this stealth tax.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, although the housing crisis has devastated \ncities and towns across America, nowhere has been hit harder than \nNevada.\n  Nearly 1 in 20 households has been affected by foreclosure, and that \nnumber goes up every single day.\n  Every time a home is lost, a family loses not just a place to live \nbut a sense of security, financial stability and the promise of a \nbrighter future.\n  Last evening, the Senate passed an amendment to the American recovery \nand reinvestment plan that doubles the tax credit for home buyers to \n$15,000. This legislation will also expand the credit to all \npurchasers, not just first-time buyers.\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\n  In Nevada, this incentive will help encourage those who continue to \nsit on the fence, hoping for further price declines, to jump into the \nmarket and buy a home. Despite the current uncertainty, many experts \nagree that for the long term, now is an excellent time to become a \nhomeowner.\n  Nevadans know that this amendment will not solve our housing crisis, \nbut it will help. If Democrats and Republicans keep working together \nwith President Obama, putting partisanship aside to find commonsense \nsolutions, we can stabilize our housing market and begin the long road \nto economic recovery.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to bring to the Senate's attention \na compelling new report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, \nCBO,\n  The February 4, 2009, report, which was requested by President \nObama's nominee for Secretary of Commerce, Senator Judd Gregg of New \nHampshire, confirms what supporters of the Senate economic recovery \npackage have said from the very beginning. The CBO has concluded that \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act would have an immediate and \nsubstantial impact on the U.S. economy, most notably in terms of job \ngrowth and GDP growth.\n  In crafting this legislation, our No. 1 priority has been putting the \nAmerican people back to work. This report estimates that the recovery \npackage, as reported out of the Senate Appropriations and Finance \nCommittees, would create between 900,000 and 2.4 million new jobs in \n2009, between 1.3 and 3.9 million jobs in 2010, and between 600,000 and \n1.9 million jobs in 2011. These numbers would correspond to an \nunemployment rate reduction of 0.5 to 1.3 percent in 2009, 0.6 to 2.0 \npercent in 2010, and 0.3 to 1.0 percent in 2011.\n  Additionally, the report estimates that the legislation would grow \nthe U.S. gross domestic product by 1.4 to 4.1 percent in 2009, 1.2 to \n3.6 percent in 2010, and 0.4 to 1.2 percent in 2011.\n  I welcome this new data as further evidence of the job-creating \npotential of this economic recovery package. I believe this new \nanalysis strongly reinforces the need for swift action by the Senate on \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This legislation will \nalleviate the painful effects of the current economic crisis by \nspurring real economic growth and putting millions of Americans back to \nwork. I am confident that this body will respond with the urgency that \nthis crisis demands of us.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, during debate on H.R. 1, the Economic \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Senator Cornyn of Texas offered \nSenate amendment 277 to Senate amendment 98, an amendment in the nature \nof a substitute. Pursuant to section 312 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, Senate Budget Committee majority staff determined and \nadvised the Senate Parliamentarian that the amendment violated the \nSenate pay-go rule, section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008. Consequently, a point of \norder was raised against the Cornyn amendment, and a motion to waive \nthe point of order failed by a vote of 37 to 60.\n  Upon further review, committee staff concluded that the determination \nof a pay-go point of order was made in error--in fact, the amendment \ndid not violate section 201. As chairman of the Committee, I regret the \npoint of order was inadvertently raised in error.\n\n\n                                Hospice\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to support an \namendment being offered by Senator Schumer to reverse a recent Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, regulation reducing payments \nto hospice service providers. This amendment is also cosponsored by \nSenators Rockefeller, Stabenow, Wyden and Roberts.\n  In October 2008, CMS finalized a rule that cut hospice reimbursement \nunder Medicare. This reduction limits the ability of hospice providers \nto provide comprehensive, high quality end-of-life care to Medicare \nbeneficiaries and their families. In 2008, an independent study from \nDuke University, clearly demonstrating the cost savings associated with \nhospice care, noted, ``Given that hospice has been widely demonstrated \nto improve quality of life of patients and family members . . . the \nMedicare program appears to have a rare situation whereby something \nthat improves quality of life also appears to reduce costs.''\n  During the 110th Congress, in response this regulation, I introduced \nS.3484, the Hospice Protection Act, to reverse the CMS regulation. The \nbill received bipartisan support and garnered thirty five cosponsors \nhowever we were not able to move the legislation forward. The economic \nstimulus legislation offers an opportunity to correct a misguided \nregulation that has put an estimate 3,000 individuals out of work. \nDuring these economic times the Federal Government should not be \nputting forth regulations that not only hurt beneficiaries but harm the \nworkforce.\n  While this amendment provides a number of jobs, I am concerned that \nthe amendment is not offset and the cost of the bill may increase the \ncost of the overall bill. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I will \nwork to ensure that the cost of this amendment is paid for without \nincreasing the cost of the bill. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis amendment and to work with the sponsor and cosponsors of this \namendment to ensure its inclusion in the economic stimulus package.\n\n\n                        Army Corps of Engineers\n\n  Mr. President, I seek recognition to comment on my cosponsorship of \nan amendment to H.R. 1, the Economic Recovery Act, which would increase \nfunding in the bill for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by $4.6 \nbillion. I am cosponsoring this amendment, offered by Senator Landrieu, \nbecause the funding will support construction of critical \ninfrastructure projects across the Nation. At the Port of Pittsburgh \nalone, there is over $580 million worth of shovel-ready lock and dam \nwork that could be started in 6 months. These structures support the \ntransportation of bulk commodities to industries that depend on them. \nFailure at any of these locks and dams would have dramatic economic \nconsequences, as the Port of Pittsburgh generates over $13 billion in \neconomic activity and supports over 200,000 jobs. Not only does the \nlong-term modernization of these structures increase the economic \ncompetitiveness of domestic manufacturing industries, but they create \nimmediate jobs in the construction industry. This is just one example \nof the type of economic stimulus that funding for the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers can provide. There are more examples across Pennsylvania \nand the Nation.\n  However, despite my cosponsorship of this amendment due to its \npotential for stimulus, I am not committed to voting for it without an \noffset. Since adopting this amendment would add $4.6 billion to the \nsize of the bill and increase the national deficit, an offset to reduce \nspending elsewhere in the bill by an equal amount would be preferable. \nWe should make every effort to identify offsets to reduce the total \nsize of the economic recovery bill.\n\n\n                      Rescission of Highway Funds\n\n  Mr. President, I seek recognition to comment on my cosponsorship of \nan amendment to prevent Federal highway funds from being rescinded. \nSAFETEA-LU requires that $8.7 billion in unobligated contract authority \nbalances held by States be rescinded on September 30, 2009. This \nrescission will cut Pennsylvania's road and bridge program by $380 \nmillion in fiscal year 2010. That is why I am cosponsoring an amendment \noffered by Senators Baucus and Bond to prevent this rescission from \nhappening.\n  However, I am not committed to voting for this amendment if it does \nnot contain an offset. Since preventing this rescission will add $8.7 \nbillion in new budget authority, an offset is needed to make its \nbudgetary impact neutral. We should make every effort to identify \noffsets to reduce the total size of the economic recovery bill.\n\n\n                              Brownfields\n\n  Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on an amendment I am \noffering to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This \namendment would provide $3 billion for the purpose of redeveloping \nBrownfields and neglected urban properties. The $3 billion would be \nequally divided between the EPA Brownfields Program, the Brownfields \nEconomic Development Initiative at the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and the Urban Development Action Grant Program, also at \nHUD.\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\n  In 2001, I cosponsored the Brownfield's Revitalization and \nEnvironmental Restoration Act. This legislation led to the creation of \nthe EPA Brownfields Program, and a similar program at the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development.\n  Abandoned industrial sites are common blight on the landscape in many \ntowns and cities across Pennsylvania and the nation. Turning these \nindustrial sites into developments, either for residential or \ncommercial use, provides an obvious benefit: an eyesore is replaced by \na new community, and economic growth is generated.\n  Traditional lenders are reluctant to lend initial money to brownfield \ndevelopment projects for a number of reasons. Liability concerns, and \nthe fact that the cleanup costs may exceed the property's actual value, \nare among them. By providing seed money that redevelopers are often \nunable to obtain from traditional sources, the Brownfield Program spurs \ndevelopment and economic growth in struggling regions throughout the \ncountry.\n  It is estimated that every $1 invested in brownfield redevelopment \nleads to $15 to $20 in economic activity. I am told an investment in \ntraditional infrastructure yields about $1.56 for every $1 invested. \nThe proposed economic stimulus legislation provides $100 million for \nBrownfield redevelopment. Of that amount, the Congressional Budget \nOffice projects that 85% could be spent within the two year time frame.\n  This number is insufficient. I recently met with a Pennsylvania \ncompany specializing in brownfields redevelopment. This company alone \nhas fifteen projects that could break ground within 120 days if granted \napproximately $280 million in support. These projects alone could \ncreate tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic \nactivity.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 85 percent of the \nfunding provided by the stimulus could be spent within the 2-year \nwindow. They base their figure off the historic spending patterns at \nthe program.\n  In light of the economic benefit of these projects, I recommend that \nwe provide $3 billion to these programs.\n\n\n                               Prompt Pay\n\n  Mr. President, I seek recognition on my amendment to remove the \nprompt pay provision from the calculation of Medicare Part B drug \npricing.\n  The prompt pay discount is a discount from the pharmaceutical \nmanufacturer to the wholesaler for prompt payment on prescription \ndrugs. The current Medicare payment calculation requires that this \nprompt pay discount be included in the calculation of average sales \nprice, which forms the basis for the Medicare drug reimbursement \nprovided by the manufacturer. This effectively lowers the average sales \nprice thus artificially lowering drug reimbursement to physicians. This \namendment would remove the prompt pay discount from ASP, requiring CMS \nto reimburse physicians based on the price they actually pay for drugs \nwithout the inclusion of discounts.\n  The reduced payment for Medicare Part B drugs has adversely affected \nphysicians since its implementation. This compounded with the current \neconomic downturn. is resulting in cancer clinic closings and staff \nlayoffs. It is estimated that in medical specialties that have the \nhighest usage of Medicare Part B drugs, over 12,000 individuals are at \nrisk of losing their jobs. This not only harms the economy, it hurts \ncancer care.\n  I am very concerned that the cost of the economic stimulus bill is \ngrowing too large. To ensure that this does not contribute to that \ngrowth I am offsetting the cost of this bill by reducing funds to the \nOffice of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. After the \nestimated cost of this bill of $400 million, the Office of the \nSecretary will still receive $700 million to examine comparative \nclinical effectiveness. I encourage my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we all know how important this legislation \nis to the health of our Nation's economy. I commend the managers of \nthis bill for focusing on job creation and projects that are focused on \nAmerica's future. Large-scale infrastructure projects such as new \nschools and better roads and bridges will benefit all of us, but when \nit comes to the men and women tasked with building them, I believe we \nhave a responsibility to ensure that those most in need of work are put \nat the front of the line.\n  That is why I introduced an amendment to express the sense of the \nSenate that, to the extent possible, contractors using funds made \navailable through this act should hire individuals from vulnerable and \nunderserved populations. By focusing on helping veterans, at-risk \nyouth, low-income people, and those trying to start a new life for \nthemselves through a reentry or career training program, we can not \nonly help build the future economy, but we can help these individuals \nbecome sustainable and productive members of that economy. These \npopulations have been most affected by the downturn in the economy the \nmost--many have lost their homes in the housing crisis or have been \nlaid off.\n  My amendment also encourages the State and local agencies that \nreceive stimulus funds to look to local organizations such as labor \nunions, community groups, and faith--based organizations to help them \nfind workers. These groups can serve as an invaluable partner in our \neffort to stimulate the economy. So I ask my colleagues as we debate \nthis bill that they stay mindful of the people who need our help the \nmost and support my amendment to ensure that we put America back to \nwork.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 248\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, as part of the debate on the \nthe American Economic Recovery Act, I filed amendment No. 248, which \naddresses development and management concerns for the Republican River, \na river that runs through Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska and is part of \nthe South Platte River Basin. This bipartisan amendment is cosponsored \nby Senator Bennet.\n  This amendment was filed to address an issue in Colorado under the \npurview of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, BOR, in the same way that \nthe drafters of the bill permitted funding for Arizona and California. \nIf funding under the bill to the BOR can be directed to address \nconcerns in California and Arizona and not be considered an earmark, \nthen similarly, this direction to benefit the South Platte River Basin \nshould not be considered an earmark.\n  As you know, the language of the bill suggests that $50 million of \nthe funds provided in the bill may be transferred to the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior for programs, projects and activities \nauthorized by the Central Utah Project Completion Act--titles II-V of \nPublic Law 102-575; $50 million of the funds provided under this \nheading may be used for programs, projects, and activities authorized \nby the California Bay-Delta Restoration Act, Public Law 108-361.\n  In this case, I feel it is important as the senior Senator for \nColorado to insist that additional funding for the Bureau of \nReclamation for important job-creating projects in the West ought to be \nhandled in an evenhanded way.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak to an amendment to the \nstimulus proposal with Senator Feinstein and Senator Kerry that would \nincrease tax incentives for energy efficiency and ensure that we invest \nin the area that can transform our energy policy. Given the state of \nour country, I believe that we must be resolute and visionary in our \ncommitment to energy efficiency, an investment that provides both \nshort-term benefits and long-term dividends. As a result, today I am \noffering an amendment that will facilitate a revolution toward energy-\nefficient buildings.\n  One inexcusable legacy of this housing crisis for our future \ngenerations will be that the vast majority of homes constructed over \nthe last 10 years during the housing boom have been inefficient. While \nan inefficient vehicle purchased today may guzzle gasoline for an \naverage of 10 years, an inefficient building will require elevated \nlevels of energy for as long as 50 years. Therefore, whenever we create \ninefficient buildings, generations to come will be saddled with our \nwasteful energy decisions.\n  My amendment today would create and expand tax incentives for \nefficient buildings to levels that would equal the additional \nconstruction costs for the higher efficient buildings. The amendment \nwould raise the tax credit for the construction of a new home from \n$2,000 to $5,000, a provision that the National Association of Home \nBuilders estimates could provide 100,000 jobs. In\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\nfact, the association has written the Finance Committee stating that \nthis amendment would ``provide much needed and meaningful expansions to \ntwo existing tax incentive programs that are helping to improve \nresidential energy efficiency in both new and existing homes.''\n  This amendment would build on Congress's landmark energy efficiency \ntax credits established in the 2005 Energy Policy Act and continue to \nfoster the burgeoning energy efficiency industry to work for homeowners \nwho are struggling with energy bills. Specifically this amendment would \nprovide a $500 tax credit for individuals to become professional energy \nauditors, experts that can reduce our country's demand for oil, reduce \ncarbon emissions, and save our struggling families money on their \nenergy bills. In addition, a $200 tax credit is established for \nhomeowners to hire these professional energy auditors and analyze the \ndeficiencies of an existing home and propose investments that will save \nthe taxpayer money. As we move forward with dedicating significant \nresources to energy efficiency in this legislation it is critical that \nwe ensure that this funding is utilized effectively by a professional \nenergy efficiency industry, and this amendment will accomplish this \ncritical goal.\n  Finally, the amendment increases the tax credit for energy efficient \ncommercial buildings by increasing the deduction from $1.80 per square \nfoot to $3.00 per square foot. The original version of the commercial \nbuildings tax deduction as passed by the Senate set the deduction to \n$2.25 per square foot, with the critical support of the current Finance \nchairman and ranking member. Adjusting for inflation, this corresponds \nto $3.00 per square foot today with partial compliance increased to \n$1.00 per square foot. These changes would return the deduction to \nviability as it was originally designed and ensure that commercial \nbuilding developers are provided an adequate incentive to pursue energy \nefficiency.\n  We must not overlook that an exacerbating factor in the collapse of \nour economy was our exposure to the historic price of foreign oil. With \nestimates that every 1 percent increase in energy prices results in a \n.15 percent drop in aggregate consumer spending, clearly, the United \nStates must address this situation with boldness, clarity, and \nforesight and invest in energy efficiency--the low-hanging fruit of a \nnew energy era. We must seize this historic opportunity.\n  Two weeks ago, a New York Times editorial pointed out that we are an \nextremely energy inefficient economy--the 76th best country in the \nworld. This must change if we are to retain our leadership in this \nworld. It is a burden to our citizens as well as our small business, \nand unsurprisingly, the Chamber of Commerce wrote to Congress on \nJanuary 14 indicating that energy efficiency should be our first \npriority. We have an opportunity to do that today, and I believe it is \na serious absence in this recovery package.\n\n\n                           energy efficiency\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak to an amendment with Senators \nFeinstein, Bingaman, and Kerry to improve upon the efficiency standards \nof residential tax credits. As a leader on energy efficiency tax \ncredits, I am encouraged to see roughly $4.3 billion in incentives for \nthe residential home energy efficient purchases through the 25C tax \ncredit. As a longtime leader on efficiency, and as the one who \nspearheaded this landmark energy efficiency tax credits with Senator \nFeinstein, I have strong concerns about the stimulus proposal, which \nmust be overhauled to ensure that only the most efficient products \nqualify for this tax credit.\n  Of primary concern, the mark extends the 25C tax credit for \nresidential property for an additional year through end of 2010 and \nraises the individual cap from $500 to $1500. However, the mark \ncritically fails to overhaul the tax credits to reflect technological \ndevelopments that have occurred since we passed this into law four \nyears ago. Quite simply, during this period, products have become more \nenergy efficient, yet the proposal fails to reflect this indisputable \npoint. For example, as a result of technological change nearly all new \nwindows, roughly 87 percent, now qualify for this credit. As a result, \nall of these windows will continue to receive a tax credit if this mark \nbecomes law.\n  My amendment is very simple in that it raises efficiency levels to \nreduce the types of products to only the efficient residential property \nthat is available today. I am pleased that Senator Bingaman, the \nchairman of the Energy Committee, as well as Senator Feinstein, a \nlongtime leader on transforming our energy policy, will make the tax \ncredit more functional and reduce the overall score of the tax \nprovision. As the sponsor of this provision in 2005, I can say that I \nbelieve this amendment returns the tax credit to the original intent of \nthis committee when we enacted this credit into law in 2005. Without \nthis amendment, I am concerned this tax credit will fail to facilitate \na transformation to more energy efficient products that will cut energy \ndemand and reduce carbon emissions.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley on this issue and appreciate their continued efforts to work \nwith me on energy efficiency tax incentives.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, America's fisheries are as important to \nour coastal communities as agriculture is to the Nation's breadbasket. \nFrom New England and the mid-Atlantic to the gulf coast and vast \nPacific, America's fisheries contribute $185 billion to our Nation's \nwealth, help drive the economy of coastal communities, create jobs for \nharvesters and processing workers, and provides the Nation a source of \nhealthy, sustainable--and tasty--seafood.\n  That is especially true in my home State, Alaska, which accounts for \nover 55 percent of the Nation's seafood landings, boasts 5 of the top \n10 fishing ports in the Nation, and is the State's largest private \nsector employer, creating jobs that are spread from the largest cities \nto the smallest rural villages.\n  Alaska seafood can be found from the Nation's finest white tablecloth \nrestaurants to your neighborhood fast food outlet. And Alaska has \nharvested this resource in a sustainable manner. Alaska stocks are \nmanaged under strict scientific guidelines. None of these species is \nconsidered overfished.\n  Fisheries elsewhere across our Nation face serious challenges from \noverfishing, habitat loss, climate change, and other factors, which is \nwhy Congress recently strengthened the conservation and management \nprovisions in reauthorizing the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation \nAct to end overfishing, reduce bycatch and improve science-based \nmanagement of our fisheries.\n  Unfortunately, many of these provisions have not been implemented due \nto a lack of funding. Only a quarter of the species managed by the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service have been fully assessed and \nprovisions for the monitoring and enforcement of regulations are \nseriously lacking.\n  The amendment I propose today would provide and help fulfill the \nintent of Congress, the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy, Pew Oceans Commission and others who called for action to \nprotect our oceans and the bounty it provides our Nation.\n  It provides $39.8 million to help rebuild our Nation's fish stocks. \nRebuilding the Nation's fisheries would generate approximately $19 \nbillion in sales and create 27,600 jobs in the harvest sector and \n295,000 jobs in the overall economy.\n  It would provide funding for bycatch monitoring, habitat assessment \nand other research relevant to climate change.\n  This amendment would provide an effective stimulus to our Nation's \nfishing industry and boost the economy of coastal communities from \nMaine to Alaska. I urge your support of this vital proposition.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a lot of amendments still pending. I \nhave made a decision in conjunction and in cooperation with the \nRepublican leader\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\nthat we are going to stop legislating tonight and come back tomorrow, \ncome in at 10 o'clock. We will go immediately to the bill. There are a \nnumber of amendments pending. Other Senators want to offer amendments.\n  The main reason I look forward to tomorrow is there are a number of \nRepublican Senators working with Democratic Senators trying to come up \nwith an alternative proposal. Now, I hope something works out. I know \neveryone is trying in good faith to move this ball down the court. But \nI think we need the night and some time tomorrow to see if we can do \nthat. There is paper floating back and forth that is becoming filled \nwith numbers, and we all need to take a look at this.\n  The work done by the negotiators, as I indicated earlier--about eight \nRepublicans, about the same number of Democrats, trying to work toward \nmaking this a better piece of legislation--is ongoing. If, in fact, we \nfind tomorrow that we are spinning our wheels, cannot get something \ndone, then we will file cloture and have a Sunday cloture vote.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am optimistic we can get something done, and I \nhope that, in fact, is the case. Everyone is going to have to give a \nlittle and understand that this is a process where we have to move this \nball down the court. The Republican leader has indicated to me that if \nwe get this out of here, we should go to conference. I agree with him. \nThat takes a little bit of time, and I would hope we could complete \nthis legislation tomorrow. I have hopes, and I am cautiously optimistic \nwe can do that.\n  So I wish I had all the answers, but the answers are not here \ntonight. I think the answers have been coming forth more rapidly in the \nlast few days. I think staying here later tonight would not benefit us. \nWe have a number of amendments we could dispose of, but I think we are \nwaiting for the big amendment that has been worked on now for all this \nweek.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for an \ninquiry?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Then am I correct in assuming we would continue to \nprocess other amendments tomorrow----\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Because there are a number over here, and I understand \nyou have some as well--while these discussions are going on?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We will come in at 10 o'clock. The managers of the \nbill should be here. We will go directly to the legislation. There will \nbe votes. We could have votes early in the morning because there are \namendments right now pending that the manager on this side could move \nto table, setting up a string of votes. But the answer to the \nRepublican leader is, yes, we will process amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I cosponsored Senator Wyden and Senator \nBennett Healthy Americans Act last year to support a legitimate \nbipartisan effort that combines ``private markets'' and ``universal \naccess.'' I am willing to do so again this year, because health care \nreform is too big of an issue for one party to tackle on its own. Our \nonly chance of achieving true, meaningful reform is if both parties \nwork together.\n  However, I do have reservations about this legislation--I see it as a \nwork in progress and would not vote for it in its current form. For \nexample, the current budget figures are unrealistic. In order to \nmaintain budget neutrality, as drafted, the bill would shift a new \nburden on middle-income Americans. We have not yet discovered a way to \nsolve this problem without increasing the cost of the bill.\n  Another problem I have with the bill is that the mandated level of \nstandard benefits is too high. As drafted, typically young, healthy \nAmericans would be forced to pay for a richer level of coverage than \nthey might now choose or possibly be able to afford.\n  I commend the efforts of Senators Wyden and Bennett to reach across \nparty lines on this important issue, and look forward to working with \nboth of them to further improve this proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/05/senate-section/article/S1676-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1676-S1677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAMES PITCHFORD\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to a staff \nmember who left over the recess to pursue new opportunities.\n  James Pitchford--known to all of us as Pitch, is a hard-charging \nmarine who will never cease and desist until told to do so when he is \non a mission. And his mission is and always has been to serve his \ncountry, the men and women in the military, and his family.\n  As a former Wisconsin Air National Guardsmen, naval aviator, marine \naviator, and current naval reservist, I am still trying to figure out \nwhen he's going to sign up for the Army and put a check in the final \nsquare.\n  Pitch served on my staff for 10 years. In that time, he was a \ntireless, and I do want to stress tireless, advocate for the men and \nwomen in uniform and the retirees and veterans that have served this \nNation so valiantly.\n  He helped me establish a counterimprovised explosive device center at \nFort Leonard Wood. This facility has saved lives and will continue to \ndo so by providing critical training to Army personnel for countering \nexplosives hazards and providing countermine working dogs that were not \npreviously available.\n  He was a lead staffer on the National Guard Empowerment Act, a top \npriority for Senator Leahy and me as cochairs of the Senate National \nGuard Caucus. Provisions were enacted that strengthen the Guard's \nposition within the Pentagon and its decisionmaking power.\n  He worked to improve health care for the Nation's service members and \nveterans, particularly those suffering from ``invisible injuries'' such \nas post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury.\n  He worked to keep the F-15 and F/A-18 lines in operation, for the \nbenefit of the Air Force, Navy, and St. Louis workers.\n  He was a strong advocate for military families, our heroes here at \nhome, and particularly the Heroes at Home Program.\n  There is much more to Pitch's credit legislatively and in fighting or \nprodding the bureaucracy, depending on which was appropriate at the \ntime.\n  In addition to Pitch's innumerable legislative endeavors, he was also \na leader on the staff.\n  He took an interest in each and every staff member and mentored all \nof the young staff with whom he came into contact.\n  He actively recruited people to work in the office, and once here, \nactively recruited them to be members of the Armed Forces.\n  He took an interest in the personal lives of staff members and \nvolunteered his time as office liaison to the Senate Chaplain's Office.\n  We are also grateful to Pitch's children, his son Benjamin and \nfraternal twin daughters, Olivia and Kate, of Wisconsin, who endured \nlong separations from their father while he worked to serve the State \nof Missouri and the Nation as well as U.S. forces and military \nveterans.\n  Pitch feels strongly, and I agree, that small business owners should \nbe encouraged to bring their innovative technologies to our Nation's \nservice men and women to reduce their risk of injury or death as they \ncarry the fight to America's enemies. In his new life, he will continue \nto pursue this high priority in the private sector.\n  We are sorry to see Pitch go, but we thank him for his many years of \nservice and wish him all the best in his many endeavors.\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/05/senate-section/article/S1677-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            75TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOSTELLING INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I recognize the Hostelling \nInternational USA for 75 years of service to intercultural \nunderstanding and youth travel.\n  Hostelling International USA is a nonprofit organization founded in \n1934 to promote hostels and hostel-related programs in the United \nStates. Today hostels across the country host nearly 1 million \novernight stays by both domestic and foreign travelers. In doing so, it \npromotes cultural exchange through travel, supports tourism in small \nand large communities throughout the country, and makes travel \navailable on very limited funds.\n  Hostels make travel safe and affordable for young and old. Hostelling \nInternational boasts more hostel rooms than most hotel chains and \noffers a unique experience in friendly and varied surroundings. Instead \nof staying in a standardized hotel room every night, travelers in a \nhostel have the opportunity to share a meal and engage with fellow \ntravelers from every nation and cultural tradition they can imagine. It \nis these shared experiences and the unexpected encounter that makes \nhostelling such a unique and valuable experience for travelers across \nthe country and around the world.\n  In my home State of New Mexico Hostelling International has operated \nhostels in Las Vegas, Silver City, Truth or Consequences, and Datil. \nToday their hostel in Taos offers travelers the opportunity to \nexperience the majestic beauty of the New Mexico landscape and the \nunique culture of Taos pueblo, as well as a little celebrity sighting. \nThese hostels have exposed New Mexico to a variety of travelers who, I \nam certain, will never forget their experiences in the Land of \nEnchantment.\n  I commend Hostelling International for their work in the last 75 \nyears and hope that they look forward to at least another 75 years with \nan increasing number of hostels and travelers around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/05/senate-section/article/S1677-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:34 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 384. A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2010 \nthrough 2014 to provide assistance to foreign countries to promote food \nsecurity, to stimulate rural economies, and to improve emergency \nresponse to food crises, to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased today to announce the \nintroduction of the Global Food Security Act of 2009. I would like to \nthank my friend Senator Casey for lending his ideas and support to this \nbipartisan effort, and Senator Durbin for his early cosponsorship. \nFinally, I want to thank the members of USAID's informal food security \nteam, who advised us on the nature of food insecurity and possible \nlegislative solutions.\n  As we know, food prices started a steep climb in the fall of 2007 and \ncontinued to increase during 2008. The increases pushed an additional \n75 million people into poverty. While prices have abated somewhat, \nmillions of people still face difficulty in food access and \navailability, and malnutrition rates in many parts of the world remain \nalarmingly high. The price crisis demonstrated that there are \nsignificant structural challenges to attaining global food security. \nThe system is vulnerable to periodic disruptions that both expose and \nexacerbate deeper problems.\n  We live in a world where nearly one billion people suffer from \nchronic food insecurity. When droughts occur, hurricanes hit, or other \ndisruptions arise--creating transitory food insecurity the economic \nprospects of those living in or near poverty are gravely threatened. In \nfact, the World Food Program reports that 25,000 people die each day \nfrom malnutrition-related causes. Health experts advise us that a \ndiverse and secure food supply has major health benefits, including \nincreasing child survival, improving cognitive and physical development \nof children, and increasing immune system function including resistance \nto HIV/AIDS. Prolonged malnutrition in children results in stunting and \ncognitive difficulties that last a lifetime.\n  Food insecurity is a global tragedy, but it is also an opportunity \nfor the United States. The United States is the indisputable world \nleader in agricultural production and technology. A more focused effort \non our part to join with other nations to increase yields, create \neconomic opportunities for the rural poor, and broaden agricultural \nknowledge could begin a new era in U.S. diplomacy. Such an effort could \nimprove our broader trade relations and serve as a model for similar \nendeavors in the areas of energy and scientific cooperation. Achieving \nfood security for all people also would have profound implications for \npeace and U.S. national security. Hungry people are desperate people, \nand desperation often sows the seeds of conflict and extremism.\n  The United States has always stood for big ideas--from the founding \nof the\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\nRepublic on the basis of freedom to President Kennedy's vow to put a \nman on the moon. One of today's big ideas should be the eradication of \nhunger. We can bring America's dedication to science, innovation, \ntechnology, and education together to lead an effort devoted to \novercoming the obstacles to food security.\n  The Global Food Security Act of 2009 is a 5-year authorization that \nseeks to provide solutions that will have the greatest effect. First, \nit creates a Special Coordinator for Global Food Security and puts that \nperson in charge of developing a food security strategy. We call on the \ndevelopment of that strategy to take a whole-of-government approach and \nto work with other international donors, the NGO community, and the \nprivate sector. Addressing food security requires more than investing \nin agriculture; it also requires improvements in infrastructure, the \ndevelopment of markets, access to finance, and sound land tenure \nsystems, to name just a few.\n  Second, the bill authorizes additional resources for agricultural \nproductivity and rural development. U.S. foreign assistance for \nagriculture has declined by nearly 70 percent since the 1980s. \nGlobally, only four percent of official development assistance from all \ndonors is currently allocated for agriculture. This amounts to neglect \nof what should be considered one of the most vital sectors in the \nalleviation of poverty. Food shortages are likely to recur frequently \nif the United States and the global community fail to invest in \nagricultural productivity in the developing world.\n  Third, the bill improves the U.S. emergency response to food crises \nby creating a separate Emergency Food Assistance Fund that can make \nlocal and regional purchases of food, where appropriate. Funds can be \nused for emergency food and non-food assistance. The Government \nAccountability Office reports that it can often take four to six months \nfrom the time a crisis occurs until U.S. food shipments arrive. Our \nintention is to provide USAID with the flexibility to respond to \nemergencies more quickly in order to complement food aid programs in \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  World leaders must understand that over the long term, satisfying \nglobal demand for more and better food can be achieved only by \nincreasing yields per acre. In the 1930s, my father, Marvin Lugar, \nproduced corn yields of approximately 40 to 50 bushels per acre. Today, \nthe Lugar farm yields about 150 bushels per acre on the same land in \nMarion County, Indiana. The Green Revolution saw the introduction of \nhigh yield seeds and improved agricultural techniques that resulted in \na near doubling of cereal grain production per acre over 20 years. But \nmore recently, food production has not kept pace with population \nincreases. By 2050, it is projected that population growth will require \nanother doubling of food production. Unless much greater effort is \ndevoted to this problem, the world is likely to experience more \nfrequent and intense food crises that increase migration, stimulate \nconflicts and intensify pandemics.\n  Moreover, the task of doubling food production is likely to be \ncomplicated by the effects of climate change. The important report by \nSir Nicolas Stern estimated that a 2 degree celsius increase in global \ntemperature will cut agricultural yields in Africa by as much as 35 \npercent. Thus, farmers around the world will be asked to meet the \ndemands of global demographic expansion, even as they may be contending \nwith a degrading agricultural environment that significantly depresses \nyields in some regions.\n  Increasing acreage under production will not satisfy the growth in \nfood demand, and these steps come with serious environmental and \nnational security costs. We need a second green revolution that will \nbenefit developed and developing nations alike.\n  Recent studies have demonstrated that funds spent in agriculture can \nbe up to twice as beneficial to economic growth as spending in other \nareas. It seems, therefore, that our overall foreign aid strategy would \nbenefit from restoring agriculture programs to their former prominence. \nThe bill increases funding for these programs in the first year by $750 \nmillion. The increase would reach $2.5 billion in year five. Because \nthose who subsist on less than $1 a day spend at least half their \nincomes on food, according to the International Food Policy Research \nInstitute, the bill highlights the need to focus on those living in \nextreme poverty.\n  In thinking about how to approach agricultural productivity, we tried \nto draw from the experience of U.S. land grant colleges and the \ncontributions they have made to U.S. agriculture. The bill seeks to \nstrengthen institutions of higher education in the areas of agriculture \nsciences, research and extension programs. Investments in human capital \nand institutional capacity are important to developing a robust \nagricultural sector.\n  Universities and research centers can play an important role in \nachieving technological advances that are appropriate to local \nconditions. As such, the bill calls for increasing collaborative \nresearch on the full range of biotechnological advances including \ngenetically modified technologies.\n  I hope that our bill will begin a productive dialogue on how our \ngovernment can be a more effective partner with NGOs and private actors \nin promoting food security. There is no good reason why nearly a \nbillion people should be food insecure or that the world should have to \nendure the social upheaval and risks of conflict that this insecurity \ncauses.\n  I look forward to working with colleagues to improve the U.S. and \nglobal efforts to alleviate food insecurity and advance agricultural \nknowledge and technology worldwide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. \n        Sanders, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 385. A bill to reaffirm and clarify the authority of the \nComptroller General to audit and evaluate the programs, activities, and \nfinancial transactions of the intelligence community, and for other \npurposes; to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Intelligence \nCommunity Audit Act of 2009, with Senators Carper, Durbin, Lautenberg, \nMcCaskill, Sanders, and Wyden. This legislation reaffirms and clarifies \nthe authority of the Comptroller General of the United States, as head \nof the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to audit and evaluate the \nprograms and activities of the Intelligence Community, IC.\n  Our bill is not new. I have introduced similar bills twice before. \nBut today, as I reintroduce this bill, I share with many of my \ncolleagues a renewed commitment to accountability. This legislation \nwould be an important step in that direction. GAO has well-established \nexpertise that should be leveraged to improve the performance of the \nIntelligence Community. In particular, GAO could provide much needed \nguidance to the IC related to human capital, financial management, \ninformation sharing, strategic planning, information technology, and \nother areas of management and administration. By employing GAO's \nexpertise to improve IC management and operations while carefully \nprotecting sensitive information, this bill would reinforce the \nIntelligence Community's ability to meet its mission.\n  The Intelligence Community has faced greater demands and increased \nresponsibilities over the past few years. It is Congress's \nresponsibility to ensure that the IC carries out its critical functions \neffectively and consistent with congressional authorization. For too \nlong, GAO's expertise and ability to engage in constructive oversight \nof the IC have been underutilized. This legislation would enhance, in a \ncomplementary manner, rather than detract from the work of the \ncongressional intelligence committees. Dr. Marvin Ott, a former \nprofessional staff member on the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, testified before my Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Management in February 2008 that the growth in the \ncomplexity, diversity, and size of the IC requires additional oversight \nresources. GAO is in a position to help. According to then-Comptroller \nGeneral David Walker, who testified at the same hearing, GAO has the \nexpertise and cleared personnel to increase the management oversight of \nthe IC.\n  I also believe that safeguards need to be in effect to protect the \nIC's most\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nsensitive information from unauthorized disclosure. Under this bill, \nonly the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, and the majority and the minority \nleaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives would be able to \nrequest reviews of intelligence sources and methods or covert actions. \nResults of an audit of this nature would be restricted to the original \nrequester, the Director of National Intelligence, and the head of the \nrelevant IC element. Employees of the GAO participating in these audits \nwould be subject to the same penalties for unauthorized disclosure or \nuse of sensitive information as their counterparts in the IC. There are \nadditional mechanisms in place to keep this information secure.\n  Congress and GAO have a crucial role in ensuring that the IC elements \nare fulfilling their responsibilities of protecting this country. By \nremoving the barrier to more comprehensive oversight, this bill will \nhelp improve our national security.\n  Mr. Presdient, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve enforcement of mortgage fraud, securities \nfraud, financial institution fraud, and other frauds related to federal \nassistance and relief programs, for the recovery of funds lost to these \nfrauds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce with \nSenator Grassley the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, FERA, of 2009, \na bipartisan bill that will reinvigorate our Nation's capacity to \ninvestigate and prosecute the kinds of financial frauds that have so \nseverely undermined our economy and hurt so many hard working people in \nthis country.\n  Our Nation is in the midst of its most serious economic crisis since \nthe Great Depression. With each passing week, tens of thousands more \nAmericans lose their jobs to layoffs, and many thousands have already \nlost their homes to foreclosure. We learn more and more each day about \nthe causes of this debacle, and it is now clear that unscrupulous \nmortgage brokers and Wall Street financiers were among the principle \ncontributors of this economic collapse.\n  As the crisis worsened last fall, I called upon Federal law \nenforcement to track down and punish those whose conduct went beyond \nmere negligence or incompetence and who were directly responsible for \nthe corporate and mortgage frauds that helped make the economic \ndownturn far worse than anyone predicted. With the new tools and \nresources in this bill, it will be easier to ensure that all of those \nresponsible for these financial crimes are held accountable.\n  While the full scope of the fraud that triggered this economic crisis \nis still unknown, we have already learned a great deal about what went \nwrong. As banks and private mortgage companies relaxed their standards \nfor loans, approving ever riskier mortgages with less and less due \ndiligence, they created an environment that invited fraud. Private \nmortgage brokers and\n\n[[Page S1682]]\n\nlending businesses came to dominate the home housing market, and these \ncompanies were not subject to the kind of banking oversight and \ninternal regulations that had traditionally helped to prevent fraud. We \nare now seeing the results of this lax supervision and accountability.\n  In the last six years, suspicious activity reports alleging mortgage \nfraud that have been filed with the Treasury Department have increased \nmore than tenfold, from about 5,400 in 2002 to more than 60,000 in \n2008. In the last three years, the number of criminal mortgage fraud \ninvestigations opened by the FBI has more than doubled, and the FBI \nanticipates a new wave of cases that may double that number yet again. \nDespite the increase, the FBI currently has fewer than 250 special \nagents nationwide assigned to financial fraud cases. At current levels, \nthey cannot even begin to investigate the more than 5,000 fraud \nallegations they receive from the Treasury Department each month.\n  Of course, the problem is not limited to mortgage frauds. As is so \ncommon in today's financial markets, home mortgages were packaged \ntogether and turned into securities that were bought and sold in \nlargely unregulated markets on Wall Street. Here again, the environment \ninvited fraud. As the value of the mortgages started to decline with \nfalling housing prices, Wall Street financiers began to see these \nmortgage-backed securities unravel. Unfortunately, some were not honest \nabout these securities, leading to even more fraud, and victimizing \ninvestors nationwide.\n  All of this fraud has contributed to an unprecedented collapse in the \nmortgage-backed securities market. In the past year, banks and \nfinancial institutions in the United States alone have suffered more \nthan $500 billion in losses associated with the sub-prime mortgage \nindustry. Some of our Nation's largest and most venerable financial \ninstitutions collapsed as a result. The list of publicly-traded \ncompanies that declared bankruptcy or have been taken over by the \nFederal Government because of the mortgage-backed securities market \ncollapse include Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Bear Stearns, IndyMac, and \nLehman Brothers.\n  As we take steps to make sure this kind of collapse cannot happen \nagain, we must reinvigorate our anti-fraud measures and give law \nenforcement the tools and resources they need to root out fraud so that \nit can never again place our financial system at risk. Taxpayers, who \nbear the burden of this financial downturn, deserve to know that \ngovernment is doing all it can to hold responsible those who committed \nfraud in the run-up to this collapse. This bill will do just that.\n  This bipartisan legislation begins by providing the resources needed \nfor law enforcement to uncover and go after these frauds. The bill \nauthorizes $155 million a year for hiring fraud prosecutors and \ninvestigators at the Justice Department for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. \nThis includes $65 million a year for the FBI to bring on 190 additional \nspecial agents and more than 200 professional staff and forensic \nanalysts to rebuild its ``white collar'' investigation program. With \nthis funding, the FBI can double the number of its mortgage fraud task \nforces nationwide--from 26 to more than 50--that target fraud in the \nhardest hit areas in our Nation. This also includes $50 million a year \nfor U.S. Attorneys' offices to staff those strike forces and $40 \nmillion for the criminal, civil, and tax divisions at the Justice \nDepartment to provide special litigation and investigative support to \nthose efforts. The bill also authorizes $60 million a year for fiscal \nyears 2010 and 2011 for investigators and analysts at the U.S. Postal \nInspection Service and the Office of Inspector General for the Housing \nand Urban Development Department to combat fraud against Federal \nassistance programs and financial institutions.\n  Of course, the economic recovery legislation includes new \nappropriations of $75 million for FBI salaries and $2 million for the \nInspector General for the Treasury Department, yet certainly far more \nneeds to be done to address the full scope of these enforcement issues \nnow and in the future.\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act also makes a number of \nstraightforward, important improvements to fraud and money laundering \nstatutes to strengthen prosecutors' ability to combat this growing wave \nof fraud. Specifically, the bill amends the definition of ``financial \ninstitution'' in the criminal code in order to extend Federal fraud \nlaws to mortgage lending businesses that are not directly regulated or \ninsured by the Federal Government. These companies were responsible for \nnearly half the residential mortgage market before the economic \ncollapse, yet they remain largely unregulated and outside the scope of \ntraditional Federal fraud statutes. This change will apply the Federal \nfraud laws to private mortgage businesses like Countrywide Home Loans \nand GMAC Mortgage, just as they apply to federally insured and \nregulated banks.\n  The bill would also amend the major fraud statute to protect funds \nexpended under the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the economic \nstimulus package, including any government purchases of preferred stock \nin financial institutions. The U.S. Government has provided \nextraordinary economic support to our banking system, and we need to \nmake sure that none of those funds are subject to fraud or abuse. This \nchange will give Federal prosecutors and investigators the explicit \nauthority they need to protect taxpayer funds.\n  The legislation would amend the Federal securities statute to cover \nfraud schemes involving commodities futures and options, including \nderivatives involving the mortgage-backed securities that caused such \ndamage to our banking system.\n  This bill will also strengthen one of the core offenses in so many \nfraud cases--money laundering--which was significantly weakened by a \nrecent Supreme Court case. In United States v. Santos, the Supreme \nCourt misinterpreted the money laundering statutes, limiting their \nscope to only the ``profits'' of crimes, rather than the ``proceeds'' \nof the offenses. The Court's mistaken decision was contrary to \nCongressional intent and will lead to financial criminals escaping \nculpability simply by claiming their illegal scams had not made a \nprofit. This erroneous decision must be corrected immediately, as \ndozens of money laundering cases have already been dismissed.\n  Lastly, FERA improves one of the most potent civil tools we have for \nrooting out waste and fraud in government--the False Claims Act. The \neffectiveness of the False Claims Act has recently been undermined by \ncourt decisions which limit the scope of the law and allow sub-\ncontractors paid with government money to escape responsibility for \nproven frauds. The False Claims Act must quickly be corrected and \nclarified in order to protect from fraud the Federal assistance and \nrelief funds expended in response to our current economic crisis.\n  The Federal Government has spent hundreds of billions of dollars to \nstabilize our banking system, and Congress will soon spend even more to \nrestart our economic recovery. But to date, we have paid far too little \nattention to investigating and prosecuting the mortgage and corporate \nfrauds that has so dramatically contributed to this economic collapse.\n  Congress should move quickly to pass this legislation so the American \ntaxpayers can be confident that those who are criminally responsible \nfor contributing to this economic disaster are caught and held fully \naccountable and to ensure that the money we are now spending to restore \nAmerica is protected from fraud in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 386\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as we struggle to restore growth and hope \nto our economy, we must continue to repair the weaknesses in our legal \nand regulatory system weaknesses that contributed to the crisis we face \ntoday. A lot of what has happened to our economy was the result of \ngreed and incompetence. But too much of it can be traced to fraud, \ninsider deals, and other acts that are illegal, and to actions that \nshould be illegal.\n  That is why I am joining today with Senator Leahy and Senator \nGrassley to introduce the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009. \nAs we survey the damage to every aspect of our economy from \nmanufacturing to retail, from construction to services we can trace the \norigins of this disaster to the real estate market and the financing \nthat drove a bubble that finally burst.\n  We now know that behind the explosion in housing values, and the \nexplosion in the secondary market for mortgages, were \nmisrepresentations, false reporting, insider deals, and other forms of \nfraud. Many of these actions clearly broke existing financial \nregulations and consumer protection laws. Others took place in so-\ncalled ``shadow'' financial markets that are outside of our existing \nlaws.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will provide the Justice \nDepartment with the resources it needs to prosecute the crimes that \nplayed a part in precipitating the crisis we are now facing. The FBI \nhas been overwhelmed by reports of mortgage fraud, now running at over \nten times the pace of a few years ago.\n  The bill authorizes $155 million a year for hiring fraud prosecutors \nand investigators at the Justice Department for 2010 and 2011, \nincluding $65 million a year for 190 additional FBI special agents and \nmore than 200 professionals to fight white collar crime.\n  In addition, this bill exposes some of the ``shadow'' financial \nsystems to the fraud laws that apply today in the better regulated \nsectors of our banking industry. It also extends antifraud protections \nto the money we are sending out under the Troubled Asset Relief Program \nand the economic stimulus package. It also amends Federal securities \nlaws to cover fraud schemes involving commodities futures and options, \nincluding so-called derivatives involving the mortgage-backed \nsecurities that caused such damage to our banking system.\n  Further, this legislation will strengthen one of the most effective \ntools to combat waste and fraud in government the False Claims Act. We \nwill need these improvements so that we can protect the taxpayer \ndollars we are using to respond to the economic crisis.\n  I hope we can move this legislation quickly. It moves against the \nroot causes of this economic crisis and improves protections for the \ntaxpayer funds we are committing to fight it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 387. A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n211 South Court Street, Rockford, Illinois, as the ``Stanley J. \nRoszkowski United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to designate the United States Courthouse at 211 South \nCourt Street, Rockford, IL, as the ``Stanley J. Roszkowski United \nStates Courthouse.''\n  Stanley Roszkowski was raised in Royalton in southern Illinois, one \nof fifteen children. During World War II, he volunteered as a nose \ngunner on a B26 bomber, flying over 25 missions in Italy and Germany. \nAfter the war he went on to earn his B.A. from the University of \nIllinois and then his law degree, working as an appliance salesman to \npay for school and meeting his wife Catherine along the way.\n  When he moved to Rockford, he opened up a successful law practice and \nbecame involved in his community. He gave up this practice when \nPresident Carter appointed him to the bench, serving for the next 20 \nyears as a Federal Judge in the Northern District of Illinois. He \nbecame known for running a business-like but relaxed courtroom, and was \npraised by his peers for being extremely knowledgeable, fair and \nobjective, and a gentleman at all times, with a wide breadth of \nexperience and an uncommon sense of decency. As one lawyer put it: \n``You couldn't ask for a better trial judge.''\n  Nobody worked harder than Stanley Roszkowski to make the United \nStates Courthouse in Rockford a reality. He spent 6 years commuting \nbetween Rockford and Chicago building up the case load at Rockford and \nbecoming Rockford's first full time Federal judge. As far back as 1992, \nhe was writing countless letters and paying numerous visits to federal \nofficials in Washington, DC, to make his case. It took many years but \nhe never gave up on his belief that if the Federal courts had a \nphysical presence in Rockford, it would be welcomed and frequently used \nby the lawyers there. He turned out to be right, and I am pleased that \nRepresentative Manzullo and I could work together to help secure the \nfunding for it.\n  Whether in a bomber or on the bench, Stanley Roszkowski has dedicated \nhis life to serving his country. I can think of no better way to honor \nhis commitment than by naming this Federal courthouse, which he worked \nso tirelessly to see built, after him. I hope my colleagues will join \nme in enacting this tribute to him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 387\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STANLEY J. ROSZKOWSKI UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The United States courthouse, located at \n     211 South Court Street, Rockford, Illinois, shall be known \n     and designated as the ``Stanley J. Roszkowski United States \n     Courthouse''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall \n     be deemed to be a reference to the ``Stanley J. Roszkowski \n     United States Courthouse''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Levin, Mr. Crapo, \n        Mr. Bond, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Enzi, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Burr, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Carper, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. \n        Barrasso):\n  S. 388. A bill to extend the termination date for the exemption of \nreturning workers from the numerical limitations for temporary workers; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S1685]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill that is \nneeded by small and seasonal businesses all over the nation. In 2005 I \nintroduced and the Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation to keep \nthese small and seasonal businesses alive. For many years they have \nrelied on the H-2B visa program to meet these needs, but this year they \ncan't get the temporary labor they need because they have been shut out \nof the H-2B visa program. That program lets them hire temporary foreign \nworkers when no American workers are available.\n  So today, I join with my colleague Senator Specter to introduce \nlegislation that provides a quick and temporary fix to the H-2B \nproblem. The Save our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act of 2009 will \nhelp these employers by extending the H-2B returning worker exemption \nfor three years. It does not raise the cap and keeps the limit at \n66,000. I urge my colleagues to work with us to pass this legislation \nquickly to save these businesses and the thousands of American jobs \nthey provide.\n  Many in this body know about the H-2B crisis--a real crisis to \nthousands of small and seasonal businesses who face a shortage of \nworkers as they approach their seasons. These small businesses count on \nthe H-2B visa program to keep their businesses afloat. But this year, \nbecause the cap was reached so early in the year, many of these \nbusinesses will be unable to get the seasonal workers that they need to \nsurvive.\n  Hitting the cap so early will have a great impact on Maryland. We \nhave a lot of summer seasonal businesses in Maryland on the Eastern \nShore, in Ocean City or working the Chesapeake Bay. Many of our \nbusinesses use the program year after year. They hire all the American \nworkers they can find, but they need additional help to meet seasonal \ndemands. Because the cap will be reached so early this year summer \nemployers face a disadvantage. They can't use the program, so they \ncan't meet their seasonal needs and many will be forced to limit \nservices, lay-off permanent U.S. workers or, worse yet, close their \ndoors.\n  These are family businesses and small businesses in small communities \nin Maryland. If the business suffers the whole community suffers. For \nseafood companies like J.M. Clayton, what they do is more than a \nbusiness, it's a way of life. Started over a century ago and run by the \ngreat grandsons of the founder, J.M. Clayton works the waters of the \nChesapeake Bay, supplying crabs, crabmeat and other seafood, including \nMaryland's famous oysters, to restaurants, markets, and wholesalers all \nover the nation. It is the oldest working crab processing plant in the \nworld and by employing 70 H-2B workers the company can retain over 50 \nfull time American workers.\n  But its not just seafood companies that have a long history on the \nEastern Shore. It's companies like S.E.W. Friel Cannery, which began \nits business over 100 years ago when there were 300 canneries on the \nEastern Shore. But now those others are gone and Friel's is the last \ncorn cannery left. Ten years ago, when the cannery could not find local \nworkers, it turned to the new H-2B visa Program. It has used the \nprogram every year since, and many workers are repeat users who come \neach year and then go home after the season. What's important is that \nhaving this help each year has not only allowed the company to maintain \nits American workforce, but it has paved the way for local workers to \nreturn to the cannery.\n  Now these employers can't just turn to the H-2B program whenever they \nwant seasonal workers. First, employers must try to vigorously recruit \nU.S. workers. These businesses try to hire American workers--they would \nlove to hire American workers. In fact, the H-2B program requires these \nbusinesses to prove that they have vigorously tried to recruit American \nworkers. They have to advertise for American workers and give American \nworkers a chance to apply. They have to prove to the Department of \nLabor that there are no U.S. workers available. Only after that are \nthey allowed to fill seasonal vacancies with H-2B visa workers. The \nworkers that they bring in often participate in the H-2B program year \nafter year. They often work for the same companies. But they cannot and \ndo not stay in the U.S. They return to their home countries, to their \nfamilies and their U.S. employer must go through the whole visa process \nagain the following year to get them back. That means an employer must \nprove again to the Department of Labor that they cannot get U.S. \nworkers.\n  This legislative fix keeps that visa process in place. It's a short-\nterm legislative fix to solve the immediate H-2B visa shortage. It does \nnot take the place of comprehensive immigration reform.\n  This legislation is a temporary 3 year fix. It exempts returning \nseasonal workers from the cap. These are workers who have already \nsuccessfully participated in the H-2B visa Program. They received a \nvisa in one of the past 3 years and have returned home to their \nfamilies after their seasonal employment with a U.S. company.\n  Everyone must still play by the rules. Employers must go through the \nwhole visa process, prove they need the seasonal help and only after \nthat are returning employees exempt from the cap. Employees must be \nthose who have left the U.S. and are requesting a new H-2B visa to come \nback for another season. This new system rewards those who have played \nby the rules, worked hard and successfully participated in the program. \nThe bill gives a helping hand to businesses by allowing them to retain \nworkers who they have already trained to do their seasonal jobs.\n  This is a quick and simple fix. It lasts three years. And it does not \nget in the way of comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I worked with my colleagues to get a bill with strong bi-partisan \nsupport. A bill that would work.\n  This bill is realistic. It provides a temporary solution because \nimmediate action is needed to help these small and seasonal businesses \nstay in business. Yes--we need to help them now. Their seasons start \nsoon. If they don't get seasonal workers this year, there may not be \nany businesses around next year to help.\n  Every member of the Senate who has heard from their constituents--\nwhether they are seafood processors, landscapers, resorts, timber \ncompanies, fisheries, pool companies or carnivals--knows the urgency in \ntheir voices, knows the immediacy of the problem and knows that the \nCongress must act now to save these businesses. I urge my colleagues to \njoin this effort, support the Save our Small and Seasonal Businesses \nAct, and push this Congress to fix the problem today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 388\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a conditional stay of the ban on lead in \nchildren's products, and for `other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to introduce important legislation \ntoday.\n  Last year, this body passed the Consumer Product Safety Improvement \nAct. Overall, I think this was a good bill, and will contribute to \nimproving our children's safety.\n\n[[Page S1686]]\n\n  However, as is the case sometimes, we are now learning about some of \nthe unintended consequences arising from that legislation. I've heard \nfrom Utahns who are very concerned that parts of the act are going to \nput them out of business and harm those that benefit from their \nproducts and services.\n  Next week, as part of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, a \nnew lead standard for products goes into effect. The act makes it \nillegal to sell products that contain more lead than the new standard \nallows--it classifies those products as banned hazardous substances. \nThe new standard should help protect our children from the harmful \neffects of lead poisoning.\n  The act also requires manufacturers to use accredited third-party \nlaboratories to certify the safety of their products made for children \nages 12 and under. If you don't test the product, you can't sell it. \nThis makes perfect sense.\n  But here's the problem: while resellers of those products are exempt \nfrom the testing requirements of the legislation, they are not exempt \nfrom the penalties associated with violating the act. Violations can \nresult in criminal punishment of up to $250,000 and 5 years in prison, \nand civil liability up to $15 million. All of this is scheduled to go \ninto effect on February 10th of this year--less than one week from \ntoday.\n  However, the Consumer Product Safety Commission understands there are \nproblems associated with the act. I met with Acting Commissioner Nancy \nNord last Friday about these issues. We discussed both the act's \npotential problems and the importance of maintaining public safety. \nThat same day, her organization postponed the testing and certification \nrequirements of the act for one year. They needed additional time to \nfinalize the rules, and issue clearer guidance on how businesses should \ncomply with the law. Congress gave them the discretion to do this.\n  However, and this is the problem, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission doesn't have the discretion to postpone the actual \nstandard--how much lead is legally allowable in certain products. So \nyou have a situation where the agency is not enforcing the standard by \nrequiring testing and certification while at the same time, the \ncompanies that have products in their inventory that exceed the lead \nstandard are subject to both criminal and civil penalties. As one who \nran his own business, I can tell you that this makes no sense.\n  The legislation that I introduce here today will remedy this seeming \ncontradiction. My legislation gives the commission the authority, if it \ndetermines it's necessary, to also delay implementing the new lead \nstandards until they have finalized the rules and begin to enforce the \nlaw. If the commission were to exercise those authorities, it would \ngive both Congress and the Consumer Product Safety Commission enough \ntime to really evaluate the effects of this legislation, particularly \non our small businesses and thrift enterprises, and implement something \nthat actually makes sense.\n  You must understand that I am not opposed to the new lead standards \nor keeping our children safe. My bill is not mandating a year delay; \nit's simply giving the commission that authority. In the meantime, we \nmust craft some sort of compromise before this well-intended law wreaks \nhavoc upon many of our small businesses and those in the thrift \nindustry that serve the lower income in our country.\n  Let me explain some of the problems associated with the CPSIA.\n  Some of my constituents who are concerned about this bill are running \nsmall businesses out of their homes to supplement their family income \nduring these difficult economic times. One constituent, Katie Erwin, \nrecently wrote to my office to tell me her personal experience. She \ndesigns and makes baby dresses that are sold on the Internet. Her \ndresses require the use of many fabrics, buttons, snaps, and elastic \nmaterials. She has done her research into what her business will have \nto do after the CPSIA becomes law. Even though she uses only materials \nthat have been proven to have safe lead content, she has to have her \nend product tested. Not just each dress, but each element of each \ndress. At $75 per test, one dress could end up costing $750. She told \nus that, in order to be compliant, the dresses would be so expensive \nthat she'd never make a profit. And that is if she could even sell the \nmore expensive dresses. Other small and home-based businesses tell the \nsame story. Many fear going out of business, and don't know how to cope \nwith the new enforcement.\n  The Ogden Rescue Mission in northern Utah has two thrift stores that \nhave been around for decades selling used goods. The owner has made it \nclear that he will stop selling any children's products on February 10 \nbecause he doesn't want to break the law or be held liable for \ninadvertently selling a now-illegal product. Companies risk losing \ntheir insurance if they accidentally sell an unsafe product. With the \nnew standards required by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, \nthe chance of that happening is almost certain. I have to believe that \nlarger thrift stores like Deseret Industries, the Salvation Army, and \nGoodwill Industries will all have similar concerns once the Act is \nfully understood and implemented.\n  Remember, these companies are going to be subject to criminal \npenalties and civilly liable for products they sell that exceed the \nstandard, including the resellers whom the law exempts from the testing \nand certification requirements. Again, five years in prison, $250,000 \nin criminal penalties and $15 million in civil penalties.\n  At a time when we are debating how to stimulate the economy and keep \nbusinesses afloat, we should not overlook this problem that has the \npotential to cost our economy millions of dollars in litigation costs \nand many, many jobs if it is not implemented in the right way. During \nan economic downturn like the one we are experiencing, thrift stores \nand others that sell used goods are going to be more important than \never. Let's make sure they are able to serve our communities by \nproviding the commission with the tools necessary to work out the \nproblems associated with implementing the CPSIA.\n  I hope the Senate expeditiously considers my legislation. I think \nthis approach makes sense, and will ultimately help the commission to \nbetter implement this law. I understand others may have different \napproaches to resolving the same problem, and I would invite a \ndiscussion of this issue during the coming weeks with my colleagues so \nwe can fix it quickly before we do irreparable damage to businesses \nacross the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/05/senate-section/article/S1686-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1686-S1687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 28--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE \n                           ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nIndian Affairs; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to provide greater efficiencies to what I believe is a \nbroken process for consideration of the budget resolution. The need for \nreform is based on the most recent consideration of the budget \nresolution on March 13, 2008, when the Senate conducted 44 stacked roll \ncall votes in one day--the so-called ``vote-a-rama.'' With the 44 \nstacked votes, the frequent unavailability of amendment text in advance \nso there could be no analysis and preparation, the chamber full of \nSenators, the unusual noise level, the constant banging of the gavel by \nthe Presiding Officer, the near impossibility of hearing even just the \n2 minutes allotted for discussion, and consideration of matters \nentirely unrelated to the budget, I believe the process needs reform. \nThe resolution I am introducing today is based on a proposal previously \nsubmitted by Senator Robert Byrd, whom most would agree is our most-\nknowledgeable Senator on parliamentary procedure. The Byrd proposal \nseeks to correct these problems I have cited by imposing several new \nrules designed to foster greater transparency and efficiency on a \nbudget resolution.\n  Under the budget rules, once all debate time has been used or yielded \nback, the Senate must take action to agree to or to dispose of pending \namendments before considering final passage. This scenario creates a \ndizzying process of voting on numerous amendments in a stacked \nsequence, often referred to as a ``vote-a-rama.'' During the course of \nthe ``vote-a-rama'', dozens of votes may occur with little or no \nexplanation, often leaving Senators with insufficient information or \ntime to deliberate and evaluate the merits of an issue prior to casting \na vote. By consent, the Senate has typically allowed 2 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided, prior to votes. However, the budget process \ndoes not require Senators to file their amendments prior to their \nconsideration. In many instances, members are voting on amendments on \nwhich the text has never been made available. This difficult working \nenvironment is further compounded by a chamber full of Senators and the \nconstant banging of the gavel by the presiding officer to maintain \norder. This unusual noise level makes it nearly impossible to hear the \none minute of debate per side.\n  The Budget Act of 1974 outlines the many clearly defined rules for \nconsideration of a budget resolution, including debate time and \ngermaneness. Despite these rules, the Senate has often set aside these \nrules and found clever ways to circumvent the rules. To restore some \norder to the process, the resolution I am offering today would require \nfirst-degree amendments to be filed at the desk with the Journal Clerk \nprior to the 10th hour of debate. Accordingly, second-degree amendments \nmust be filed prior to the 20th hour of debate. This legislation would \nrequire a budget resolution to be set aside for one calendar day prior \nto the 40th hour of debate. Doing so would allow all filed amendments \nto be printed in the Record allowing Senators, and their staff, an \nopportunity for review before debate on the resolution continues. To \npreserve the integrity of these new rules, debate time may only be \nyielded back by consent, instead of the current procedure whereby time \nmay be yielded at the discretion of either side.\n  Another problem has been the subversion with the budget's germaneness \nrules by offering amendments to deal with authorization and substantive \npolicy changes. It is important to remember that the Federal budget has \ntwo distinct but equally important purposes: the first is to provide a \nfinancial measure of Federal expenditures, receipts, deficits, and debt \nlevels; and the second is to provide the means for the Federal \nGovernment to efficiently collect and allocate resources. To keep the \ndebate focused, amendments to the budget resolution must be germane, \nmeaning those which strike, increase or decrease numbers, or add \nlanguage that restricts some power in the resolution. Otherwise, a \npoint of order lies against the amendment, and 60 votes are required to \nwaive the point of order. Yet, to circumvent this germaneness \nrequirement and inject debate on substantive policy changes, Senators \nhave offered Sense of the Senate amendments and deficit-neutral reserve \nfund amendments that include exorbitant programmatic detail.\n  A sense of the Senate amendment allows a Senator to force members to \neither support or oppose any policy position they seek to propose. An \nexcerpt of an amendment to the FY09 budget resolution follows:\n\n       Vitter Amendment #4299:\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the leadership of the Senate should bring to the floor \n     for full debate in 2008 comprehensive legislation that \n     legalizes the importation of prescription drugs from highly \n     industrialized countries with safe pharmaceutical \n     infrastructures and creates a regulatory pathway to ensure \n     that such drugs are safe; (2) such legislation should be \n     given an up or down vote on the floor of the Senate; and (3) \n     previous Senate approval of 3 amendments in support of \n     prescription drug importation shows the Senate's strong \n     support for\n\n[[Page S1688]]\n\n     passage of comprehensive importation legislation.\n\n  The use of sense of the Senate amendments on the budget resolution \nhas been discouraged in recent years because they have little relevance \nto the intended purpose of the budget resolution. As a result, it has \nbecome increasingly popular to offer deficit-neutral reserve fund \namendments. Prior to the fiscal year 06 budget resolution, reserve \nfunds were used sparingly. In fiscal year 07, 22 were included in the \nSenate resolution and 8 in the House resolution; in fiscal year 08, 38 \nwere included in the Senate resolution and 23 in the conference report; \nand in fiscal year 09, 31 were included in the Senate resolution.\n  Deficit-neutral reserve funds--which are specifically permitted by \nsection 301(b)(7) of the Budget Act of 1974--have an important \nfunctional use in the budget process, but do not require extensive \nprogrammatic detail to be useful. On the speculation that Congress may \nenact legislation on a particular issue--perhaps ``immigration,'' \n``energy,'' or ``health care''--a reserve fund acts as a \n``placeholder'' to allow the Chairman of the Budget Committee to later \nrevise the spending and revenue levels in the budget so that the future \ndeficit-neutral legislation would not be vulnerable to budgetary points \nof order. Absent a reserve fund, legislation which increases revenues \nto offset increases in direct spending would be subject to a Budget Act \npoint of order because certain overall budget levels, total revenues, \ntotal new budget authority, total outlays, or total revenues and \noutlays of Social Security, or budgetary levels specific to authorizing \ncommittees and the appropriations committee, committee allocations, \nwould be breached.\n  However, it is unnecessary to include extensive programmatic detail \ninto the language of a deficit-neutral reserve fund for it to be useful \nat a later date. An excerpt of an amendment to the fiscal year 09 \nbudget resolution demonstrates the unnecessary level of programmatic \ndetail that I refer to:\n\n       Sessions Amendment #4231:\n       DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR BORDER SECURITY, \n     IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT, AND CRIMINAL ALIEN REMOVAL PROGRAMS.\n       (a) In General.--The Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate may revise the allocations of 1 or more \n     committees, aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this \n     resolution by the amounts authorized to be appropriated for \n     the programs described in paragraphs (1) through (6) in 1 or \n     more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions, or \n     conference reports that funds border security, immigration \n     enforcement, and criminal alien removal programs, including \n     programs that--\n       (1) expand the zero tolerance prosecution policy for \n     illegal entry (commonly known as ``Operation Streamline'') to \n     all 20 border sectors;\n       (2) complete the 700 miles of pedestrian fencing required \n     under section 102(b)(1) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1103 note);\n       (3) deploy up to 6,000 National Guard members to the \n     southern border of the United States;\n       (4) evaluate the 27 percent of the Federal, State, and \n     local prison populations who are noncitizens in order to \n     identify removable criminal aliens;\n       (5) train and reimburse State and local law enforcement \n     officers under Memorandums of Understanding entered into \n     under section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)); or\n       (6) implement the exit data portion of the US-VISIT entry \n     and exit data system at airports, seaports, and land ports of \n     entry.\n\n  Voting on amendments that advocate substantive policy changes in the \ncontext of a budget debate are a subversion of the budget's germaneness \nrequirements and clearly fall outside the jurisdiction of the Budget \nCommittee. In many instances, the programmatic detail is of a \ncontroversial nature, such as a recent amendment to ``provide for a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for transferring funding for Berkeley, CA, \nearmarks to the Marine Corps'', Coburn Amendment #4380.\n  To bring the focus back to the budget, my legislation states that \n``provisions contained in a budget resolution, or amendments thereto, \nshall not include programmatic detail not within the jurisdiction of \nthe Senate Committee on the Budget.'' It is my hope that this language \nwill bring about a change in practice in the Senate whereby Senators \nwill avoid including excessive programmatic detail in their reserve \nfund amendments. Doing so will put the focus back on the important \npurposes of a budget resolution.\n  The provisions in my legislation may be waived or suspended in the \nSenate only by an affirmative vote of \\3/5\\ of the Members. Also, an \naffirmative vote of \\3/5\\ of the Members of the Senate is required in \nthe Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point \nof order raised under this section.\n  I commend the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee for their hard work in processing amendments to the budget \nresolution. Unfortunately, the process needs reforms to provide \nstructure and to increase transparency and efficiency. The 44 roll call \nvotes conducted in relation to S. Con. Res. 70 are the largest number \nof votes held in one session dating back to 1964, according to records \nmaintained by the Senate Historical Office. The Senate cast more votes \non the budget in one day than it had previously cast all year on \nvarious other issues.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MAINTAINING ACCESS \n                   TO MEDICAID DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Medicaid is a vital safety-net for nearly 60,000,000 \n     low-income Americans. In times of economic downturn, Medicaid \n     becomes even more important for working families.\n       (2) The current national unemployment rate is 7.2 percent, \n     and many States are above the national average. Experts \n     believe that unemployment could rise to 9 percent or even \n     higher before the economy turns around.\n       (3) If the unemployment rate averages between 8 and 9 \n     percent during the next 2\\1/2\\ years as is currently \n     projected, States will face an estimated funding gap of \n     approximately $94,000,000,000 in Medicaid and the Children's \n     Health Insurance Program (CHIP) during that period, according \n     to the most recent Urban Institute and Kaiser Family \n     Foundation study.\n       (4) States are struggling to cope with increasing Medicaid \n     enrollment and decreasing State revenues. The Congressional \n     Budget Office has projected Medicaid enrollment growth of \n     nearly 9 percent in fiscal year 2009 alone.\n       (5) According to the Government Accountability Office, \n     State and local fiscal pressures have led to an estimated \n     $312,000,000,000 operating deficit in State and local \n     governments over the next 2 years, which will \n     disproportionately impact Medicaid.\n       (6) States need greater financial support from the Federal \n     Government, not less financial support and more restrictions \n     that make providing quality care to those most in need more \n     difficult.\n       (7) This Act includes $90,000,000,000 in Medicaid relief to \n     States, $87,000,000,000 in relief through an increase in the \n     Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) and \n     $3,000,000,000 in reimbursement to States for expenditures \n     for providing medical assistance to disabled individuals that \n     should have been paid for by the Medicare program.\n       (8) The Medicaid relief in the Act will fill a significant \n     portion of the expected gaps in Medicaid funding over the \n     next 27 months and allow States to protect eligibility, \n     benefits and provider payments.\n       (9) Adding additional restrictions on a State's ability to \n     receive Medicaid relief moves in the wrong direction.\n       (10) Any maintenance of effort for eligibility should be \n     straightforward, as it was in the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-27), so that \n     States and the Federal Government can avoid conflicts over \n     questions related to applicable aspects of eligibility \n     policies and so that States may still undertake activities \n     intended to streamline eligibility procedures which in turn \n     could result in cost efficiencies.\n       (11) Requiring States to ensure certain provider payment \n     and benefit levels, in addition to the income eligibility \n     requirements already in the Act, means that some States will \n     simply decline the Federal help and cut their Medicaid \n     programs even more drastically than they already have.\n       (12) According to the Congressional Budget Office, adding \n     provider payment and benefit maintenance of effort provisions \n     will either reduce the overall FMAP amount to States by more \n     than $12,000,000,000 or increase the amount that States have \n     to spend on Medicaid.\n       (13) It is inefficient to spend vital coverage dollars on \n     provider payment and benefit restorations that States are \n     likely to do on their own, without such additional \n     requirements.\n       (14) Medicaid provider payment issues require a longer-term \n     solution that addresses the historical problems with Medicaid \n     provider payments, which is why Congress created the Medicaid \n     and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) in the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of \n     2009.\n       (15) Any additional maintenance of effort requirements will \n     penalize States in desperate need of relief to keep their \n     Medicaid programs operating and will reduce the number of \n     families covered during this economic downturn.\n       (16) Providers, including physicians, community health \n     centers, and hospitals, are already receiving significant \n     relief in other areas of this Act.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Medicaid relief is an essential part of economic \n     recovery;\n       (2) States are required, as a condition for receiving FMAP \n     relief, to report to the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services on the use of the FMAP relief funds, which will \n     alert the Secretary to any ongoing problems with access to \n     benefits;\n       (3) Congress created the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and \n     Access Commission (MACPAC) to take a longer-term look at \n     Medicaid benefits and access; and\n       (4) additional Medicaid maintenance of effort provisions, \n     as requirements for receiving FMAP relief, are unnecessary \n     and should not be added to the Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 426.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the deterioration of financial firms in 2008 and the \n     resulting crisis of confidence in the financial markets have \n     required broad intervention by the Federal Government in the \n     financial sector;\n       (2) the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, \n     signed by President Bush on October 3, 2008, included a \n     $700,000,000,000 Troubled Asset Relief Program (or ``TARP'') \n     for the express purpose of ``providing stability to and \n     preventing disruption in the economy and financial system'';\n       (3) the investment and commercial banks and other financial \n     institutions that have received taxpayer-funded bailouts \n     perform public functions supporting the operation of the \n     economy, in addition to their private profit-making \n     functions;\n       (4) reports of billions of dollars in obligations to \n     executives have eroded public confidence in the TARP, and \n     have caused increasing opposition to other bailout proposals, \n     thereby impeding the Government's ability to address the \n     financial crisis;\n       (5) participation in the TARP and any other Federal \n     Government bailout program should be conditioned on a fair \n     restructuring of executive compensation obligations;\n       (6) taxpayer dollars should not unreasonably compensate \n     executives, particularly when in the absence of such relief, \n     such compensation would be reduced as part of a bankruptcy \n     restructuring or liquidation; and\n       (7) establishing a due process forum will allow the \n     Government to ensure that executive compensation relying on \n     taxpayer funds is fair and reasonable.\n\n     SEC. 6003.

If, after an audit authorized by this title, the \n     Advocate finds reason to believe that any assisted entity \n     would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection \n     under title 11, United States Code, if not for the receipt of \n     assistance under the TARP, the Advocate shall negotiate a \n     reduction in the executive compensation obligations of the \n     assisted entity as a condition of the continuing use or \n     future receipt of such TARP assistance.\n       (b) Form.--Negotiated reductions in compensation under \n     subsection (a)--\n       (1) may include vested deferred compensation; and\n       (2) shall be in an amount that is fair and reasonable in \n     light of the taxpayers' assistance, but not less than the \n     estimated value of the compensation obligations that would \n     face the estate or debtor-in-possession if the TARP funds had \n     not been granted and the entity had filed for bankruptcy \n     protection.\n       (c) Certification to Adjustment Panel.--The Advocate shall \n     certify the findings of the Office under this section to the \n     Panel.\n\n     SEC. 6007.

The \n     determination of what is fair and reasonable shall be made in \n     light of the taxpayers' assistance to the company, the risk \n     of bankruptcy and loss of such benefits and obligations, and \n     the need for adequate compensation to attract competent \n     management.\n\n     SEC. 6008.

LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Chairperson shall establish a \n     systematic foreclosure prevention and mortgage modification \n     program, in consultation with the Secretaries, that--\n       (1) provides lenders and loan servicers with compensation \n     to cover administrative costs for each eligible mortgage \n     modified according to the required standards; and\n       (2) provides loss sharing or guarantees for certain losses \n     incurred if a modified eligible mortgage should subsequently \n     redefault.\n       (b) Program Components.--The program established under \n     subsection (a) shall include the following components:\n       (1) Exclusion for early payment default.--To promote \n     sustainable mortgages, loss sharing or guarantees under the \n     program shall be available only after the borrower has made a \n     specified minimum number of payments on the modified \n     mortgage, as determined by the Chairperson.\n       (2) Standard net present value test.--In order to promote \n     consistency and simplicity in implementation and auditing \n     under the program, the Chairperson shall prescribe and \n     require lenders and loan servicers to apply a standardized \n     net present value analysis for participating lenders and loan \n     servicers that compares the expected net present value of \n     modifying past due mortgage loans with the net present value \n     of foreclosing on such mortgage loans. The Chairperson shall \n     use standard industry assumptions to ensure that a consistent \n     standard for affordability is provided, based on a ratio of \n     the borrower's mortgage-related expenses to gross monthly \n     income specified by the Chairperson.\n       (3) Systematic loan review by participating lenders and \n     servicers.--\n       (A) Requirement.--Any lender or loan servicer that \n     participates in the program shall be required--\n       (i) to undertake a systematic review of all of the eligible \n     mortgage loans under its management;\n       (ii) to subject each such eligible mortgage loan to the \n     standard net present value test prescribed by the Chairperson \n     to determine whether it is suitable for modification under \n     the program; and\n       (iii) to offer modifications for all eligible mortgages \n     that meet such test.\n       (B) Disqualification.--Any lender or loan servicer that \n     fails to undertake a systematic review and to carry out \n     modifications where they are justified, as required by \n     subparagraph (A), shall be disqualified from further \n     participation in the program, pending proof of compliance \n     with subparagraph (A).\n       (4) Modifications.--Modifications to eligible mortgages \n     under the program may include--\n       (A) reduction in interest rates and fees;\n       (B) term or amortization extensions;\n       (C) forbearance or forgiveness of principal; and\n       (D) other similar modifications, as determined appropriate \n     by the Chairperson.\n       (5) Loss share calculation.--In order to ensure the \n     administrative efficiency and effective operation of the \n     program and to provide adequate incentive to lenders and loan \n     servicers to modify eligible mortgages and avoid unnecessary \n     foreclosures, the Chairperson shall define appropriate \n     standardized measures for loss sharing or guarantees.\n       (6) De minimis test.--The Chairperson shall implement a de \n     minimis test to exclude from loss sharing under the program \n     any modification that does not lower the monthly loan payment \n     to the borrower by at least 7 to 15 percent, at the \n     determination of the Chairperson.\n       (7) Time limit on loss sharing payment.--At the \n     determination of the Chairperson, a loss sharing guarantee \n     under the program shall terminate between 5 and 15 years \n     after the date on which the mortgage modification is \n     consummated, as determined by the Chairperson.\n\n     SEC. 1703. ALTERNATIVE COMPONENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Chairperson may, with the approval of \n     the Secretaries, and after making the certifications to \n     Congress required by subsection (b), implement foreclosure \n     prevention and mitigation actions other than those authorized \n     under section 1702.\n       (b) Certification to Congress.--The Chairperson shall \n     certify to Congress that the Chairperson believes the \n     alternative foreclosure mitigation actions would provide \n     equivalent or greater impact or have a more cost-effective \n     impact on foreclosure mitigation than those authorized under \n     section 1702. Such certification shall contain quantitative \n     projections of the benefit of pursuing the alternative \n     actions in place of or in addition to the actions authorized \n     under section 1702.\n\n     SEC. 1704.
