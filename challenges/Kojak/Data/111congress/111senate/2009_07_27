Mr. President, there are many who suffer from our broken \nhealth care system, and many who will benefit when we fix it. Counted \namong those are the increasing numbers of Americans who go to work \nevery day in small businesses. The vast majority of jobs in America \ntoday are not with the huge companies but with small businesses. Owners \nand employees alike of small businesses are getting a raw deal. They \nare paying more for their health insurance, if they have it at all.\n  Small businesses in big cities and small towns across the country \nplay an immeasurable role in sculpting how the future will look. These \nare the entrepreneurs who innovate, invent, and fuel our economy. They \nare the visionaries who help create jobs and cultivate ideas.\n  We, in turn, must help nurture these businesses. We should be making \nit easier for them to grow and to succeed. But if we keep the status \nquo--if we do not act--we will be making it harder. The White House's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers has found that when a small business buys \nthe same health insurance plan as a big business, the small business \npays significantly more per worker. The consequence of this inequity is \nvery clear: A small business owner who has to pay more to keep his or \nher employees covered has to cut corners somewhere else. Maybe they pay \ntheir employees lower wages or salaries. Maybe they have to use more of \ntheir profits to pay for health care and have less to spend on the \nresearch and development that will help their ideas become realities. \nMaybe they need to buy new equipment or invest in new technologies but \ncannot because of the crushing costs of health care. Maybe they lay off \nmore hard-working Americans than they ordinarily would.\n  What if the expense they choose to sacrifice is health care itself? \nAnd that happens so often. Almost 100 percent of large businesses--\nthose with more than 200 employees--offer health benefits. But fewer \nthan half of businesses with nine or fewer employees can afford to do \nthe same, and that number is shrinking.\n  When we reform health care, we will level the playing field for small \nbusinesses. We will give employees more choices and better plans from \nwhich to choose. We will give owners tax credits so they can afford to \ncover their workers. We will make it easier for existing small \nbusinesses to succeed. We will make it easier for more entrepreneurs to \nstart their own new companies. And we will make it easier for more \nAmericans to afford to work there and stay healthy at the same time--\nall in this small business atmosphere.\n  Reforming health care--and doing it the right way--is not just a \nhealth issue, it is also an economic issue. That\n\n[[Page S8104]]\n\nis why we will continue in the coming weeks and months to reform health \ncare in a way that protects what works and fixes what does not. It is \nwhy we are committed to getting this right, not just getting it done by \nan arbitrary deadline.\n  While we work on health care, we will also tackle other priorities on \nour plate. Over the next 2 weeks, we are going to complete at least two \nappropriations bills that invest in our Nation and support programs \nthat will help our economy grow.\n  This week we will pass the Energy and Water appropriations bill and \nstart the very important Agriculture appropriations bill. Both of these \nbills are important. The Energy and Water appropriations bill will help \ndevelop safe, homegrown energy sources that reduce our dangerous \nreliance on oil. The Agriculture appropriations bill, which invests \nsignificantly in nutrition programs, school lunch programs, food and \ndrug safety, and international food aid, is important.\n  We also need to keep existing and successful programs alive so they \ncan continue to succeed. These include the highway trust fund, the \nunemployment trust fund, the Federal Housing Authority, Ginnie Mae, and \nbenefits for retirees of the Postal Service. All these extensions we \nhave to take care of before we leave. So let me be clear: We are not \nlooking to expand a single one of the programs I have just talked \nabout. We merely must keep them running.\n  We will also revisit the Travel Promotion Act--a solid, important \nbipartisan bill that will create tens of thousands of new jobs, cut our \ndeficit by almost a half a billion dollars, and help our economy \nrecover in every single State in the Union.\n  We will confirm President Barack Obama's outstanding nominee for the \nSupreme Court, Judge Sonia Sotomayor.\n  With the cooperation of both Republicans and Democrats, and with a \ncommitment to crafting productive policy rather than playing political \ngames, we can finish this work and this work period strongly. I am \nconfident we will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8104-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, what I wish to talk about today is the \nsubject that probably more than any other is on the minds of the \nAmerican people and certainly probably the No. 1 item on the agenda of \nmost of us in the House and the Senate; namely, what we do about the \nescalating cost of health care in America and the need for all \nAmericans to have access to coverage.\n  Those two questions are animating a debate which has captured the \ntime of the people in the House and the Senate, who represent to the \nAmerican people, and, as we have found more and more--and I found out \nthis weekend when I was back in my home State--the attention of our \nconstituents.\n  Let me begin by saying, I think that is good.\n  There was a question about whether the Congress would pass \nlegislation on the House floor or the Senate floor before the beginning \nof the August recess. Most of us on this side of the aisle felt it \nwould be beneficial if we could go back home and take the month of \nAugust, when we are supposed to be home visiting with our constituents, \nto have some townhall meetings and other fora, and engage them in a \nconversation about what they think the best ideas are. Because, at the \nend of the day, legislation this important, that is going to affect \nevery single American, needs to be well understood by them. And we \nneed, as their representatives, to get their input on what they think \nis a good idea.\n  The reality is that very few, if any, Members of either the House or \nthe Senate have read the major bills yet, let alone be able to post \nthem on the Internet so the American people can see them or get them in \nsome kind of hard copy for other people to understand, evaluate them, \nand discuss them with the American people.\n  Anything this important cannot be done quickly. It has to be done \nright. And the first principle is: People need to understand what it \nis. I have found--and I confess, first of all, I have not read the \nthree House bills nor have I read the HELP Committee bill, the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee bill. I have read a great deal \nof what has come out of the Finance Committee. But there is no bill put \ntogether in the Finance Committee yet.\n  The thing that strikes me is the complexity and the degree of \ngovernment takeover involved. I can't begin, in the brief period of \ntime I have, to describe all the different ways in which the government \nwould take over the key decisions about health insurance and health \ncare in America if these bills were to pass. They are replete with \nreferences to the most minute things about people's health that the \ngovernment will then be taking over.\n  There are major decisions being made here. We don't know the \nramifications of them all. Among other things, the cost. One thing we \nare learning is ideas Members have about reducing costs don't translate \ninto actual cost reduction because the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich is the entity we have charged with the obligation of telling us \nhow much these things cost, has come back with estimates that are very \nlow in terms of savings and very high in terms of cost. For example, in \nthe main bill in the House of Representatives, the deficit is increased \nby $240 billion, and in the bill that has come through the HELP \nCommittee in the Senate, the deficit is increased by $600 billion.\n  Nor has the CBO been able to find much savings. I think it was last \nFriday that they examined the latest idea to come to the White House; \nnamely, to put a group in charge--it used to be called MedPAC, but it \nwould have a different name now--and they would be in charge of \nidentifying what coverage for federal programs there was and how much \nwould be reimbursed to the providers. Unless both Houses of Congress \naffirmatively voted to reject those recommendations, they would \nautomatically go into effect.\n  Well, apart from the obvious concerns about that, CBO came back and \nsaid it will only save perhaps $2 billion over 10 years, which is a \ndrop in the bucket when given the over $1 trillion cost of the \nlegislation in the House, when it is fully implemented, $2 trillion \ncost to the Senate bill.\n  I mention this simply to point out the order-of-magnitude issue we \nhave facing us: a hugely complex subject; huge amounts of money to be \nspent, big increases in the deficit, lots of new taxes proposed to help \npay for it, and ramifications that will affect all of us in terms of \nthe health care we are entitled to receive. Because of the amount of \ngovernment involvement in both what insurance can and cannot cover as \nwell as what the government programs such as Medicare can and cannot \ncover, every American will be affected in terms of the health care our \nphysician says our family or we need but which the government says not \nnecessarily can we receive from our physician; in other words, putting \nthe government between the patient and the physician. That will result \nin delay and denial of care and outright rationing of health care. This \nis something that is also of concern to the American people.\n  When we take $500 billion in proposed cuts from Medicare at the same \ntime we are adding a brandnew group of baby boom generation retirees, \nthere\n\n[[Page S8105]]\n\ncan be only one result: a cut in health care for seniors. So seniors \nalso have a right to be concerned. Young people have a right to be \nconcerned when we say that in order to reduce the cost of insurance for \nthe sickest people, we are going to put everybody in the same pool, \nbasically, and they will all get the same basic insurance premium or at \nleast within a dictated range. The sticker shock for younger people in \nAmerica is going to be incredible. They are going to see their premiums \nincrease. So for many people, the cost of health care is not going to \ngo down, it is going to go up.\n  Very few people believe we can actually reduce the cost of something \nby putting the government in charge of it.\n  The final issue people are concerned about after the cost of it, the \nincrease in deficits, the increased taxes to pay for it, the fact that \nit will result in delay and denial of care, is the fact that it will \nnot enable people to keep what they have. This is one of the reasons \nthe President has said so many times that if you like your insurance, \nyou get to keep it. The President is wrong when he says that. He hasn't \nread the bills. On this I will take just a little bit of time because \nhe is wrong on two counts.\n  First of all, the statement comes with significant conditions; \nsecond, it comes with an expiration date. There are two primary reasons \nwhy it is not true that if you like your insurance, you get to keep it. \nLet's back up a little bit. According to a Fox News survey, 91 percent \nof Americans say they have health insurance. Eighty-four percent of \nthem rate their insurance as either good or excellent. This is why the \nPresident makes the comment ``If you like it, you get to keep it,'' \nbecause most Americans have it and they like it, they want to keep it, \nand they don't want to sacrifice their coverage in order to solve some \nof the other problems that are inherent in our system. But the promise, \nas I said, is not true.\n  First of all, what the President and our Democratic colleagues want \nis what they call a public option--a government-run insurance company--\nto compete with other insurance companies. To the extent that a lot of \nAmericans don't particularly like insurance companies--and I must \nconfess there are some things insurance companies do that I don't \nlike--it is easy to put them out there as a target and say, as the \nPresident has said, we need somebody to keep them honest.\n  Well, let's examine that for a moment. Do we need to have a \ngovernment-run business in every business in America in order to keep \nthe privately run businesses honest? In the first place, the health \ninsurance industry is the most regulated--or one of the most \nregulated--industries in America. Every State regulates the health \ninsurance that is issued in their State. They don't need to be kept \nhonest by a competitor from the government. In the second place, having \nthe regulator--the government--also be a competitor has its obvious \nlimitations. It won't be long before the other competitors are put out \nof business. I think most people who look at this say that is exactly \nwhat would happen.\n  But it also represents a point of view that I find very troubling. I \nknow the government has now taken over our biggest automobile \nmanufacturers. It has gotten into the business of other insurance. It \nhas gotten into the business of banking. It has gotten into the \nbusiness of student loans; in fact, it now has a monopoly in that. But \nI can't believe the American people want there to be a government \nbusiness to compete with private businesses in other elements of our \neconomy. That is socialism. I don't think the administration wants to \ndo that. Certainly, the American people don't want to. So why would you \nhave a government competitor in the private market? For one reason \nonly, and most people who are honest about this acknowledge that it is \nin order to have the government take over health care. It is called \nsingle payer. There is a group in America that wants single payer very \nbadly.\n  Members of Congress have said: Well, we can't get there in one giant \nstep; the American people won't stand for that. It is going to take two \nsteps. First, we will create a very powerful government-run insurance \ncompany to compete with private business and eventually put them out of \nbusiness and then we will have one insurance company for all of \nAmerica. It will be a government company, and there won't be any more \nprivate companies, at least to speak of. So it is a two-step process. \nThat is the hidden agenda of those who want a government-run insurance \ncompany. There is no other reason to have one.\n  We have 1,300 insurance companies in America. We don't need yet one \nmore competitor. They sell thousands of different kinds of insurance \npolicies. We don't need yet one more competitor. Honesty is not the \nissue. We have a highly regulated industry by the States and by the \nFederal Government. The only reason to have it is to put the private \ninsurers out of business.\n  Is that what would happen? How does this relate to people who like \ntheir insurance and won't get to keep it? Well, the Lewin Group, which \nis a highly respected, nonpartisan health care think tank, says that \nwithin a couple years, we will have 119 million people on the \ngovernment-run insurance plan, 88 million of whom were previously \ninsured by private business. In other words, 88 million people will \nlose their coverage because it is much cheaper to have the government-\nrun plan take care of them than for their employer to continue to do \nso. As much as their employer likes the employees, if it is \nsubstantially cheaper to provide health care to them by paying the fine \nthat the bills have--$750 per employee, 8 percent of the payroll tax; \nthere are different fines in here--it is still cheaper for the business \nto pay the fine than it is to pay the health care they are currently \nproviding. So 88 million people: Sorry; even if you like your health \ncare, you don't get to keep it, according to the Lewin Group. I think \ntheir estimate is, if anything, conservative.\n\n  There is a second reason why if you like your insurance you won't be \nable to keep it. Those who are not insured by larger businesses--the \nones whom I have just been talking about--but by smaller businesses or \nwho are self-insured, there is an expiration date on this promise. \nAfter 5 years, you don't get to keep it and probably sooner than that. \nBecause if there is a change in your policy or if the insurance company \nenrolls anybody else in it, then automatically it loses its protected \nor grandfathered status and is now under the regulatory regime that is \nestablished by these bills. That regulatory regime will totally change \nwhat that insurance coverage is. They dictate what is covered, what \nisn't covered, what the premiums are, what the companies can make, and \na whole host of other things. So even though you may like your \ninsurance, you are not going to get to keep it because no plan is \nstatic; that is to say, it never enrolls any more people and it never \nchanges any of its terms. If either of those two things happen under \nthe House bill, you lose your insurance. So it is not true that if you \nlike your insurance, you get to keep it.\n  That is the final reason people are concerned. They are concerned \nabout the huge cost: $1 trillion, $2 trillion; they are concerned about \nthe deficit, the increase in the deficit, even with more tax increases. \nThese numbers are not mine; these are from the Congressional Budget \nOffice--nonpartisan, which is in business to tell us how much these \nthings cost. So these are facts, not opinions.\n  It is my opinion that based upon the language of these bills, we will \nlose the ability to determine with our doctor what health care we get. \nSecondly, even if you like your health insurance, you are not going to \nbe able to keep it for the reasons I mentioned.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 5 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. Five minutes. Thank you very much.\n  The American people are becoming concerned about this as well. The \nmore they hear about it, the more they don't like what they are \nhearing. I resent those who say we have to do this quickly or it might \nnot happen at all. It is a lot like the stimulus. We were told we had \nto do it quickly. Nobody read that bill. It was over 1,000 pages. It \nhad a lot of stinkers in it. It had porkbarrel spending. It made a lot \nof promises it couldn't keep: We are going to cap unemployment at 8 \npercent. Well, it is on its way to 10 percent. It hasn't created 4 \nmillion jobs. It is not going to. And it is going to cost us over $1 \ntrillion.\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\n  So I think fooled once, maybe that is your fault; fooled twice is my \nfault. The American people are saying we are not going to be fooled \ntwice. We want time to look at this one. It is over 1,000 pages. We \nwant to read it. We want you, the Senators and Representatives, to read \nit, and when you do, you will find a lot of things you are going to be \nsurprised about and you do not like.\n  The American people, as I said, are beginning to answer polling \nquestions, and I wish to share some of the data. A majority--this is \nfrom the Fox Poll I cited earlier--say slow it down. We would rather \nhave it slowed down and done right than moved quickly. They are afraid \nit will raise taxes and costs. By 2 to 1 they believe it will reduce \nthe care they currently receive. By the way, they are right.\n  I mentioned the fact that 91 percent have insurance and 84 percent \nrate it as good or excellent. Fifty-three percent, according to a \nRasmussen Poll--and this was just at the end of last week--53 percent \ndisapprove of the Obama health care plan. It is no longer true that the \nmajority of Americans want this plan. Now that they know about it, they \ndon't like it. They want us to deal with the deficit first. That is \nanother one of the things the polls say. By the way, on this idea of a \npublic plan, they oppose it by 50 to 35.\n  All this has resulted in some reduced polling numbers for the \nPresident. His job performance now has actually gone under 50 percent. \nPeople disapprove rather than approve 51 to 49. I don't wish him ill, \nbut if he keeps pushing proposals such as this, that approval rating \nwill probably continue to decline.\n  What have some people said about these bills? Representatives of the \nMayo Clinic basically said this won't create affordable care for \npatients. In fact, it will do the opposite. In other words, it will \nincrease costs. The Congressional Budget Office, in looking at the \nHouse bill, said it won't reduce the trajectory of Federal health care \nspending. In fact, it will increase the budget deficit by $239 billion. \nIncidentally, that assumes taxes will be raised by the amount of $583 \nbillion.\n  Incidentally, if anybody wants to check what I said about if you like \nyour insurance, you get to keep it, check the University of \nPennsylvania Annenberg School of Public Policy Web site.\n  They have a site called factcheck.org. This is a totally nonpartisan \norganization. They contradict on factcheck.org the notion that if you \nlike your insurance, you get to keep it.\n  The last thing I want to say about this today is that: it is not \nenough for us to say what is wrong with the bills that are before us. \nThere are a lot of great ideas Republicans and Democrats have put forth \nthat aren't in these bills. Unfortunately, a lot of amendments were \noffered in the HELP Committee--for example, to try to inject some of \nthese Republican ideas into the bill--and they were defeated, every one \nof them. In fact, when he was a Senator, President Obama voted against \nseveral of these ideas.\n  Let me give you a flavor of some of these things to illustrate that \nthere are a ton of good ideas on how to address access and costs in \nhealth care. They don't require us to scrap the entire system we have \nand superimpose a brandnew system of huge government regulation or a \ngovernment takeover of health care, which results in these huge \nexpenses, deficits, and dictating what care we can get and what care we \ncannot. There are solutions that go right to the specific problems.\n  For example, you never hear the President talking about medical \nmalpractice reform, lawsuit liability reform, or, as some have called \nit, ``jackpot justice.'' There are a lot of estimates out there that, \nbecause of the defensive medicine physicians have to practice, we can \nsave over $100 billion every year if we have some modest reforms in the \nlawsuit liability area.\n  Two very prominent Arizona physicians were in my office this morning, \nand both of them talked at length about the specific situations that \nrequire the practice of defensive medicine because of the fact that \nmaybe 1 out of 10,000 people who come before them may have something go \nwrong, a lawsuit is filed, and they have to, therefore, go to excessive \nlengths to protect themselves by ordering all kinds of tests, calling \nin specialists, and doing things that cost a lot of money, not because \nthey are necessarily needed or provide better care but simply to \nprotect against a lawsuit. Annual premiums of $200,000 are not \nuncommon. That is more than most of us make. Before you can start \npracticing medicine on January 1, you have to pay your liability \ncarrier. The President doesn't even mention liability reform. Let's \nstart with that.\n  Next is the interstate sale of insurance. This is a great idea. Why \ndo they always vote it down? Because if you actually let insurance in \nthe health field be sold like home insurance, liability insurance, and \ncar insurance--you can buy a State Farm car insurance policy in \nvirtually every State, and it doesn't matter where you move to; you are \nstill covered. Why can't you do that with health care? They don't want \nthat because they want the government to control it instead of allowing \nprivate companies to sell it all around the country. If they were able \nto do that, they could reduce premiums and provide greater access. That \nis one of the bills the President voted against.\n  Why not let small business compete like big business with small \nbusiness plans or association health plans? Basically, you could allow \nall the small businesses in your town--the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs--to \nassociate together and create a bigger risk pool, which brings down \npremiums, just as big businesses do. If you are a small business owner \nwith 30 employees and one of them gets really sick, your premiums \nskyrocket the next year. By making a 3,000-person risk pool rather than \n30, your premiums will come down. We have tried to get that into the \nbill. The Democrats say no.\n  There could be greater affordability by giving individuals the same \ntax deduction businesses get. The President voted against that when he \nwas in the Senate. We could expand health savings accounts so you can \nuse the money saved there to buy health insurance--pay the premiums. \nAgain, the President voted against that when he was in the Senate.\n  These are Republican ideas, good ideas, and they have been voted down \nin these bills.\n  Here is another one: require insurance companies to share the claims \ndata. One big business told me they couldn't compete and get a lower \ncost because their current health care insurer wouldn't give them their \nclaims data. That information ought to belong to the company. So we can \nmake that requirement.\n  Another thing is--the last thing I will mention--we need to encourage \nless first-dollar coverage. Our automobile insurance would be very \nexpensive if we insisted that it cover every tire we have to buy or \nevery battery we replace or any other thing we do. Yet with health \ninsurance we complain about a $15 or $20 copayment or a deductible of \n$50. It is common to have a $500 deductible or even a $1,000 deductible \non your car insurance. Certainly, health care ought to be more \nimportant to us than owning a vehicle.\n  These are just some of the comments I have about the reaction my \nconstituents are having to the bills being proposed out there and the \nfact that they want to slow it down and look at it carefully because \nthey are concerned about the cost of it, the increase in the Federal \ndeficits, the increased taxes that will result, the government \ntakeover, and that the net result will be our health care will be \nrationed, we will have delay and denial of care, and we won't be able \nto keep the insurance most of us have and like.\n  Those are legitimate concerns, and they should not be answered by \nsimply saying we have to hurry up and get this done. No, we don't. We \nneed to let the American people evaluate it and have them tell us what \nthey want to be done. I think they have already spoken in some of the \npolling, and I think it is important for us, therefore, if we approach \nour duties the way we are supposed to here, by carefully considering \nwhat our constituents want, asking whether we can solve some of the \nspecific problems with, for example, some of the ideas I laid out--good \nRepublican ideas--rather than having to throw out the baby with the \nbathwater, tossing overboard what we know works for most people most of \nthe time just because it doesn't work for everybody all of the time, in \nexchange for a new government takeover--it is a bad bargain.\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues, in the last week or two before the August \nrecess, we have to start planning for opportunities to visit with \nconstituents over the recess, get the information together so we can \npresent it to them and they can tell us what they think about these \nideas. I suspect that, at the end of the day, they will say they don't \nwant a government takeover, just fix what needs to be fixed and leave \nthe rest of it, which works, alone.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, let me say I agree with the points \nof my friend from Arizona. They are significant. He saved the best \nuntil last, because we hear people say the Republican Party doesn't \nhave any answers, when we do have answers. There are real reforms we \nhave tried, and they have worked. The health savings accounts--we tried \nthat on a pilot project basis, and it was tremendously successful.\n  Health coverage and health services are the only things in this \ncountry on which individual decisions can be made that would encourage \nus to save what we are spending. There is no other product or service \nout there that doesn't have some kind of a competition.\n  I think it is only natural, if you have an insurance policy that \ncovers all these things and you find out you have a problem, rather \nthan worry about what it is going to cost or what treatment to get, you \ngo out and get it all because it doesn't cost you anything. That is one \nof the problems you have. Health savings accounts have been successful. \nIn fact, we have none of this stuff.\n  In the discussion they have had on socializing medicine, they have \nnot talked about medical liability or malpractice. The Senator from \nArizona did a very good job talking about this issue. Just imagine, a \ndoctor has to pay $200,000 upfront before he can do anything for an \nentire year. Who pays that? It is not the doctor; it is everybody else \nwhom he is treating. That is where you get into the real need for \nreform.\n  We have a system that has worked very well.\n  By the way, I inquire of the Chair, are we in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have three subjects I think we need to \ntalk about during the August recess. I want to touch on each one.\n  The Senator from Arizona has already touched on the health care issue \nthat is out there. I don't think Arizona and Virginia are all that \ndifferent from my State of Oklahoma. That is all people talk about when \nI go back. They want to know: Am I really going to have a government \nbureaucrat standing between me and my health provider? So those are \nhuge issues. I never thought we would be dealing with that in this \ncountry, but we are.\n  What I want to pursue is, I get very upset when I hear people on the \nother side of the aisle say we have to do something to stop our \ndependency on the Middle East for our ability to run this machine \ncalled America. Here are a couple. Many people don't want to drill, \ndon't want oil, gas, nuclear, or coal--they don't want all these \nthings. If you don't want them, how do you keep the machine going? The \nanswer is that you cannot. The day will come when maybe wind energy or \nsolar energy or renewables will take care of our needs, but that is \ndown the road. That will be 30, 40, 50 years from now. In the meantime, \nwe have to produce the energy to run this machine called America.\n  One of the things is a little bit technical, but I think that since \nit is looming out there, it needs to be talked about. Of course, I am \nsensitive to this issue, being from Oklahoma, which is an oil State; we \nproduce oil. I have looked at one of our systems that is used to get \nthe most oil and gas out of oil.\n  At this point, I will yield to the Republican leader, and then I will \ncontinue my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the American people want health care \nreform--and they want us to take the time we need to get it right. As I \nhave said repeatedly, and as an increasing number of Senators and \nCongressmen from both sides of the aisle are also now saying, the last \nthing Americans want is for Congress to rush through a flawed bill that \nwould make our health care system even worse just so politicians in \nWashington can have something to brag about at a parade or a press \nconference.\n  The President and some Democrat leaders in Congress now acknowledge \nthat getting health care reform right is more important than rushing \nthrough some slipshod plan no one has even looked at and calling it \nreform. Last week, the President said he wants to get health care \nreform right and that the most important thing is that Members of \nCongress continue to work together on the difficult issues in this \ndebate. And one senior Democrat said last week that ``it's better to \nget a product that's based on quality and thoughtfulness than on trying \nto just get something through.''\n  Republicans agree, and so we are encouraged to hear our friends on \nthe other side acknowledge that health care reform is too big, too \nimportant, and too personal an issue to rush.\n  In the coming weeks, Congress should work to achieve real reforms \nthat actually address the problems in our health care system without \ntampering with the things that Americans--and many other people from \naround the world--like about our health care system and can no longer \nfind in other countries.\n  The American people want health care that is more affordable and \neasier to obtain. What they don't want is a government takeover of \nhealth care that costs trillions of dollars, adds to our unsustainable \nnational debt, forces them off the health insurance they have, leaves \nthem paying more for worse care than they now receive, and leads to the \nsame kind of denial, delay, and rationing of care we see in other \ncountries.\n  One thing Democrats and Republicans should be able to work together \non are practical ideas the American people support, such as reforming \nmalpractice laws and getting rid of junk lawsuits; promoting wellness \nand prevention programs that encourage people to make healthy choices \nlike quitting smoking and fighting obesity; encouraging more robust \ncompetition in the private insurance market; addressing the needs of \nsmall businesses through new ideas that won't kill jobs in the middle \nof a recession; and leveling the playing field when it comes to taxes. \nRight now, for example, if your employer offers health insurance, they \nget a tax benefit for providing it. If they don't, and you have to buy \nit yourself, you don't get the same benefit they do. In my view, this \nisn't fair, and we should change it to make it fair.\n  These are commonsense ideas that would enable Republicans and the \nincreasingly vocal block of skeptical Democrats to meet in the middle \non a reform that all of us want--and that all Americans could embrace.\n  The President has already acknowledged that both Democratic bills \nworking their way through Congress are not where they need to be. In \nfact, by the President's own standard that any health care reform must \nnot increase the national debt and must reduce long-term health care \ncosts, he would not even be able to sign either of these bills we have \nseen so far.\n  According to the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, both \nbills would lead to an increase in overall health care costs. Just this \nweekend, the CBO said there is a high probability one of the \nadministration's central proposals for reducing long-term costs would \nnot lead to any savings in the near future and would generate only \nmodest savings in the future.\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\n  Moreover, even if this proposal did generate any savings, they would \nlikely be dwarfed by the new spending and deficits in the Democratic \nbills we have seen. It is like charging a new Cadillac to the family \ncredit card and getting excited about saving a few dollars on the cup \nholder.\n  On top of that, the CBO says both bills would add hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to the debt. Simply put, these bills are moving in \nthe wrong direction and would make the problems in our health care \nsystem even worse than they are today.\n  So it is clear we need to hit the restart button and begin working on \nreal reform that would address the problems in our health care system. \nAmericans want the two parties to work together on something as \nimportant and as personal as health care reform. Embracing the ideas I \nhave mentioned and finding responsible ways to pay for reform are a \ngood place to start.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank again my colleague from \nOklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I thank the minority leader for his \ncomments. I said before he came in that there is no issue more \nmeaningful to our people in Oklahoma than health care. I think there is \nan awareness. If you look at the polling data that was given by the \nSenator from Arizona, people are now aware this is not the way we \nshould go.\n  We do have good ideas on this side of the aisle in terms of the \nhealth savings account, medical malpractice, and small businesses \ngetting together to resolve this problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8108-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8108-S8110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a surprise to a lot of people as to what \nwe can do in the oil and gas business when we are concerned right now \nabout the problem we have--our dependence on foreign countries for the \nability to run this machine called America--is that we actually could \nresolve that problem. We could produce enough oil and gas and all the \nother resources I mentioned earlier so we would not have to be \ndependent on the Middle East for anything.\n  Increasing attention has been given to hydraulic fracturing, a key \nproduction method which aided in U.S. production of oil and gas from \nmore than 1 million wells and continues to aid in the production from \nover 35,000 wells a year.\n  Hydraulic fracturing is a system that forces water into the ground to \nrelease oil and gas coming up. In fact, there are two things that open \nour potential. One is horizontal drilling and the other is hydraulic \nfracturing. It is a 60-year old technique. It has been responsible for \n7 billion barrels of oil and 600 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. \nThe National Petroleum Council reports that 60 to 80 percent of all \nwells in the next 10 years--most of these are gas wells--will require \nhydraulic fracturing to remain productive and profitable.\n  The first use of hydraulic fracturing was near Duncan, OK, in my \nState, way back in 1949. Since that time, companies such as Oklahoma's \nDevon and Chesapeake have perfected the practice. Very simply, it is \nthe temporary injection of mostly water with sand, nitrogen, carbon \ndioxide, and other additives to fracture and prop open a ground \nformation to improve the flow of oil and gas through the rock pores and \nincrease oil and gas production. Mr. President, 95 percent of the fluid \nis water; 99 percent is water and sand. We are talking about putting in \nthe water and sand that would already be there. Hydraulic fracturing is \nused for both oil and gas production, but I would like to focus mostly \non natural gas.\n  I have kind of good news and bad news. First, let me tell you the \ngood news.\n  The Potential Gas Committee at the Colorado School of Mines reported \nin June that the United States has--it is kind of hard to talk about \nfigures such as this--1,836 trillion cubic feet, or 1.8 quadrillion \ncubic feet, of technically recoverable natural gas. This is the highest \nreserve total ever reported by this organization in the last 44 years.\n  When the U.S. Department of Energy proven reserves are added to the \ntotal, the future natural gas supply of the United States is over 2,000 \ntrillion cubic feet. At today's rate of use, that is enough natural gas \nto meet demand for the next 100 years. Only 1 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas can heat 15 million homes for a year or fuel 12 million \nnatural-gas-powered vehicles for a year.\n  T. Boone Pickens is often quoted in this Chamber. He characterizes \nthe reserves this way: 2 quadrillion cubic feet of gas is equivalent to \nSaudi Arabia's total petroleum reserves.\n  I guess what we are saying is people are complaining we are importing \nfrom the Middle East oil and gas, and then they find we have it all \nright here. We don't have to do it. If the argument is, we don't want \nto use oil and gas which we think pollutes--which it does not--if that \nis their argument, then why are we willing to import it from Saudi \nArabia and the Middle East? We can produce it right here in the United \nStates.\n  Much of the increase noted in the news report comes from estimates of \nshale gas found in formations throughout the United States. In fact, \nshale gas accounts for one-third of America's total gas reserves. \nAgain, we are talking about natural gas, which is very low in fossil \nfuels, burns very cleanly, very inexpensively, and certainly, as we can \nsee by this chart, is very abundant.\n  The U.S. Department of Energy reports that by 2011, most new reserves \ngrowth will come from nonconventional shale gas reservoirs. The \nAmerican Petroleum Institute forecasts that unconventional gas \nproduction, such as that from coalbed methane, or CBM, and shale will \nincrease from 42 percent of total U.S. gas production to 64 percent in \n2020. However, shale resources are largely only economically and \ntechnologically available due to hydraulic fracturing, that technique \nof forcing the gas out of the ground.\n  The good news does not only involve oil and gas reserves, it also \nmeans good news for jobs. For example, the 10,000 wells producing in 14 \ncounties in north Texas, Barnett shale--Barnett shale is the type of \nshale that is characteristic in the northern part of Texas--in 14 \ncounties, they are responsible for 110,000 jobs and $4.5 billion in \nroyalty payments. That is the people who own the land. That is a \nproperty rights issue. They account for 8 percent of the personal \nincome, 9 percent of employment, and over $10 billion in increased \neconomic activity in north Texas.\n  The Haynesville shale in Louisiana has created 33,000 jobs, $2.4 \nbillion in business sales, $3.9 billion in salaries, and $3.2 billion \nin royalty payments. This is the economy we are talking about. We are \ntalking about two separate issues: one is making us independent, the \nother is doing something for the economy.\n  People look at these things and say: Why in the world will the \nDemocrats in this Chamber not allow us to drill offshore, won't allow \nus to get into shale production in the Western United States, and yet \nthey complain about the fact we are importing our oil and gas from the \nMiddle East?\n  The IPAA reports that the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and New \nYork contains 516 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which is enough \nto satisfy the U.S. demand for more than 35 years--in two States, \nPennsylvania and New York, enough to satisfy our needs for the next 35 \nyears.\n  A 2008 report on the Marcellus shale attributes production in the \nMarcellus to two key methods. One is hydraulic fracturing, again, the \nsystem used to make sure we are able to retrieve, to produce this \nshale. Oil and gas development employs more than 26,000 and continued \ndevelopment in the Marcellus shale is forecasted to create over 100,000 \njobs. These jobs pay more than $20,000 above the average annual salary \nin Pennsylvania. We have New York and Pennsylvania, two States--they do \nhave economic problems. This is a way to produce 100,000 jobs, and \nthose jobs average $20,000 a year more than the average job in \nPennsylvania and New York.\n  The Walton School of Business at the University of Arkansas recently \ncompleted an economic forecast of the Fayetteville shale. It estimates \na business and capital investment in the area of $22 billion, the \ncreation of 11,000 jobs, and new State revenues of more $2 billion by \n2012.\n\n  We are talking about just in the State of Arkansas. In my State of\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\nOklahoma, we have the Woodford shale, which is pictured here and \nextends through southwest Oklahoma.\n  In Oklahoma, exploration of natural gas accounts for 80 percent of \nthe State's energy production and over 50,000 people are directly \nemployed by the oil and gas industry. One in seven jobs in Oklahoma is \ndirectly or indirectly supported by the crude oil and natural gas \nindustry because we rank fourth in the Nation for natural gas \nproduction and fifth in crude oil.\n  Oklahoma received $1.3 billion in taxes directly from oil and gas \nproduction in 2009. In fact, oil and gas account for 25 percent of all \ntaxes paid in my State of Oklahoma.\n  These reserves mean domestic energy production and jobs, but now I \nhave bad news. Another reason hydraulic fracturing has received \nincreasing attention is because some Members of Congress want to \nsubject it to new Federal regulation, specifically the Safe Drinking \nWater Act, by claiming the practice endangers drinking water sources. \nThis Congress, House Members from Colorado and New York and Senate \nMembers from Pennsylvania and New York have introduced legislation \nimposing new Federal regulation. Some of these Members claim that \nallowing the practice is a loophole in the Federal law and that it is \nfree of regulation.\n  Last Congress, at a House hearing, the current chairman of the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee complained about hydraulic fracturing:\n\n       Oil and gas companies can pump hundreds of thousands of \n     gallons of fluid--containing any number of toxic chemicals--\n     into sources of drinking water with little or no \n     accountability.\n\n  This is completely false. Nothing could be further from the truth. As \nformer chairman and the current ranking member of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I have a history of working on \nenvironmental and energy issues. I can tell you new Federal regulation \nof hydraulic fracturing would be a disaster.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act was enacted in 1974. It was enacted to \nestablish drinking water standards and to control permanent disposal of \nwaste by underground injection. By 1974, hydraulic fracturing had been \nin commercial operation for 25 years. This law was not designed nor \nintended to regulate the practice, and the legislative history \ndemonstrates that. The 1974 conference report states that none of the \nact's underground injection provisions are to ``needlessly interfere \nwith oil and gas production.'' That was in the law in 1974.\n  The 1980 amendments were probably the most significant until 2005 for \nclarifying the act's application to oil and gas operations. The 1980 \namendments created a new section 1425 to allow States to regulate \nunderground injection from two types of oil and gas operations known as \ninjection wells and disposal wells. However, given the chance to \nadditionally address hydraulic fracturing, Congress declined. In the \n2005 Energy bill, Congress specifically clarified the act is not \nintended to apply to hydraulic fracturing.\n  Everything all the way up from 1950, all the way up to the present \ntime was saying the act was not intended to apply to hydraulic \nfracturing. There are a myriad of Federal statutes, such as the Federal \nworkplace rules, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know \nAct, the Toxic Substances Control Act, among others, which regulate the \nstorage and disposal, transporting, handling, and reporting of chemical \nuse. Federal law requires disclosure of any release to the environment. \nThose statutes overlay State laws which also include extensive rules \npermitting oil and gas drilling and production. No state has been \nrequired to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water \nAct with the exception of Alabama.\n  The Eleventh Circuit Court in Alabama issued an opinion in 1997 \nignoring legislative history, oil and gas industry practices, and the \nclear text of the law, finding that Alabama should subject hydraulic \nfracturing in coalbed methane production to the Safe Drinking Water \nAct. However, hydraulic fracturing has not been subject to the Safe \nDrinking Water Act and is not correctly governed by the act.\n  I am not alone in this opinion. President Obama's energy czar agrees \nwith me. In 1995, as EPA Administrator--during the Clinton \nadministration--Carol Browner wrote in response to litigation that \nFederal regulation is not necessary for hydraulic fracturing. She \ncorrectly made the point that the practice was closely regulated by the \nStates and ``EPA is not legally required to regulate hydraulic \nfracturing.'' Most importantly, she further wrote that there was no \nevidence that hydraulic fracturing at issue resulted in any \ncontamination or endangerment of underground sources of drinking \nwater. Now, this is Carol Browner. That is the current energy czar \nserving in the White House.\n\n  Following the 1997 litigation in Alabama, I introduced legislation in \n1999 with Senator Sessions and again in 2005 clarifying that hydraulic \nfracturing is not correctly regulated by this act. In March of 2002, \nthe Senate spoke on this issue voting 78 to 21 on Senator Bingaman's \namendment, which I cosponsored, to study ``the known and potential \neffects on underground drinking sources of hydraulic fracturing.'' That \namendment ultimately did not become law, but in June of 2004, the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency gave us the answer. It issued its \nlengthy report, which EPA began in late 2000 to determine if \nunderground drinking water sources have been or are endangered from the \nuse of hydraulic fracturing from coalbed methane production. The EPA \nstudy of coalbed methane wells is particularly important because the \nCBM wells are shallower, meaning they would be closer to the \nunderground drinking water sources than other conventional or \nunconventional oil and gas well production.\n  In other words, the other production is down much deeper than that \nwhich uses the technique of hydraulic fracturing. These are deep wells. \nIn fact, most ``fracked'' wells--that is what they are called--are \nhundreds of thousands of feet deep and well below drinking water \nsources. In this 2004 report, EPA conducted a review of all 11 major \ncoal basins across the country and of 200 peer-reviewed publications. \nIt reviewed 105 comments in the Federal Register. It requested \ninformation from 500 local and county agencies in States where CBM \nproduction occurs. It interviewed 50 local and State government \nagencies, industry representatives, and 40 citizens groups which \nalleged drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing. After \ncompleting its 4-year study--a 4-year study--the EPA concluded:\n\n       The injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids into CBM wells \n     poses little or no threat to underground sources of drinking \n     water and does not justify additional study at this time.\n\n  EPA had planned to study contamination in a two-phase study. \nFollowing these findings, the EPA did not even initiate the second \nphase of the study. In fact, it was so strong that they didn't even do \nthe next study.\n  This is a very strong statement. In fact, in hydraulic fracturing's \n60-year history there has not been a single documented case of any kind \nof contamination. Mr. President, that is 60 years. As early as 1998, \nthe Ground Water Protection Council conducted the first survey of the \n25 States in which hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas \nproduction occurs for any complaints of underground contamination. The \nsurvey reported no instance of contamination from the practice. In \n2002, the IOGCC, representing 37 States, conducted its own survey \nmaking the same findings. On June 12, the Oklahoma Corporation \nCommission addressed the issue of hydraulic fracturing again in \ncorrespondence with these 37 States. The Corporation Commission wrote \nthat it has been regulating oil and gas drilling and production for 90 \nyears, which has included tens of thousands of hydraulic fracturing \noperations over the past 60 years. The commission wrote:\n\n       You asked whether there has been a verified instance of \n     harm to groundwater in our state from the practice of \n     hydraulic fracturing. The answer is no.\n\n  States have been regulating oil and gas exploration and production \nfor years. The Department of Energy and Ground Water Protection Council \nreleased a report in May titled ``State Oil and Natural Gas Regulations \nDesigned to Protect Water Resources,'' where it described State \nregulations which require multiple barriers, casings, and\n\n[[Page S8110]]\n\ncement reinforcement to protect against groundwater contamination. \nFracturing involves removing thousands of gallons of waters from the \nwell which includes the fracturing fluids. Once these fluids are \nreturned to the surface, regulations require they are treated, stored, \nand isolated from groundwater zones. All these processes together work \nto significantly reduce the risk to groundwater.\n  This DOE and Ground Water Protection Council report ultimately \nconcluded that Federal regulations on fracturing would be ``costly, \nduplicative of State regulations, and ultimately ineffective because \nsuch regulations would be far removed from field operations.'' Equally \ninteresting, the report also concluded--and keep in mind this is the \nreport of the Department of Energy and the Ground Water Protection \nCouncil--the ``only alternative to fracturing in reservoirs with low \npermeability such as shale would be to simply have to drill more \nwells.'' In other words, if we are not able to get these wells to \nproduce a lot of shale, we would have to drill a lot of wells in their \nplace.\n  These findings mirror the EPA's 2004 report of hydraulic fracturing \nin CBM production. EPA noted that fracturing involves the removal of \nthousands of gallons of ground water. This removal includes the \nfracturing fluids and the possibility that fracturing chemicals affect \nground water. EPA also concluded that the low permeability of rock \nwhere hydraulic fracturing is used acts as a barrier to any remnant of \nfracturing chemicals moving out of the rock formations, as has been \nproven.\n  None of these findings are new. In the 1980 amendments to the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, Congress acknowledged that ``32 States that \nregulate underground injection related to production of oil and gas \nbelieve they have programs already in place to meet the requirements of \nthis Act. States should be able to continue these programs unencumbered \nwith additional Federal requirements.''\n  We need to recognize that in considering additional Federal \nregulation we are experimenting with disaster. In January, the DOE \nreleased a report by Advanced Resources International, which evaluated \nthe economic and energy supply effects on oil and gas exploration and \nproduction under a series of new regulatory scenarios. One scenario \nevaluated the effects from new Federal regulation of hydraulic \nfracturing. According to the report, the largest cost for new \nunconventional gas wells would be from any new Federal regulations on \nhydraulic fracturing. The report concluded these costs would amount to \nan additional $100,000 for each well in the first year alone.\n  Among other factors, this report concludes that increasing Federal \nregulations on hydraulic fracturing would reduce unconventional gas \nproduction by 50 percent over the next 25 years. Even more recently, \nthe American Petroleum Institute released a report in June which only \nevaluated the effect of increased Federal regulations and the effect of \neliminating the practice of hydraulic fracturing altogether. The report \ndetermined that through duplicative Federal regulations, the number of \nnew oil and natural gas wells drilled would drop by 20 percent in the \nnext 5 years.\n  Should hydraulic fracturing be eliminated, new oil and gas wells \nwould drop by 79 percent resulting in 45 percent less domestic natural \ngas production and 17 percent less domestic oil production.\n  It would be a disaster to impose new Federal regulations. They are \ntalking about doing that now. They talked about it a few years ago. \nEvery report has discouraged that from happening. Again, I am not alone \nin this opinion. Colorado Governor Bill Ritter recognizes the value of \nthe practice. In the Denver Business Journal, the Governor \ncharacterized the bills pending in Congress imposing new Federal \nregulations on hydraulic fracturing as ``a new and potentially \nintrusive regulatory program.'' That was Governor Bill Ritter. A \nColorado newspaper recently reported a number of Colorado counties have \nadopted resolutions against the pending Federal bills. States are \npassing their own resolutions opposing new Federal regulation of \nhydraulic fracturing.\n  For example, in March the North Dakota Legislature passed a \nconcurrent resolution--I say to the Senator from North Dakota--to not \nsubject hydraulic fracturing to needless and new Federal regulation. \nNorth Dakota is home to the Bakken shale, where oil wells are reported \nto be producing thousands of barrels a day.\n  America has tremendous natural gas reserves. The exploration and \nproduction of these reserves using hydraulic fracturing has been \nregulated by the States and conducted safely for 60 years. The oil and \ngas industry contributes billions in State and Federal revenues each \nyear and billions in salaries and royalty payments. The oil and gas \nindustry employs 6 million people in the United States. When the United \nStates is approaching 10 percent unemployment, and when we want energy \nsecurity and independence from foreign energy, why would we want to go \nout of our way to restrict an environmentally and economically sound \nmeans to extract our own resources--a means that has demonstrated \neffectiveness and safety for 60 years?\n  The oil potential in ANWR would produce 10 billion barrels or 15 \nyears' worth of imports from Saudi Arabia. The RAND Corporation has \nreported that the new potential production in just Utah, Colorado, and \nWyoming would be around 1 trillion barrels of oil. That is three times \nSaudi Arabia's oil reserves and more oil than we are currently \nimporting from the entire Middle East. But the Democrats will not let \nus produce. We are currently the only country in the world that doesn't \ndevelop its own resources. In fact, the President's budget imposes $31 \nbillion in new taxes on oil and gas development. We must not impose any \nnew----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The morning business period is \nclosed.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will finish this last sentence, if it is all right.\n  We must not impose new burdens. This is a procedure that is necessary \nfor us to put ourselves in a situation where we can become energy \nindependent, and I encourage all my colleagues to look very carefully \nat the one thing that is going to give us that independence, and that \nis this procedure called hydraulic fracturing.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8110-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I call up the substitute amendment to H.R. \n3183, which is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1813.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with \nthe reading of the substitute amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Subcommittee bill that I bring to the floor this week \nwith my colleague, Senator Bennett, from Utah. I am chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Bennett is the ranking member, and we have worked \non the bill for some long while.\n  On July 9, 2009, by a vote of 30 to 0, the committee recommended the \nbill,\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\nas amended, be reported to the Senate. That is, the full Appropriations \nCommittee has recommended this bill, on a bipartisan basis, without \nobjection, 30 to 0.\n  I want to thank both Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran for \ntheir support of this bill, and I want to especially thank Senator \nBennett for his work with me in developing the legislation.\n  Let me, perhaps as I begin rather than end, thank the staff of the \nsubcommittee: Scott O'Malia, on the minority side; Doug Clapp, Roger \nCockrell, Barry Gaffney, Franz Wuerfmannsdobler, and Molly Barackman.\n  There are many staff on both sides who have worked very hard. Putting \nlegislation of this type together is not easy. We are working with \nlimited resources, at a time when we have relatively difficult \ncircumstances, to try to deal with Federal budget deficits and other \nissues, but we have put a bill together that has garnered bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The allocation for this bill is just under $34.3 billion. With score \nkeeping adjustments, it comes down to about $33.75 billion. The total \nfunding for our bill is 1.8 percent less than the President's budget \nrequest and just 1.4 percent over the regular energy and water bill of \n2009. That means there is a very modest increase for the programs in \nthis legislation.\n  Let me say generally this legislation deals with the energy and the \nwater programs across the country. Energy and water are very important \nto this country's long-term future. What we are working to support is \njobs and the economic health of our country as well as an adequate \nenergy supply dealing. These energy challenges we face from being \noverly dependent on foreign oil doing something about climate change \nrequire action. We are dealing with energy accounts in this bill that \nare very important for the country.\n  We have tried to make funding determinations about them that we think \nmove this country in the right direction and help make us less \ndependent on foreign sources of oil. That means that we have, in \nrelated authorizing legislation, actually expanded drilling and the \ndetermination to try to find additional supply in this country. Fossil \nenergy from coal, oil and natural gas is going to continue to be used \nin the future. But we need to use them differently.\n  This legislation includes opportunities to do a range of activities \nthat I believe will be in the country's best interests. Working with \nSenator Bennett, we know the legislation dealing with energy and water \nrequire substantially greater resources. We have far more water \nprojects underway in this country than we can possibly fund in the \nshort term. I believe we have something close to $60 billion of \nunfunded water projects. The Corps of Engineers, and particularly the \nBureau of Reclamation, especially for western America, are charged with \nfunding these projects.\n  Then, on the energy side, the accounts dealing with efficiency and \nreliability and a wide range of energy accounts--all of those accounts \nunderstand and recognize that we do not have unlimited amounts of \nmoney. Our country has very substantial and growing budget deficits \nbecause we are in a deep recession.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma was speaking as I came to the Chamber. I \nagree with most of what he described with respect to hydraulic \nfracturing. He is describing something that affects our ability to \ncontinue to produce a domestic supply of oil and natural gas. My \ncolleague should know we have had now from both the previous Presidents \nthat we zero out the research and development in oil and gas \ndevelopment. The current President's budget seeks to cut the oil \nprogram. My colleague and I have restored the funding for that. One of \nthe reasons we have done it is our country leads the world, for \nexample, in unconventional and ultra deep water drilling. We need to \nretain program funding to keep that advantage.\n  We need to produce more here at home, and we have added the funding \nback. As I indicated, both the previous administration and this \nadministration decided not to support the research and development \nfunding for oil research and development.\n  The description of the shale formations that Senator Inhofe talked \nabout earlier remind me that 5 to 10 years ago we could not drill in \nthese formations. They are now delivering substantially new resources. \nThat energy was not accessible to this country because we didn't have \nthe technology and the capability. My colleague described the Bakken \nshale in North Dakota, which I want to describe in a moment. I think it \nis so important for us to have the research and development funding \nwhich current technology benefitted from in the past. With sustained \ninvestments, we might have future technology options available as well.\n  To go to the previous point, the Bakken shale is a formation 100 feet \nthick, and it is 10,000 feet underground. To drill through that 100-\nfoot-thick seam, they have divided it into thirds--top third, middle \nthird, and bottom third. They go down two miles with one drilling rig, \n10,000 feet down, searching for the middle third of a seam of shale \nthat is 100 feet thick. They do a big curve when they get down two \nmiles, then they go out two miles. The same drilling rig, goes down two \nmiles then makes a large curve and goes out two miles, following the \nmiddle third of a seam a hundred feet thick called the Bakken shale.\n  A few years ago I asked the U.S. Geological Survey to do an \nassessment of what is recoverable in the Bakken shale. They came back \nwith their estimate after a 2-year study, saying there are 4.3 billion \nbarrels of recoverable oil using today's technology. It is the largest \nassessment of recoverable oil in the lower 48 States ever made in the \nhistory of our country.\n  None of that was available to us a decade ago. It was there, but it \nwas not available to us. How do we get that oil? When they drill down \nwith a drilling rig, it takes about 35 days to drill that hole, then \nfracture it under high pressure--hydraulic fracture, they call it. \nAfter that, they tear down that rig and move it away a ways and drill \nanother hole--every 35 days. The hydraulic fracture allows that rock \nformation to be fractured so that the oil drips and then is extracted \nfrom the well. They are pulling up oil out of those wells, in some \ncases 2,000 barrels a day. The key to that is, No. 1, have they carried \nout the research and development so that we lead the world in the \nability to do that kind of very sophisticated exploration. We continue \nto put that funding in this bill and have always had it in this \nlegislation. That is what has opened up this unbelievable opportunity.\n  The second half of it, as my colleague described, is not something we \nare doing in this bill, but the ability to continue hydraulic \nfracturing, decade after decade, I think for nearly 50 years, I am not \naware of any evidence that there is any contamination of groundwater \nwith hydraulic fracturing when companies have followed the appropriate \nguidelines and regulations.\n  I have been describing one small part of what Senator Bennett and I \nhave done with respect to increasing our domestic energy needs in this \nbill.\n  We also want to encourage the development of renewable energy. We \nhave done a lot of things in this legislation to do that. We want to \nencourage the ability to use our most abundant resources, such as coal, \nbut we must use them differently. That means, if you are going to have \na lower carbon future you have to decarbonize the use of coal. So we \nneed to make substantial investments to be able to decarbonize the use \nof coal.\n  I think we can do that. Some say let's give up on it. I say let's \nfind a way to use our most abundant resource by decarbonizing it so \nthat we can move to a low carbon future to protect our planet.\n  We are doing a lot of things in this legislation that I think move \nthis country in the right direction for a better and a more secure \nenergy future. When I talk about energy and say that nearly 70 percent \nof our oil now comes from outside of our country, I think most people \nwould look at that and say that makes us vulnerable. That is an energy \nsecurity issue. It is also a national security issue. If, God forbid, \nsomehow, some way, someday, someone shuts off the supply of foreign oil \nto our country, this economy of ours would be flat on its back. So I \nthink everyone--the previous administration, this administration--\nbelieves we must be less dependent on foreign energy.\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\n  The other thing that is important to understand is, although about 70 \npercent of our oil comes from outside our country, nearly 70 percent of \nthe oil is used in our transportation fleet. We are doing things in \nthis appropriations bill that moves us toward a different kind of \ntransportation fleet, an electric-drive fleet, for example. If we are \nusing 70 percent of our oil for transportation in this country, how do \nwe make us less dependent on foreign oil? Convert; move to something \nelse.\n  We have funding in this legislation and we had funding in the \nEconomic Recovery Program for battery technology and for a whole series \nof things that help accelerate the movement toward an electronic \ntransportation system.\n  All of these things are things we can do. It is only a matter of \nestablishing public policy that encourages it, public policy that is \nsupportive of the direction we want to go.\n  I am going to be describing in some detail some of the accounts. I \nhave talked about the energy piece of this a bit. We have programs in \nhere for electricity, fossil energy, energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy--small little things that people don't think much about.\n  Energy efficiency: Almost everything we use these days--a \nrefrigerator, a dishwasher, an air conditioner--all of the appliances \nare much more efficient than they have ever been. I recall some years \nago when I was supporting and pushing something called a SEER 13 \nstandard for air conditioners--a SEER 13 standard. You would have \nthought we were trying to bankrupt the country by insisting on a much \nhigher standard of energy efficiency for air conditioners. We have \ngotten to SEER 13 and are looking beyond that now, but we have pushed \nstandards so that when you put a new refrigerator in your kitchen these \ndays it uses so much less electricity because it is so much more \nefficient.\n  I recognize--someone told me this a while back--yes, we are putting \nthese unbelievably efficient refrigerators in kitchens, and then they \ntake the old refrigerator and put it in the garage to store beer \nand soda. I recognize we need to get rid of those old refrigerators, \nperhaps, but it is people's right to move them into the garage.\n\n  My point is, these smaller issues we are funding, energy efficiency \nstandards for appliances are very important. When we get up in the \nmorning we flick a switch and a light goes on. We turn on an electric \nrazor and never think much about what makes it go. We plug it into a \nwall. We go down and put something in the toaster and the bread toasts \nbecause there is electricity. We put a key in the automobile, and we \ndrive off to work.\n  As Dr. Chu says, 2,000 years ago, normally when you would go look for \nfood someplace, 2000 years ago you would get on one horse and go look \nfor something to eat. Now, of course, we get in modern conveniences and \nwe take 240 horses to go to the 7-Eleven or grocery store. That is the \nway our engines work and use energy.\n  But we are required now to be smarter and use energy in a different \nway. For a wide range of accounts, my colleague Senator Bennett and I \nwill begin describing some of these accounts in more detail in between \nother presentations. With the funding in this legislation, we are \ntrying to change the way we use energy: Develop a more abundant supply \nof energy, including changing the way our vehicle fleet is powered. One \nissue with respect to the transportation fleet is moving toward a \nhydrogen and fuel cell future, I think a future beyond electric drive. \nStill, hydrogen is everywhere; it is ubiquitous. I believe a hydrogen \nfuel cell future is something our children and grandchildren will \nlikely see realized and will be very important to this country.\n  The administration, in its budget request for this fiscal year to the \nCongress decided it would zero out 189 existing contracts in hydrogen \nand fuel cell program. We included the money again because we don't \nthink that is wise to cut ongoing work.\n  I agree in the short term we are going to move toward an electric \ndrive transportation system, but, in the longer term, we need to \ncontinue the research toward hydrogen and fuel cells, and we included \nthat money in this bill.\n  Let me turn for a moment--I am going to come back to some energy \nissues a little later, after Senator Bennett talks about this bill as \nwell. I want to talk about water, because this bill, after all, is also \nabout water. As all of us who have studied history know, water is the \nsubject of great controversy. Water is very important. So many things \nrelated to development and jobs in this country relates to accessible \nwater.\n  We have issues in this bill dealing with the Corps of Engineers and \nthe Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation with respect to water. \nThese address storing water, moving water, dredging water in ports and \nchannels so that commerce can occur, and much more. In some cases, we \nmust address not having enough water or too much water. We have a lot \nof issues.\n  As I indicated earlier, we have far more water projects than we can \npossibly fund. Senator Bennett and I decided we simply could not fund \nwhat are called new starts in construction and investigations this \nyear. We hope to do that next year, but we could not do it this year. \nWe didn't have the money. We think it is far better to continue funding \nfor existing projects and try to complete some of the projects underway \nand then proceed with new starts next year. We had 92 requests for new \nprojects starts. We have a $60 billion backlog and 92 requests, some of \nwhich came from the President. We believed we could not do it. I wish \nwe could, but we could not do it.\n  I also want to make a point that there are, in this legislation \nespecially, legislatively-directed proposals, that is the Congress \nitself directs certain funding. The President sent us proposals, \nparticularly on water projects--energy projects as well, but especially \nwater projects. He requested earmarked funding. In other words, the \nPresident says, all right, here is what I want you to have for water. \nThese are my Presidential earmarks and how I believe you should spend \nthe water money.\n  Some of them made a lot of sense. Some of them did not. Senator \nBennett and I also included, in this legislation perhaps more than \nother legislation, legislative-directed funding on the amount of \nfunding we believed should go to projects.\n  Because, frankly, I think perhaps Members of Congress have a much \nbetter idea of what are the water needs more than the Corps of \nEngineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, Office of Management and Budget, \nor the White House. They know which projects will benefit their State's \ncommerce.\n  So this subcommittee, going back many decades, has had a tradition of \nlegislatively-directed funding toward the highest priorities, \nparticularly in water projects. That makes a lot of sense to me. I \nassume we may well have some folks come and decide that some of them do \nnot have merit.\n  It is important to discuss the individual programs for individual \nlegislatively-directed amounts, and we will do that when necessary. But \nI did wish to say once again that we received a lot of recommendations \nfrom the President for earmarking the funding for various projects, and \nwe have included many of these. We have also included projects that \nwere recommended by the Members of Congress that were well underway.\n  I have other things to discuss, but let me yield the floor because I \nknow my colleague, Senator Bennett, will want to describe some of this \nbill as well.\n  Let me close as I opened by saying it is a pleasure to work with \nSenator Bennett on these issues. These do represent investments in our \ncountry. Some things are spent and you never get it back, it is just \nspending. But when you build water projects or invest in the energy \nfurther such as through this bill, then it represents investments in \nthe country's future that will provide very substantial dividends for \nthe country for a long time to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my chairman, \nSenator Dorgan. Even more, I appreciate the hard work he has put in. \nThe level of cooperation between the two of us and between our two \nstaffs is as he has described it. This is a truly bipartisan effort, \naimed at trying to solve the problems we face. One demonstration of the \nfact is that we have, in a bipartisan fashion, come in with a number \nsignificantly below that which the\n\n[[Page S8113]]\n\nPresident requested. If it had been a single partisan effort, I am \nassuming it would have been responsive entirely to the President's \nrequest.\n  As Senator Dorgan has indicated, we have a number of Member-directed \nitems of spending. When people say: Well, where do you get the money \nfor that? The answer is, we have canceled the President's directed \norders of spending.\n  I agree with Senator Dorgan that Members in these areas are closer to \nthe people, closer to the problems, and understand them a little better \nthan the folks downtown.\n  I recommend passage of the bill to my colleagues. I am delighted with \nthe prospect that it is highly likely this will be done prior to \nOctober 1, the start of the fiscal year. That is a goal that has not \nbeen achieved in decades and a further tribute to the leadership of \nSenator Dorgan that we are on that path.\n  As I have said, the bill provides $643 million below the President's \nrequest. This is the number Senator Dorgan cited, the $34.271 billion, \nbut it is $476 million above current year levels. One of the things we \ndid that helps us come in below the President's request was focus on \nthe fact that the stimulus package that passed earlier this year put a \ngreat deal of money into these accounts. We did not want to ignore the \nfact that they had that money from the stimulus bill in coming up with \nour own figures.\n  The committee, as Senator Dorgan said, has said no new starts for the \nCorps of Engineers. I repeat that and reemphasize that because many of \nthe complaints that I think we are going to get on the floor about \nMember-directed spending are for projects in the Corps of Engineers.\n  They will say: Well, you are calling for earmarks. You use the dread \nword for this project and that project. Because we have no new starts, \nevery project we are calling for is an ongoing project. So that if we \nwere to cancel it, it would undoubtedly end up costing more money \nrather than would be saved if the earmark were to be struck down.\n  For the Bureau of Reclamation, we are $55 million below fiscal 2009 \nlevels. Pardon me. The request is $55 million below the fiscal 2009 \nlevel. The committee provides an additional $110 million to the Bureau. \nAs Senator Dorgan has said, this is the tremendous backlog of \nunderfunded projects. Let us take a sober lesson from what happens when \nwe do not proceed with the proper maintenance in this area.\n  In my own State of Utah, a privately owned irrigation canal broke and \nflooded the community of Logan, UT, and tragically, in the process, \ntook the lives of two young children and their mother who were \noverwhelmed as a result. This is a reminder to us that we have a \nresponsibility to keep this fund going because the human cost can be \nsignificant.\n  These types of accidents are only avoidable if we are vigilant in \nmaintaining the infrastructure and making the appropriate investments. \nWith respect to the Department of Energy, the committee recommends \n$27.4 billion which is $1 billion below the President's request.\n  Again, this is a demonstration of the fact that we are attempting to \nbe good stewards, that we are paying attention to the fact that the \nDepartment of Energy was already the beneficiary of over $45 billion in \nsupplemental and stimulus funding in fiscal 2009.\n  Not all of that will be spent in this fiscal year, so that is a \nlittle bit of an overstatement of how much they will have to offset. \nBut looking at the amount they had from the stimulus package, we felt \nwe were appropriate in coming in $1 billion below the President's \nrequest.\n  We do recommend an additional $100 million for Nuclear Power 2010 in \norder to complete this project. The bill restores $50 million funding \nfor the Integrated University Program and Research and Reactor \nFacilities account to support nuclear engineering and research and \ntraining.\n  That was eliminated in the budget request. I do that partly because I \nbelieve in it. I am joined with Senator Dorgan in doing it and also \nbecause, in my new assignment, I am taking the place of Senator \nDomenici, and he will come back and haunt us both if we are not \nappropriately supportive of nuclear power. His great work in that area \nis something I think we should carry on.\n  There are other issues the Senator from North Dakota has already \nmentioned that I will not touch on as we go along because I do not want \nto be redundant. We do provide an increase in funding for the Office of \nScience, $127 million over the current year levels. I think that is \nessential to a sustained investment in important scientific facilities \nthat we have throughout the country.\n  Let's talk about cleanup. There are many Members of the Senate in \nStates that support a strong environmental cleanup program, and the \nrequest reduced cleanup funding by over $200 million from current year \nlevels. Well, we believe the faster we can move on cleanup, the cheaper \nit will be over the long term because contractors are out of work now. \nThey are anxious to get back to work and they will make low bids and \ntake advantage of that situation.\n  We recommend $350 million in additional funding for both defense and \nnondefense cleanups. Again, there is such an activity going on in my \nState, and I know that moving ahead and having the funding available \nnow will save us significant amounts long term. So funding has been \nadded for cleanup activities at DOE facilities located in South \nCarolina, Idaho, Washington, New York, Illinois, Kentucky, New Mexico, \nand California.\n  The committee has also restored critical funding in our national \nsecurity sites, which was reduced in the President's budget request. An \nadditional $83 million was added to the weapons account to invest in \ncritical infrastructure and science facilities.\n  We are attempting to highlight what I consider to be the failure of \nthis administration to address fully spent nuclear fuel and defense \nwaste inventory in this country. Consistent with the President's \nrequest, a minimum level of funding has been provided to sustain the \nNRC license review process of the Yucca Mountain Project.\n  The Secretary of Energy has determined he will convene a blue ribbon \npanel of advisers to recommend other disposal options. But while the \nadministration is considering these options, ratepayers across the \ncountry are required to pay $800 million annually to the nuclear waste \nfund to address spent fuel solutions.\n\n  CBO estimates that by the end of the year the unspent balance in this \ntrust fund will be $23.8 billion. The committee has included language \ndirecting the Secretary to conduct an evaluation of the sufficiency of \nthe fund and suspend the annual collection from ratepayers until he has \na strategy to address the issue of spent fuel inventory.\n  Another problem that has arisen that we have dealt with has to do \nwith the funding of pensions. We have provided the Secretary the \nauthority to transfer funding within the Department to mitigate the \nimpact to specific programs. The environmental cleanup mission has been \nhardest hit by pension shortfalls. The committee has not included any \nof the proposed budget gimmicks included in the request, and we have \nrejected a new tax on uranium fuel to pay for the cleanup.\n  With that, I think I have covered the highlights. I am sure there is \nmore the chairman will talk about. I will listen to what he has to say. \nIf there is any pet project I think needs to be highlighted, I will \nrise to my feet again. But I wish to summarize that the committee has \nnot included funding for new starts for either Members of this body or \nfor the President. The funding is dedicated to the completion of \nongoing projects. We have reduced the amount of Member-directed \nspending by 8 percent from previous years as we hear the complaint some \npeople have with respect to that process.\n  We have worked hard to rebalance the administration's request to \nensure that investment in the water infrastructure is sufficient. We \nrecognize that we could not accommodate all the needs across the \ncountry, so we focused our effort on ongoing projects and forgoing new \nstarts.\n  I believe this budget strikes an appropriate balance and I recommend \nits adoption.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of \nits third appropriations bill for fiscal year\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\n2010. The bill before the Senate provides funding for the Department of \nEnergy, the Army Corps of Engineers and for related agencies. The \nfunding in the bill totals $33.75 billion. This is nearly $650 million \nlower than the administration requested.\n  As we begin our debate on this bill, I urge my colleagues not to \ndelay action on this measure. The Senate will only be in session for 2 \nmore weeks prior to the August recess. The Appropriations Committee has \nreported seven bills which have already passed the House and are \nawaiting Senate action. We need to get this bill passed so that we can \nmove on to the other appropriations bills that are ready for \nconsideration. Passing appropriations bills and providing the funding \nessential to run our Federal Government is one of the most important \nduties of this Senate. We need to act responsibly and move this \nlegislation.\n  All Senators should have an interest in seeing this bill passed. It \nprovides critical funding for our nation's waterways, for safeguarding \nour nuclear power industry, and for programs to improve energy usage, \nconservation and discovery. I know of very little controversy \nassociated with this measure. I would ask any Member who is interested \nin amending this bill to come to the floor today to offer any \namendment.\n  I am very grateful to Chairman Dorgan and Ranking Member Bennett for \ntheir hard work on this measure. The committee strongly endorsed the \nrecommendations in this bill and passed the measure unanimously. I \nbelieve this bill deserves the support of all my colleagues. I urge all \nMembers of the Senate to work with the managers and help us attain \nquick passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, a couple of additional points:\n  No. 1, the administration's budget to the Congress for this year did \nrecommend an increase in Corps of Engineers funding for water issues. \nThey should be complimented for that. That is a step forward. We have \nseen relatively flat and underfunded budgets for the Corps of Engineers \nin recent years. It is encouraging. We added to it, of course, but the \ninvestment needed in major water projects to be completed is very \nimportant. I appreciate the administration's decision to increase, at \nlong last, the recommendations there.\n  No. 2, my colleague, Senator Bennett, mentioned Yucca Mountain. I \nexpect that will be mentioned more than once during this discussion in \nthe next day or so. We are going to see the building of some additional \nnuclear power plants in this country. The reason is pretty obvious: \nOnce built, nuclear power plants do not emit CO2 and \ntherefore do not contribute to the warming of the planet. We are \nbeginning to see additional activity. Companies are preparing license \napplications now.\n  Senator Bennett described the issue of Yucca Mountain. I do want to \nmake a point about that because it is important. I didn't come to the \nCongress with a strong feeling about building additional nuclear power \nplants. I have, with my colleague, increased some funding for loan \nguarantees for nuclear power plants in a previous appropriations bill \nbecause I come down on the side of doing everything, and doing it as \nbest we can, to address this country's energy challenges. They are \nsignificant and require building some additional nuclear power \ncapacity.\n  This President campaigned last year against opening Yucca Mountain. \nIt was not a surprise to the American people that he would at this \njuncture take the position that Yucca is not the place for a permanent \nrepository for high level waste materials. The Secretary of Energy and \nthe administration have recognized that, not proceeding with opening \nYucca Mountain, does not mean we don't need an intellectual framework \nfor nuclear waste. They have indicated and committed themselves to \nthat, the development of an alternative framework for how we address \nthe issue of waste. We have to do that because, in order to build \nplants, we have to establish waste confidence. I am convinced the \nadministration is doing the right thing in the sense that they have \nsaid we don't want to open Yucca, but they are saying there has to be \nan alternative. We are committed to trying to find a solution and \nexplore the alternatives with a blue ribbon commission.\n  I wish to mention the National Laboratories. This bill funds our \nnational science, energy, and weapons laboratories. These laboratories \nare the crown jewels of our country's research capability. We used to \nhave the Bell Labs, and we had laboratories that were world renowned, \nworld class, that didn't have anything comparable in the world. The \nBell Labs largely don't exist at this point. Much of our capability in \nscience for research and technology exists in these science labs we \nfund in this bill. I am determined to find ways to make certain those \nbest and brightest scientists and engineers working on the future of \ntomorrow and the new technologies for tomorrow at the national science \nlaboratories have some feeling of security about their future. The last \nthing we should want is to see the roller-coaster approach to jobs at \nour National Laboratories and our science labs.\n  We had a hearing some while ago in our subcommittee on the issue of \nhow to continue to use coal in the future. That leads to the question \nof carbon capture and sequestration. I held a hearing in our \nsubcommittee on carbon capture and beneficial use. One of the witnesses \nfrom one of our laboratories, Margie Tatro from Sandia National \nLaboratory, talked about what they are working on. It was breathtaking. \nWe have this giant problem related to using coal, but it is not an \ninsurmountable problem. She talked about the work they are doing with \nrespect to concentrated solar power to be used in a heat engine to take \nCO2 in on one side of the engine and water in on the other \nside. They fracture the molecules and, through thermal chemical \ndynamics, they create methane gas from the air. I don't know exactly \nwhere all this goes.\n  Deep in our laboratories are some of the brightest people working on \nthese issues. We will solve some very vexing and challenging energy \nissues through research and development programs. I look at what we are \ndoing in those areas for energy efficiency and renewable energy such as \nfor hydrogen, biomass and biorefineries, solar energy, wind energy, \ngeothermal energy, vehicle technologies, building technologies, \nindustrial technology, weatherization, State energy programs, advanced \nbattery manufacturing, and more.\n  All of these issues are investments in the country's future and will, \nno doubt in my mind, unlock the mysteries of science to give us the \ncapability to do things we did not dream possible. That opens up the \nopportunity to find new sources of energy, to move us way from this \nunbelievable dependence on foreign oil, to move toward different \nconstructs in building efficiency, appliances, and new vehicles. That \nsolves a number of things, allowing us to produce more energy, more \nrenewable energy, more fossil energy, but it also allows us to conserve \nmuch more because we are prodigious wasters of energy.\n  I didn't mention one other area of electricity--and it goes with \nconservation--incorporating smart grid technologies. We will in the \nfuture see substantial amounts of smart metering in homes that allows \npeople to change very substantially the way they use electricity in \ntheir homes. They have not had, up until this point, that capability, \nbut the capability, because of the research going on and the \ndemonstration programs, some of which we are funding, can increase all \nacross the country in the future. That, too, will invest in making us \nless dependent on foreign oil.\n  All of these things play a role in what we are trying to do.\n  In the electric delivery and energy reliability portion of our bill, \nwe have programs for clean energy transmission and reliability, smart \ngrid, cyber-security for energy delivery systems. They are examples of \na wide range of investments in all of these areas that will make this a \nbetter country and advance our energy and water interests.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   In Memoriam: William Proctor Jones\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise to make a statement in honor and \nin memory of William Proctor Jones. He died three weeks ago on July 7, \nthe day before we actually wrote and marked up this bill in \nsubcommittee.\n  Proctor Jones was a longtime staff director of this subcommittee. His \ndeath is a great sorrow for our members and staff who worked with him. \nHis life was a great blessing for this country.\n  He first came to work in the Senate in April of 1961. He went to work \nfor his home State senator, Richard Russell of Georgia. Proctor moved \nto the Appropriations Committee in 1970 and worked there 27 years until \n1997. Since 1973 and beyond and for the majority of his time on the \ncommittee, Proctor served as staff director of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee.\n  For decades, as this bill was brought to the floor of the Senate, \nProctor Jones was sitting on the floor knowing that he played a very \nsignificant role in putting together the investments this country was \nmaking in the critical areas of energy and water. Proctor became a very \nclose adviser and close personal friend of Senator Bennett Johnston, \nthe Energy and Water Subcommittee's longtime chairman.\n  For those of us who knew Proctor and relied upon him, he defined the \nvery best of the term ``public servant.'' He was tireless in his work. \nHe was a master of the budget and the appropriations process and an \nexpert in many policy fields this subcommittee has dealt with over the \nyears. His service made this country a much better place.\n  This country moves forward because a lot of people do a lot of good \nthings in common cause to make judgments about what will strengthen \nAmerica. It is often the case that those of us who are elected and \nserve have our names on a piece of legislation or our names on a report \nof a subcommittee such as this, but it is also often the case that some \nvery key people who have devoted their lives to good public service \nplayed a major role in making good legislation happen. William Proctor \nJones is one of those.\n  Today, as we take up the piece of legislation from a subcommittee he \nspent decades working on, I honor his memory and thank him and his \nfamily in this time of sorrow and thank Proctor Jones for all of the \nwork he did for his country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I associate myself and those of all \nminority Members with the comments of the chairman about Proctor Jones. \nI didn't have the opportunity to work with him as closely as others \nhave, but the legacy the chairman has described is genuine and real. \nAll of us in the Senate, regardless of party, wish to acknowledge that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from Utah and I would ask of \nSenators who have amendments to this legislation that if they wish to \ncome now, we would very much like to have amendments offered. Certainly \nthe majority leader has wanted to bring appropriations bills to the \nfloor of the Senate. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee \ndescribed appropriately, a few minutes ago, the importance of trying to \nget these appropriations bills completed. So working through the full \ncommittee we are winding our way through.\n  Now Senator Reid is bringing them to the floor, and I deeply \nappreciate his determination to do that. It is a marked departure from \nwhat we were able to do previously. We would like to get individual \nappropriations bills done, get them to conference, have a conference \nwith the House, and get them to the President for his signature. That \nis the way the Congress is supposed to work. It is the way \nappropriations bills are supposed to be done.\n  We will have amendments, I am sure. We were told someone has prepared \nnearly 20 amendments. But, look, they ought to have that opportunity. \nIn the past couple years they did not have that opportunity. That is \nwhat Senator Reid is doing now, to say: Bring these to the floor. Give \npeople an opportunity to take a look at what the Appropriations \nCommittee has done. If they disagree, come to the floor with \namendments, have a discussion, and vote on the amendments. It is \nexactly what we should do.\n  It is a problem, however, that we do not have unlimited time. My hope \nis--and I think Senator Bennett's hope is--we could have people come \nover, offer amendments, and we could finish this bill in the next \ncouple of days. It would be great to finish it late tomorrow night or \nperhaps Wednesday at the latest. But in order to do that, we would need \nsome cooperation. We would very much ask people to tell us what their \namendments are, come over and file amendments, and come and debate the \namendments. The point is, we are here and ready, and we very much want \nto get this piece of legislation completed.\n  I have described in some respects the urgency of our energy policies \nin this country. Well, the fact is, passing this legislation, and doing \nso now, will give us the opportunity early in the fiscal year to have \nthe Department of Energy and the administration develop energy strategy \nbased on these investments. For the first time in a long time, we will \nknow where we are headed.\n  I have always felt we ought to be saying: Look, here is where America \nis headed on energy. Here is what we are going to do on renewable \nenergy. Here is what we are going to do on carbon capture and storage. \nHere is where we are headed. You can invest in it. You can count on it, \nbelieve in it, because this is America's policy. Part of that policy is \ndeveloped through the authorization committees, and no small part is \ndeveloped in what we fund in the Department of Energy. Exactly the same \nis true with respect to water policy.\n  Let me make this point as well. This country had an economy that fell \noff a cliff in the first part of October of last year, and we still are \nin a deep recession. In the middle of a very deep recession, a piece of \nlegislation that is going to provide the funding, hopefully by October \n1, to proceed ahead building and creating water projects and other \nthings puts people to work. It invests in the country's economy in a \nway that puts people to work and provides jobs. That is very important.\n  For a lot of reasons, again, I commend the majority leader for \nbringing this to the floor. We will hope for some cooperation. We want \namendments, if they want to bring amendments to the floor. We want them \ntoday or beginning in the morning. Senator Bennett and I wish to work \nwith our colleagues to try to review amendments. We wish to work with \nthem. Perhaps they have some ideas we did not think of. We could add to \nthis bill by consent, or others perhaps we can debate and have a vote \non.\n  We want to make that known to our colleagues. We are looking forward \nto completing this bill in the early part or at least no later than \nmidweek.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 370\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I want to spend a little time on a bill \nthat has to do with one of the three major interests we are going to \nhave during the recess. One of the issues is one I feel very strongly \nabout; that is, what is happening right now at Guantanamo Bay. Some \nrefer to it as Gitmo. I have some very strong feelings about that.\n  I do not know why our President has this obsession that he is going \nto turn loose or bring these detainees, these terrorist detainees, back \nto the United States. If you do that, either to try them or to bring \nthem back here, they become magnets for terrorist activity.\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\n  We have detained about 800 al-Qaida and Taliban combatants at Gitmo. \nWe have to understand that a terrorist combatant is someone different \nthan you would normally--we are not talking about criminals here. We \nare not talking about even people who represent countries. We are \ntalking about terrorist combatants. To date, over 540 have been \ntransferred or released, leaving approximately 230 at Gitmo.\n  Here is the problem we have. If I were making this talk, as I was, \nabout a month ago, I would say we had about 280 detainees at Gitmo. The \nproblem is, you cannot get rid of them by asking some country to take \nthem because the countries will not do it. You do not want to bring \nthem back to the United States because, as I said, that becomes a \nmagnet.\n  So our President has been, one by one, trying to bring these back, \nputting them in our system for trial here in the United States. It is \nimportant to understand the rules of evidence are different. If you are \nin a military tribunal, you can dispose of these people. But you cannot \ndo it--for example, hearsay evidence is not admissible in the courts in \nthe United States. So it would not fit in our Federal system.\n  President Obama has ordered the Guantanamo facility be closed. He has \nrecently given an extension to that.\n  In 2007, the Senate voted 94 to 3 on a nonbinding resolution to block \ndetainees from being transferred to the United States. It said: \nDetainees housed at Guantanamo Bay should not be released into the \nAmerican society nor should they be transferred stateside into \nfacilities in American communities and neighborhoods.\n  Well, that is very specific. In fact, I had the amendment to do that \non the Defense authorization bill only last week. Quite frankly, it was \nblocked by the Democratic majority.\n  On May 20, 2009, the Senate voted 90 to 6--that was my and Senator \nInouye's language; it was a bipartisan amendment--to prohibit funding \nfor the transfer of Gitmo detainees to the United States. We are \nhitting them two different ways. One is, we are saying you cannot bring \nthem over here. Second, you cannot try them over here. And now, \nthirdly, we are not going to pay for any relocation of these people.\n  Unfortunately, the supplemental appropriations conference deleted \nthat provision. That was a provision that passed 90 to 6, authored by \nme, Inhofe, and Senator Inouye, the senior Senator from Hawaii. But \nthey took it out. So that means it is not there right now for trials. \nBut the law does block funding for permanently transferred detainees \nfrom Gitmo to the United States for the 2009 budget year, which ends on \nSeptember 30.\n  The House Appropriations Committee will vote this week on language \ncontained in a manager's amendment proposed by Representative Jerry \nLewis of California prohibiting the administration from spending any \nmoney to move prisoners to U.S. soil. Last Thursday, the Senate \nDemocrats again blocked an attempt to consider an amendment that would \nhave permanently prevented the detainees from being transferred from \nGitmo. That was my amendment. It was part of the Defense authorization \nbill. When President Barack Obama took office, there was one free bed \nat the supermax prison in Colorado, with a typically long waiting list \nto move high-security prisoners into supermax.\n  To understand what this is, the supermax prison is one with the very \nhighest level of security, a place where they might argue that you \ncould put a terrorist there and that terrorist, regardless of how \nserious he was, is one who would be secure. The problem they are \noverlooking is, if they are located in the United States, they become a \nmagnet for terrorism.\n  I know President Obama, at one time, was proposing some 17 sites in \nAmerica where we could put these Gitmo detainees. One of those happened \nto be in Fort Sill, in my State of Oklahoma. I went down to Fort Sill \nto look at our prison facility down there. There is a master sergeant--\nno, I am sorry, Sergeant Major Carter was her name. She was in charge \nof the prison. That prison was set up as a normal military prison but \ncertainly not suitable for detainees, not suitable for terrorists. It \nhappens that Sergeant Major Carter--you can call her and ask her about \nthis. She had two tours at Gitmo, and she said: Why in the world are \nyou guys in Washington and this President trying to close Gitmo? It is \nan asset we need. It is a place where they can be secure. It is a place \nwhere they have treated them humanely over the years. Well, anyway, so \nwhen you look at what we have here, there are no places that are \nappropriate.\n  Assistant Attorney General David Kris testified at the same hearing \nof the House Armed Services Committee that both civilian and federal \njails and military prisons are being considered for potential future \nincarceration for prisoners facing criminal prosecution, military \ntribunals or long-term detention without trial, more than 50 have been \ncleared for release, and an administration task force is sorting \nthrough the remaining 229 prisoners to determine their fate. What we \nare saying is we have already picked the low-hanging fruit. We have \nalready taken care of the problem of those individuals who either a \ncountry won't take back or you can find someplace to put them. But the \nremainder are the real tough guys, the bad guys whom we don't want in \nour society. Government lawyers in both the Obama and the Bush \nadministrations have said that an unspecified number of detainees \nshould continue to be held without trial, stating that some of the \nevidence against them will be classified or thin, and the government \nfears these most dangerous detainees could be released should they be \ngiven their day in court; that is, their day in court in the United \nStates.\n  If you look at the facility they have down there, it is made for this \ntype of detainee. It is one that will allow the security of evidence so \nit doesn't threaten other people, and it is something that cannot take \nplace in this country.\n  Johnson also said the Obama administration has not yet determined \nwhere it will hold newly captured al-Qaida and Taliban prisoners for \nextended detention after the Guantanamo Bay prison closes, if it should \nclose. Of course, my effort is to keep it open. So far the only \nGuantanamo Bay detainee brought to face trial in a U.S. criminal court \nis Ahmed Ghailani. He is the Tanzanian whom we sent to New York and \nfaces charges in conjunction with the two bombings. We remember the two \nbombings in Tanzania and Kenya. Federal prosecutors said last Friday \nthey no longer plan to hold Mohammed Jawad, who threw a grenade at a \nU.S. convoy in 2002, as a wartime prisoner, a signal that the Obama \nadministration intends to bring him to the United States before a \ncriminal court.\n  Last week, Democratic Members in the House and the Senate said \nMichigan prisons set to close because of the State budget crunch could \ntake the high-profile prisoners from Gitmo, creating jobs lost in the \nauto industry.\n  Let's stop and think that one through. These are elected \nrepresentatives from the State of Michigan, the two Senators and \nRepresentative Stupak, who are suggesting that we could put those \nprisoners, these high-level, high-security terrorist detainees in \nprisons in Michigan and that would cause them to have to go through \nthere and provide jobs to update the prisons. Let's stop and think that \none through. Why not just go ahead and do something with the \nindividuals who are there, leaving them where they are right now, and \nget into a public works program where at least they could be spending \nthat money on roads and highways.\n  Let me do this. I have almost given up--in fact, I did give up--\ntrying to put the language in the Senate Armed Services Committee's \nDefense authorization bill to preclude the President from putting these \nindividuals into the United States. There is only one vehicle left. \nThat is my Senate bill 370, S. 370. It is a one-page bill. I have 22 \ncosponsors. It merely says we cannot pay to transfer any of these \ndetainees to the United States, and we are not going to be able to try \nthem here. So it is the final answer to this matter.\n  Madam President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that S. 370 be \nbrought up for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill object, the Senator from Oklahoma knows that such a unanimous \nconsent cannot be entertained at this point. He\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\nhas not consulted with the majority leader who is in charge of \nscheduling legislative matters to come to the floor of the Senate. So \non behalf of the majority leader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I would only respond to my very good \nfriend from North Dakota--in fact, we were recently talking about how \nin agreement we were on some of these things, the potential we have to \nexplore in the United States. I have talked to the leadership to try to \nbring this up and have not been able to do it. I guess you get to the \npoint where you are frustrated and you know that two-thirds of the \nAmerican people want to set something in place to keep these terrorists \nfrom coming into the United States. All I ask is to get my bill up. I \nwill be trying to do that in the future.\n  I wish to ask the manager of the current bill on the floor, the \nminority manager, if he desires to have the floor for the purpose of \nthe consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from Oklahoma had asked to \nspeak in morning business. Senator Bennett and I have no objection to \nthat. We are waiting for amendments to be offered. If someone were to \ncome and offer an amendment, we would hope the Senator would relinquish \nthe floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from North Dakota and I assure him \nthat if someone comes down with an amendment, I will cease and yield to \nthem.\n\n\n                             Cap and Trade\n\n  In the meantime, there is another subject I wish to speak about. I \nhave been doing this now for 10 years every week.\n  It is safe to say that at 3:09 a.m., on June 26, most of America was \nasleep. While they slept, Democratic leaders in the House were creating \na nightmare. In the early morning hours, Speaker Pelosi and her \ndeputies were pushing the largest tax increase in American history.\n  In the dead of night, with no one watching, they engaged in full-\nscale arm twisting, back-room dealing, and outright pork-barreling to \ngarner support for a massive bill few, if any, had actually read or \nunderstood. You have to keep in mind there are about 400 pages of this \nbill that weren't printed until 3 o'clock in the morning of the morning \nthe bill was voted on.\n  When America awoke, they found Democrats talking about green jobs and \nthe new clean green energy economy. They spoke of free markets and \ninnovation and energy independence. All of it sounded so appealing. Yet \nnone of it was true. That is because Waxman-Markey is full of \nregulations, mandates, bureaucracy, and big government programs. \nWaxman-Markey is, to quote John Dingell, ``a tax, and a great big one'' \non small businesses, families, and consumers.\n\n  I don't blame the Democrats for selling cap and trade as something it \nis not. This is a political imperative for them because the American \npeople now know what cap and trade is and they don't like it.\n  According to independent political analyst Charlie Cook:\n\n       Many Democrats getting back to Washington from Independence \n     Day recess reported getting an earful from their constituents \n     over the `energy tax hike' . . .\n\n  Further, Cook noted--and I am quoting Charlie Cook right now:\n\n       The perception is that this is a huge tax increase at a \n     time when people can ill afford one. Hence, Democrats, \n     whether they supported the bill or not, are getting battered, \n     increasing their blood pressure.\n\n  Let me say this. This is an issue we are going to be talking about. I \nhave been on the Environment and Public Works Committee since I came to \nthe Senate in 1994. I was the chairman of that committee back when the \nKyoto treaty was considered. At that time, as everyone else, I assumed \nmanmade gases, anthropogenic gases, CO2, methane, were \ncausing global warming. Now people are careful to say climate change \nand not global warming since we are in about the ninth year of a \ncooling period. But at that time I assumed it was true. That is all \neverybody talked about. Until the Wharton School did a study and the \nquestion was posed: If the United States were to pass and ratify the \nKyoto treaty and live by its emissions requirements, how much would it \ncost? The range was between $300 billion and $330 billion a year. It \nwas at that point that I decided it would be a good time to look at the \nscience behind that and see if, in fact, the science was there.\n  We are talking about 10 years ago. After looking at it and studying \nit, we found scientist after scientist who was coming out of the closet \nand saying this thing was started by the United Nations, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the reports they give \nare not reports from scientists; they are reports that are from \npolicymakers. Consequently, on my Web site, the Web site \ninhofe.senate.gov, I have listed over 700 scientists who were on the \nother side of this issue and now are on the side saying: Wait a minute. \nThis is something that is not real, and it certainly is not worth the \nlargest tax increase in history.\n  I remember when Vice President Al Gore was in office, the Clinton-\nGore administration, and at that time they decided they wanted to come \nout with a report, in order to sell the idea of ratifying the Kyoto \ntreaty, that they would come up with a report to say how much good \ncould be done, how much the temperature could be lowered over a 50-year \nperiod of time if all developed countries, all developed nations \nratified and lived by the emissions requirements, how much would it \nreduce the temperature. The results--and the man's name was Tom \nQuigley. Tom Quigley was the foremost scientist at that time. He said \nit would reduce the temperature over a 50-year period by .07 of 1 \ndegree Celsius in 50 years. That is not even measurable.\n  I wish to inquire if the Senator from Florida wishes to speak as in \nmorning business or on this bill?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, morning business.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Morning business. Well, I am going to be awhile.\n  Anyway, what I would suggest doing is going back and looking at what \nhas happened since the Kyoto treaty was considered. In 2005, we had the \nMcCain-Lieberman bill. The McCain-Lieberman bill was very similar to \nthe Kyoto treaty. It was cap and trade. It was very similar to the \nWarner-Lieberman bill and very similar to what we are looking at today, \nthe cap-and-trade bill, which is the Waxman-Markey bill. They are \nessentially the same thing; that is, cap and trade, a very \nsophisticated way to try to regulate greenhouse gases or primarily \nCO2.\n  I would suggest that many of the people who were talking about doing \nthis in the very beginning were people who were saying: Well, why don't \nyou pass a tax on CO2? I would say: If you want to get rid \nof CO2 and be honest and straightforward, go ahead and pass \na tax and get rid of it. As it turned out, they didn't want to do that \nbecause that way people would know how much they are being taxed. If \nyou have a cap and trade, that is government picking winners and \nlosers, and you might be able to make people think they are actually \nnot getting a tax increase.\n  I wish to quote a few of the people who have weighed in on this \nissue. If you don't believe what I am saying about cap and trade, \nlisten to some of the past quotes from members of the Obama \nadministration and other proponents of cap and trade. They speak for \nthemselves.\n  This is what President Obama said prior to the time he was President. \nHe said:\n\n       Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity prices \n     would necessarily skyrocket . . . Because I'm capping \n     greenhouse gases, coal, power plants, natural gas--you name \n     it--whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they \n     would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost \n     money. They will pass that money on to consumers.\n  John Dingell:\n\n       Nobody in this country realizes that cap and trade is a \n     tax, and it's a great big one.\n\n  Charlie Rangel said this not too long ago, speaking on cap and trade:\n\n       Whether you call it a tax, everyone agrees that it's going \n     to increase the cost to the consumer.\n\n  Then Peter Orszag, former CBO Director and current White House OMB \nDirector, said:\n\n       Under a cap and trade program, firms would not ultimately \n     bear most of the costs of the allowances, but instead would \n     pass\n\n[[Page S8118]]\n\n     them along to their customers in the form of higher prices.\n\n  That is the appointed OMB Director, Peter Orszag, saying that.\n  Continuing his quote:\n\n       Such price increases stem from the restriction on emissions \n     and would occur regardless of whether the government sold \n     emission allowances or gave them away. Indeed, the price \n     increases would be essential to the success of a cap and \n     trade program, because they would be the most important \n     mechanism through which businesses and households would be \n     encouraged to make investments and behavioral changes that \n     reduced CO2 emissions.\n\n  He said further:\n\n       The government could either raise $100 by selling \n     allowances and then give that amount in cash to particular \n     businesses and individuals, or it could simply give $100 \n     worth of allowances to those businesses and individuals, who \n     could immediately and easily transform the allowances into \n     cash through the secondary market.\n\n  He said further:\n\n       If you didn't auction the [CO2] permits, it \n     would represent the largest corporate welfare program that \n     has ever been enacted in the history of the United States. \n     All of the evidence is that what would occur is that \n     corporate profits would increase by approximately the value \n     of the permits.\n\n  Further, although the direct economic effects of a cap-and-trade \nprogram described in the previous section would fall disproportionately \non some industries, on some regions of the country, and on low-income \nhouseholds, we had several people testify before the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee--and you saw the most notorious one speak 2 \nweeks ago, representing the U.S. Black Chamber of Commerce. He was \ntestifying how regressive this cap-and-trade tax would be. If you stop \nand think about it, sure, it is true, if you raise necessarily, as they \nhave to do, under the House-passed Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill--if \nyou raise the cost, it is going to be the cost of energy. So you have \npoor families on fixed incomes who still have to heat their homes in \nthe winter, so the percentage of their expendible income they use in \nheating their homes would be far greater. So it is regressive. That is \nwhy he got so emotional when he was here talking about what the cost \nwould be to the poor people of America.\n  Douglas Elmendorf, Director of the CBO, said that some of the effects \nof a CO2 cap would be similar to those of raising such \ntaxes. The higher prices caused by the cap would reduce real wages and \nreal returns on capital, which would be like raising marginal tax rates \non those sources of income.\n  All of these people are experts. They work in the government, and \nthey work--most of them--in the Obama administration. They are saying \nthis would be the largest tax increase in history on the American \npeople.\n  I think that during the recess--if we ever get to it--which is \nsupposed to take place a week from Friday, we will be in a position to \ntalk about three major issues. We have already talked about efforts to \npass some kind of a government-operated health system. I talked about \nGitmo, the closing of that, which I think there is no justification for \nwhatsoever. The other thing is that it is the largest tax increase in \nthe history of this country.\n  In an interview with Michael Jackson, AutoNation CEO, he said:\n\n       We need more expensive gasoline to change consumer \n     behavior.\n\n  Otherwise, Americans will continue to favor big vehicles no matter \nwhat kinds of fuel economy standards the government imposes on \nautomakers. He added that $4 a gallon ``is a good start.''\n  These are people who do want to increase the cost of fuel for an \nagenda, which will not help the environment.\n  Alan Mulally, CEO of Ford Motor Company, said:\n\n       Until the consumer is involved, we are not going to make \n     progress in reducing the amount of oil the United States \n     consumes.\n\n  On and on, we have people--I plan to spend time on the floor talking \nabout the problems with this because I fear that if you don't do \nanything, we are going to end up passing the largest tax increase in \nthe history of America.\n  Even the Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, said:\n\n       Coal is my worst nightmare.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n\n  That is the Secretary of Energy for the Obama administration who said \nthat.\n  He also said:\n\n       What the American family does not want is to pay an \n     increasing fraction of their budget, their precious dollars, \n     for energy costs.\n\n  He said further:\n\n       A cap and trade bill will likely increase the costs of \n     electricity. . . .\n\n  This is the Secretary of Energy under President Obama. He said:\n\n       These costs will be passed on to the consumers. But the \n     issue is, how does it actually--how do we interact in terms \n     with the rest of the world? If other countries don't impose a \n     cost on carbon, then we would be at a disadvantage. . . .We \n     should look at considering duties that would offset that \n     cost.\n\n  Then, of course, the chairman of our committee, Senator Boxer, said:\n\n       The biggest priority is softening the blow on our trade-\n     sensitive industries and our consumers. I just want you to \n     know that that's the goal.\n\n  I am glad she is saying that is a goal.\n  Senator McCaskill weighed in--and I agree with her--saying:\n\n       We need to be a leader in the world, but we don't want to \n     be a sucker.\n\n  That is a good statement.\n\n       And if we go too far with this, all we're going to do is \n     chase more jobs to China and India, where they've been \n     putting up coal-fired plants every 10 minutes.\n\n  That was Senator McCaskill from Missouri. She is a Democrat. Yet she \nhas very strong feelings that this would chase off our jobs to foreign \ncountries. She mentioned China and India. They are cranking out two new \ncoal-fired plants every week in China.\n  Let me do this. Three weeks ago, in our Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works--I want to commend the Director of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, Lisa Jackson--I asked her this on the record, on TV: \nIf we pass the Waxman-Markey bill as it is written right now, as it \ncame over from the House, and it were signed into law by the President, \nwhat would be the result of that in terms of reducing the amount of \nCO2 in the atmosphere?\n  She thought for a minute, and then she said something that surprised \nme: It wouldn't reduce emissions at all.\n  In other words, even if we pass this largest tax increase in American \nhistory on the people, we are still not going to reduce the amount of \nCO2 that goes into the atmosphere. In fact, you could \nargue--and it has been argued--that it would increase it because it \nwould chase the manufacturing jobs to other countries. They are \nestimating 9.5 percent of the manufacturing jobs would be sent to China \nand other countries, where they have no emission restrictions, and that \nwould have a net increase of CO2.\n  With that, I see several colleagues coming to the floor. In deference \nto them, I will yield, but before I yield the floor, let me make one \nlast request. I want to do this. I have been concerned--and I don't \nknow that the Senator from Florida was here when we were talking about \nGitmo. I was frustrated when we were unable to get my amendment on the \nDefense authorization bill that would have the effect of keeping Gitmo \nopen. The only thing left for me is S. 370.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 370.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, on behalf of the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nI might speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Tourism in Florida\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, most people know that tourism \nis certainly a vital part of my State's economy. I know that many of \nour Florida cities, just like so many cities elsewhere around the \ncountry, offer some of the finest and most competitive prices on hotels \nand conference facilities. So you can imagine that I was absolutely \nfloored when I found out that some Federal agencies are blacklisting \nFlorida cities and other cities in the country for travel\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\nand conferences because they are looked at as a vacation or resort \ndestination.\n  The hotel industry in Florida is already reeling, it is facing a \nsignificant decline because of the recession. Orlando hotels are \nfilling only about 64 percent of their rooms. That is a drop of 8 \npercent from last year. So you can imagine that I was stunned when I \nfound out that in a Wall Street Journal article last week they had \nlisted Orlando and Las Vegas as cities mentioned in e-mails from the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Department of Justice as no-go-to \ndestinations.\n  Well, what they ought to be looking at is what is most cost-effective \nfor the government if it is going to an out-of-town location from \nwherever that particular agency is to have a conference. When you \ncompare, for example--I could be talking about any city in Florida and \nmany other cities in this country, but let me take Orlando, for \nexample. When you compare the cost of a hotel room in Orlando during \nthe season with the cost of a hotel room, let's say, in Washington, DC, \nduring the season, you will find that the Orlando hotels on average are \n$100 less per night than the other city in that comparison. Likewise, \nif you look at the cost of airfare as a destination, you will find that \nthe round-trip airfare to a place such as Orlando is considerably less. \nBut some agencies in the Federal Government, because Orlando is looked \nupon as a resort or vacation destination, have gotten so sensitized to \nthe fact that we saw the Wall Street bigwigs going haywire, with all \ntheir perks and all of their extra emoluments, that they want to avoid \nthe perception of going to a resort destination.\n  I wish it hadn't come to this, but I have had to draft legislation to \nmake it illegal for the Federal Government agencies to design travel \npolicies that blacklist certain U.S. cities simply because they are \nlooked at as destination cities for a lot of tourism. Talk about a \ndouble whammy in tough economic times when we have seen tourism and \nbusiness travel dropping like a rock.\n\n  It is one thing to avoid nonessential trips for the government to \nsave taxpayers money, but it is taking it a little far when it is \nanother thing that if it is legitimate travel and you then avoid \ncertain cities just because they are where they are.\n  My Senate colleague, Senator Martinez, is helping me with this issue, \nand working together we ought to be able to put an end to any such \npractice.\n  I certainly hope it is not going to take me having to push through \nthis legislation. I am asking the head of the Department of Justice, \nthe Attorney General, and the head of the Department of Agriculture, \nthe Secretary of Agriculture, if they will dig down into the bowels of \ntheir organizations and root out this kind of narrow thinking that is \ngoing on and expressed in those e-mails as reported by the Wall Street \nJournal last Wednesday.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, tomorrow the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee will vote on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to serve \nas Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I thank the nominee and the members of the committee, including our \nDemocratic colleagues, and Chairman Leahy, for their efforts throughout \nthe process. I appreciate Judge Sotomayor's kind words to us about how \nwell the hearings went and her expression of gratitude for the kindness \nand respect she was shown. She is a good person with experience, the \nkind of experience one desires in a nominee, and her personal story is \ncertainly inspiring.\n  However, based on her record as a judge and her judicial philosophy, \nI have concluded that she should not be confirmed to our Nation's \nhighest Court. While differences in style and background are to be \nwelcomed on the Court, no one should sit on the Supreme Court, or any \ncourt, who is not committed to setting aside their personal opinions \nand biases when they render opinions and who is not committed \nfaithfully to following the law, whether they like the law or not. \nImpartiality is the ideal of American law. Judges take an oath to \npursue it, and the American people rightly expect it.\n  Judge Sotomayor's speeches and extrajudicial writings represent \ndramatic expressions of an activist view of judging that is contrary to \nthat ideal. Judge Sotomayor made speech after speech, year after year, \nsetting forth a fully formed judicial philosophy that conflicts with \nthe great American tradition of blind justice and fidelity to the law \nas written.\n  These speeches also contradict the oath that judges take to ``do \nequal right to the poor and the rich'' and to do so ``impartially'' \n``without respect to persons.'' Under the law, under the Constitution \nand laws of the United States, judges are subordinate to our \nConstitution and laws. This ideal is a high one indeed, and it requires \na firm personal commitment to objective truth and a belief in the \nmeaning of words.\n  It has been suggested repeatedly that Judge Sotomayor's words and \nspeeches are being taken out of context. I have read her speeches in \ntheir entirety. Her words are not taken out of context. In fact, when \none reads the entire speeches, the context makes them worse, not \nbetter.\n  My criticism also should not be considered as a personal attack on \nher as a person because there are a number of intellectuals, judges, \nand legal writers who believe in just such a new way of judging. It is \nquite fashionable among some--those who think they are more realistic \nthan naive American citizens, judges, and lawyers who, they believe, \ndelude themselves when they think a judge will or can find true facts \nand apply them fairly to the law as written.\n  Most Americans and most Senators have heard about Judge Sotomayor's \nspeeches, which are clearly outside the mainstream. She has repeatedly \nsaid, among other things, that judges must judge when ``opinions, \nsympathies and prejudices are appropriate.''\n  She accepts that who she is will ``affect the facts I choose to see \nas a judge.''\n  It is her belief that ``a Wise Latina woman, with the richness of her \nexperiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a \nwhite male.''\n  That there is ``no neutrality'' in judging, just a ``series of \nperspectives.'' She has also said the appellate courts are where policy \nis made.\n  These matters have been discussed in some detail by my colleagues and \nat the hearing. Her testimony at the hearing was that these speeches do \nnot reflect her philosophy of judging. It is hard for me to accept that \nher words, expressed over a decade in these speeches, do not reflect \nwhat she actually believes. Indeed, it is an odd position in which to \nfind oneself to be at a hearing and say you don't believe what you have \nbeen saying over the years.\n  But Judge Sotomayor has asked, and her supporters have asked, that we \nlook at her judicial record which proves, she and her supporters say, \nshe is unbiased, and shows that she does not allow personal politics \nand views to influence her decisions. They cite over 3,000 cases she \nhas decided, most without controversy.\n  They have gone to some length to discuss and defend the process by \nwhich she decides cases. Indeed, in her opening statement, Judge \nSotomayor explained: ``[t]he process of judging is enhanced when the \narguments and concerns of the parties to the litigation are understood \nand acknowledged.''\n  She did follow this style in many of the cases that came before her, \ngoing into detail and even being criticized by some in a Washington \nPost article for ``uncommon detail'' that risked ``overstepping'' the \nbounds of an appellate judge.\n  But there is more to the story. Most cases before the courts of \nappeals are fact based and routine and do not raise the kind of serious \nconstitutional issues that the Supreme Court hears and decides on a \nregular basis.\n  I have reviewed carefully three cases--two decided in the last year, \nand one 3 years ago--that are the kinds of cases the Supreme Court \ndeals with regularly. Unfortunately, Judge Sotomayor's handling of \nthese cases was not good. They show, first of all, an apparent lack of \nrecognition of the importance of the issues raised in these three \ncases.\n  In each case, the decisions were extremely short and lacking any real \nlegal analysis. These three cases also\n\n[[Page S8120]]\n\nreached erroneous conclusions. They ignore the plain words of the \nConstitution, and they provide a direct look at how the nominee will \ndecide many important cases that will come before the Court, if she is \nconfirmed, in the decades to come.\n  The case of Ricci v. DeStefano came to her three-judge panel of the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit as an appeal by 18 \nfirefighters. They had passed a promotion exam, but the exam had been \nthrown out by the city of New Haven because the city thought not enough \nof one group passed. The test was thrown out not because it was an \nunfair test. Indeed, the Supreme Court, when the case got there, found \nthat ``there is no genuine dispute that the examinations were job-\nrelated and consistent with business necessity.'' Instead, the city \nthrew out the test because the city did not like the racial results. \nThus, the city discriminated against the firefighters who passed the \nexam because of their race.\n\n  This case is a sensitive case, it is an important case, and we need \nto analyze it carefully. It is noteworthy because the court failed to \nadhere to the simple but plain words of the Constitution.\n  In Ricci, Judge Sotomayor's opinion violated the plain constitutional \ncommand that no one shall be denied ``the equal protection of the \nlaws'' because of their race.\n  Additionally, the case is subject to criticism because of the manner \nin which it was handled. I want to talk about that a minute. Judge \nSotomayor did not deal with this important constitutional issue--a very \nimportant constitutional issue--in a thorough, open, and honest way. \nWithout justification and in violation of the rules of the Second \nCircuit, Judge Sotomayor and the panel initially dismissed the case by \nsummary order; that is, without any published opinion, without even \nadopting the trial court's opinion. No opinion, no explanation.\n  The effect of this summary order was to deal with the case in a way \nthat would not require the opinion to be published or even circulated \namong the other judges on the circuit. This was not justifiable. The \ncircuit court rule states that summary orders are only appropriate \nwhere a ``decision is unanimous and each judge of the panel believes \nthat no jurisprudential purpose would be served by an opinion. . . .''\n  This is a huge constitutional question in this matter. If it were \nnot, the Supreme Court would never have taken it up, and it almost \nslipped by. But by chance, other judges on the Second Circuit \napparently found out about it through news accounts, apparently, and \nbegan to ask about this case that seemed to be of significant import. \nThis resulted in a request by one of the judges--quite unusual when you \nare dealing with a simple summary order--to rehear the case before all \nof the circuit judges. It created a notable dustup. The result was a \nsplit court with half of the judges asking for a rehearing of the case, \nhalf against rehearing it, with the deciding vote not to hear the case, \nnot to reconsider any of the precedent that may have existed, being \ncast by Judge Sotomayor herself.\n  In effect, this was a vote to avoid the full and complete analysis \nthis case cried out for from the beginning. It was only during this \nchallenge that Judge Sotomayor's panel agreed to decide the case then \nby a per curium opinion, an unsigned opinion, which at least then \nadopted for the first time the lower court's opinion which, frankly, I \ndon't think was a very fine opinion for this kind of important case. \nBut that became the opinion she adopted.\n  Still, the firefighters didn't give up hope. They then sought a \nreview by the Supreme Court. Against long odds, the Supreme Court \nagreed to hear their plea. The Court found the ruling erroneous. They \nreversed the Sotomayor court's opinion and rendered a judgment in favor \nof the firefighters. They held that what the city of New Haven did, \nwhich Judge Sotomayor had approved, was simply wrong.\n  At the Judiciary Committee hearing, firefighters Frank Ricci and Ben \nVargas beautifully described what it meant for them to go from a \nsummary dismissal in the Sotomayor court, to a summary judgment victory \nin the Supreme Court. Five years of personal cost, stress, and strain \nsuffered by the firefighters were vindicated by an important victory \nfor equal justice in the Supreme Court.\n  But nothing can erase either the flawed result of Judge Sotomayor's \npanel decision or her panel's apparent attempt to sweep the case under \nthe rug.\n  Secondly, Judge Sotomayor's treatment of critically important second \namendment issues that have come before her is equally troubling, for \nthe same reasons. She simply got the text of the Constitution wrong and \ndid so in such a cursory way that her actions seemed designed to hide \nthe significance of the case and the significance of her ruling.\n  Last year, in a case of great importance, the Supreme Court held in \nthe Heller case that the second amendment, which protects the right of \n``the people to keep and bear Arms,'' provides an individual right--\nwhich I think it clearly does--and that, therefore, the Federal city of \nWashington, DC could not ban its residents from having a handgun in \ntheir homes for protection. In a footnote, the Supreme Court left open \nthe question, not raised in the case, of whether the second amendment \nwould bind the States. The question is simple and of fundamental \nimportance to the second amendment: Does the Constitution bar States \nand cities from denying their residents the right of gun ownership? \nPretty big question. Huge question.\n  On January 28 of this year, in Maloney v. Cuomo, Judge Sotomayor \nissued an opinion on this very issue. And in this opinion, Judge \nSotomayor again failed to follow the text of the Constitution. The \nConstitution is plain and simple on this issue: ``. . . the right of \nthe people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' And when \nyou are talking about the people, you are talking about the right not \njust as it is applied to the Federal Government, I would submit, but \nalso to the States and cities. So the Sotomayor panel looked at this \ntext and decided that a State or local government may infringe, even \ndeny your right.\n  Some argue that Judge Sotomayor was bound by precedent in her \ndecision and there was old case law that her decision followed. But we \nhave looked at this closely and tried to think it through. I would note \nthat the situation the court found itself in shortly after the well-\nknown, tremendously important Heller case had changed, and the Ninth \nCircuit panel, facing the very same issue, disagreed with Judge \nSotomayor. It found that the second amendment does apply to the States. \nThe Seventh Circuit, in a very thorough and carefully written opinion, \nand at its final conclusion, agreed with Judge Sotomayor's panel's \ndecision, but it did so in such a way that it demonstrated its \nrecognition of the importance of this right and the new situation \ncreated by the Supreme Court in Heller. This recognition was utterly \nlacking in Judge Sotomayor's very brief opinion.\n  While it is argued that Judge Sotomayor relied on precedent, the \nprecedent she cited was from the 1800s and does not use the modern test \nfor incorporation that the Supreme Court employs in deciding whether \nrights apply to States, something that has been going on for nearly 100 \nyears. Not only that, but even after the watershed decision by the \nSupreme Court in Heller, she held that it was ``settled law'' that the \nsecond amendment did not apply to the States and that the right to keep \nand bear arms is not a ``fundamental right.''\n  When these points were brought to the Judge's attention during the \nconfirmation hearings, she declined to explain herself, claiming that \nshe had not recently read the cases on which she so recently relied. \nThis is not the level of analysis that the Judiciary Committee has the \nright to expect from a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Make no mistake, the effect of this ruling, if not reversed, if it \nstands, will be to eviscerate the second amendment by allowing States \nand cities to ban all guns, as the District of Columbia had basically \ndone before the Supreme Court reversed that in Heller. In simple terms, \nin a case of great constitutional importance, Judge Sotomayor, once \nagain in an unjustifiably brief opinion, measured in mere paragraphs of \nanalysis, gave short shrift to the plain words of the Constitution.\n  I will say also that after the Supreme Court rendered its ruling in \nHeller, it had a footnote that said since this is a Federal cities \ncase, we don't decide the\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\napplication of the second amendment to the States. But in that \nfootnote, the Court made it quite clear that the prior old cases were \ndecided before it had adopted a different approach to incorporating \nconstitutional rights against the States. It is pretty clear from that \nthey have left this matter open. The judge on the Ninth Circuit found \nthat the question was an open question after Heller.\n  To say it is ``settled law'' that the second amendment does not apply \nto the States is not good, in my view. It is not settled law. I would \ncertainly hope, and millions of Americans will be hoping, that the \nSupreme Court will not rewrite the Constitution; rather, they hope they \nwill declare that the second amendment does apply to the States.\n  Further, she said it was not a fundamental right. That was not a \nphrase used by the other two courts which considered this question, and \nit is gratuitous, in my opinion. The combination of saying it is not a \nfundamental right, which is important to the ultimate analysis, and her \nstatement that it is ``settled law'' that the second amendment does not \napply to the States indicates a lack of appreciation for the importance \nof the second amendment right and a hostility toward the second \namendment.\n  And similarly troubling were the judge's equivocations as to whether \nshe would appropriately recuse herself from considering this issue that \nwill surely come before her on the Supreme Court. She declined to \ncommit to recusing herself if the Seventh or Ninth Circuit cases came \nto the Court, even though those cases raise exactly the same issue as \nthe one she decided against gun rights. I would note also that even the \nHeller case--breathtaking to me--decided by a narrow vote of 5-4 that a \nright to keep and bear arms provided in the Constitution explicitly \napplies to bar the city of Washington, DC, from banning all firearms, \nbasically.\n  In addition to the firefighters case and the second amendment case, \nboth of which involve important issues of constitutional law, Judge \nSotomayor handled, in a similarly cursory manner, a very important \nprivate property rights case which some have called the most egregious \nproperty rights decision in this area since the Supreme Court's \ninfamous decision in the Kelo case a few years ago.\n  Just 3 years ago, after Kelo was decided, which caused quite a storm \nof controversy and a great deal of academic writing, Judge Sotomayor's \ncourt issued an opinion in which a private property owner found his \nproperty, on which he planned to build a CVS pharmacy, taken by \ncondemnation by the city so that another private developer could build \na Walgreen's on the same property. The way this condemnation came about \nshould send chills down the spines of ordinary Americans, because the \nWalgreen developer, who was pursuing a redevelopment plan supported by \nthe city, told the landowner that he could keep his land and build a \nCVS and they wouldn't condemn it. All he had to do was fork over \n$800,000 or half ownership in his business. I look at that and I can \nunderstand why the landowner thought he was being blackmailed. Judge \nSotomayor looked at that and called it business as usual--a simple \nnegotiation. But it is no negotiation when one party possesses the \npower through the city to take your property, whether you agree or not.\n  In another curiously short 2-page opinion, Judge Sotomayor's court \nrejected the landowner's claims, holding that the courtroom doors were \nclosed to the landowner because he had brought his claim too late. The \nlogic was that the landowner had to bring his claim to court months \nbefore the extortion occurred. The effect was to violate the \nConstitution. The Constitution plainly states that property ``shall not \nbe taken for public use without just compensation.'' The Supreme Court \nhas been quite clear that means you can't take private property except \nfor public use.\n  At Judge Sotomayor's hearing, Professor Ilya Somin, who has written \nextensively on property matters, said this case was the most anti-\nproperty rights case since the infamous Kelo decision decided by a \nsplit Court a few years ago. Again, plain constitutional protections \nwere ignored to the detriment of an individual American citizen who was \nstanding up for his constitutional rights.\n  So in three cases, contrary to the plain text of the Constitution, \nJudge Sotomayor has ruled against the individual and in favor of the \nState in the face of seemingly clear provisions of the Constitution, \nfurthering what can be fairly said to be, in each case, a more liberal \nagenda in America. A liberal or a conservative political belief, a \nRepublican or Democratic political belief does not disqualify someone \nfrom serving on the Supreme Court. What does disqualify is when a judge \nallows such beliefs or ideology or opinions to impact decisions that \nthey make in cases.\n  Anyone with more than a casual acquaintance with the law would \ninstantly know that each of these three cases presented issues of great \nlegal importance, and each deserved to be treated with great \nthoughtfulness. Judge Sotomayor surely understood that fact. Yet in \neach instance her decisions were unacceptably short. It seemed to me \nthe only consistency in them was that the result favored a more liberal \napproach to government.\n  So I have come to announce, regretfully, that I cannot support Judge \nSotomayor's elevation to our highest Court. She also now sits in a \nlifetime appointment on the Nation's second highest court, the Court of \nAppeals. Her experience, however well rounded, and background, however \ninspirational, are not enough. What matters is her record on the bench \nand her stated judicial philosophy.\n  I hope I am wrong, but my best judgment, my decision is that a \nSotomayor vote on the Court--the Supreme Court--will be another vote \nfor the new kind of ideological judging, not the kind of objectivity \nand restraint that have served our legal system in our Nation so well. \nThus, I am unable to give my consent to this nomination.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday, July 26, marked the 19th \nanniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act by \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush, on July 26, 1990. Passage of that \nlaw was a great national achievement. I remember being there. I was the \nchief sponsor of the bill. I was at the White House when it was signed. \nIt was a beautiful sunny day. More people were on the White House lawn \nfor the signing of that bill than for the signing of any bill in the \nhistory of this country. It was huge. It was a wonderful day. It was \none of the landmark civil rights bills of our generation--of the 20th \ncentury.\n  Passage of the original Americans with Disabilities Act was a \nbipartisan evident. As the chief sponsor of that bill, I worked very \nclosely with Senator Dole. Of others on the other side of the aisle, \ntwo come to mind: Senator Orrin Hatch, who worked very closely with us \nto get it through, and also Senator Lowell Weicker, of Connecticut. \nSenator Weicker was the first proponent of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, but by the time we were able to get it passed, he was \nno longer in the Senate. But Senator Weicker did yeoman's work in \ngetting it going and pulling everything together before he left the \nSenate.\n  We received invaluable support from President Bush and key members of \nhis administration. I mention, in particular, White House Counsel \nBoyden Gray, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, and Transportation \nSecretary Samuel Skinner.\n  We look back, after 19 years, and what do we see? We see amazing \nprogress. Thanks to the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA as \nwe call it, streets, buildings, and transportation are more accessible \nfor people with physical impairments. Information is offered in \nalternative formats so\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\nit is usable by individuals with visual or hearing impairments. Need I \nmention the closed captioning through which one can be watching the \nwords of my speech on television right now? Closed captioning is now \ngoing all over the country, not just for speeches on the Senate or \nHouse floor but for television programming and important events and \nweather announcements. Again, it all started after the passage of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n  These changes are all around us--curb cuts, widened doorways, \naccessible buses, accessible trains. You never could get on an airplane \nbefore with a seeing-eye dog. Now when you get on an airplane you see \npeople come on with a seeing-eye dog. They are allowed to do that.\n  These changes are now so integrated into our daily lives it is \nsometimes hard to remember what life was like before the ADA. After \nADA, employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations so \npeople with disabilities have an equal opportunity in the workplace. \nThere were four goals of the ADA, four stated goals in the law: \nequality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and \neconomic self-sufficiency.\n  Last year, again with broad bipartisan support, we were able to pass \nthe ADA Amendments Act, overturning a series of Supreme Court cases \nthat greatly narrowed the scope of who is protected by the ADA. \nBeginning in 1999 and going to 2000 and 2001, there were a series of \ncases, the three most important are what we call the Sutton, the \nMurphy, and the Kirkingburg cases that came before the Supreme Court. \nIn each of those cases, the Supreme Court did not look at the report \nlanguage and the findings we had made in the Congress on who is covered \nby the ADA--the fact that mitigating circumstances were not to be taken \ninto account and that there was not a demanding standard to be met. The \nSupreme Court turned that on its head. They narrowed who was covered by \nthe ADA. They said that mitigating circumstances had to be taken into \naccount and that there had to be a demanding standard for who was \ncovered.\n  Again, we worked on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to straighten out \nthese hearings, to overturn the Supreme Court's findings as a matter of \nfact, and we did. We did it on a bipartisan basis, both the House and \nthe Senate, and President George Herbert Walker Bush's son, then-\nPresident George Bush, was able to sign those into law, and I was able \nto be down at the White House on that. Again, it was a very poignant \nmoment with both President George W. Bush and his father, President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, being there for the signing of the ADA \namendments. Thanks to that legislation of last year, people who were \ndenied coverage under the ADA will now be covered.\n  As we celebrate the 19th anniversary of this great civil rights law, \nit is remarkable to think that many young people with disabilities have \ngrown up taking advantage of these changes, and they have no memory of \nthe way things used to be before the law was passed. I remember \nrecently as I--as we are wont to do as Senators--had my picture taken \nout here at the front of the Capitol with a group of young people, one \nof whom was using a wheelchair, I was talking about the upcoming \nanniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I pointed to the \ncurb cuts so someone could come up and use a wheelchair. I said: You \nknow, those were not there before 1992.\n  This young person in the wheelchair was astonished to find this out. \nHe assumed they had always been able to move around freely.\n  As we look around after 19 years, we see a lot of changes--a lot of \nchanges for the good. We see more young people taking advantage of \neducational opportunities, travel opportunities, families going out to \nrestaurants, traveling with family members who have a disability, \nschools. We see a lot of wonderful changes that have taken place \nbecause of the ADA. But, frankly, there is more work to do. We have not \nyet reached the promised land of those four goals of the ADA.\n  At the top of the list is the need to pass the Community Choice Act. \nThis bill has been around a long time. It was first introduced in the \n1990s. It was then called MCASSA; that stood for the Medicaid Community \nAttendance Support Services Act. No one could ever remember what it \nstood for so we changed the name to the Community Choice Act.\n  What is this all about? Right now, all over America there are people \nwith disabilities who qualify for Medicaid coverage. They are low \nincome and they have severe disabilities, so they qualify for Medicaid. \nIf they want to get their full coverage for support services, they have \nto go to a nursing home. If they go to a nursing home, under the law, \nMedicaid must pay for their support services. If they go to a nursing \nhome, it must pay.\n  But let's say a person with a disability doesn't want to go to a \nnursing home, they kind of like to live in their own home, they would \nlike to live with their friends, their family, in the community where \nthey know people. Do they get any support services? None. Medicaid does \nnot have to pay one single dime. If they go to a nursing home, they \nwill pay for it; if you want to stay in your own home and get those \nsupport services, Medicaid doesn't have to pay for it. They do not have \nan equal right to choose where they want to live.\n  Again, I will say this, some States have applied for waivers, and \nthey have extended these support services to people with disabilities \nin the community. But it varies from State to State. Some States don't \nhave the waivers, some States do. Even in some States that have \nwaivers--my State of Iowa has one--the waiting lists are long. It will \ntake you 3 or 4 years to ever get up in the queue to be eligible. So it \nhas been a patchwork of different things around the country.\n  On top of that, in 1999, 9 years after the passage of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, a case came to the Supreme Court. We call it the \nOlmstead case, Olmstead v. L.C. It came out of Georgia. The Supreme \nCourt made an important decision. It said that individuals with \ndisabilities have the right to choose to receive their long-term \nservices and support in the community rather than in an institutional \nsetting. The Supreme Court said they have a right to that.\n  So this year marks the 19th anniversary of the ADA, it marks the 10th \nanniversary of that decision of Olmstead by the Supreme Court. Yet \npeople with disabilities still have to go to a nursing home to get \ntheir long-term services and supports.\n  Listen to what the Supreme Court said in 1999:\n\n       Institutional placement of persons who can handle and \n     benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted \n     assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or \n     unworthy of participating in community life.\n\n  Changing these assumptions is what the ADA is all about. Again, as I \nsaid, some States have done it. But it is kind of a patchwork quilt \naround the country. The Community Choice Act is focused on increasing \nthe availability of attendant services and supports.\n  We know from studies done--the most important being done by Dr. Mitch \nLaPlante at the University of California at San Francisco--we know from \nstudies that for a person with a disability to go into a nursing home \nto receive those long-term services and support costs three times more \nthan what it does in the community. In other words, it would cost three \ntimes as much. So for every one person in a nursing home, you can \nsupport three people living in their own homes in the community.\n  You would say: Why aren't we doing that? Because there are about \n600,000 people in this country. These are individuals who are on the \nbottom rung. Let's be frank about it; they are on the bottom rung of \nthe economic ladder. They are poor because they are Medicaid eligible; \nthey have varying degrees of disabilities that, if they do not have \ntheir support services, they cannot get out, they cannot go to work. \nThey may be capable of working. After all, we have curb cuts, we have \nbuses that are accessible, we have subways that are accessible, we \nmandated that employers must make reasonable accommodations--wonderful. \nBut if you can't even get out of your house in the morning, what good \ndoes all that do you? So 600,000 people. CBO did a cost analysis and \nsaid this would cost about $50 billion over 10 years--$50 billion over \n10 years.\n  That is a lot of money. But, keep in mind, the health care bill we \nare talking about passing, recent estimates by\n\n[[Page S8123]]\n\nCBO put it at $1 trillion over 10 years--$1 trillion over 10 years. So \n$50 billion, that is about 5 percent. Is that too much to ask to help \npeople on the lowest rung of the economic ladder in our country, to \nhelp them take advantage of what is their civil right, what the Supreme \nCourt said they have a right to: a right to live independently, a right \nto live in their own home, to get those services?\n  As we all know, civil rights such as this are not self-executing. \nThey require some support from the Congress. Frankly, I must tell you I \ndisagree with the estimate of the CBO because here is what they do not \ntake into account. They don't take into account that many of these \npeople with disabilities who could live in the community if they had \nthese services and support can now get out the door in the morning, get \nto work, make a living, and pay taxes.\n  I think of my nephew Kelly. My nephew Kelly was injured in the \nmilitary. He was serving on an aircraft carrier and got sucked down a \njet engine. He lived, but he is a severe paraplegic for the rest of his \nlife.\n  My nephew Kelly came back out of the military. He had that terrible \naccident. He was 19 years old, a big strapping kid. He went to school, \nwent to college. Then he lived by himself--he still does. He lives in \nhis own home. He has a van he drives with a lift on it.\n  He gets up in the morning, goes to work, comes back. How is he able \nto do this? He has support services. He has someone who comes in his \nhouse in the morning, gets him ready; someone who comes in the house at \nnight, gets him ready for bed. He does his own shopping and cooking, \nbut he has to have a nurse there, someone to help him get going. If he \ndid not have that, he would not be able to go to work. But he has that. \nHe is able to go to work, and he is a taxpaying citizen of this \ncountry.\n  There are hundreds of thousands of Kellys around this country who, if \nthey had that support mechanism, could go to work. So when they say it \ncosts $50 billion, I say, well, you are not taking that into account. \nThey are not taking that into account. So as we enter the critical \nstage in hammering out comprehensive health care reform, we must not \nmiss this opportunity to extend the availability of attendant support \nand services which so many have been fighting for for so many years.\n  Every individual with a significant disability deserves the choice \nabout where to live and with whom to live and where to receive his or \nher essential services. That has a lot to do with employment, and as I \nlook back over 19 years of the ADA, there is one thing that is still \nlacking: that is employment of people with disabilities.\n  Recent surveys show 63 percent of people with disabilities are \nunemployed. They want to work. They have abilities, but they are \nunemployed. A lot of this is because there are no support services. \nMuch of this has to do with the fact that some employers are not \nproviding reasonable accommodations. Some of it has to do with the fact \nthat there is not an affirmative action program to hire people with \ndisabilities. Some 21 million people with disabilities are not working, \nare not employed. So we need to do a better job with providing these \npeople with disabilities the opportunity for economic self-sufficiency \nas we promised in the ADA.\n  On a closing note, on Friday of last week, President Obama announced \nthe President of the United States will sign the U.N. Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities, an international treaty that \nidentifies the rights of persons living with disabilities and obligates \ncountries to maintain those rights. The convention, after it will be \nsigned, I understand, this week by our Ambassador to the U.N., will go \nthrough a process and then it will be referred to the Senate for \nratification.\n  Well, we should take pride in the fact the United States has always \nbeen a leader in ensuring the rights of individuals with disabilities. \nWe have made great progress toward the goal of equal opportunity, full \nparticipation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.\n  By becoming a party to the convention, the United States will \ncontinue its leadership role. So on this 19th anniversary of the ADA, I \nthank our President, President Barack Obama. I thank him for the \nstatement he made last Friday that he was going to sign this week and \nfor maintaining the leadership role of the United States in ensuring \nthe rights of people with disabilities.\n  I only hope the convention will get through the process rapidly so we \ncan get it to the Senate, and I hope the Senate can ratify it as soon \nas possible.\n  Lastly, on a more poignant note, I want to pause on this anniversary \nto remember people who played such a vital role in passing the ADA. \nSome are no longer with us, such as Justin Dart, who was the person who \npulled it through. Justin Dart. We are fortunate that his wife Yoshiko \ncontinues to carry on this legacy day after day and week after week and \nyear after year.\n  We remember Ed Roberts, the father of the independent living \nmovement, whose work and vision continues to inspire powerfully. He is \nalso gone.\n  Others who are still with us: Pat Wright, my staff director; Bobby \nSilverstein, who worked so hard and pulled this through. Of course, the \none person, when the going got tough, when we did not know if we could \nget everything pulled together, who worked his magic to bring people on \nboth sides of the aisle together--and herein I speak of Senator Ted \nKennedy, the chairman of the committee, the HELP Committee, at that \ntime, and I was chairman of the Disability Policy Subcommittee. But \nthat was under the tutelage of Senator Kennedy. He was the chairman of \nthe HELP Committee at that time. It was because of his great work we \nwere able to pull people together to get the great compromise to pass \nthe ADA.\n  I would mention one other person I think might be somewhat \nresponsible who is no longer with us. That is my late brother Frank. I \nhave spoken of him many times as my inspiration for working on \ndisability issues.\n  Frank became deaf at a young age. He was taken from our home and sent \nacross the State to the Iowa School for the Deaf. At the time, many \npeople called it the State School for the Deaf and Dumb. That is how \nthey referred to people who could not hear, as deaf and dumb.\n  I remember my brother said to me: I may be deaf, but I am not dumb.\n  He also said to me one time: The only thing that deaf people cannot \ndo is hear. He fought, not only in school, but after school to be \nindependent and to make his own way in life, and he was able to do \nthat.\n  I saw how many times he was discriminated against, whether it was \ngetting a driver's license, so many things he was told he couldn't do \nbecause he was deaf. They were always trying to hold him back. But he \nwas always pushing, and he was able to carve out a life of independence \nand dignity for himself. Why did he have to fight so hard for all of \nthis? Why did he have to struggle so much just to get people to accept \nhim for what he was and who he was and not just to look at the fact \nthat he was a deaf man, but that he was a person of great capabilities.\n  Great ethics. Great work. Very hard. But why did he have to struggle? \nThen I started looking around and saw all of those people with \ndisabilities in America who just had to overcome almost insurmountable \nobstacles just to be a contributing member of our society, not to get \nwelfare. My brother was never on welfare in his entire life. He always \nworked hard. They just want to work and contribute and to be a part of \nour society. Why did it require extraordinary efforts to do things we \njust take for granted in our country?\n  So he was sort of my inspiration and continues to be today. So, yes, \nwe have had our share of frustrations. We have not reached the promised \nland. We have a 60-percent or more rate of unemployment, and people \nwith disabilities have to go to a nursing home to get support rather \nthan living in the community.\n  So we do have a ways to go. We have come a long ways, but we do have \na ways to go. So we can celebrate this great law, this great civil \nrights bill, the Americans with Disabilities Act. But now we also have \nto say we have to take these next steps.\n  On July 26, 1990, when he signed the ADA into law, President George \nBush spoke with great eloquence. I will never forget his final words \nbefore taking up his pen. He said: ``Let the shameful wall of exclusion \nfinally come tumbling down.''\n\n[[Page S8124]]\n\n  Well, today that wall is indeed falling. We have to continue the \nprogress. We have to go forward and not backward. We must enact the \nCommunity Choice Act so that people with disabilities can finally have \nnot only independence but they can have full participation and they can \nhave economic self-sufficiency.\n  Their goal, their home, not the nursing home, has been their cry for \nmany years. We ought to hear that, heed it, and make sure we do not \npass a health reform bill unless we have something in it to address \nthis one fundamental flaw in our society that wreaks havoc against \npeople with disabilities in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, before Senator Harkin leaves the floor, I \nwant to express that there is no one in this Chamber, there is no one \ndown the aisle in the House of Representatives, there is no one in this \ncity who has worked harder on issues advocating for those with \ndisabilities than Tom Harkin.\n  I heard him make that moving and beautiful tribute to his brother. \nThere is a building on the Galludet campus named after Senator Harkin's \nbrother.\n  Galludet is the university for the deaf in Washington, DC. I am \nfortunate to sit on the board of that university, recommended by \nSenator Harkin, for whom I will always be grateful, that institution \nthat has lifted up so many people, and his brother was a big part of \nthat. Senator Harkin is a big part of the success of that institution \nand advocating for the rights of the disabled.\n\n\n        United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, SED\n\n  I rise now to speak about the United States-China Strategic and \nEconomic Dialogue, the so-called SED, which began early today in \nWashington. Dozens of Chinese officials descended on our city over the \nweekend. They are now negotiating, discussing, and engaging in \nstrategic and economic dialogue with comparable officials in our \nFederal Government.\n  Secretary of State Clinton and Treasury Secretary Geithner are \nleading these talks for the Obama administration. The challenges they \nface are daunting. The issues that frame our relationship with China, \nwhich range from global security and fundamental human rights to trade \nand investment to energy and global warming policy, are critical to the \nfuture of our Nation and to the world.\n  I think we all agree a strong middle class makes a strong economy. We \nalso agree the middle class, to put it mildly, is not faring well in \nthis financial crisis. The official unemployment rate of the United \nStates is 9.5 percent. My State is 11.1 percent. It has climbed 2 \npercentage points in the past 5 months.\n  China is one enormous export platform, and the United States, its \nbiggest customer, has stopped buying. Morgan Stanley economists report \nthat exports account for 47 percent of the economics of China and other \nEast Asian nations, while in the United States consumption accounts for \n70 percent of our GDP. As revenues flow out of the United States and \ninto China, more than $200 billion every single year, China becomes our \nbiggest lender. This unbalanced economic relationship breeds risk. It \nis rooted in our Nation's passive trade relations with China.\n  My State of Ohio is one of the great manufacturing States in this \ncountry, as it has been for about a century. We make solar panels and \nwind turbines, we make paper and steel and aluminum and glass and cars \nand tires and polymers and more. Look around today. I am sure you will \nfind something you use that is made in Ohio. But let's look at a \ntypical Ohio manufacturer and compare that to a Chinese manufacturer.\n  The Ohio manufacturer abides by a minimum wage to ensure workers are \npaid for and not robbed of talents. An Ohio manufacturer abides by \nclean air and workplace and product safety standards, helping to keep \nhis or her workers healthy and productive and to keep customers safe. \nThe Chinese manufacturer has no minimum wage to maintain. The Chinese \nmanufacturer is allowed to pollute the environment, is allowed to force \nworkers to use dangerous and faulty machinery.\n  Food and product safety are not a must for the Chinese manufacturers; \nlax enforcement makes it look more like an option. The Ohio \nmanufacturer pays taxes, pays health benefits, pays Social Security.\n  The Ohio manufacturer typically allows family leave and gives WARN \nnotices when there is going to be a plant closing. The Chinese \nmanufacturer allows child labor. The Ohio manufacturer receives no \ngovernment subsidy. The Chinese manufacturer receives subsidies often \nfor the development of new technologies or for export subsidies.\n  The Chinese manufacturer benefits from China's manipulation of its \ncurrency, which gives, many economists think, a 40-percent cost \nadvantage--a 40-percent cost advantage.\n  In addition to all of the other cost advantages of product safety, \nworker safety, minimum wage, paying into Social Security, Medicare, all \nof that, the Ohio manufacturer is investing in clean energy. The Ohio \nmanufacturer is investing in new technologies and efficiencies to \ncreate more sustainable production practices. The Ohio manufacturers \nare part of the movement to make our country more energy efficient.\n  They will do their part to reduce carbon emissions but not at the \nexpense of jobs if China and other countries do not take comparable \naction. Yet when the Ohio manufacturer petitions for relief and says it \ncan compete with anyone, but only when it is a level playing field, or \nthat it can emit less carbon but the Chinese competitors should bear \nsimilar costs on similar timelines, what does the Chinese Government \nsay?\n  They call it protectionism.\n  Amazingly, that Chinese Government, when it labels behavior \nprotectionism, has allies in the United States, all kinds of allies \nright here in Washington, DC. It had allies certainly in the Bush White \nHouse. It has allies among newspaper publishers certainly in this city. \nIt has allies among Ivy League economists and among too many Members of \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate. So when China labels \nanything we do to protect our workers, our environment, our families, \nour security, the chorus of protectionism from our own Nation's media \nand from many Ivy League economists and many political leaders sounds \nalmost as loud as Chinese accusations of protectionism.\n  Earlier this year, Energy Secretary Chu noted that unless other \ncountries also bear comparable costs for carbon emissions, the United \nStates will be at a disadvantage. In other words, if we deal with our \ncarbon emissions by stronger environmental laws on American \nmanufacturing, and China doesn't, Secretary Chu understands that will \nencourage more industry to move from the United States, where \neverything produced contains an environmental cost, to China where many \nthings produced contain little environmental cost. The response to \nSecretary Chu from the Chinese official? He called it an excuse to \nimpose trade restrictions and practice protectionism. Chinese officials \nare quick to call the United States protectionist, despite all the \nprotections it affords its manufacturers. These labels, launched when \nCongress considers import safety legislation--remember the toys at \nHalloween and Christmas and Easter that came from China that had lead-\nbased paint on them at levels far in excess of what we consider safe, \nremember the drug ingredients put into prescription drugs that killed \nmany people in Toledo with the drug Heparin and all over the country, \nthose ingredients came from China--or the ``Buy American'' provisions \nare used by trading partners to influence our debates about public \npolicy. Of course, Chinese officials are all too often joined, whenever \nwe in this body insist on food safety, pharmaceutical safety, worker \nsafety, environmental protections, by American CEOs, Ivy League \neconomists, newspaper publishers, and too many people who sit in this \nChamber.\n  Meanwhile, the United States has the world's most open economy. That \nis why I believe today's strategic economic dialog, the SED, is so \nimportant. China's industrial policy is based on unfair trade \npractices. It involves direct subsidies, indirect subsidies such as \ncurrency manipulation, and copyright piracy and hidden subsidies such \nas lax standards and sweatshop labor. In total, it results in the loss \nof millions of American jobs.\n\n[[Page S8125]]\n\n  The Economic Policy Institute estimates that 2.3 million jobs were \nlost between 2001 and 2007 due to the trade deficit with China. Those \nwere during our good economic times. During that economic time, the \nfirst 7 years of the Bush administration, not only did we lose 2.3 \nmillion jobs--many of them because of Chinese trade policy--in addition \nto that, 40,000 manufacturing concerns in our country shut down. \nChina's policies are depressing wages and income levels worldwide, \nwhile its exploitation of environmental, health, and safety standards \nis killing Chinese workers and citizens and adding to our climate \nchange challenges. The health of our economy, the strength of our \nmiddle class, depend on how Congress and the Obama administration \nengage with China on these issues.\n  I am hopeful the Strategic and Economic Dialogue begins a new chapter \nbetween two great nations, China and the United States. But Congress \ncannot sit idly by as we debate climate change or trade or \nmanufacturing or any other policies that affect the middle class.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8125-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8125-S8126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TAX INCREASES ON HIGHER INCOME AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my alarm about the \npossibility that this Congress will raise tax rates on higher income \nAmericans in order to partially finance the cost of health care reform. \nEven though some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle may \nnot currently see the serious damage to our economy and our society \nthat such a proposal could create, I want to spend a few minutes \nexplaining why such a course of action would be a grave mistake.\n  We began hearing talk of raising taxes on the so-called wealthy last \nyear during the presidential campaign. Then-candidate Obama made a \nnumber of promises regarding taxes. Perhaps most prominent among these \nwere the following three pledges: He would cut taxes for small \nbusinesses and companies that create jobs in America; he would cut \ntaxes for middle-class families, and no family making less than \n$250,000 per year will see their taxes increase; and families making \nmore than $250,000 will pay either the same or lower tax rates than \nthey paid in the 1990s.\n  I have been around this town for a long time, and I have seen a lot \nof presidential candidates make lots of promises. It is easy to greet \nsuch pledges with a degree of skepticism. However, I have seldom, if \never, seen promises regarding tax cuts and tax increases made more \nprominently, more clearly, or more often than those made by the \nPresident when he was on the campaign trail last year.\n  And yet, it was only a matter of a few weeks before the promise to \nkeep tax rates below the 1990s level for higher income families was \nbroken. In his budget outline for fiscal year 2010, which was released \non February 26, 2009, the President included a proposal to partially \npay for health care reform. This proposal would lower the value of \nitemized deductions for families with incomes over $250,000.\n  When this proposal is combined with the President's promise to allow \nthe 2001 tax cuts to expire for families making over $250,000, we are \nlooking at effective tax rates well above those paid by higher income \nfamilies in the 1990s. Thus, the President broke his pledge within \nweeks of Inauguration Day.\n  While it is true that none of the health care reform proposals \nintroduced so far in Congress includes the limitation on itemized \ndeductions, this presidentially preferred offset proposal has been \ndiscussed in the Senate as a possible way to finance health care \nreform.\n  More importantly, the health care reform package that has been \nreported by two House committees and is working its way through a third \nincludes an offset that is even more blatantly in violation of the \nPresident's pledge. This is a surtax on the adjusted gross income of \nsingle taxpayers earning more than $280,000 and of families earning \nmore than $350,000.\n  This surtax starts at a rate of 1 percent at the lowest thresholds, \nbut it is set at 5.4 percent for income in excess of $1 million. This \nnew surtax has been projected by the Joint Committee on Taxation to \nraise $544 billion over 10 years. I know we are getting far too \naccustomed to seeing scores in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but \nlet me say that number again: $544 billion. That is over half a \ntrillion, with a T. For those who might be watching or listening at \nhome, that is 544 followed by nine zeroes.\n  Whether at the 1 percent level, at the 5.4 percent level, or \nsomewhere in between, this surtax also starkly violates the President's \npledge to not increase tax rates above their 1990s levels. In fact, \nwhen combined with the phase-out of itemized deductions, which the \nPresident has also proposed bringing back from the grave, this surtax \ncould increase the top marginal income tax rate to more than 46 \npercent. When State taxes are added, the top rate in many States would \nlikely exceed 50 percent.\n  Some may say that this surtax is not the President's idea, and that \nit therefore should not be blamed on him. Well, it may have not been \nhis idea, but I have not seen the White House repudiate it in any way. \nAll indications from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue are that the President \nsupports this huge new tax increase.\n  Do I bring this matter to the attention of my colleagues today merely \nbecause I am irritated to see the President violating one of his \ncampaign promises? No. As I mentioned earlier, I have seen a lot of \ncampaign promises made and a lot of campaign promises broken.\n  Perhaps it is because I am worried about the estimated 12,900 Utah \ntax filers or the just over 2 million Americans who would be affected \nby this surtax. After all, some are saying, this is just over 1 percent \nof taxpayers, and after all, they are rich, and they can afford it, \nright?\n  Well, yes, I am concerned about them. A tax on adjusted gross income \nis unfair, and it is discriminatory. If we wish to raise tax rates we \nshould do it in a straightforward and transparent way. A tax based on \ngross income provides for few or no deductions, and it jolts our long-\nestablished differential between ordinary income and income from \ncapital. It is a raw revenue grab justified on the socialistic idea \nthat these people earn more than the rest of us so they should be \nforced to share it with those less fortunate than they are.\n  But this also is not my primary reason for bringing up this matter \ntoday.\n  I bring this to the attention of the Senate for two reasons. First, \nhigh tax rates on upper-income earners, particularly when combined with \nthe ever-increasing progressiveness of our tax system, are destructive \nto the economy and to our society.\n  Second, a good share of these higher income taxes will be paid by \nsmall businesses which will harm job creation. Today I want to talk \nabout the problems of too much tax progressivity. In a subsequent floor \nspeech, I will address the issue of how this tax will hurt small \nbusinesses and job creation.\n  We often hear from those on the left that our tax system is not \nprogressive enough. Essentially, proponents of a more progressive tax \nsystem believe that the Internal Revenue Code taxes lower income \ntaxpayers too much and higher income taxpayers too lightly. In essence, \nthey believe the so-called wealthy among us are not paying their fair \nshare of taxes.\n  However, the facts simply do not support this viewpoint. According to \ndata released by the IRS for 2006, which is the latest year available, \nthe highest-earning one percent of income earners received 22 percent \nof all the income in America. This sounds like a great deal of income \nconcentrated into the hands of a few, and it is.\n  One would think and hope that an equitable tax system would require \nthis top one percent of income earners, who are earning 22 percent of \nall income, to pay at least 22 percent of all the income taxes. If they \npaid exactly this amount, ours would be considered a proportional tax \nsystem. If they paid less, we would call it a regressive tax system. If \nthe top earners paid more than the proportion that they earned, the tax \nsystem would be considered progressive.\n  I do not know anyone who truly believes that a completely regressive \ntax system is fair. No one should be asked\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\nto bear a higher portion of the tax burden than what he or she receives \nin income. However, I know that certain taxes are regressive, even if \nour overall system is not.\n  In contrast, many Americans think the only fair tax system is a \nprogressive one. The more you make, the more you ought to pay. I can \nunderstand this and I do not necessarily disagree with it, within \nreason.\n  On the other hand, I believe that a strong case can be made that a \nproportional tax system is the fairest tax system. Many of my fellow \nUtahns agree with this idea. I have received thousands of letters over \nthe years asking why we should not have a flat tax that requires \ncitizens to pay a fixed proportion of their income in taxes. \nConceptually, I think they are correct.\n  Even though many Americans like a progressive tax system, I think \nthey might be shocked to see just how progressive ours has become. I \nmentioned before that the top one percent of income earners received 22 \npercent of all income in 2006. However, this group paid 40 percent of \nall income taxes paid in America. Almost twice the proportion paid as \nearned. This is not just progressivity. This is progressivity on \nsteroids. And it is harmful and unfair.\n  And, we are not just looking at the top one percent to see this \nproblem. The top 10 percent of income earners received 47 percent of \nall income, but they paid 71 percent of all tax. Again, this is way \nbeyond what I believe fair-minded people would call a reasonable amount \nof progressivity.\n  However, this is not the worst of it. In fact, this is only half of \nwhat I will call the equitable taxation equation. This is because so \nfar, we have only talked about the half of the equation that raises \nmoney from taxpayers. What about the other half of the equation, where \nthe money is spent?\n  In a 2007 study, economists at the Tax Foundation looked at both the \ntax side of the equation and the spending side. Their findings are very \ninteresting. Using total Federal taxes rather than just income taxes, \nthe study found that the top 20 percent of income earning households \npaid on average $57,512 in Federal taxes.\n  However, the average Federal Government spending received by these \nhouseholds was just $18,573.\n  The lowest 20 percent of income-earning households, on the other \nhand, paid an average of just $1,684 in Federal taxes, but received an \na amazing $24,860 average per household in Federal Government spending.\n  Another way of saying this is that the top earning 20 percent of \nhouseholds received 32 cents in Federal Government spending for every \ndollar in Federal taxes paid, while the lowest earning 20 percent of \nhouseholds received $14.76 in Federal Government spending for every \ndollar they paid in Federal taxes.\n  Plain an simple, this means the top-earning fifth of Americans get \nback only a third of what they pay in taxes while the bottom-earning \nfifth are receiving a bounty of nearly 15 times what they pay. This is \nredistributionism gone wild.\n  And this study takes into account all Federal taxes, not just income \ntaxes. If the study included only the Federal income tax, the amounts \nwould be skewed even farther because the income tax is much more \nprogressive than are other Federal taxes.\n  Moreover, this study used tax-and-spending numbers from 2004. Our tax \nsystem has become more progressive since then. It is very apparent to \nme that our tax system is very progressive already. And when it is \nviewed in this larger context, along with the Federal spending, it is \nnothing short of ultra progressive.\n  So the question I have for my friends and colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle is this: just how progressive is progressive enough? \nI realize that some will not be satisfied until we reach a total \nredistribution where there is no more rich or poor among us. And while \nthat idea might sound really fine, it would create total havoc to our \ngovernment and our society, and I think we all know it.\n  How far can we take this idea of progressivity before the system \ncollapses of its own weight? Our tax system, and indeed our entire \nsystem of government, depends on the voluntary cooperation of its \ncitizens. An underlying if unstated foundation of the American \ngovernment is the idea that the great majority of us will work hard, \ntake care of our families, willingly if grudgingly pay our taxes, \ncooperate with the law, and do our best to make it all work.\n  What happens to our society if those who are in the top 25 percent, \nwho are now paying 86 percent of the general cost of government, see \nthat their burden is about to grow ever bigger, and that they soon may \nbe part of only 10 or 15 percent who are carrying all the rest of us?\n  Where does incentive go as we approach this situation? Is there a \ntipping point where hard-working and successful Americans will say: \nEnough is enough. I am no longer willing to be a chump and carry the \nload for everyone else. Why don't I also stop pulling and get in the \nwagon and get the free ride?\n  We have already seen a strong movement toward removing more and more \nlower-earning Americans from the income tax rolls. The Making Work Pay \ncredit and other refundable tax credits give cash back where no taxes \nhave been paid. They serve as a negative income tax.\n  According to the Tax Policy Center, for calendar year 2009, the \nnumber of Americans who are not subject to the Federal income tax \nexceeds 43 percent. This number will likely grow significantly as a \nresult of the enactment of the Making Work Pay credit earlier this \nyear. If the President and his followers in the Congress have their \nway, there will be millions more who will be allowed to stop pulling \nand get on the wagon to be carried by the few who work.\n  This means that the number of American households that contribute \nnothing to our general cost of government, to our defense, and to the \nthousands of programs that are funded by the income tax is approaching \n50 percent. Asking fewer and fewer to carry more and more of the load \nis dangerous in a free society. We are approaching that point where the \nmajority can simply vote for higher taxes to fund higher spending with \nno personal cost to them. When that happens, our representative \nRepublic is in grave danger.\n  There are lots of good economic reasons why we have to be careful \nabout raising taxes too high on those who are bearing the burden of the \ncost of government. I will talk about those at another time. The one I \nam talking about today is a simple one, but it is the scariest to me.\n  The simple fact is that there is a limit on how much we can ask \nsuccessful people to contribute to the cost of general government, just \nas there is a limit to how few people will be willing to pull a wagon \nthat gets heavier each time we let someone leave the ropes and climb on \nboard for the free ride.\n  Ideally, we should all have to carry our own weight. While this may \nnot be possible or practical, we surely cannot expect a willing but \ndiminishing minority to continue to pull a heavier and heavier wagon up \na steeper and steeper hill without a breakdown. I urge my colleagues to \nthink carefully before going along with an idea that loads more of a \ntax burden on the few who seem to be able to afford it. If we go too \nfar down this path, we are all going to end up in a ditch.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen).

Madam President, over the last several months I had \nthe exceptional honor of serving as a temporary member of our HELP \nCommittee--Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--where I joined a \ntruly remarkable group of Senators as we wrote and fought through and \nrefined and ultimately passed our part of legislation that will begin \nto fundamentally\n\n[[Page S8127]]\n\ntransform our broken health care system. During that period, Senator \nKennedy could not be with us, but we certainly felt his spirit and his \npresence and the tradition of service to this issue that he has \nembodied through that time. I think he would be proud of the Affordable \nHealth Choices Act we brought out. I certainly am.\n  This bill, in combination with the work now being done in the Finance \nCommittee, will guarantee quality, affordable health coverage for all \nAmericans. It will protect Americans against back-breaking medical \ncosts. It will expand access to vital preventive services. It will \nfight fraud and abuse in public and private health insurance plans. It \nwill help retirees with the high cost of coverage. It will improve the \nquality of care through fundamental delivery system reforms. It will \nbuild a 21st century health care workforce. It will provide a new \nvoluntary insurance plan, a different choice for long-term care. Most \nimportantly, it will bend--maybe even break--the cost curve. In short, \nwe stand at the dawn of the most significant improvement of our health \ncare system that our country has ever seen. My only regret is how \nremarkably, staggeringly, embarrassingly late we are to this task. We \noften talk about the health care reform efforts of 1993 and 1994 and \nhow startling it is that it has taken us 15 years to return to such a \nparamount issue for our people. But as we all know, the debate over \nreforming health care goes back decades and decades.\n  Let's take a quick trip back in time. From a 1992 New York Times \narticle: ``Health Care Costs Dampen Hiring.'' This at a time when our \nnational health care costs were $850 billion a year. Now they are $2.3 \ntrillion a year; then, $850 billion a year.\n\n       This could be the first recovery crippled by medical costs. \n     Employee benefits--health insurance in particular--have \n     become so explosive that manufacturers are increasingly \n     coping with weak demand by cutting payrolls, not overtime . . \n     . Health care costs, increasing at more than twice the rate \n     of wages, have made benefits so expensive it would be \n     surprising if companies were not responding. As they find \n     other ways to avoid paying benefits--the growing use of \n     contract workers, for example--they often say instead that \n     they are merely giving employees some flexibility.\n\n  That was 1992. We could have that same discussion today, only we \nwould have to multiply the number by three.\n  Here we are back in 1988 when the New York Times reported: ``Soaring \nHealth Care Costs.'' At this time, instead of $2.3 trillion a year in \nhealth care costs, we were spending $500 billion.\n  The article says:\n\n       Health care amounts to 11.1 percent of gross national \n     product in the United States,--\n\n  Now, of course, we are over 18 percent.\n\n     --a bigger share than in any other advanced country.\n\n  That didn't change.\n\n       In 1987, Americans spent $500 billion on health care, 9.8 \n     percent more than the year before.\n\n  Those trends have continued.\n\n       This year, spending on health care is expected to rise by \n     8.2 percent, more than double the inflation rate. And despite \n     many efforts to slow health care spending, it is expected to \n     grow by another 9.1 percent in 1989. . . .The average jump in \n     premiums could hit 30 percent in 1989. But at the same time, \n     we're getting less for it.\n\n  Further back to 1979, 30 years ago when our annual expenditure was \nless than one-tenth of today. Today, $2.3 trillion; then, $200 billion. \nThe article says:\n\n       HEW Secretary Patricia Roberts Harris said the quality of \n     American health care does not justify its price tag of more \n     than $200 billion a year. Harris said health costs represent \n     nearly 10 percent of the gross national product, the total \n     value of goods and services produced in this country each \n     year. The federal share of health costs will exceed $50 \n     billion next year, including $30 billion for Medicare and $12 \n     billion for Medicaid, and will claim 12 percent of the \n     Federal budget.\n\n  But for the passage of 30 years and for all of those numbers getting \nbigger, you could say the same today.\n  Finally, last, but not least, from a 1955 New York Times article. \nThis article predates me. I was born in October of that year. Here is \nwhat it says:\n\n       As it does each year without fail, the government declared \n     again this week that it is time to do something about the \n     rising cost of medical care.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       As it does each year without fail, the government declared \n     again this week that it is time to do something about the \n     rising cost of medical care. Last year, the Nation's medical \n     bill ran over $10 billion.\n\n  It is now 25 times as much, and you could say the same thing.\n\n       It was an increase of $3 billion since 1948. Of this sum, \n     only about 25 percent was covered by some form of prepaid \n     health insurance. In human terms, this meant that the \n     American had to scrap his budget, dig into savings or go into \n     debt, to pay some $7.5 billion for doctors, hospitals, \n     dentists, nurses, and the myriad physical accessories of \n     medical care.\n\n  These words, from February of 1955, when one-fifth of the Members of \nthis body were not yet born, could not be truer today.\n\n       In human terms, the American had to scrap his budget, dig \n     into savings or go into debt to pay for doctors, hospitals, \n     dentists, nurses, and the myriad physical accessories of \n     medical care.\n\n  How little we have changed.\n  Fifty-four years later, astoundingly, despite all of this time and \nall of this trouble and all of this tragedy, this is still a game to \nsome people, a political game. Fifty-four years later, health reform \nstill faces opponents who will do whatever they can to delay or derail \nthe reform process, turning what is our most desperate domestic \npolitical crisis into political theater.\n  Last Friday, one of our colleagues on the Republican side told a \ngroup of conservative activists:\n\n       If we're able to stop Obama on this, it will be his \n     Waterloo. It will break him.\n\n  Think about that for a minute. One hundred thousand Americans die \nevery year because of avoidable medical errors, and the response from \nthe other side is ``let's find a way to break the President of the \nUnited States.'' More families now go into bankruptcy because of health \ncare costs than for any other reason; families across this country who \nlose everything. And the response: ``Let's find a way to break the \nPresident of the United States.'' We watched Detroit crumbling under \nthe weight of its health care costs, and General Motors, one of our \nfabled companies, fail. And what is the response? ``Let's not fix it. \nLet's find a way to break the President of the United States over \nthis.''\n  We have a health care costs tsunami bearing down on us, one that \ntruly could break the fiscal back of this country, but do they want to \ndeal with it? No. They want to play politics to break the President of \nthe United States. We have an insurance industry that turns on you when \nyou have the nerve to get sick, denying you care and denying you \ncoverage. They call it medical loss when they have to pay for you. \nAcross this country people suffer. When they are sick, when they are \ndown, when they are hurt, when they are at their weakest, their own \ninsurers turn on them and try to interfere with their health care and \ntry to deny them payment and coverage. What is the response from the \nother side? ``Let's try to find a way to break President Obama.''\n  This is not President Obama's Waterloo. This is not one man's battle. \nThis is a war in which millions and millions of Americans are \ncasualties every day: the child whose insurance policy carves out from \nher coverage the asthma care she desperately needs; the doctor whose \noffice spends more time fighting the insurer over claims and \nauthorizations than delivering health care; the small business owner \nwhose employees are like family for her and who can no longer afford to \ncover their health care; the elderly retiree who falls into the \nMedicare prescription drug doughnut hole; the diabetic who cannot \nobtain a policy at all from anyone because he or she has a preexisting \ncondition.\n\n  This should not be a political battle of right versus left. It is \ntruly a battle of right versus wrong. I have come to the floor \ncountless times now to share Rhode Islanders' personal and family \ntragedies, their sorrows, and their frustrations with our present \nhealth care system. My constituents share their stories with me at \ncommunity dinners across Rhode Island, in our senior centers, at \ncoffees, and as I walk the main streets of towns across our State.\n  Earlier this year, I launched a health care storyboard on my Web site \nwhere Rhode Islanders can share their experiences and ideas for health \ncare reform. In just a few short months, literally hundreds of Rhode \nIslanders have written to me to share their ideas and experiences. \nThose stories are fraught with\n\n[[Page S8128]]\n\nanguish, pain, frustration and, too often, tragedy. They break your \nheart. They break your heart to read. Rhode Island is a small State. If \nwe have it happening hundreds and hundreds of times, in the Presiding \nOfficer's State of New Hampshire and across this country, it has to be \nhappening thousands of times, tens of thousands of times, hundreds of \nthousands of times every day.\n  With all that suffering going on, with all the risks to our country \nof the perils of the costs coming at us from our health care system, if \nthe other side can't care about the merits and substance of health care \nreform--if you cannot care about the merits and substance of health \ncare reform, if, for you, it is just political theater, if all it is, \nis a way to ``break'' the President of the United States of America, in \na time of domestic and international crisis, if your goal is to break \nthe President rather than do something about health care, if that is \nhow little you care about health care, then you can't care about the \nmerits or substance of anything else because there is nothing \ndomestically that is as important to our country as health care reform. \nIf you cannot care about that and deal with us on the merits on that, \nthen you can't care about anything.\n  What is really frustrating about this is for these Rhode Islanders, \ntormented by our health care system, and for their millions of fellow \nAmericans across the country, who have those same experiences, there is \na better way. We are working toward it. We can find it, and we can make \nit happen.\n  We have to do better, we can do better, and we will do better with \nthis legislation than 47 million uninsured and millions more teetering \non the brink, one paycheck away from losing their insurance, one \nillness away from losing their insurance. We can and we have to and we \nwill do better under this legislation than 100,000 Americans dying \nevery year because of avoidable medical errors and because, among other \nreasons, we have the worst health care infrastructure, information \ninfrastructure, in health care than in any other American industry \nexcept the mining industry. We can make this better. We can do better \nand we have to do better and we will do better than health care \noutcomes for Americans that are at the bottom of all of our \nindustrialized competitors--at the bottom; with all of our capabilities \nas Americans, our ingenuity and our entrepreneurship, we are at the \nbottom of developed nations in health care outcomes for our people, and \nwe pay twice as much as they do to get there.\n  America can do better than this. Beginning with the work of the HELP \nCommittee, we are on our way. Let's not squander the opportunity and \nthe responsibility this day presents. Let's not be distracted by calls \nfor delay or appeals to the pettiest political instincts this Chamber \ncould express.\n  As I see it, we are about 55 years late already. We don't need \nfurther delay; we need to get this done. Year after year, Americans \nhave had the same complaints about their health care system. We have it \nwithin our power, under the leadership of this President, to make it \nhappen, and we will.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8128-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ARTS IN CRISIS PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today I stand to recognize the outstanding \nefforts of the Kennedy Center in addressing the crisis facing our art \norganizations across this country. Under the leadership of their \ntalented president, Michael Kaiser, the Kennedy Center has established \na unique outreach program that will help cultural organizations \nthroughout Nevada and our Nation weather the economic downturn.\n  Every Member of this body knows of the economic hardship facing \nAmerican families and businesses. The art community is not immune. In \nNevada, the Las Vegas Art Museum recently closed its doors due to \nfinancial troubles when donations dried up. The museum had been \noperating since 1974 and was a staple for art enthusiasts in the \nregion. Unless help is provided to our cultural organizations, I am \nafraid this scene will continue to be rehashed throughout the country.\n  Considered the ``turnaround specialist'' in his industry, Mr. Kaiser \nknows a thing or two about struggling arts organizations. When the \nLouisiana Philharmonic Orchestra was struggling after Hurricane \nKatrina, Mr. Kaiser helped keep their organization performing. When the \nDance Theater of Harlem was struggling, Mr. Kaiser helped reopen its \nschool. When the New York City Opera needed restructuring, Mr. Kaiser's \nrecommendations helped the Opera thrive. These are just a few examples \nof high-profile success in Mr. Kaiser's career as an arts \nadministrator.\n  Now, Mr. Kaiser wants to use his talents to help struggling arts \norganizations across the country. The ``Arts in Crisis'' program offers \nfree consultation from the Kennedy Center's experts about budgeting, \nfundraising, marketing, and other aspects vital to a struggling \norganization. Whether by phone, email, or in-person visits, the Kennedy \nCenter's talented staff freely gives of their time and talents to help \npreserve America's cultural establishments. I am confident that this \nunique program will enable struggling arts organizations to emerge from \nthe economic downturn stronger than ever.\n  I urge every arts institution that is struggling during this \ndifficult time to take advantage of Mr. Kaiser and this exceptional \nteam of experts. I know that the arts in Nevada will benefit from the \nKennedy Center's sound advice and I look forward to Mr. Kaiser's visit \nto my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8128-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8128-S8129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE POLLS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam. President, a spate of new polls reveal that, while \nAmericans want health care reform, just as all of us in Congress do, \nmost of them oppose the plan put forward by President Obama, disapprove \nof his handling of health care, and have serious concerns about the \ncost of his plan and how it would affect the quality of their own \nhealth care.\n  For example, a Rasmussen poll released July 22 shows a full 53 \npercent of voters oppose the health care legislation ``working its way \nthrough Congress.''\n  A July 17 Zogby poll backs up these findings, revealing that a full \n50 percent of Americans disapprove of the health care bill introduced \nin the House of Representatives and endorsed by President Obama.\n  A July 20, USA Today/Gallup poll shows that 50 percent of Americans \ndisapprove of the President's overall handling of this issue.\n  These findings dovetail with polling that indicates Americans are \nvery wary of the projected costs of the President's health care plan.\n  Zogby's July 17 poll shows that 59 percent of Americans say the \nPresident's proposals, including health care, call for too much \ngovernment spending.\n  And a whopping 78 percent of U.S. voters believe it is at least \nsomewhat likely that taxes will be raised on the middle class to cover \nthe cost of health care reform, a July 16 Rasmussen poll tells us.\n  Nearly half of respondents--44 percent believe ``government-managed \ncoverage'' will increase--not decrease--the price of health care, \naccording to a July 21 Public Strategies Inc/Politico poll. Only 27 \npercent think a government-managed health care system would lower \ncosts, while 29 percent said prices would remain the same.\n  Americans' concerns about how the President's plan would affect \nhealth care access and quality are reflected in this same Public \nStrategies/Politico survey.\n  Asked by pollsters ``what effect a government-managed health care \ncoverage option would have on access to health services, 40 percent \nsaid it would make the situation worse, 38 percent said it would make \nit better, and 22 percent said it would remain the same.''\n  Asked what effect the President's plan would have on the quality of \nhealth care, ``42 percent said it would make health care worse, 33 \npercent said it would make it better, and 25 percent said it would not \nhave an effect.''\n  We, in Congress, have heard Americans' concerns about the President's \nproposed health care reform for weeks now--and these concerns were not \nallayed at all when the Director of the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office told us that these reforms would actually increase, \nrather than decrease, costs, and drive our Nation more deeply into \ndebt.\n  That statement, along with congressional Democrats' plan to raise \ntaxes\n\n[[Page S8129]]\n\non small businesses--creators of two-thirds of new jobs in America--as \nwell as individuals, should put to rest any claims that we need this \nWashington-run health care system to help the economy. Moreover, except \nfor tax increases, many of the proposals in the President's bill \nwouldn't take effect for at least another 4 years, by which time the \nrecession will hopefully be over.\n  In a recent radio address, President Obama criticized those ``who \nmake the same old arguments'' in opposition to his health care plan and \npainted those who object to it as obstructionists.\n  I would like to know why the President equates having legitimate, \nhonest objections to a government-run regulatory health care system \nwith being an obstructionist?\n  No one in Washington wants to block health care reform. But many of \nus want to take the time to achieve the right kind of reform--the kind \nAmericans are looking for.\n  Republicans want an approach that will bring costs down, make sure \nhealth care is accessible to all, and fix parts that aren't currently \nworking. We have put forward many sensible ideas on how we can get \nthere, without jeopardizing the care many happily insured Americans \nhave.\n  To reiterate some of those ideas: We want to root out Medicare and \nMedicaid fraud, reform medical liability laws to discourage ``jackpot \njustice,'' allow small businesses to band together and purchase health \ninsurance as large corporations can, allow insurance companies to sell \ntheir policies across State lines--just as car-insurance companies \ncan--and strengthen wellness and prevention programs that encourage \nhealthy living. We believe we should apply specially tailored solutions \nto specific problems, rather than scrap the whole current system and \nimpose a one-size-fits-all Washington-run health care system.\n  If the President's plan is implemented, Americans could be left with \na health care system that few people would recognize, or even want. And \nthey would be stuck with it, permanently.\n  I urge President Obama and congressional Democrats to take a harder \nlook at Republican ideas, which the Republican leader, many of my \ncolleagues, and I have spoken of repeatedly.\n  These reforms would put patients first, lower costs, make health care \nmore accessible to the uninsured, and most wouldn't cost taxpayers a \ndime. I believe that is an approach Americans would be sure to support.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal \narticle ``Health Reform's Hidden Victims'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 24, 2009]\n\n                     Health Reform's Hidden Victims\n\n                             (By John Fund)\n\n       President Barack Obama's health-care sales pitch depends on \n     his ability to obfuscate who is likely to get hurt by reform. \n     At Wednesday's news conference, for example, he was asked \n     ``specifically what kind of pain and sacrifice'' he would ask \n     of patients in order to achieve the cost savings he promises.\n       He insisted he ``won't reduce Medicare benefits'' but \n     instead would ``make delivery more efficient.'' The most Mr. \n     Obama would concede is that some people will have to ``give \n     up paying for things that don't make you healthier.'' That is \n     simply not credible.\n       While Democrats on Capitol Hill dispute claims that \n     individuals will lose their existing coverage under their \n     reform plans, on other issues many Democrats privately \n     acknowledge some people will indeed get whacked to pay for \n     the new world of government-dominated health care.\n       Democrats have been brilliant in keeping knowledge about \n     the pain and sacrifice of health reform from the very people \n     who would bear the brunt of them. They've done so by \n     convincing health-care industry groups not to run the kind of \n     ``Harry and Louise''-style ads that helped sink HillaryCare \n     in 1993.\n       Sen. Tom Coburn (R., Okla.) says the pressure not to run \n     ads has been ``intense, bordering on extortion.'' ``Groups \n     were told if they did they'd give up their seat at the \n     table,'' says former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. ``What they \n     weren't told is that they'd be at the table as lunch.''\n       Here are some of the groups on the menu if anything like \n     the existing Senate or House health plans become law:\n       Young people. If the government mandates that everyone must \n     have health insurance, healthy young people will have to buy \n     policies that don't reflect the low risk they have of getting \n     sick. The House and Senate bills do let insurers set premiums \n     based on age, but only up to a 2-to-1 ratio, versus a real-\n     world ratio of 5 to 1. This means lower prices for older (and \n     wealthier) folks, but high prices for the young. ``They'll \n     have sticker shock,'' says Rep. Paul Ryan, ranking Republican \n     on the Budget Committee.\n       Small Businesses. Employers who don't provide coverage will \n     have to pay a tax up to 8% of their payroll. Yet those who do \n     provide coverage also have to pay the tax--if the law says \n     their coverage is not ``adequate.'' Amazingly, even if a \n     small business provides adequate insurance but its employees \n     choose coverage in another plan offered through the \n     government, the employer still must pay.\n       Health Savings Account (HSA) holders. Eight million \n     Americans, according to the Treasury Department, are covered \n     by plans with low-cost premiums and high deductibles that are \n     designed for large, unexpected medical costs. Money is also \n     set aside in a savings account to cover the deductibles, and \n     whatever isn't spent in one year can build up tax-free. \n     Nearly a third of new HSA users, according to Treasury \n     figures, previously had no insurance or bought coverage on \n     their own.\n       These policies will be severely limited. The Senate plan \n     says a policy deemed ``acceptable'' must have insurance \n     (rather than the individual) pay out it least 76% of the \n     benefits. The House plan is pegged at 70%. That's not the way \n     these plans are set up to work. Roy Ramthun, who implemented \n     the HSA regulations at the Treasury Department in 2003, says \n     the regulations are crippling. ``Companies tell me they could \n     be forced to take products off the market,'' he said in an \n     interview.\n       Medicare Advantage users. Mr. Obama and Congressional \n     Democrats want to cut back this program--care provided by \n     private companies and subsidized by the government. Medicare \n     Advantage grew by 15% last year; 10.5 million seniors, or 22% \n     of all Medicare patients, are now enrolled.\n       The program is especially popular with those in badly \n     served urban areas and with those who can't afford the \n     premiums for Medicare supplemental (MediGap) policies. A \n     total of 54% of Hispanics on Medicare have chosen Medicare \n     Advantage, as have 40% of African-Americans, according to the \n     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the Department \n     of Health and Human Services.\n       These plans tend to provide better coordinated and \n     preventive care, and richer prescription drug coverage. But \n     Democrats dislike Medicare Advantage's private-sector nature, \n     and they have some legitimate beefs with its unevenly \n     generous reimbursement rates. This week Mr. Obama told the \n     Washington Post that the program was ``a prime example'' of \n     his efforts to cut Medicare spending, because he claims \n     people ``aren't getting good value'' from it.\n       That's not what others say. In January, Oregon's Democratic \n     Gov. Ted Kulongoski wrote the Obama administration expressing \n     his concern about its efforts ``to scale back Medicare \n     Advantage'' because the plans ``play an important role in \n     providing affordable health coverage.'' He noted that 39% of \n     Oregon's Medicare patients had chosen Medicare Advantage, and \n     that in ``some of our Medicare Advantage plans . . . with \n     proper chronic disease management for such conditions as \n     heart disease, asthma and diabetes, hospitalization admission \n     rates have declined.''\n       The $156 billion in Medicare Advantage cuts over the next \n     decade proposed by Mr. Obama will force many seniors to go \n     back to traditional Medicare at greater expense. A new study \n     for the Florida Association of Health Plans found that \n     because Medicare Advantage plans have richer benefits and \n     lower deductibles and copayments than traditional Medicare, \n     seniors in that state would face dramatically higher payments \n     if forced to give up their Medicare Advantage plans. Cost \n     increases would range from $2,214 a year in Jacksonville to \n     $3,714 a year in Miami.\n       There are reasons that Blue Dog Democrats in Congress are \n     leery of their party's health-care reform plans. Many are in \n     districts or states carried by John McCain, and they worry \n     about the political fallout when these groups realize they \n     will be paying for health-care reform.\n       They also know that every government entitlement winds up \n     becoming a money pit. In 1965, Sen. Allen Ellender (D., La.) \n     dismissed promises that Medicare would be a modest program to \n     save seniors from bankruptcy. ``Let us not be so naive as to \n     believe that the Medicare program will not be increased from \n     year to year to the point that the government will have to \n     impose more taxes on the little man or else take the \n     necessary money out of the Treasury,'' he told colleagues.\n       Ellender was right, and his warning is even more relevant \n     in our era of skyrocketing deficits and Medicare costs. The \n     only way the House and Senate health plans can pass is if the \n     costs they impose on vulnerable parts of the population \n     continue to be hidden.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8129-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8129-S8130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING ITEMS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Madam President, today I wish to congratulate \nand honor the crew of STS-125, who conducted NASA's fifth and final \nmission to the Hubble Space Telescope earlier this year. The crew--\nCommander Scott D. Altman, Pilot Gregory C. Johnson and mission \nspecialists John M. Grunsfeld, Michael J. Massimino, Andrew J. Feustel, \nMichael T. Good and Megan McArthur--brilliantly executed a mission that \nincluded an unprecedented five spacewalks in 5 consecutive days to \ninstall two new instruments, repair two others and add necessary \nupgrades to extend the life of the Hubble. Most importantly, they \nreturned safely to Earth.\n  I would like to specifically acknowledge Dr. Grunsfeld, whom I have \nhad the pleasure of knowing for many years. Prior to the mission, the \nNew York Times referred to Dr. Grunsfeld as the ``keeper of the \nHubble'' because of his long commitment to the program, including three \nservicing missions. I cannot imagine a better caretaker. Without him, \nthe Hubble would not be the unparalleled success it is today. I am also \nthrilled that Dr. Grunsfeld will be joining the faculty of the \nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder after an extraordinary career at \nNASA.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting with the crew last week. We talked \nabout the marathon spacewalks needed to install upgrades to Hubble that \noften required on-the-spot improvisation by the astronauts. It is a \ntestament to the crew's professionalism, teamwork and resourcefulness \nthat the spacewalks were so successful given such challenging \nconditions. We also discussed what each astronaut will be doing next--\nmost will be returning to the astronaut corps awaiting their next \nmission-- and how the microgravity of space adds an inch or more to \nyour height. I appreciate the time they gave me and am always honored \nto visit with these extraordinary Americans.\n  It isn't widely known, but the State of Colorado and NASA have deep \nconnections. The University of Colorado receives more research funding \nfrom NASA than any other university. Colorado enjoys the second largest \naerospace economy in the country, behind only California, including \nsignificant endeavors in both civilian and military aerospace. After \nthis final servicing mission, which added the cosmic origins \nspectrograph and widefield camera 3 to the Hubble, every scientific \ninstrument on the Hubble Space Telescope has been made by Boulder, \nColorado-based Ball Aerospace. Ball also built the corrective optics to \nfix the telescope's flawed vision upon installation in 1993. Ball \nAerospace played an essential part in the Hubble story, and I am \nextremely proud of the contributions it has made to Hubble's success.\n  We should not forget that there was a time when it appeared this \nmission would never occur. Following the Space Shuttle Columbia \ntragedy, NASA initially decided to cancel all further missions to \nHubble, arguing that it was too risky. At the time, I was a member of \nthe House of Representatives Science Committee's Space and Aeronautics \nSubcommittee, and I strongly urged NASA to reconsider its decision. I \nbelieved that we should not abandon the world's greatest scientific \ninstrument when servicing missions were no riskier than missions to the \nInternational Space Station, which NASA was planning to continue. I was \npleased that, after some deliberation, NASA changed course and decided \nto go forward with the final servicing mission.\n  Hindsight being what it is, it is easy to say that continuing the \nHubble servicing mission was the right choice to make. But for me, it \nwas always the best option. As Dr. Grunsfeld said during the mission, \nthe Hubble is about humanity's quest for knowledge. Over the past 19 \nyears, the Hubble Space Telescope has opened fantastic windows into the \nuniverse. With it we have seen the pillars of creation and the death \nthroes of distant stars. We have seen signs of supermassive black holes \nat the centers of galaxies and evidence that our universe is expanding \nat an ever increasing rate. And we have found planets similar to our \nown orbiting stars much like the Sun, reigniting old debates that force \nus to ask if we are alone in this universe. That is a quest we should \nnot easily give up.\n  I find it fitting that the crew of STS-125 visited Capitol Hill on \nthe same week as the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. \nFor an agency that has had its fair share of tragedies and triumphs, \nsurely the Apollo 11 mission and the Hubble Space Telescope stand out \nas shining examples of the heights NASA can reach. They are arguably \nthe agency's greatest successes in manned and unmanned space \nexploration.\n  As high water marks of the past, they also offer useful perspective \non the future of NASA. NASA is at a crossroads, where we must answer \nquestions about the future balance of manned versus unmanned space \nexploration, about whether we should set our sights next on the Moon, \nMars or some other goal, about how to cope with completion of the \nInternational Space Station and retirement of the Space Shuttle in \ncoming years. And we must answer all of these questions during the most \ndifficult economic conditions of a generation. I look forward to those \ndebates in the Senate, but they are debates for another day.\n  Today is about honoring the crew of STS-125. Our thanks go out to \nScott Altman, Gregory Johnson, John Grunsfeld, Michael Massimino, \nAndrew Feustel, Michael Good and Megan McArthur, and all of the other \nHubble caretakers over the years. They have steadied Hubble's gaze, \nsharpened its vision and extended its reach. Thanks to them we can keep \nour eyes focused on the heavens, touch the face of God and learn a \nlittle more about the universe and ourselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8130-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8130-S8131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING DETROIT SHOCK\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this afternoon, I had the pleasure of \njoining President Obama on the South Portico of the White House for a \nceremony to honor the Detroit Shock on winning the 2008 WNBA \nchampionship. This is the third WNBA Championship in 6 years for the \nShock, an outstanding accomplishment for the WNBA's first expansion \nfranchise and one in which many across the State of Michigan take great \npride. As one of only two teams to win three or more championships in \nthe league history, the Detroit Shock is clearly a part of an elite \ngroup in the WNBA.\n  The Shock completed a hard fought title run with a three game sweep \nof the San Antonio Silver Stars, capped by a 76-60 victory in the final \ngame before an elated home crowd. Those in attendance, as well as those \nin Detroit and across Michigan, were pleased with the poised \nperformance of this veteran team. Through persistence, perseverance and \nhard work, this team defeated two quality opponents, the Indiana Fever \nand the New York Liberty, en route to earning a spot in the WNBA \nfinals.\n  Led by the determined play of Katie Smith, the Shock maintained their \nfocus throughout a grueling regular season and their ensuing march \ntoward the 2008 WNBA title. Katie Smith averaged 21.7 points per game \nin the finals and won the 2008 WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player award.\n  This championship win was yet another milestone in the storied career \nof head coach Bill Laimbeer, who was at the helm of each of the Shock's \nchampionship runs. He has amassed a total of five professional \nbasketball titles, which includes two as a player for the Detroit \nPistons. This was also the sixth championship for Detroit Shock owner \nBill Davidson's Detroit sports teams.

Madam President, our military is under an \nunprecedented stress. Over 140,000 American servicemembers are deployed \nfighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many have made multiple deployments. \nTheir families are also fighting on the home front to live normal lives \ndespite repeated absences of a spouse or parent. Our nation owes our \nservicemembers and their families an enormous debt of gratitude. \nCongress has a sacred trust to provide for their needs.\n  The fiscal year 2010 Defense authorization bill passed by the Senate \nensures that our servicemembers on the battlefield have what they need \nto complete their missions come home safely to their families and \ncommunities. It provides for advanced armored vehicles to keep them \nsafe from roadside IEDS. It also authorizes an increase of 30,000 \nadditional soldiers for the Army to help reduce the strain of repeated \nIraq and Afghanistan deployments.\n  I commend Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain for their \nleadership in crafting this bill. They have carefully balanced many \ncompeting priorities. They recommended a bill that looks out for the \nneeds of our men and women while also looking out for their families. \nThey have made hard choices to cut programs that are not working or are \nno longer needed. This is not an easy task. We should all be grateful \nfor their dedication to our military and to our Nation's security.\n  This bill really looks out for our military personnel and their \nfamilies. It includes a 3.4-across-the-board pay raise, half a \npercentage point more than requested. It increases the supplemental \nsubsistence allowance from $500 to $1100 per month to ensure that \nservicemembers and their families do not have to rely on food stamps. \nIt also authorizes $30 million in IMPACT aid to help communities \neducate military kids, including $10 million for communities hard hit \nby BRAC, and $5 million to help educate military kids with severe \ndisabilities. It has been said time and again, that while we recruit \nthe soldier into the military, we must retain the family. This is \nespecially true in this time of great stress on our military. This bill \nrecognizes and responds to this reality.\n  I am also very glad that once again, the Senate is passing a DOD \nauthorization that looks out for wounded warriors. This bill requires \nthat DOD increase the number of behavioral health specialists to ensure \nthe military has enough doctors trained to identify and prevent suicide \nand post-traumatic stress disorder. It also directs DOD to devise \nstrategies for electronic medical record exchanges between the military \nmedical and Veterans Administration systems. This is critical to \nensuring a smooth transition of care from one medical system to the \nother, and a timely processing of disability and benefits claims. When \na soldier is injured, we incur a 50 year commitment for their care. I \nam glad that this bill helps ensure that those promises made will be \npromises kept.\n  The Senate considered many amendments during our two weeks of debate \non this important bill. There are two that I want to discuss in \nparticular.\n  I am pleased that the Senate supported President Obama, Secretary of \nDefense Gates, Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff ADM Mike Mullen and \nAir Force leaders in their decision to end the F-22 program. The F-22 \nwill ensure the U.S. Air Force is dominant in future air-to-air \nconflicts. It is a credit to engineers and technicians who designed and \nbuilt this great plane. Everyone involved in this program should be \nproud. However, I agree with the President that the time has come to \nbring F-22 production to an end so we can channel limited dollars to \nfielding the Joint Strike Fighter as soon as possible. I support ending \nthe F-22 at 187 planes, and would have voted in support of the McCain-\nLevin amendment on the Senate floor to accomplish this.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate voted to reject the amendment \nproposed by Senator Thune to allow gun owners to carry concealed \nweapons across State lines without first getting a permit to do so from \nthe State they are entering. The second amendment guarantees Americans \nthe right to bear arms. However, each state must be able to make \nreasonable rules to protect residents and public safety officers, and \nthis amendment would have made that impossible. It also would have \nundermined Congress's long-standing respect for State's rights to enact \nand enforce their own gun laws. It is no surprise that large city \nmayors and police chiefs all over the country opposed this amendment. I \nwould have opposed it also, and I believe the Senate did the right \nthing in defeating the Thune amendment.\n  In closing, I reiterate my strong support for this bill. It puts our \nservicemembers and their families first, provides our troops with what \nthey need to accomplish their missions, and it makes wise investments \nin our Nation's security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8131-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8131-S8132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     WOMEN AIRFORCE SERVICE PILOTS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, with Arkansas pride and \nheartfelt gratitude, I would like to thank and honor the brave \nArkansans who served as Women Airforce Service Pilots--or WASPS, as \nthey were more commonly called--during World War II.\n  During the war, women were recruited to fly noncombat missions under \nthe Army Air Corps, so that male pilots could be deployed in combat. \nThey served as test and instructor pilots, towed targets for air-to-air \ngunnery practice and ground-to-air anti-aircraft practice, ferried and \ntransported personnel and cargo, including parts for the atomic bomb, \nand simulated combat maneuvers. In short, they flew every type of \nmilitary aircraft on every type of mission, except direct combat \nmissions.\n  Between 1942 and 1944, 25,000 young American women volunteered for \nflight training and service. Of these, 1830 were accepted and 1074 \nwould eventually successfully complete their training. Four of those \nwho received their wings were from Arkansas.\n  Dorothy Rae Barnes, from Hot Springs, AR, graduated from Hot Springs \nHigh School in 1935. She became a WASP, she said, because she had \nfriends who were early WASP recruits and they encouraged her to join. \nShe graduated from flight school in July 1943 and, as a WASP, flew the \nAT-6, a single-engine advanced trainer aircraft used to train fighter \npilots, and the BT-13, a basic trainer flown by most American pilots \nduring World War II. After her wartime experiences, she returned to Hot \nSprings, where she still lives today.\n  Geraldine Tribble Vickers Crockett, from Stevens, AR, became \ninterested in flying because of an older brother, who was a flight \ninstructor. He enrolled her in a civilian pilot training program that \nhe was teaching in Little Rock and it was there that she earned her \nprivate pilot license. She went into the WASPs in 1944 and, like \nDorothy Barnes, flew AT-6 and BT-13 aircraft. After deactivation, she \nwent on to get her instructor and commercial licenses and taught flying \nto veterans on the G.I. bill. She now lives in Palm Springs, CA.\n  Betty Fulbright White, from Clarksville, AR, was in the last WASP \nclass to graduate in December 1944. During her shortened service, she \npulled targets for gunnery practice and transported cargo. After the \nwar, she returned to Clarksville, where she passed away in 1985.\n  Thirty-eight women died during their service. They were denied \nmilitary honors and their families bore all the costs of transporting \ntheir bodies home and arranging for their burials. One of those was Lea \nOla McDonald. Lea McDonald was born in Hollywood, AR, on October 12, \n1921. She entered WASP training in Houston, TX, in January 1943 and \ngraduated in April 1944. She was killed less than 4 months later while \nflying an A-24 attack bomber on a practice flight at the age of 22.\n  During their time in service, these women faced overwhelming cultural\n\n[[Page S8132]]\n\nand gender bias. They received unequal pay, did not have full military \nstatus, and were barred from becoming military officers. At the end of \nthe war, the women were ordered to leave military service and paid for \ntheir own transportation home. It was not until 1977 that the WASPs who \nserved during the war were provided veterans' benefits.\n  WASPs were America's first women to fly military aircraft and are a \nsource of inspiration for current and future generations of Americans. \nI am so proud of these women from Arkansas, and from all over the \nUnited States, who served our country under dangerous and difficult \ncircumstances. While we could never fully express the extent of our \nappreciation for their service, President Obama signed Public Law 111-\n40 on July 1, 2009, authorizing Congress to bestow a gold medal in \nhonor of these patriotic Americans. I was honored to be an original \ncosponsor of the bill and I am happy that Congress has bestowed this \nlong-overdue honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8132-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TILLAMOOK COUNTY CREAMERY ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, today I wish to recognize the \nTillamook County Creamery Association, a farmer-owned dairy cooperative \nthat was founded 100 years ago. In 1909, 10 small independent cheese \nplants formed an association in Tillamook County, OR, to produce, \ndistribute, and market quality cheese products that are now sold across \nthe country. Today, Tillamook Cheese is cooperatively owned by 115 \ndairy farming families. As a national leader in the dairy industry, the \nTillamook County Creamery Association produces some of the highest \nquality milk for cheesemaking.\n  Tillamook County Creamery Association has been honored, not only for \ntheir quality dairy products, but for their commitment to community and \nenvironmental stewardship. The farmer-owners have been recognized \nnationally for their dedication to maintaining healthy herds and \nfarmland. They have worked to improve water quality, protect local \nsalmon habitat, and rebuild stream habitats in Tillamook County. In \naddition to being responsible stewards for Oregon's environment, \nthey've also been advocates in addressing hunger in Oregon communities. \nIn partnership with the Oregon Food Bank, the Tillamook County Creamery \nAssociation has contributed countless meals to families in need and \nworked with school districts to help provide cheese for school lunch \nprograms.\n  In addition to cheese production, the Tillamook County Creamery \nAssociation contributes to the local economy by attracting nearly 1 \nmillion tourists every year, making it one of the top tourist \nattractions in the State. The Tillamook County Creamery Association is \na shining example of dedication to the State of Oregon and to the \nhealth of the coastal economy. The cooperative's mission is ``the \ncontrolled and profitable growth of consistent, high quality, great \ntasting Tillamook branded products to meet the demand of the \nmarketplace while optimizing returns to members.'' The Tillamook County \nCreamery Association has achieved that vision and much more in Oregon \nfor a century and will undoubtedly carry on that tradition for years to \ncome.\n  I encourage my fellow Oregonians, my colleagues in the Senate and the \nentire nation to recognize this anniversary and to congratulate the \nTillamook County Creamery Association on 100 years of \nexcellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8132-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMENDING MAYOR PAT RUSSELL\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to convey my sincere \nthanks and appreciation in recognizing Pat Russell, from Keene, NH, for \nher four decades of distinguished service to the State of New \nHampshire. On August 1, Pat is retiring from her role as commissioner \nof the New Hampshire State Liquor Commission, and I am pleased to \nsubmit this statement to the Record.\n  Pat Russell has spent her life serving her community, her State, and \nher country. She was elected to six terms in the New Hampshire House of \nRepresentatives and two terms as mayor of Keene. She served with \ndistinction on President Clinton's Council for Developmental \nDisabilities and for the past ten years she has served on the New \nHampshire State Liquor Commission.\n  To each of these roles, Pat brought a willingness to roll up her \nsleeves and get to work for those she served. Her record of \naccomplishment and her wide circle of admirers speak to the qualities \nthat defined her work: intelligence, persistence and devotion to the \nState of New Hampshire and her beloved city of Keene.\n  As Governor of New Hampshire, I was looking for someone with these \nqualities to fill a coming vacancy on the State Liquor Commission. I \noffered the position to mayor Pat Russell of Keene, who graciously \naccepted. Since that day in 1999, Commissioner Russell has overseen \nwhat she refers to as ``a perfectly oiled machine with absolutely \nfantastic employees.'' Indeed, under Pat's leadership, the commission \nhas thrived, contributing over $100 million each year to New \nHampshire's general fund.\n  New Hampshire is proud and grateful for Pat's service and I know her \nabsence will be felt by all who have relied on her leadership and \nstrength. On a personal note, Pat has been a dear friend and mentor to \nme for over 30 years. I have admired not only her multifaceted \nprofessional abilities, but also her commitment to make a difference \nfor the people of New Hampshire. I wish her well in a much-deserved \nretirement, but I also believe that Pat still has more she wants to do. \nI know that whatever she does, it will be in the service of others.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing our commissioner, the \nHonorable Pat Russell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8132-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMENDING THE HARVEY S.

Firestone High \nSchool in Akron, OH, on the 40th anniversary of their graduation. \nGraduates of Firestone's Class of '69 have gone on to become \ndistinguished and accomplished educators, scientists, doctors, artists, \nentertainers, athletes, public officials, entrepreneurs, and moms and \ndads. This is a tribute not only to those students, but also to their \nteachers who gave lavishly of their time, attention and knowledge to \nensure a sound foundation for almost 400 young men and women.\n  The State of Ohio has been long recognized for its excellence in \neducation, and the 1969 graduates of Firestone High continue to leave a \nlegacy that is a testimony to that excellence. This weekend these \ngraduates will travel from all parts of the country and beyond to \nreminisce, and rekindle friendships. I ask Members of the Senate to \njoin me today in congratulating the Harvey S.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to furnish \nhospital care, medical services, and nursing home care to veterans who \nwere stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, while the water was \ncontaminated at Camp Lejeune; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill ensure the Department of Veterans Affairs provides health care to \nveterans and their families who were stationed at Camp Lejeune, North \nCarolina during the years when the base's well water was contaminated \nby numerous known and probable human carcinogens.\n  Thousands of Navy and Marine veterans and their families who lived on \nCamp Lejeune have fallen ill with a variety of cancers and diseases \nbelieved to be attributable to their service at the base in the years \nbefore the EPA designated the base as a Superfund site in 1988.\n  A recent National Research Council report on the contaminated water \nat Camp Lejeune assessed that there are numerous adverse health effects \nassociated with human exposure to the chemicals known to have been in \nwater at Lejeune that was used for drinking and bathing.\n  Many years have passed while Lejeune veterans and their families have \nwaited for some hope of progress on this issue. Some have died waiting. \nToday, there is much that we now know that was not known in the past, \nespecially a growing body of scientific information about the adverse \neffects these chemicals have on the human body.\n  The Lejeune veterans and their families deserve clarity on the cause \nof their conditions and closure on this tragic situation. It is vitally \nimportant we give those who are sick the benefit of the doubt. If a \nveteran or military family member was stationed at Camp Lejeune during \nthe time the water was contaminated, they should be able to come in to \na VA medical center for needed health care. This bill is a step toward \nproviding the veterans of Lejeune and their loved ones with the respect \nthey deserve. Quite frankly, it is the morally right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/27/senate-section/article/S8136-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8136-S8137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 36--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF \n               ``NATIONAL PURPLE HEART RECOGNITION DAY''\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Crapo) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed \nServices:\n\n                            S.
