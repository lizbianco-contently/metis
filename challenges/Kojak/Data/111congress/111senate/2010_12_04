Mr. President, there is a recurring gag in the comic strip \n``Peanuts'' with which we are all familiar. Charlie Brown is getting \nready to kick a field goal. Lucy is holding the ball while Charlie runs \nup to the ball. At the last second, Lucy pulls the ball away. Charlie \nBrown flies into the air, comes crashing back down, and falls flat on \nhis back. We have all seen this time and time again. But what makes \nthis gag funny is the same thing that made it famous. It wasn't so much \nthat Lucy was tricking Charlie Brown; it was that it kept happening \nover and over. Charlie Brown kept being tricked.\n\n[[Page S8514]]\n\n  It is obvious by now that our Republican friends have drawn their \npolitical strategy from this cartoon. We have all heard Republicans \nweep for the deficit they say they fear. Democrats agree that we need \nto do something about the deficit. We have said: How about cutting the \ndeficit by admitting we can't afford a tax break for millionaires and \nbillionaires, a tax break that would add, under the legislation offered \nby my Republican colleague, Senator McConnell, $4 trillion to the debt, \nas this is a tax cut many admit they don't need. When was the last time \nwe heard an investor ask for less money? What did the Republicans do? \nThey pulled away the football and said: Rather than reduce the deficit, \nwe would really rather give an unnecessary, unwanted, unaffordable \nhandout to the richest of the rich.\n  Then they went a step further. They pretend the real victims here are \nsmall businesses, conveniently bending the rules so that multimillion-\ndollar Wall Street firms, companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers and \nenormous conglomerates such as the Tribune Company, count as small \nbusinesses. It is a sham. In fact, the way Republicans count, President \nObama himself, who has made a lot of money on his books, and most movie \nstars and professional athletes count as small businesses. If that is \nthe way they count, perhaps that explains why Republican economic \npolicies nearly led us into a depression. It is why this time around \nperhaps we should not count on their ideas to help us recover.\n  This week, every Republican sent me a letter saying they would not \nlet legislators legislate, that they wouldn't let the Senate operate \nuntil we addressed the tax cuts. So Democrats called their bluff. We \nsaid: OK, let's talk about tax cuts. Let's vote. The other body had \nalready passed a middle-class tax cut, and we can do the same. The \nmajority in the Senate, like the majority of the country, believes the \nmiddle class deserves this tax cut. The minority in the Senate \nbelieves, against all evidence to the contrary, that millionaires and \nbillionaires and big CEOs who ship jobs overseas deserve this giveaway. \nWe disagree, but that is why the Founders created this body--to debate \nand settle those disagreements. So we said: Let's vote. And what did \nthe Republicans do again? Just like Lucy, they pulled the football away \nand said: No deal. They then sat on the ball while we watched the clock \ncount down. That is why we are here on a Saturday morning when we could \nhave resolved this days ago.\n  In that same letter, Republicans claimed their top priority is \nputting people back to work. It is a priority with which Democrats \nagree. The difference is we really mean it. My State of Nevada has the \nhighest unemployment rate in the country. I know my most important job \nis to create jobs. So Democrats again gave them the chance to walk the \nwalk. We tried to pass a bill that would extend unemployment insurance \nfor so many Americans who lost their jobs in the recession and are \nstill trying hard to find work.\n\n  Economists tell us that unemployment insurance is one of the best \nways to energize the economy and create jobs. We know that for every \ndollar of unemployment insurance that goes out, at least $1.61 comes \nback into the economy. It is a good investment. The Council of Economic \nAdvisers said this week that failing to extend this lifeline would cost \nthe country 600,000 more jobs.\n  What did Republicans do? Once again, they did their best Lucy \nimpression, pulling away the football and saying: I object. They \nstepped up and did the same thing they have done over and over. They \nstopped us from creating jobs. Like the football Charlie Brown can't \nkick, the money that would immediately go back into the economy remains \nout of reach for those who would spend it the fastest.\n  Finally, the Senator from Arizona, his party's nominee for President \nlast election, has given a dizzying defense of don't ask, don't tell--\nan obsolete, embarrassing, and discriminatory policy that weakens our \nmilitary and offends our values. First, Senator McCain said he \nseriously would consider repealing it if the military leadership \nthought we should. When the military leadership said it should be \nrepealed, he pulled away the football. Then Senator McCain said he \nwould need to see a study from the Pentagon. When the Pentagon produced \na study saying repeal would have no negative impact, he pulled away the \nfootball again. And for his latest trick, he said yesterday that he \nopposed repealing don't ask, don't tell, a proposal that would be a \ngreat stride forward for both equality and military readiness, because \nof the economy. I repeat: The senior Senator from Arizona said he \ncouldn't support repealing don't ask, don't tell because of the \neconomy. I have no idea what he is talking about, and no one else does \neither.\n  Yesterday, we also heard the Republican leader say:\n\n       Americans don't want to see meaningless theatrics in \n     Congress. They want us to do something about the economy.\n\n  He is right. The theatrics need to end. The time to do something \nabout our economy needs to begin now, and what better way to \ndemonstrate that than by doing what the American people and economists \nof every political position know is the right thing to do--protect the \nmiddle class from higher taxes and reject a $4 trillion bailout for \nbillionaires.\n  Our economy is not a cartoon. The jobs of hard-working Americans are \nnot political footballs. Instead of taking their ball and going home \nwhen they don't get their way, it is time Republicans realize we are \nnot here to embarrass one another. We are here to get things done. We \nare here to help our economy grow again. It is time Republicans \nrecognize that, like Charlie Brown and Lucy, we are on the same team.\n  Mr. President, we are 2 minutes or so from the 2 hours for the time \non the tax cut debate. We have a couple of amendments. Unless there is \nobjection, we should go ahead and start that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been my honor to serve on President \nObama's deficit commission, a commission chaired by former White House\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\nChief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former U.S. Senator from Wyoming Alan \nSimpson. For 10 months, we met and considered all of the possibilities \nfor us to move toward a more stable fiscal picture in America. Our goal \nwas simple: to reduce Federal spending, reduce the deficit by $4 \ntrillion over 10 years. It took us 10 months to come up with a \nproposal, and yesterday 11 out of the 18 members of the commission \nvoted in favor, as I did. I had my reservations about some of their \nprovisions, but I did not quarrel with the goal.\n  Unless we are serious about budget deficit reduction, America's \neconomy will be in peril. Borrowing 40 cents out of every dollar we \nspend and borrowing it from countries such as China, which, as a \nresult, have leverage on the U.S. economy, is something we should not \never accept as normal. It is abnormal and dangerous.\n  I left that commission hearing yesterday, voting to cut $4 trillion \nover 10 years, to come to the floor of the Senate, where the Republican \nside of the aisle, the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, has a \nproposal for tax cuts over the next 10 years of $4 trillion. What a \ncoincidence. All of the pain that would be inflicted on the American \npeople and our economy from the deficit commission proposal to reach \nthe goal of moving toward budget balance and sensible budgeting would \nbe completely wiped away by the Republican tax cut proposal. That is \nwhy this debate is so critical.\n\n  I fully support the amendment being offered by Senator Baucus of \nMontana, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, an amendment \nwhich says: We will have tax cuts, but we will do it sparingly because \nwe need to, not only to help middle-class families but to help this \neconomy. The Baucus proposal would cost us, over 10 years, $1.5 \ntrillion. It is a huge sum of money. But it is a sum of money we should \ninvest at this moment because of the reports we received yesterday that \nthe unemployment rate in America continues to rise, that our economy is \nfragile, that this recession is serious, and we need to move to breathe \nlife into this economy as quickly as possible for workers and small \nbusinesses all across the United States.\n  That is why I support the Baucus proposal. That is why President \nObama supports it. That is why it is a sensible way to go. And that is \nwhy the Republican position--calling for expanding our deficit, calling \nfor expanding tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans--the Republican \nposition is indefensible, indefensible not just among Democrats and \nIndependents but even in their own political party.\n  A recent CBS poll showed more than 50 percent of Republicans across \nAmerica reject the Senate Republican position calling for tax breaks \nfor millionaires. When we add those who say to just extend the tax \nbreaks for those making $250,000 or less or don't extend any tax \nbreaks, the Republican position is rejected by Republicans across \nAmerica. Why? Because they can add and subtract, and they understand \nthat to give a tax break to the wealthiest people in America at this \nmoment in history is foolish and reckless. Yet that is the position of \nthe Republican Party and a definition of their values.\n  I might also add, to think that the Republicans could stand before us \nand argue that we should give tax breaks to those making over $1 \nmillion a year--let me quantify those tax breaks. The average tax break \nfor a person making $1 million a year, under the Republican proposal, \nis $100,000 a year--$100,000 a year. That is what they are prepared to \nask for and then turn around and argue it does not add to the deficit, \nwhich it clearly does--some $700 billion--and then argue we cannot \nextend unemployment benefits because it might add to the deficit.\n  So on one hand, giving help to those who do not need it, did not ask \nfor it, and, frankly, will not help our economy when they receive it, \nis acceptable to Republicans. But turning around to help 127,000 \nunemployed people in Illinois who will lose their unemployment \ninsurance this month--Merry Christmas, they lose their unemployment \ninsurance--40,000 people in Missouri who will lose their unemployment \nbenefits this month, this holiday season, and over 30,000 people who \nwill lose it in the State of Iowa, to cut off those unemployment \nbenefits, the Republicans say: Tough luck. That is the way it has to \ngo. We have to be very careful about the way we spend money. Tax breaks \nfor the wealthy, no unemployment insurance for those who struggle is an \nunacceptable position for America's economy and America's future.\n  This is a clear choice. I support the Baucus amendment: help middle-\nincome families, reduce the deficit. Do not reward those who have done \nso well in our economy, have not asked for a tax break, do not need it, \nand only add to our Nation's deficit. As part of the proposal from \nSenator Baucus: provide unemployment benefits for those in America who \nhave lost their jobs through no fault of their own and deserve a \nhelping hand in this holiday season.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield my time to myself, 15 minutes \nout of what we control.\n  First of all, I remember before the President was sworn in he \nannounced that--even though he ran on a platform of increasing taxes on \nhigher income people--you do not raise taxes during a recession. So \nduring the year 2009, there were no proposals to increase taxes from \nthe administration, and, obviously, the Congress went along with that.\n  Then, in August 2009, the President was in Elkhart, IN, and there was \nan exchange there along the same line, and the President said this:\n\n       You don't raise taxes in a recession. We haven't raised \n     taxes in a recession.\n\n  Well, with 9.8 percent unemployment yesterday, it is quite obvious we \nare still in a recession. This debate is not about cutting taxes. This \ndebate is whether we ought to increase taxes on anybody during a \nrecession. We believe we should not raise taxes on anybody during a \nrecession.\n  Also, I heard the other side in their early speeches talk about \nefforts on this side to prevent unemployment insurance from being \nextended. Well, that is the same song we heard from the majority party \nduring June and July. I would remind people on the other side of the \naisle, the results of the election were that the people of this country \nsaid they were concerned about jobs, about the economy, and about the \nlegacy of debt.\n  During that period of time last summer when we were being accused, as \nwe were just accused this time, of not wanting to do anything about \nunemployment compensation, on June 14, June 17, June 24, and June 30, \nwe tried to not only extend unemployment compensation but we tried to \ndo it in a way that was paid for so we did not increase the deficit. \nBut we were denied that opportunity.\n  Finally, soon after the July Fourth break, we were given an \nopportunity to at least vote on an opportunity to extend unemployment \ncompensation and pay for it. But we did not get the votes because for \nthe other side, a deficit does not bother them except when it comes to \nincreasing taxes on somebody else. Then they say the deficit is of \nconcern to them.\n  But the fact is, as I said yesterday right here as I spoke to my \ncolleagues, if we look at the history of tax increases in this \nCongress--in Congress generally--over a long period of time, it is one \nthing to raise taxes if it will go to the bottom line, but we have seen \ntime after time raise a dollar's worth of taxes and it is a license to \nspend about $1.15, $1.17. So raising taxes does not reduce deficits. \nThe reason is, it is not because people in this country are undertaxed, \nit is because Congress overspends. For the tax increases of the past \nand the expenditures that followed, $1 of taxes gives a license to \nspend $1.15. It is just like the dog chasing its tail; he never catches \nit.\n  So here we are, just 1 month after the people of this country very \ndefinitely spoke about their concern about jobs, the deficit, and the \neconomy, and we are right back where the President said we should not \nbe both before he was sworn in and then in August of 2009; that we \nshould not increase taxes during a recession.\n  So I would like to quickly discuss the proposal to increase taxes on \nsome Americans starting in less than a month from now.\n  The first one would be unemployment. Just yesterday--as I just stated \nbut to be more specific--the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the \nunemployment rate ticked back up to 9.8 percent\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\nfrom 9.6 percent. In July, the unemployment rate was 9.5 percent. For \nthe 3 months of August, September, and October, it was pretty steady, \n9.6 percent; now for November, 9.8 percent. The unemployment rates for \nminorities are significantly worse than what it is for the average. The \ntrend is in the wrong direction. In other words, the economy is in a \nvery fragile situation. The economy is clearly telling Congress: Handle \nwith extreme care.\n  The second point is what the economists say. I have a chart that says \nwhat various economists say we ought to do. This was a survey by CNN \nMoney. A majority of the economists say preventing the 2011 tax hikes \nis the No. 1 thing Congress can do right now to help the economy. That \nwould be the 60 percent of the economists who say don't raise taxes for \nany taxpayers; the 60 percent of the economists who say preventing tax \nhikes on all Americans is the best course of action.\n  But only 10 percent of the economists say preventing tax hikes on \nonly the middle class is the best way to help the economy. Sixty \npercent say don't increase taxes on anybody versus 10 percent who say \nit is OK to increase them on some. Of course, the survey is by CNN, \nhardly known as being a Republican network.\n  Four, some on the other side may say that preventing tax hikes on \nhigher income folks is not important. The theory goes that high-income \npeople would just save the money. There are a couple problems with that \npoint. The first is, we all know the lack of savings and investment is \nharmful to the economy. But the other more direct response is, they \nprobably would increase their spending on consumption.\n  Mark Zandi, a respected economist with Moody's, had this to say: \nNormally, I would firmly agree that raising taxes on people who make \nover $250,000 a year would not make a meaningful difference in the way \nthey spend money. But I worry that these aren't normal times and that \neven this income group may be sensitive.\n  Now, obviously, these are not normal times when we still have almost \n10 percent of the people unemployed and a fragile economy. What this \nCongress does has consequences, and we ought to be very cautious how we \napproach it.\n  Fifth, we have CBO saying the gross domestic product would be as much \nas 1.4 percent higher in 2011 if all the tax relief of 2001 and 2003 is \nmade permanent. If the tax relief is only for lower income Americans--\nas is proposed by the amendment before this body and by people on the \nother side of the aisle--then, according to CBO, the GDP would only be \n1.1 percent higher in 2011.\n  Now maybe some people think the difference between 1.4 percent an 1.1 \npercent of more growth is insignificant. But let me tell you, when it \ncomes to 10 percent unemployment that sort of economic growth is going \nto put a significant number of people back to work if we allow the \nhigher 1.4 percent to happen.\n  In other words, the difference between preventing tax increases on \nall Americans and on only preventing the tax increases on some \nAmericans--that three-tenths of 1 percent in 2011 is a very significant \ndifference of economic growth.\n  I would like to go to a sixth point. Given the recession, given the \nunemployment rate, given business reluctance to invest and grow, is \nthis the time to reduce the gross domestic product at all? If it were \njust a matter of either the government got the money or the private \nsector, that would be one thing, as the government does have a deficit \nproblem. But in this case, it is a matter of money simply not being \nthere because of the hit to the gross domestic product. So we are \ntalking about dead-weight loss.\n  Then, seventh, fiscal history proves higher rates do not yield higher \nrevenue. As shown on this chart, this is a 50-year history of revenue \ncoming into the Federal Government as a percentage of gross national \nproduct. The red line is pretty steady. It does not matter whether we \nhave 93 percent rates back in the Eisenhower and early Kennedy years, \nand then they were reduced down and down and down and down and down, to \neventually, in 1987, when they got down to 26 percent, and, in 1990, \nthey went back up to 39.6 percent. Now they are down to 35 percent. Are \nthey going to go back up to 39 percent, 40 percent? This chart proves \nthe taxpayers of this country are smarter than we are in Congress \nbecause we think we can raise high marginal tax rates and bring in more \nrevenue, and it doesn't have anything to do with what the American \npeople are willing to send to Washington.\n\n  I wish to quote not this Senator but the Joint Committee on Taxation \nin regard to high marginal tax rates not making much difference to what \nmoney comes into the Federal Government because the taxpayers are \nsmarter than we are. They are smart enough to know that if you have 93 \npercent marginal tax rates, why work? So you didn't get any more \nrevenue. There is still about 18.2 percent of the gross national \nproduct coming in for us to spend. But we don't give the taxpayers of \nthis country any credit for having any smarts because we think we are \nsmarter than they are, and this chart proves the taxpayers are smarter \nthan we are because we have high marginal tax rates, and it doesn't \nbring in any more revenue. When are we going to learn?\n  So the Joint Committee on Taxation says about this:\n\n       We anticipate that taxpayers would respond to the increased \n     marginal rates by utilizing tax planning and tax avoidance \n     strategies that will decrease the amount of income subject to \n     taxation.\n\n  The ninth point out of 11--and I am about done--I often quote the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the voice of small \nbusiness here. Because the President says 70 percent of the new jobs in \nAmerica are created by small business so we ought to listen to what \ntheir voice in Washington has to say for small business and what we do \nand the effect, good or bad, on the economy.\n\n       Members of Congress fled with no action on important issues \n     like expiring tax rates, leaving the cloud of uncertainty \n     larger and darker. In response, consumer sentiment fell and \n     owner optimism remained anchored solidly in recession \n     territory. Thus, spending stayed in ``maintenance mode'', \n     deterioration of jobs continued, and capital spending remains \n     at historically low rates. Owners won't make spending \n     commitments when sales prospects remain weak, and important \n     decisions--\n\n  I wish to highlight this--\n\n     such as tax rates and labor costs remain so uncertain.\n\n  This debate adds to that uncertainty, if you are going to have tax \nincreases.\n  So here we are on a Saturday. I have a chart up that I think says \nwhat today's debate is all about. We don't need a dog and pony show \ngoing on, on a Saturday, when we ought to be giving certainty to the \neconomy, because the word ``uncertainty'' is exactly what CEOs of major \ncorporations told the President back in June, when he called them in \nand said: You have $2 trillion in cash sitting in corporate treasury. \nWhy aren't you spending it and creating jobs?\n  They said: Because of so much uncertainty.\n  So the bottom line is this. Stop the tax hikes.\n  Mr. President, may I make a unanimous consent request, please, that \nSenator Hatch have 15 minutes; Senator Thune, 10 minutes; Senator Kyl, \n10 minutes; and Senator Graham, 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, because you New Yorkers think you can make us \nMidwesterners look bad, but I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. Through the Chair, I would simply \nlike to ask my colleague this. I understand we have a different point \nof view. We both care about deficit reduction. Could he please explain \nto me why it is OK to take $300 billion of tax cuts for those at the \nhighest income levels--above $1 million--and not pay for it, yet we \nhave to pay for an unemployment extension?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes; I thought I made that point very clear. Because \nthe taxpayers are smarter than we in Congress are. They know if they \ngive another $1 to us to spend, it is a license to spend $1.15. So it \njust increases the national debt. When it comes to paying for \nunemployment compensation, we can pay for unemployment compensation \nbecause the stimulus bill was supposed to stimulate the economy and it \nis not being spent. If you put money from stimulus into unemployment, \nyou\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n\ndon't increase the deficit, and you also have the money spent right \naway.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reclaiming my time, I thank my colleague.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would just say the answer doesn't deal \nwith deficit reduction. If you care about deficit reduction, the two \nshould be treated equally. Mr. President, $1 of tax break per \nmillionaire and $1 of increased unemployment benefits increases the \ndeficit the same amount. However, every economist--I saw we had a chart \nup about economists before--will tell us $1 into unemployment benefits \nstimulates the economy about four times as much as $1 into tax \ndecreases for millionaires. That is pretty universal. Mark Zandi, John \nMcCain's economic adviser during his campaign, said $1 of tax breaks \nfor millionaires stimulates the economy about 30 cents' worth. So $1 of \nunemployment benefits increases the economy by about $1.62.\n  I know we have a few of my colleagues coming. Does my colleague have \nanyone else here he wishes to have speak right now?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I don't think they are here.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. OK. Then I will speak for a minute or two, unless you \nwould like to speak a little longer.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Are you saying you don't want to use any time on your \nside to speak?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If you have more time on your side that you want to use, \nthat is fine; otherwise, I will.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I don't want to eat into my colleagues' time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. OK. Then I will speak for a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, this debate is very simple. Everybody here believes in \nall good faith that we ought to permanently extend tax breaks for the \nmiddle class. The question on the floor is, Do we want to extend those \ntax breaks for millionaires and billionaires at a time of huge deficit? \nI would argue vociferously no. I would argue most economists agree that \nshouldn't happen. I would argue the American people, by 26 percent to \n74 percent, are against giving tax breaks to millionaires. Why? It is \nvery simple.\n  It is not that we are against millionaires. God bless them. Most of \nthem made their money the hard way. They worked hard. They made the \nAmerican dream. Every one of us would like to have done that--or most \nof us. So this is not aimed at being critical of them. But, rather, it \nsays we have two economic realities. We have an economy that under the \nBush tax cuts right now--my colleague mentioned unemployment went up to \n9.8 percent. That is under these tax cuts.\n\n  When the rates were a little higher under President Clinton, we never \nhad unemployment that high. But we would argue: So the middle class \nneeds to continue that break for two reasons. One, it stimulates the \neconomy and, No. 2, middle-class incomes have declined over the last \ndecade. In the first decade under the Bush tax cuts, middle-class \nincomes declined for the first decade since World War II. Under the \nClinton rates, middle-class incomes increased rather significantly. \nSecond, we would say this: But at the same time--this is the conundrum \nwe have economically--we have a large deficit and the question is, How \ndo you reduce the deficit? Again, I think both of us agree we should \nreduce the deficit. It seems to me, about the best way to reduce the \ndeficit is not to give $300 billion of tax breaks to the 315,000 \nAmericans whose income is over $1 million.\n  By the way, I would remind my colleague there are 160 million \npeople--my colleague from Alaska has reminded me--160 million people \nwho file tax returns. Only 315,000--by quick math, that is about .03 \npercent--have an income over $1 million. But in the last decade under \nthe Bush tax cuts, those people have garnered all the increase in \nwealth, all the increase in income--or just about--a huge proportion of \nit.\n  So if we are looking for deficit reduction, should we hurt the middle \nclass? No. Should we stop building roads? In my opinion, no. Should we \ntake money out of Social Security? In my opinion, no. Where are we \ngoing to get it? Don't do unemployment benefits which stimulate the \neconomy and mean so much to middle-class people who have been out of \nwork for so long under this regime of Bush tax cuts? No. The best place \nto get that money--it is not that we want to punish wealthy people. We \nwant to praise them. But they are doing fine and they are not going to \nspend the money and stimulate the economy. For some reason, 42 Members \nof this Senate, all on the other side of the aisle, somehow the \nlinchpin of their entire economic policy is tax breaks--further tax \nbreaks--for those who are very wealthy.\n  Let me remind my colleague that every person whose income is $100 \nmillion--there aren't many of them, but they have a lot of the income--\nwould get a $3.8 million tax break a year. The average middle-class \nperson under our plan would get about a $2,000 tax break a year. Is \nthat equivalent? Certainly, the person making $3.8 million isn't going \nto rush to J.C. Penney and buy that warm winter coat they have been \nwaiting for. No.\n  So I would say to my friend, it is a bit contradictory to say pay for \nunemployment benefits but don't pay for tax cuts to the rich. It is \nalso a bit contradictory to say you care about deficit reduction but \nnot when it comes to tax breaks for the wealthiest people.\n  I am going to be here for the next 2 years to remind my colleagues, \nevery time they talk about deficit reduction and don't spend money on \nthis and don't spend money on that, that they were willing to increase \nthe deficit $300 billion to give tax breaks to people who have over $1 \nmillion.\n  With that, I yield the floor and turn it over--I see my colleague \nfrom Utah is here. I kept him waiting yesterday. I am not going to do \nthat today. So I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate my colleague, Mr. President. This is a first \nfor him to yield to me and appreciate me.\n  That is not quite accurate because we are real good friends.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from New York, has come forward with an \namendment. The essence of the amendment is a marginal tax rate hike on \ntaxpayers earning more than $1 million. It has been dubbed the \n``millionaires' tax.''\n  Folks on the other side must know two things. One, this may be well \ndesigned from the other side's political viewpoint. Supporting the tax \nprobably registers well with some of the Democratic polling mavens. By \nthe same token, these polling mavens might be indicating to their \npatrons that this lameduck session vote might supply some good campaign \nmaterial. As the debate ensued this past week, it almost seemed as \nthough my friends on the other side were giddily rubbing their hands \ntogether. Maybe they view this vote as the equivalent of a Hanukkah \ngift or Christmas present. But their holiday political joy stands in \nsharp contrast to the dreary situation facing America's unemployed. Two \nyears of wall-to-wall Democratic rule has only made the situation \nworse.\n  There is a second thing my friends on the other side must know. They \nknow Senator Schumer's amendment will surely fail. Does anybody doubt \nit?\n  Thirty-three days ago, the American people sent a message: Work \ntogether. Take care of the people's business. Nothing is more \nfundamental to the people's business than how much they are taxed. In \nthis weak economy they said: Keep taxes low. Keep taxes low.\n  We should not meddle with the great sovereign power of taxation. It \nis especially true in this harsh economic climate. On April 19, 1774, \nSir Edmund Burke tried to persuade the British Parliament to repeal the \nlast of several controversial colonial taxes. His wisdom is instructive \nfor today's vote. Remember, this is Sir Edmund Burke arguing for the \ncolonists in America:\n\n       Could anything be a subject of more just alarm to America, \n     than to see you go out of the plain high road of finance, and \n     give up your most certain revenues and your clearest \n     interests, merely for the sake of insulting your Colonies?\n\n  Burke's point was that the Parliament was acting unwisely by \nmaintaining a tea tax primarily to spite the colonists.\n  Four Saturdays from today, we will mark New Year's Day 2011. The tax \nlaw, as it now reads, will impose a punitive hike on virtually every \nAmerican taxpayer. That date of reckoning has been clear since my \nfriends took power almost 4 years ago in both Houses of Congress.\n  My friends on the other side, with all due respect, your actions this \nmorning\n\n[[Page S8518]]\n\namount to meddling. You possess part of the sovereign power to change \nthe tax law to prevent this tax increase. Instead, you have forced this \nbody into a political showdown.\n  The proponents of the so-called millionaires' tax say the reason to \ndo so is ``fiscal discipline.'' This proposal preserves less than half \nof the revenue of the related positions in the Reid-Baucus substitute. \nIf that is the case, and revenue is the goal of the proponents of the \nmillionaires' tax, they ought to stick with the Reid-Baucus substitute.\n  But let's set aside for a moment the fact that the revenue raised is \na fraction of the broader tax hike on the Reid-Baucus substitute. Does \nanybody take seriously the amendment proponents' claims that the \nrevenue raised will go to deficit reduction? Does anybody really \nbelieve that? You know they are going to spend every dime of it, if \nthere were any revenues. Where is the mechanism to assure taxpayers of \nthat? More important, what is the record of my friends on the other \nside on this point? You need to only look at the fine print in the \nrevenue and spending tables of the President's budget.\n  As an aside, the President's budget is the most transparent \npresentation of the fiscal features of the agenda of my friends on the \nother side. Hiking marginal tax rates on singles making more than \n$200,000 and families making over $250,000 translates to about six-\ntenths of 1 percent of gross domestic product, or GDP, per year over 10 \nyears. The new above-baseline spending initiatives in the President's \nbudget translate to seventy-five one-hundredths of 1 percent of GDP per \nyear over 10 years. What does that mean fiscally? The revenue raised by \nthe broader tax hike in the Reid-Baucus substitute is less than the new \nspending in the President's budget. It doesn't take a rocket scientist \nto figure this out.\n  As I stated earlier, the revenue raised by the amendment of my friend \nfrom New York is less than half of that of the Reid-Baucus substitute. \nDoes anybody really believe that lesser amount of revenue is less \nlikely to be spent? So much for the fiscal discipline argument.\n  There are some disturbing points to ponder on this so-called \nmillionaires' tax. I am going to alert my friends on the other side to \nthem.\n  The first point is that capital is the lifeblood of business. Pump \nmore capital into business and it will respond: the business will gain \neconomic energy. Curtail the flow of capital to a business and it will \nrespond: the business will lose economic energy. That is what is \nhappening in America.\n  According to the latest Internal Revenue Service statistics of \nincome--or SOI--data, a lot of capital gain income is earned by \ntaxpayers targeted by Senator Schumer's amendment. Statistics of income \ndata states that 56.6 percent of the net long-term capital gain from \ntraditional capital assets is reported by taxpayers with $1 million or \nmore in income. More important, if capital gains from transactions \ninvolving partnerships and other flowthrough entities are concerned, \nthat percentage rises to 64.7 percent. There can be little doubt that \nwe are talking about a large pool of capital.\n  If my friends on the other side were to prevail, it would be a game-\nchanger for the tax treatment of a large pool of income from capital. \nThe change in the capital gains would surely be a negative one.\n  I have a chart that illustrates the change in the playing field for \ncapital transactions. It shows where we are today; that is, 15 percent \ncapital gains rate. If my friends on the other side are successful, in \na little over 27 days from now, the marginal rate will rise to 20 \npercent. The health care reform bill has baked in another 3.9 percent \nrate hike. That kicks in a little over 2 years from now. So that is \n23.9 percent.\n  This chart shows that the marginal rate on nearly two-thirds of \ntaxable long-term capital gains transactions could be affected. It \nmeans investors who supply that capital, the lifeblood of business, \nwill see the marginal tax rate on capital gains rise by nearly 60 \npercent in a little over 2 years.\n  Everything else being equal, a rise in the marginal tax rate means a \ndecline in the after-tax rate of return. The nonpartisan Joint \nCommittee on Taxation always cautions us about this effect in their \nrevenue estimates.\n  Here is what Joint Tax said:\n\n       We anticipate that taxpayers would respond to the increased \n     marginal rate by utilizing tax planning and tax avoidance \n     strategies that will decrease the amount of income subject to \n     taxation.\n\n  My gosh, what more do you need to understand economics? Capital is \nthe lifeblood of business. Raise the marginal rate on capital gains \ntransactions, and the result will be a decrease in the after-tax rate \nof return on capital investments. What will happen? Capital will go out \nof taxable activities, in many cases. Capital, the lifeblood of \nbusiness, will be constricted. With capital constricted, does anybody \nsee business activity affected in any way that is positive? It would be \nhard to imagine that outcome.\n  When most folks hear about a so-called millionaires' tax, they \nprobably think it would have minimal impact on the business \nenvironment. The data I have discussed shows exactly the opposite. It \nalso shows that any revenue raised will likely be spent. Anybody who \nbelieves that by raising revenues we are going to pay off the national \ndebt has not lived in this country for the last 34 years I have been in \nthe Senate. Our friends on the other side will always spend that money. \nThat is how they keep themselves in power.\n  Does it make sense to send a tax policy signal to investors to move \ntheir capital out of taxable business activity? In the worst economic \nenvironment in many years,--now with 9.8 percent unemployment--should \nwe not be going in the opposite direction? Instead of finding ways to \nkill jobs when the unemployment rate continues to stagnate near 10 \npercent, let's focus our time on finding a bipartisan solution to \nprotect all Americans, especially our job creators, from crushing tax \nhikes. It is time to put a stop to this nonsensical political theater \nand get down to the people's business.\n  One last thought. Over the last summer, President Obama said this:\n\n       The last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the \n     middle of a recession, because that would just suck up, take \n     more demand out of the economy, and put businesses in a \n     further hole.\n\n  I think the President was right. I think the economists think that \nstatement was right. The last thing we should do is raise taxes in the \nmiddle of this downturn, which now is even more down because of the \n9.8-percent unemployment rate. But that tells only part of the story. \nIf you talk about the underemployment rate--those people who don't have \njobs, those who can't find jobs, those who are dependent on the Federal \nGovernment, and those who stopped looking for jobs, and there are a lot \nof people like that--you are talking about 18 percent or better. We \nhave to wise up. The last thing on Earth we need to do is increase \ntaxes at this late date.\n  This is an important debate. The Democrats have had 4 years to change \nthis, where they controlled both Houses of Congress. In the last 2 \nyears, they controlled not only the Houses of Congress but the \nPresidency. At this last minute, to say that we have to do something, \nit shows a lack of--well, you name it; I won't name it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I think the American people, when they \nvoted this year, were saying one thing: We want to keep the main thing, \nthe main thing. To the American people, the main thing is getting the \neconomy growing again and creating jobs. Almost everything that has \nbeen done here in Congress in the last couple of years has been the \nexact opposite of that. You have seen policies put into place that \nincrease the cost of doing business in this country and make it more \ndifficult for small businesses to create jobs.\n  So here we are today debating what evidently has become the \nDemocratic economic theory, which is to raise taxes to create jobs. We \nhave seen this in play throughout the last couple of years. The cap-\nand-trade bill was a tax on energy. It didn't get through the Senate \nbecause we were prepared to stop it, but it passed in the House of \nRepresentatives and was headed here. The health care bill raised taxes \non medical device manufacturers and drug companies and health insurance \nplans, all of which is going to get passed on to small businesses in \nthe form of higher insurance premiums.\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\n  Here we are debating a frontal, direct tax increase on small \nbusinesses. It is the most astounding theory on how to create jobs I \nhave ever seen--raising taxes to create jobs. That hasn't worked in \npractice. The Senator from Iowa eloquently pointed out that, \nhistorically, if you go back over the past half century, not only does \nit not create jobs, it doesn't generate additional revenue. As he \npointed out, when you raise taxes, you don't get more revenue. When you \nlower taxes, you get more revenue. Why? Because it affects the behavior \nof the American people. It affects investors, it affects the allocation \nof capital, and it affects people across this country when they know \ntheir tax rates are going to be low.\n  This seems to me to be completely off the track and off the point \nthat the American people want us to focus on, which is keeping the main \nthing, the main thing--how can we expand the economy and create jobs? \nWe do that by keeping taxes low on small businesses, which, by the way, \ncreate two-thirds of the jobs in our economy.\n  What will be the impact of the proposal we will vote on today in \nterms of small businesses and their ability to create jobs? According \nto the nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee, half of small business income \nwould be subject to higher taxes. That translates into 750,000 small \nbusinesses that would be faced with higher taxes. That also, \nincidentally, impacts about 25 percent of the workforce in this \ncountry.\n  How does that translate in real terms? When these taxes go up on \nJanuary 1 for people who make more than $250,000 a year, who are \nprobably paying the 33-percent or 35-percent marginal income tax rate \ntoday, their taxes will go up to 36 percent or 39.5 percent. If they \nare a family of four and they have personal exemptions, these phase \nout. There is a cap on the number of itemized deductions they can take. \nWhen that kicks in, their top marginal income tax rate could go up to \n41 percent.\n  If you are a small business today that is paying at the 33-percent \nrate and you end up paying 41 percent as a result of this increase to \ntake effect on January 1, you are looking at roughly a 25-percent \ndecrease in your income. That is obviously going to increase the cost \nof doing business. When you increase the cost of doing business, it \nmakes it that much harder for small businesses to invest, to make that \nnew capital investment and buy that new piece of equipment or to hire \nthat additional person, or hopefully additional people, in the \nworkplace.\n  All they are simply doing here is trying to implement a failed policy \nthat hasn't worked in the past and isn't going to work in the future. \nWe have all the science and history and facts to support this. It is \ncounterintuitive to the American people. How many people think the way \nto create jobs is to increase the cost of doing business in this \ncountry? When small businesses create two-thirds of the jobs in our \neconomy, it is absolutely fundamental that you don't increase their \ncost of doing business. You don't raise taxes if your ultimate goal is \nto create jobs.\n  The best thing we can do for the high unemployment numbers and for \nthe debate we are having about unemployment benefits being extended is \nto get people back to work. This is the exact opposite way of going \nabout that. It is completely counterintuitive. Raising taxes to create \njobs is a failed economic theory, and it has failed in practice.\n  I think if the Democrats' tax hike goes into effect--and make no \nmistake about it, I hear the other side talking about tax breaks and \ntax cuts. These are not tax breaks or tax cuts. Taxes are going up on \nJanuary 1, pure and simple. That is all there is to it. Taxes are going \nup on income, on capital gains, on dividends, and they are going up on \nestates. If action isn't taken by the Congress, we are going to see the \nlargest tax increase in American history.\n  The other side says: Well, let's cushion it. Let's limit to it those \nmaking more than $250,000. Of course, that affects a lot of LLCs, a lot \nof partnerships and subchapter S corporations, whose incomes flow \nthrough to their individual income tax returns and who will be faced \nwith the higher income tax rates, not to mention the higher capital \ngains and higher dividend rates. These are the very people we are \nasking to pull us out of this recession and create jobs.\n  So where does that leave us? Well, we are going to have an \nalternative. The alternative would be that we just extend the tax \nrelief, not raise taxes or the cost of doing business, and allow our \nbusinesses to prosper and to flourish and to create more jobs for the \nAmerican people so we can get that 9.8 percent unemployment rate down \nand reduce the amount of unemployment benefits we have to come back \nperiodically and approve.\n  We have 9.8 percent unemployment. We were told a year and a half \nago--a little more than that, almost 2 years ago--when the stimulus \nbill was being debated, if we passed a $1 trillion stimulus bill, we \ncould keep unemployment below 8 percent. That didn't work. Obviously, \nwe borrowed $1 trillion to do that from our children and grandchildren, \nand what do we have to show for it? We have a 9.8-percent unemployment \nrate today and no apparent prospect for the economy to pull out of this \nsluggishness we are in.\n  The best way to accomplish that, the best way to make that happen, in \nmy view and I think the view of the American people--and I speak as one \nindividual who is under the $250,000 threshold--is to allow the people \nwho create the jobs in this country, the people who make more than \n$250,000, to continue to do well. I hope they do because the small \nbusinesses, when they can increase their top-line sales and increase \ntheir revenues and increase their bottom-line profits, are going to be \nin a better position to create jobs. I get that, and I think the \nAmerican people get that. That is why they so consistently voice their \ndisapproval--and particularly the best poll that was taken was the \nelection-day poll, where they came out in big numbers and voiced their \ndisapproval of the policies in Washington, DC, that continue to kill \njobs.\n  So I think we should be looking at what we can do not to kill jobs \nbut to create jobs; what we can do to incentivize businesses to create \njobs, not putting more burdens on them and increasing the cost of their \ndoing business in this country. There isn't anything, in my view, that \nhas happened in this last year, if you are concerned about creating \njobs, that has been conducive to that.\n  There was a group of CEOs pulled in to visit with the President \nsometime last summer. When the President posed the question to them: \nWhy are you CEOs and corporations not creating jobs, I will paraphrase \nthis, but I think the answer, very simply, was: It is your agenda, Mr. \nPresident. That is the problem. We have an agenda here that is killing \njobs because it is increasing the cost of doing business in this \ncountry.\n  It is a very simple proposition. I don't think it takes a lot to get \nit. That is why I think so many people are beginning to realize either \nof these proposals--the Baucus proposal or the Schumer proposal--are \nthe wrong ways in which to approach an economic downturn in this \ncountry and the wrong way to get that economy back on track and get \npeople back to work. The latest example of that was today in the New \nYork Times.\n\n       In the latest sign how the tax issue continues to rankle \n     and divide Democrats, the White House said the administration \n     opposes raising the threshold to $1 million.\n\n  So we have the $250,000 vote that is going to occur and we have the \n$1 million vote that is going to occur, but what I wish to point out to \neveryone is, under the Schumer bill--which is the $1 million \nthreshold--according to the Joint Tax Committee, that still impacts \n350,000 small businesses in this country whose income flows through to \ntheir individual tax returns. So it is a question of whom do you want \nto raise taxes on, 750,000 small businesses with the Baucus amendment \nor 350,000 small businesses with the Schumer amendment.\n  Obviously, one is clearly better than the other, but the point simply \nis this: The economic theory we are debating about raising taxes to \ncreate jobs is the wrong one. It has been proven wrong historically. It \nis counterintuitive to anybody who knows anything about economics, \nwhich is why 60 percent of all prominent economists in this country \nsay--and this was quoted by the Senator from Iowa today--the best way \nto create jobs, to grow and expand the\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\neconomy, is to extend these tax provisions that are going to expire on \nJanuary 1.\n  That is what this debate is about. I hope we will keep the main thing \nfor the American people and not get distracted on all these other \nthings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to defeat \nboth of these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, what this debate is about is whether we \ncontinue to take money from the middle class and working families of \nthis country who are struggling in a way they have not struggled since \nthe Great Depression and force their kids to borrow huge sums of money \nin order to provide $700 billion over a 10-year period to the \nwealthiest people in this country.\n  I hear my Republican friends, time and time again, coming down to the \nfloor of the Senate, say we have a huge deficit, we have a huge \nnational debt. Yet today what they want to do is to drive that national \ndebt up by $700 billion over the next 10 years in order to give huge \ntax breaks to millionaires and billionaires. So please, my friends, say \nwhat you want, but stop talking about the deficit and the national debt \nwhen what you are doing today is driving that debt up by $700 billion \nover the next 10 years.\n  Secondly, everybody in America knows what is going on in our country \ntoday is that the middle class is collapsing, poverty is increasing, \nbut the people on top are doing phenomenally well. In the last 25 \nyears, 80 percent of all new income created in this country went to the \ntop 1 percent. You don't have to worry about the top 1 percent. The \nmillionaires and the billionaires in this country are doing fine. They \ndo not need a huge tax increase. Today, in America, we have the most \nunequal distribution of income and wealth that we have had in this \ncountry since before the Great Depression.\n\n  Isn't it enough for you that the top 1 percent now earns 23\\1/2\\ \npercent of all income? Isn't it enough for you that the top 1 percent \nearns more income than the bottom 50 percent? Isn't it enough for you \nthat in the last 25 years, almost all new income has gone to the top 1 \npercent? Do you think the CEOs on Wall Street who make hundreds of \nmillions of dollars a year need a tax break? Do you think so? I don't \nthink most of the American people think our kids and grandchildren have \nto see their taxes go up in order to provide tax breaks for the richest \npeople in this country.\n  Thirdly, I would say, without the slightest doubt, if these guys are \nsuccessful in giving $700 billion more in tax breaks to millionaires \nand billionaires, the next thing they will do is run down to the floor \nand say: Oh my word, the deficit and the debt are going up. We have to \ncut Social Security because we have such a large debt. Yes, we have \nraised the debt by $700 billion, now we have to cut Social Security. We \ncan't afford to extend unemployment compensation. We can't do it.\n  Millions of workers out there today, as we get to the holiday season, \nare worried about how they are going to take care of their families, \nhow they are going to maintain a minimum level of economic security. We \ncan't afford to extend unemployment security, but we can afford to give \nbillions and billions of dollars in tax relief to the top 1 percent.\n  So I think this is a very easy vote, and the vote is to say: OK. \nLet's give tax relief, let's extend the tax cuts to 98 percent--many of \nwhom are struggling--but let's not give tax breaks today to the \nmillionaires and billionaires of this country who, in many ways, have \nnever had it so good.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think what we have just heard illustrates \nwhy it has been so hard for us to reach a bipartisan agreement on how \nto resolve the tax issues all Americans face in just 4 short weeks.\n  Last Tuesday, a group of us went down to the White House to visit \nwith the President, the Vice President, and some of his folks in a \nspirit of cooperation, I must say, and a spirit in which the President \nreached out to us and said: All right, the elections are over. My party \ndidn't do so well, but it is time now for us to get together and work \ntogether, and the first piece of business we have to resolve is this \ntax issue. We have to figure out how we are going to fund the \ngovernment for the remaining 10 months of the fiscal year, and we have \nto figure out how we are going to prevent Americans from getting a big \ntax increase come January 1. What I would like for you all to do--\ntalking both to Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and \nSenate--is to sit down and try to negotiate this in a bipartisan spirit \nthat truly would give credit to the Congress and give the American \npeople some confidence that they can move forward with some degree of \nclarity about what their tax obligations are going to be. We agreed.\n  The President asked us if we would be willing to sit down, literally \nimmediately, to begin these discussions. We said yes. He named two of \nhis chief spokesmen--the Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner, and Jacob \nLew, the head of OMB, to discuss those issues on behalf of the \nadministration, and each of the four leaders in the House and Senate \nnamed someone to join the discussions as well. Leader McConnell asked \nme to do that on behalf of Senate Republicans.\n  We immediately scheduled a meeting and we got together to discuss the \nparameters of how we should move forward, and it was a very productive \ndiscussion. But it also became apparent, and it became apparent the \nsecond time we met, that actually there weren't going to be any \nbipartisan negotiations to reach a decision until there had been a \npolitical catharsis on the Democratic side.\n  So let me respond briefly to comments made by the majority leader \nthis morning, who seemed to lay at the feet of Republicans the delay in \ngetting this tax issue resolved, when, in fact, it has been due to the \nfact that House and Senate Democrats have had to demonstrate to many of \nthe people in their political base that they can't accomplish what \ntheir base would like them to accomplish and, therefore, ultimately, \nthey will have to negotiate something with us. I understand sometimes \nyou need to go through a process whereby it makes it easier for you to \nmake concessions, and I suspect that is part of what this is all about.\n  I certainly don't denigrate the motives of any of my colleagues \nbecause this is hard, and they are getting a lot of pressure from \npeople in their political base about not giving in to the Republicans \nand so on. But the President asked us to discuss this in a bipartisan \nway, and Republicans have been willing to do that. But, first of all, \nSpeaker Pelosi scheduled a vote in the House that was the Democratic \nposition to allow taxes to be increased on hundreds of thousands of \nsmall businesses and others in this country. A vote was finally held, \nand I might add that 20 Democrats left the fold and joined Republicans \nin saying: No, that is not the way to reach a consensus. Then the \nSenate Democrats decided to schedule the same vote and one more vote to \ntry to accomplish the same purpose. Because of the lateness of the time \nin which that was done, the cloture didn't ripen until this morning, \nwhich is why we are here this morning getting ready to cast these two \nvotes.\n  But I wish to make it clear that I have a disagreement with the \nmajority leader if he is suggesting that somehow it is Republicans who \nhave delayed these negotiations. The fact is, we have had three \nmeetings and I have sat there and we have been very genial with each \nother, but it has been very clear we are not going to be negotiating \nanything until this political process is over with--until the partisan \nvotes have been cast--and then and only then will people sit down to \nseriously negotiate how we are going to resolve the issue. The problem \nis, of course, there is very little time before Christmas. The \nPresident has some other things on his agenda, as does the majority \nleader. I now understand we are going to have to schedule time next \nweek for an impeachment trial, for example, that can take about a day \nand a\n\n[[Page S8521]]\n\nhalf. The President would like to see the START treaty brought up in \nthe Senate and resolved before Christmas. There are other things that \nhave to be done.\n\n  I wish to make it clear that it is not the Republicans' fault that \nthese things are taking time and we still don't have the tax issue \nresolved. It is interesting, we have now been in the lameduck session \nfor 2 weeks and we have accomplished exactly one thing: the Senate has \npassed a food safety bill which now turns out to be unconstitutional. \nSo 2 weeks of lameduck session and essentially nothing accomplished.\n  Our Democratic colleagues have been in caucus for hours--hours--\ntrying to figure out what to do while Republicans are ready to \nnegotiate, ready to act. But until this political catharsis has finally \nrun its course, it appears there will be no more negotiation.\n  I am assuming that the next time the negotiators get together--I hope \nit will be Monday morning; whenever we can get together--we will then \nbe able to actually sit down and work through the process so we can \nextend the tax policies that have been in place for the last decade so \nthat no Americans have their taxes increased, so that businesses will \nhave certainty and families will have certainty about what their tax \nobligations will be going into the next year. If that process can begin \nquickly, then I think we can reach a bipartisan agreement that would \nmake the American people proud and would demonstrate that we actually \ncan come together on an important issue such as this for the benefit of \nthe American people.\n  But let there be no mistake, the votes that were taken in the House \nof Representatives and that will be taken here are not because \nRepublicans wanted to take these votes. These are votes the Democrats \nbelieved were necessary to demonstrate essentially that they cannot get \nthe support they need to do what they would prefer to do, therefore \nenabling them to sit down and talk to Republicans.\n  Those are the facts. We understand this takes time. I just don't want \nto be blamed for taking the time when it is, in fact, not the \nRepublicans' fault that negotiations have not been completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, as you know, I was presiding this morning. \nI was not scheduled to speak, but this time I decided to inform my \nstaff that I would be speaking so they would not be surprised.\n  First, with all due respect to the Senator from Arizona, let's not \ncast shadows on either side. We are all in this together. You cannot \nblame one side or the other for delay. I could argue that the food \nsafety bill took way too long because of three filibusters from the \nother side. But we are here.\n  I am new to this whole process the last 2 years, and I have been \npatient about the issues we face and talk about. But this one is a \nfundamental issue. It is not a question of how long we extend these tax \nbenefits for the middle class; it is who gets them--the middle class or \nthe wealthy, the millionaires and billionaires.\n  I heard my good friend, the Senator from South Dakota--we just \nsponsored a piece of legislation that passed--talk about the small \nbusinesspeople, that they will be affected. Well, let me give some data \npoints because it is one thing to have opinions, it is another thing to \nhave facts. Let's just focus on the facts.\n  The bottom line is businesses in this country. I can speak as a small \nbusinessperson, I think the only one--if not broadly, pretty darn \nclose--who has small businesses in this Chamber. My wife has four \nretail businesses. She started her businesses selling smoked salmon on \na street corner on a vending cart. Today, she employs 30-some \nemployees, struggling every day but making a difference in the small \nbusiness world.\n  Who are these people, the small business community I hear people from \nthe other side talking about? I have no clue whether most of them have \nbeen in it, but I have. Who are these people? These are the people we \nget our drycleaning from or when we go to the convenience store, the \npizza parlor, wherever it might be, these are the small businesses we \nare talking about.\n  The small business community of this country that makes $1 million \ngross--that is not their taxable income; gross--$1 million and under, \nwhere probably their net income is well below $200,000 on that, the \ntaxable income, is 95 percent of the businesses of this country. I like \nthe $250,000-and-under proposal. I also like the compromise Senator \nSchumer has brought forward--$1 million and under--because it catches \n95-plus percent of the small businesses of this country.\n  I continue to hear from the other side that we are going to have an \nimpact on the small business community. You are not. If you support the \nefforts of helping the middle class and you support the efforts of \nhelping small business--businesses that gross $1 million and under--and \nfor those who don't know the difference between gross and net, net is \nthe profit on which they get taxed; gross is what they sell the \nproducts for, not what they get taxed on. Don't confuse the numbers and \nconfuse the American people. And 95-plus percent of the businesses will \nenjoy the tax relief and break. So don't be confused by some of the \nnumbers that are thrown around on the other side or their one-liners.\n  I am going to tell you from Alaska, when I go back to Alaska and I \nlisten to the constituency or when I get the phone calls, e-mails, the \nthousand-plus letters and e-mails I get every single week, what do they \nwant? They want to make sure the small business community--because in \nour State 56 percent of the employment is generated by small \nbusinesses, small businesses that every day are making a difference. \nThose are the folks on whom we are focused. It is a question of not how \nlong these extensions are but who gets them. Is it the millionaire-\nbillionaire club or the people?\n  I know the other side complains and even some on our side complain \nthat we are here on Saturday, but you know there are a lot of Alaskans, \na lot of Americans, a lot of folks from Colorado who are working today. \nThey are working on Saturday, working on Sunday, working one or two or \nthree jobs. First, I say to my colleagues, we are here to have a \ndebate. Some might want to call it political. Well, welcome to \npolitics, where 100 people get elected to a political process. This is \nwhat I came for--a debate and discussion about what is important to the \nAmerican people, to the people whom I represent--Alaskans. That is what \nI came here for.\n  Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal--again, not a very liberal \nmagazine--as well as the Washington Post, which some may consider a \nliberal paper--read their headlines. We can talk about what is making \nthe economy move. What is making the economy move is consumer \nconfidence, not millionaire and billionaire confidence, I can tell you \nthat. They have $2 trillion stuffed away in a bank account.\n  My friend from Iowa is right--he and I have done some work together, \nand I respect him greatly--he is right: $2 trillion is stuffed away \nwith the millionaires and billionaires. But the people who are \nexpending the resources and buying this economy are the middle class, \nthe working people of this country. It is a question of, who are we \ngoing to support? Who are we going to help?\n\n  We do have these huge deficits. We have to make some decisions sooner \nor later. Today's is one of those decisions. I hope we are going to \nmake a decision that, millionaires and billionaires, we are not going \nto fund your tax bonus, your tax giveaway from the taxpayers, on the \nbacks of the future. But we are going to help the small business \ncommunity. We are going to help the middle class.\n  When you look at the numbers--Cyber Monday--some of you may not know \nwhat this is; I do because I am in the retail business in our family--\nversus Black Friday, which is the Friday after Thanksgiving, and then \nthere is Cyber Monday, which occurs Monday, Cyber Monday alone raked in \na historic $1 billion. Now, no disrespect for the millionaires and \nbillionaires, but they are not on Cyber Monday, I guarantee you that. \nEveryday Americans are, everyday Alaskans are--especially in Alaska \nbecause we have to get a lot of products that are not necessarily \nalways in our State. Double-digit increases to the automobile \nindustry--an automobile industry that we helped out to make sure they \ncould survive, but now they are having double-digit sales. Home sales \nin October,\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\nexisting home sales, which is critical to clean the inventory--again, I \nam from the real estate industry, and I know this--10.4 percent \nincrease in October. That is not millionaires and billionaires who buy \nthose homes because they just trade among their friends; these are \nworking Alaskans, working Americans spending their money because they \nbelieve in the future.\n  But here we are about to have a political debate, and I understand \nthere is a lot of swapping and trading going on, and we are having to \ndebate today, and who knows what is going to happen next week on other \nlegislation. To be very frank with you, I think that is not the way \nthis should operate. We should vote on this based on the merits, the \nmerits of the 95-plus percent of the business community that will \nbenefit from the million-and-under program, the 98 percent of the \nmiddle class who will benefit--that is whom we should be talking about.\n  When you look at the data points in regard to the consumer \nconfidence, we are now in the third month and running of increasing \nconsumer confidence. Thirty retail chains talk about their record \nincreases in sales. Again, the people who are shopping at these places, \npeople such as myself, my family, my brothers and sisters, many \nAlaskans--that is what this is about. It is not a question of how long \nto extend these things; it is who will benefit from the right public \npolicy discussion and decisions. Small business folks benefit.\n  I understand the other side doesn't like the $250,000 and under, so a \nlot of us on this side, moderates, said: Well, why not try something a \nlittle different? Let's up it a little bit; let's get to the $1 million \nthreshold because it covers basically everybody except the millionaire \nand billionaire club. That seemed reasonable. I have yet to see any \ncompromise from the other side.\n  That is also what the election told us. It wasn't one side won, one \nside lost. The people in this country, the people in Alaska are telling \nme every day: Get busy, solve problems, compromise, and move forward. \nThe compromise should be not on how long these go but who benefits.\n  My view, again, I am going to support both of these. I think the \ncompromise that has been laid out on the $1 million and under will make \na big difference to our business community. So that argument I keep \nhearing from the other side--and I will tell you this from the other \nside--I am a small businessperson. I know who these people are. So when \nyou talk about it and talk about an economist says this or that, I have \nworked in it, I live it, I see it. So I understand what they are asking \nme to do. Going with that compromise is the right decision in the long \nterm.\n  I encourage my friends that we can reach a compromise here and get to \nhelp our small business community, the middle class, and put money in \nto reduce the deficit--to reduce the deficit. Help our economy, reduce \nthe deficit, I would say that is a pretty good deal, and that is what \nthe taxpayers and the voters told us in this last election.\n  To my friends on the other side, we are reaching out. They may not \nlike the $250,000, but the $1 million and under is a positive step to \nhelp our communities. Again, why would we give millionaires and \nbillionaires $300 billion in another bonus? It makes no sense to me. \nThey are not the ones driving this economy, despite what my friends on \nthe other side might say. It is the people who are the small business \ncommunity, it is the people who work every single day, who are working \ntoday while we sit here and deliberate this issue, who will be working \ntonight and tomorrow and Monday. For us to sit around and say: Let's \nwait until Monday to sit down and have compromise--today is the day, \nright now; this is what we are doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to contrast the Democratic \nplan, plan A, and the Republican plan, plan B, and what they mean for \nthe working citizens of the United States of America.\n  Let me start by talking about the Democratic plan, plan A. It is plan \nA because it is America's plan. Why is it America's plan? First, it \nbenefits every single taxpayer in America. That is the first reason.\n  Some of my colleagues across the aisle have liked to talk about how \nthe Democratic plan only helps those who earn under $250,000, but that \nis because they are not paying attention or they are deliberately \ndistorting the facts, because the Democratic plan provides a tax break \non the first $250,000 regardless of what amount of money you make. So \nit helps every single American.\n  The second is that the recent focus on citizens earning less than \n$250,000 is because it is the working citizens of the United States of \nAmerica who have been getting the short end of the stick. The amount of \nmoney--the average income for workers in America plateaued in 1974.\n  Now, that happens to be the year I graduated from high school. \nEarlier this year, I had the pleasure of taking my son to his first day \nof high school, same high school I went to, exactly 40 years later. So \nfor almost 40 years, the working wages for working Americans have been \nflat. But during that time period, the wealth of this country has \nincreased enormously.\n  The productivity of the American worker has increased enormously. Up \nuntil the mid-1970s, when the productivity increased, the wage of \nworking Americans increased. They shared in the productivity of our \neconomy because they were the driving factor in our economy. \nUnfortunately, for the last 3\\1/2\\ to 4 decades that has not been the \ncase.\n  Then along come the great Bush recession. This recession, caused by \nthe deregulation of retail mortgage,--allowing predatory mortgages, \nallowing kickbacks from mortgage originators to create predatory \nmortgages, when folks qualified for prime mortgages, and then the \nderegulation of Wall Street so those could be packaged into securities \nwas a 2-year ticking time bomb because they had these teaser rates on \nthe mortgages.\n  When the interest rates went from 4\\1/2\\ to 9 or 10 percent, not only \ndid the mortgages blow up but the securities based on them blew up. And \nwe blew up the whole economy. So, thank you very much, friends across \nthe aisle, for attacking the most important financial instrument for \nAmerican families, the American mortgage, destroying it, allowing \npredatory mortgages, allowing predatory securities, blowing up this \neconomy, and attacking the American family.\n  I cannot tell you how many millions of American families are \nsuffering because of the policies that you all implemented over the \nlast decade. What is the result? The American family home has lost \nvalue, a tremendous amount of value. Families are underwater. What is \nthe result? Huge unemployment caused by the meltdown in the great Bush \nrecession. Retirement savings are depleted. Folks who thought they \ncould have retired maybe now, maybe in 2 years, 5 years, are realizing \nthey may have to work as long as they are able to work, as long as they \nare able to keep a job. Their dreams are blown up thanks to these Bush \npolicies.\n  Well, there is a third reason the Democratic plan is the American \nplan. That is because four out of five Americans support it. Some 79 \npercent, or roughly 80 percent, four out of five Americans support tax \nbreaks for families earning less than $250,000, for extending those tax \nbreaks. So that is plan A, America's plan, because it helps all \nAmericans, because it is focused on the American worker who has been \nhit so hard by the great Bush recession, and, because four out of five \nAmericans support it and understand we need it.\n  But now let's turn to the Republican plan, plan B. Plan B consists of \nbonus breaks for billionaires--millionaires and billionaires. Why \n``bonus''? Because every person helped under the Republican plan who \nearns $1 million or $1 billion has already been helped under the \nDemocratic plan. But my colleagues across the aisle want ``extra'' for \nthe wealthiest, most successful Americans.\n  I respect tremendously the entrepreneurs who have been so successful. \nBut there is a time when we have to ask, Are bonuses to those best off \nthe best strategy for America to go forward? This is quite a tongue \ntwister:\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\nbonus breaks for billionaires. It gets even worse. These are the \nextensions of the Bush breaks, and because my colleagues across the \naisle are trying to sell it as a job creation issue--and we will get to \nthat in a minute--they are bogus.\n  So we have the bogus bonus Bush breaks for billionaires. That is the \nRepublican plan B, saying they will obstruct any issue on the floor of \nthe Senate so they can get these bonus breaks for their best friends \nearning millions and billions.\n  Well, I will tell you, these are expensive. Let's ask ourselves how \nmuch is the average value of the Republican bonus break? Well, $100,000 \nper taxpayer. That is how much. If we take the $700 billion the \nRepublican plan creates in more deficit and more debt, if we take that \n$700 billion and divide it by the number of citizens--men, women and \nchildren--in America, 300 million, that is $2,300 for every man, woman, \nand child in America.\n  So my colleagues across the aisle are proposing taking $2,300 out of \nevery child's and adult's pocket in America to give breaks, $100,000 \ntax breaks, to millionaires and billionaires.\n  So let's look at the total cost. Total cost, $700 billion, before we \nadd on interest. Let's add on interest. It is almost $1 trillion. That \nis a huge increase in our deficit. So it is deficit busting, debt \nadding, financed by China, and placed onto our children.\n  Is that what the excited Republican team, coming fresh out of an \nelection, wants to say is their top priority in America, taking $2,300 \nfrom every man, woman, and child in America so they can give a $100,000 \ntax break to millionaires and billionaires?\n  Well, they have a way of trying to camouflage this. That camouflage \nis to talk about jobs. So let's talk about jobs. Let's look at the \nRepublican plan in terms of job creation. Well, CBO ranked the \nRepublican plan against many other plans, and where does it come in? \nDead last.\n  I have the detailed chart from the Congressional Budget Office, and \nup here at the very top is the Democratic plan. That is to provide \nassistance to the unemployed. Here at the very bottom is the Republican \nplan, which is bonus breaks for millionaires and billionaires.\n  Let me tell you just how different these are. Increasing aid to the \nunemployed is estimated to create 8 to 19 jobs for every $1 million in \nexpenditure, 8 to 19 jobs. How many jobs are created by the Republican \nplan? One to three, one to three jobs.\n  So the Democrats are saying, let's take the dead-last plan in job \ncreation, the Republican plan, and let's replace it with the best plan, \nthe Democratic plan.\n  Republican plan, one to three jobs per $1 million, one to three for \n$1 million; Democratic plan, 8 to 19. Well, my good friend from South \nDakota was here saying it is all just common sense. Yes, it is common \nsense. We take the plan that is the worst for job creation, and we \nreplace it with the plan that is the best for job creation.\n  Well, friends across America, this is about jobs, and the word \n``jobs'' will come out of the rhetoric on the opposite side of the \naisle with every speech. But it is bogus. Their plan is dead last; \nDemocratic plan is top of the list. Check the CBO study.\n  It hurts to hear folks who are out of touch with the foreclosure \ncrisis in America----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask for the chairman to yield me 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much does the Senator seek?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. One minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my friend from Montana.\n  It is summarized like this. We have American families who are \nhurting. They have lost their jobs, their retirement savings, the value \nof their houses. Let's have the plan that is best for creating jobs, \nnot the plan that is worst for creating jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am allocated 10 minutes, I think. Can \nyou let me know when I have used 9 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you for allowing me to speak, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Baucus.\n  I guess the first observation I would like to make is that we are \nhere on a Saturday morning. This is democracy, in many ways, at its \nbest. People understand the two votes are going to fail. But it is good \nfor Americans to have genuine differences to be able to discuss what \nmakes us tick, why we want to go one way versus the other. So the fact \nthat America is divided on a lot of big issues is just the result of \nliving in a free country.\n  What was the lesson of the last election? They are what you would \nlike them to be. But here is my observation, for what it is worth. Our \nDemocratic friends took a beating. As Republicans, we have been there. \nIn 2006 and 2008 we took a beating. In 2006, the Iraq war was going \nvery badly, and Americans were very frustrated. President Bush's \npopularity plummeted.\n  In 2008 we had an economic meltdown that I thought was related to \nhousing, where we lent money to people who could not afford to pay \ntheir mortgages. The mortgages were being packaged and sold as all \nkinds of exotic instruments throughout the world. It brought the whole \nworld economy down, and we have been struggling ever since.\n  We can talk about how much Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were the cause \nof this problem, how loose the practices were when it came to lending, \nbut I think most people understand that our economic crisis was created \nby the housing market being overextended and people getting into that \nmarket in exotic ways without a whole lot of regulation.\n  Here we are a couple of years later. I think the last election was a \nmessage to our Democratic friends: For the last 2 years, you have been \ngoing down the wrong road. The health care bill, which about 80 percent \nof Americans, if it ever becomes law, will be under government-\ncontrolled health care, was an overreach.\n  The stimulus package was $780-something billion that has not done \nwhat it was billed to do. When we look at the amount of spending the \nDemocratic Party is engaged in, way above what every American has been \nable to do, this was an election basically not to pro-Republican, just \nto our Democratic colleagues. Stop. And the way you get stopped around \nhere is to get replaced.\n  So the House had a dramatic election. We picked up seats in the \nSenate, and some of us thought maybe we could pick up about two or \nthree more. We made some pretty poor choices when it came to \ncandidates, but that is now behind us.\n  What I would like to tell my colleagues is, when I look at America I \ndo not see an undertaxed nation. I think our Tax Code is far too \ncomplicated. Now 35 percent is the rate. How much is enough? Is it \n39.6? Is that the difference between a social justice country and a \nland of the rich? I mean, are we going to increase taxes for the upper \nincomes by 10 percent when we cannot create enough jobs for Americans \nwho are unemployed?\n  I do believe in this idea that upper income Americans are the ones \nwho create most jobs for the middle class and people looking for work. \nThat is just the fact.\n  Here is how our Tax Code works today. Forty percent of Americans pay \nno Federal income tax. Forty percent of us really do not pay any income \ntax at all. Of those who do, 50 percent of those who pay Federal income \ntax pay 3 percent. The other 50 percent pay 97 percent.\n  The top 10 percent of wage earners in this country pay 70 percent of \nthe taxes. Now, I am for a progressive tax system, but that is not \nright. That seems to me to be taking the country in the wrong \ndirection.\n  There are 750,000 small businesses who will get a tax increase if we \ndo not extend the Bush tax cuts for everybody.\n  I will make a prediction. There are a lot of unsolved mysteries in \nthe world, a lot of things we would like to know that we do not know \nthe answers to. This is not one of them. What will happen, hopefully, \nnext week, is all of the Bush-era tax cuts will be extended because we \nhave high unemployment, and\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\nnow is not the time to pass on to businesses or upper income Americans \nmore taxes.\n  I hope we can extend some of the Obama tax cuts. I do not want to \nraise taxes on anyone. If you do not pay taxes, then you should not be \ngetting a tax cut because you have no tax liability. But if you were in \nthe EITC before, you have some tax liability. The Obama tax cut and the \nstimulus helped you. I am one who considers that to be something we \nshould be looking at, that no one's taxes should go up, Bush-era tax \ncuts or Obama tax cuts.\n  When it comes to the unemployed and unemployment insurance, we are \ngoing to extend that. But we have to have a package that makes sense. \nSo once we get this vote behind us Democrats on the other side will \njoin with Republicans on this side to say no to the class warfare \napproach.\n  One of my good friends from New Jersey said something that got \neverybody stirred up, that negotiating with Republicans is like \nnegotiating with terrorists. Well, I know Bob Menendez. He is a fine \nman. But these are heated times. We say things that sometimes maybe \nsound good to our base but upon reflection we should not say. Nobody \nover here should be considered in that light. To our Democratic \nfriends, we have a genuine disagreement. That is all it is. The one \nthing we have in common, when the real terrorists do come to visit \nAmerica, they could care less how much money one makes. They will kill \nthe janitor and the business owner just as quickly because they don't \nsee any difference based on income. The one thing Americans have in \ncommon is, we do believe in free speech, open debate, religious \ndiversity. That is not something we believe in based on income. That is \nsomething we believe in based on being an American.\n\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides to understand that not only are we \nin this war on terror together, we are in this economy together. A lot \nof Americans are suffering, some more than others. The ones who are \nstruggling in the middle class and lower incomes are trying to do one \nthing everybody agrees on--get a job. I believe the best way for \nstruggling Americans to get a job is not to raise taxes but keep them \nlow in a weak economy. That is what I genuinely believe.\n  I did not come from a rich family. I am the first person in my family \nto ever go to college. My mom and dad owned a liquor store and a \nrestaurant. They worked long and hard to make sure my sister and I \ncould go to college. When my parents died, I was 22 and my sister was \n13. If it were not for Social Security survivor benefits, we would not \nhave made it. She received Pell grants to go to school when her college \ndays were there. I was in the Air Force and helped where I could. I get \nit. People are struggling. There is a role for the government. But this \nis not the time for our government to raise taxes on anybody because \nall of us are struggling to try to find a way out of this economic \nmess. There are tough days ahead, economically. There are tough days \nahead in the war on terror.\n  Let's have these votes, come back next week, and see if we can solve \nsome problems that all Americans are dying for their Congress to solve: \nget us back on sound economic footing, deal with debt.\n  Hats off to Senator Durbin, Senator Crapo, and Senator Coburn for \ntheir votes on the debt commission. They did some very hard things. \nThat product is going to serve the country well. We are all in this \ntogether.\n  I wish everyone good holidays and maybe a time to reflect that we do \nhave more in common than we have in differences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, the job market is still suffering \nfrom the fallout of the recession from the end of the Bush years. The \nunemployment rate nationally is near 10 percent; in my State, it is \nwell over 11 percent. The proposal of Chairman Baucus would inject \nhundreds of billions of dollars into this faltering economy, helping \nstruggling families make ends meet and creating jobs in the process. On \nbehalf of the 65,000 Rhode Islanders who are out there currently \nlooking for work, I express my support for the Baucus 1-year extension \nof emergency unemployment benefits. Without this extension, thousands \nof Rhode Islanders will soon be left with no source of income as they \ncontinue to search the want ads, no money for the mortgage or rent, no \nmoney for food, no money for medicine or for holiday presents for the \nchildren.\n  The 1-year extension of this lifeline will quite literally mean for \nRhode Island families the difference between keeping a home or facing \nhomelessness this winter. The vast majority of unemployed Rhode \nIslanders are out there looking for work. They are out of work through \nno fault of their own. They are looking for work every day. The jobs \nsimply are not there.\n  I was at the Cranston senior center yesterday for their Christmas \nholiday party and spoke to a lady whose son had been in the workforce \nfor 28 years. He had a substantial career. He was out of work. He is \nstocking shelves at the minimum wage. People are not ducking work. The \njobs are not there.\n  Historically, Congress has extended unemployment benefits when the \nnational unemployment rate has been above 7.2 percent. It is over 9 \npercent. It is 9.8 percent, according to a report Friday. This 1-year \nextension will give the 65,000 unemployed Rhode Islanders and over 15 \nmillion unemployed Americans the support they need to continue \nweathering this tempestuous economy.\n  In addition, this tax package would continue a powerful incentive for \nmore investment in smaller companies. Under the proposal of the \nchairman, qualified investments made in 2011 in small businesses would \nbe eligible for a 100-percent capital gains tax exclusion, if they are \nheld for at least 5 years. As the credit market continues to slowly \nthaw, I have heard from numerous Rhode Island business owners that they \nwould like to expand operations, but they can't get the capital. This \nprovision will encourage much needed equity investments so businesses \nin Rhode Island and around the country can create and expand jobs.\n  The Baucus proposal would make permanent the current tax rates for 97 \npercent of taxpayers and deliver tax savings to 100 percent of \ntaxpayers. I am sure my colleagues hear from their constituents, as I \nhear from Rhode Islanders, that it is getting more and more difficult \nfor families to balance their budgets. Each year ticks by bringing \nhigher fuel, food, and medicine costs. Budgets are stretched paper \nthin. It would be harsh now to let taxes go up for middle-class \nfamilies. The Baucus proposal would keep tax rates where they are for \nindividuals earning less than $200,000 per year and families earning \nless than $250,000 per year. Continuing these rates will spare middle-\nclass families considerable tax increases. For example, a family of \nfour earning $60,000 per year would save $2,500 under our plan. I can \nassure my colleagues that for some of my constituents, that $2,500 \ncould be the difference between paying their mortgage and facing \nforeclosure or sending a child to college instead of into the minimum-\nwage workforce.\n  In addition to continuing the middle-class tax cuts, this will inject \nabout $200 billion into the economy over the next 2 years. When middle-\nclass families get additional resources, they tend to spend them, \ninvigorating the economy and supporting local and regional jobs. From \nfamily budgets to the national economy, extending the middle-class tax \ncuts is a clear win-win.\n  This is not necessarily the case for extending tax cuts for \nmillionaires and billionaires. Under the Democratic plan, the first \n$250,000 of income for a wealthy family would benefit from extended \nlower rates. This means $6,000 to $7,000 in savings. But our Republican \nfriends want to go much further and give the average multimillionaire a \n$100,000 tax bonus. Every economist knows a middle-class family is more \nlikely to spend an extra few thousand dollars on groceries, on clothes, \non pharmaceuticals, than a person who already has millions to spend \nwill with an extra $100,000. In an age of large deficits, we need to \nstart to make tough choices on our budget, and this should be an easy \none. Let's keep rates where they are for the vast majority of Americans \nand permit the rates at the very tiptop to go back to Clinton-era \nlevels.\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\n  We are warned that if millionaires and billionaires have to pay the \nsame tax rates as the 1990s, the economic recovery will suffer. But \nwere the Clinton years a time of economic suffering? Of course not. The \neconomy thrived in the 1990s under Clinton income tax rates, far better \nthan it did under the Bush tax rates. There is no reason to think the \nrecovery would suffer if we restored the Clinton-era rates for the very \nwealthiest and most fortunate.\n  I find it astonishing that our Republican colleagues continue to \nfilibuster our efforts to get a tax break for all Americans in order to \nsecure a bigger tax bonus for the top 3 percent of the American \npopulation at a cost to our debt and deficit of $700 billion. The \nwealthiest 1 percent of Americans earn about 21 percent of all income \nand own over one-third of our Nation's wealth. Those figures are at \ntheir highest levels since the Roaring Twenties. Quite simply the rich \nare richer than they have ever been, and Senate Republicans are holding \nhostage a tax benefit for all Americans to demand a superbenefit for \nthe superwealthy.\n  I hope our Republican colleagues will stop obstructing this important \ntax reduction and emergency unemployment legislation. From funding the \ngovernment to authorizing the military, we have so much work to do this \nyear. The price for regular Americans of obstruction in the Senate is \nbecoming too high.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my colleague, the chairman, for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  Today, we stand at a crossroads. We have two vital issues facing this \ncountry. One is an economy that is moving too slowly. The second is a \nlarge deficit looming around the corner. How do we solve that problem? \nThe best way to solve that problem, in my judgment, is to give tax \nbreaks to the people who will spend it, the middle class, and to make \nsure the highest income people who have done very well over the last \ndecade, instead of getting a tax break, make sure that money goes to \ndeficit reduction. Most economists who would look from 10,000 feet up, \nwho are not ideological, would say that is the solution. So why, then, \ndo our colleagues on the other side of the aisle make the linchpin of \ntheir economic policy tax breaks for the wealthiest among us? It can't \nbe because it is needed to stimulate the economy. Economic statistics \nshow that very little of the dollars we give them in tax breaks will go \nto stimulate the economy. It can't be for the purpose of fairness. The \nhighest income people in America, the people who make over $1 million, \nthe people who make over $250,000, are the ones who have benefited the \nmost in the last decade while middle-class incomes have declined. It \ncan't be because they care about the deficit. Because if they did, that \nwould be a much higher priority.\n  It is hard to figure out why 42 Members on the other side of the \naisle say tax breaks for the wealthiest among us are more important \nthan any single other issue. Over the next 2 years, when they come to \nthe floor and talk about deficit reduction, they will be reminded that \nthey chose $300 billion in tax breaks for the very wealthy, not paid \nfor, increasing the deficit, over any other priority.\n  Our view is simple, those of us on this side of the aisle. Our view \nis that tax cuts should go to the middle class. The well-to-do among \nus--God bless them. They have done well, and we are proud of them. We \ndon't resent it--their huge increase should go to deficit reduction. It \nis that simple.\n  My colleagues on the other side say: Well, what about small business? \nVirtually no small businesses have incomes of less than $1 million. \nSome big businesses disguise themselves as small businesses for tax \npurposes, but no small business does. So we are not hurting small \nbusiness one job. Then they say: What about moving the economy forward? \nThe answer is very simple. Thirty cents out of every $1 we give to tax \nbreaks for people who make above $1 million goes into the \neconomy. Madam President, $1.62 goes into the economic economy. We \nrenew unemployment insurance. In the most anomalous situation of all, \nthey insist that unemployment insurance be paid for but tax breaks to \nthe wealthy not to be. It is a philosophy far out of touch with what \nAmerica needs and what average Americans believe.\n\n  The election was not a referendum on tax cuts for the millionaires. \nVery few people campaigned on it. A CBS poll shows 26 percent of \nAmericans think the Bush tax breaks ought to go to everybody, and 74 \npercent think they should not go to the millionaires.\n  One final point. We had 10 very good years in the 1990s. Middle-class \nincomes increased, the deficit was reduced. The wealthy did well under \nthe previous administration's tax policies. The Bush tax policies have \nbeen a failure. We should not repeat them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let's start with a basic fact: the \nlegislation we soon will vote on represents a tax cut for every single \nAmerican taxpayer. From the poorest to the wealthiest, every single \nAmerican taxpayer will pay less in taxes under this legislation than \nthey will pay if we do not act.\n  But prudently, given the concerns all of us profess about our fiscal \nsituation, this legislation draws a line. While every taxpayer would \nenjoy a tax cut, that cut would only apply to income under $250,000 for \nfamilies and $200,000 for individuals. This is important for two \nreasons. First, it focuses on the middle-class families that were \nstruggling to get ahead even before reckless mortgage lenders and Wall \nStreet traders drove our economy into a ditch. Second, drawing that \nline respects the need to address our fiscal situation. Extending the \ncuts for income above the $250,000 level would increase our budget \ndeficit by $818 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Let's focus on that for a moment. Just a month ago, we concluded a \npolitical campaign. During that campaign and after the votes were \ncounted, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle repeatedly \ncharacterized that election as essentially a referendum on the deficit \nand jobs. In a joint opinion column published in the Washington Post, \nRepublican leaders in the House and Senate wrote that the message from \nvoters is, ``They want us to stop the spending binge, cut the \ndeficit.''\n  So what's the first major policy position taken by our Republican \ncolleagues after that election? It is a proposal to increase the budget \ndeficit by $818 billion. They say the deficit is important to them but \napparently not so important that they would give up additional tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans in order to cut it.\n  This change of heart extends beyond the question of tax cuts and the \ndeficit. In that same opinion article, the Republican leaders say \nvoters in 2010 told us ``they want both parties to work together on \npolicies that will help create the conditions for private sector job \ngrowth.''\n  Well, here is our chance. This legislation includes an extension of \nunemployment benefits for those who have lost their jobs in this \nrecession. There is no policy option more effective in helping ``create \nthe conditions for private sector job growth'' than extending \nunemployment benefits. Doug Elmendorf, the director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, said before the Budget Committee on \nSeptember 28:\n\n       The largest effect on the economy per dollar of budgetary \n     cost would arise from a temporary increase in aid to the \n     unemployed.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       The largest effect on the economy per dollar of budgetary \n     cost would arise from a temporary increase in aid to the \n     unemployed.\n\n  Director Elmendorf isn't alone. Economist Mark Zandi told the Finance \nCommittee earlier this year:\n\n       No form of the fiscal stimulus has proved more effective \n     during the past two years than emergency UI benefits.\n\n  These economists and others, across the ideological spectrum, base \nthese judgments on empirical studies and complex statistical models. \nBut the reason what they say is true comes down to common sense. If you \nare without a job, you don't have much money not just money to spend on \nluxuries but money to spend on food and shelter for yourself and your \nfamily. So the relatively small amount of money you receive in an \nunemployment check almost certainly will go to pay for\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\nthose necessities. You have little choice but to spend it. And that \nspending helps generate economic activity. A wealthy taxpayer, by \ncontrast, has the luxury of taking the money from a tax cut and putting \nit in his or her pocket a luxury they are likely to exercise, meaning \nthat tax cut for the wealthy does little to stimulate the economy.\n  The legislation we will soon vote on includes other important \nprovisions that would fulfill the Republican leaders' self-proclaimed \ngoal of working together to stimulate job growth. It would permanently \nreduce capital gains tax rates, and permanently extend the expanded \nchild tax credit for working families. It makes relief from the \nmarriage tax penalty permanent. It makes permanent provisions that \nreduce taxes for small businesses, freeing up capital for those \nbusinesses to generate new jobs, and extends temporary provisions to \nhelp small businesses such as exclusions for small business capital \ngains and increased deductions for start-up ventures. It continues \ninitiatives to boost investment in advanced energy technologies that \nare increasing employment in my state and others. It extends the \nresearch and development tax credit. It repeals a provision of the \nAffordable Care Act that added to small business reporting \nrequirements, a provision that I would think our Republican colleagues \ncan support.\n  In short, if you say you ``want both parties to work together on \npolicies that will help create the conditions for private sector job \ngrowth,'' and if you say you want to rein in the deficit, you should \nsupport this legislation. And if you say you support more jobs and less \ndeficit, and then vote against this legislation, you are guilty, at \nbest, of a real inconsistency.\n  So I will vote in favor of the cloture motion on the Baucus \namendment. And I should add that, if Senator Baucus's amendment fails, \nI will vote in favor of Senator Schumer's amendment. If we cannot agree \nthat those making over $250,000 a year can endure a slightly higher tax \nburden at this time of great concern over deficits, surely we all can \nagree that those enjoying incomes over $1 million a year are able. We \nshould not, and I hope we would not, reject tax cuts for the vast \nmajority of middle-income Americans, and even most high-income \nAmericans, in order to pursue tax cuts for those who are least in need.\n  I urge my colleagues to support cloture so that we can get this much \nneeded tax relief to middle-class families and small businesses and \ncontribute to private sector job growth and a growing economy. It is \ntime for our Republican colleagues to back up their rhetoric with their \nvotes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, with the Bush-era tax cuts from 2001 set \nto expire at the end of the year, the whole debate about what to do \nnext needs to be based on fairness and honesty. Any additional tax \nrelief we provide now must be targeted to those who need it most like \nthose Vermont businesses looking to grow and expand their workforces \nand those Vermonters struggling to pay their bills, heat their homes, \nand put food on the table this winter. We must recognize the enormous \ncost of making these tax cuts permanent as even a short, 2-year \nextension of all tax cuts would cost us over $400,000,000,000 and the \ncost of extending tax cuts to those making more than $250,000 annually \nballoons to $700,000,000,000 over the next decade. We also must \nacknowledge that with a finite amount of Federal resources we will be \nforced to shortchange important government services for millions of \nAmericans if we provide extravagant tax cuts to a handful of \nmillionaires and large corporations.\n  Like it or not, taxes are an essential way for Federal, State, and \nlocal governments pay for important services and projects that we \naccess and use daily. Taxes pay for our schools and teachers; they \nmaintain our roads and bridges; they support our military and veterans; \nand they sustain a host of other programs from food assistance to \nunemployment benefits to and medical care that help all Americans. It \nis the responsibility of Congress to make sure that the federal tax \nrates are fair and justified. Our tax system must strike an appropriate \nbalance that allows hard-working Americans to keep much of their income \nto spend as they choose while still providing the government with \nenough revenue to pay for the important programs we rely upon.\n  Unfortunately, over the past decade the U.S. Government has \nincreasingly spent more money than it has received from taxes, causing \nour national debt to grow to unsustainable levels. Under the previous \nadministration, for instance, we saw our Federal debt triple as \nPresident Bush pushed for trillions in tax cuts and two wars without \noffering a way to pay for them. I opposed these policies because I was \nconcerned then, as I am now, that our soaring Federal debt will have \ndevastating repercussions.\n  I have serious concerns that fully extending all of the Bush-era tax \ncuts would be a major mistake if we are truly committed to helping our \neconomy recover from the Great Recession and to putting our country \nback on the glide path to fiscal responsibility. The Bush tax cuts of \n2001 and 2003 have led to record Federal deficits, contributed to the \ngovernment's current financial woes, and have not helped many Americans \nwho face the greatest financial burdens. Most disappointingly, the Bush \ntax cuts failed to ``trickle down'' to help those Americans most in \nneed, while the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans benefited \nsubstantially. Unfortunately, many of these wealthy beneficiaries of \nthe Bush tax cuts have not injected that money directly into the \neconomy to hire new workers or create new jobs. Why do we think that \nextending the income tax cuts to the top wage earners now will produce \na different result now?\n  I do think that Congress should make directed tax relief to help \nworking families and to improve the economy. For instance, there are \nsome Bush-era tax cuts that I support keeping on the books such as the \nincrease in the child tax credit, the elimination of the marriage \npenalty, and the 10-percent tax bracket. In addition, I think we should \nretain many of the hiring incentives championed by President Obama that \nare providing needed assistance to small businesses in Vermont that \nlooking to create job opportunities. These tax breaks have allowed \nVermont companies to hire new workers and purchase new equipment for \ntheir business, thus creating demand for other new jobs to produce that \nequipment.\n  But now is not the time to extend tax breaks to the wealthiest \nAmericans and to companies that are sending American jobs overseas. I \nam greatly concerned that if we maintain these policies, our soaring \nfederal debt will have devastating repercussions. We will become \nincreasingly vulnerable to the foreign nationals who are collecting our \ndebt. Our ability to provide promised Social Security and Medicare \nbenefits will be jeopardized severely. And, our children and \ngrandchildren will be left with an enormous debt that they cannot \npossibly be able to afford.\n  That is why I will support the two cloture motions we are voting on \ntoday. While I prefer capping the tax cuts at $250,000, in the spirit \nof compromise I am willing to extend the relief to those with incomes \nunder $1,000,000. These are both more fiscally responsible ways of \nmoving forward than a blanket extension for a small group of \nmillionaires. If the last election was a public outcry to restore \nfiscal sanity to Washington, then the last, major accomplishment of \nthis Congress should not be putting billions more in debt on the \nAmerican credit card.\n Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, allowing any of the Bush tax cuts \nto expire would be a dramatic failure of economic policy. These tax \ncuts, enacted during President Bush's first term in office, delivered \nmajor relief to all taxpayers. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimates \nthat tax cuts have been worth $2,200 annually for a family of four. \nThey reduced the marginal rates in every tax bracket and created a new \n10 percent marginal rate for Americans with the lowest incomes. These \nindividual tax cuts, in addition to giving people additional spending \npower, had a positive impact on small businesses. The tax cuts also \nlowered the cost of business expansion for all firms through reduced \ntax rates on dividends and long term capital gains. Unfortunately, \nlegislative procedures kept these tax cuts from being made permanent \nwhen they were created, and unless a new law prevents it, all of them \nwill expire at the end of this year. If\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\nthis happens, it will reduce Americans' spending power and the capacity \nof small businesses to grow. With our economy in the middle of a very \nfragile recovery, proposals to take more money out of the economy run \nthe risk of pushing the Nation back into recession.\n  In the meantime, the Democrat leadership of Congress insists on \nscheduling votes solely for the purpose of political messaging. For \nexample, the House voted to permanently extend the lower rates on the \nfirst $200,000 of an individual's income and the first $250,000 for \nmarried couples. In the Senate, we are scheduled to vote on two similar \nproposals drawing lines at the first $250,000 of a married couple's \nannual income and the first $1 million of a couple's income. The \npurpose of these arbitrary income lines is to create political theater. \nOnly earlier today, we understand that the Senate amendments will also \ninclude other provisions such as keeping the death tax, albeit at a \nlower rate and a higher exemption. The amendments will also include \nimportant provisions such as another patch on the alternative minimum \ntax and an extension of a variety important tax provisions which have, \nin fact, already expired because the Democrat leadership is a year \nbehind in moving the annual tax extenders package. I am simply not \ngoing to participate in political games. We have a responsibility to \noffer serious proposals. We must extend all the Bush tax cuts. The \nHeritage Foundation reports that in Oklahoma alone, no extension would \ncost over 8,000 jobs annually, decrease per household disposable income \non average by $2,800, and increase individual income taxes by $4.4 \nmillion.\n  Any vote to not extend all the Bush tax cuts is simply a tax on small \nbusiness. Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this \ncountry, and they have historically been responsible for creating more \nthan 70 percent of all new jobs. According to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, the 750,000 Americans in the highest tax bracket report \nroughly half of the $1 trillion in total net business income on their \npersonal returns. This is mainly income earned from small business \noperations. By saddling the cost of a growing government on these \nAmericans, the President is putting the survival of small firms, new \njob creation, and economic growth at risk. Small businesses are also \nparticularly vulnerable to increases in individual tax rates. Because \ntheir businesses are often structured as partnerships, their tax \nobligations pass directly to their owners, so any tax increases on a \nsmall business owner is a tax increase on the small business itself. \nWith small businesses across our nation hanging on by a thread and \nhaving difficulty finding the money they need, now is no time to raise \ntheir taxes.\n  It is frustrating that the President and Democrats in Congress \ncontinue to not hear the American people. If the President is truly \ninterested in the long term economic prosperity of the nation, he will \nbegin adopting and pursuing policies that encourage small business \ngrowth and development. Extending all the Bush tax cuts is a promising \nand necessary start. Unfortunately, until we cease this political \ntheater, we cannot seriously work to ensure the growth of our economy \nto create jobs for more Americans. I am simply not going to participate \nin political games this weekend. I will be absent from the political \nposturing votes tomorrow because I would have simply opposed them. I \ntrust that in this next week, we can get past theater and turn to \nserious proposals extending all the Bush tax cuts, ensuring that \nmiddle-class Americans are not hit with the alternative minimum tax, \nand extending the annual tax extender package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to know how much time I \nhave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes forty seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, there are a lot of issues that have \nbeen brought up in the last hour that need to be responded to. I \nprobably will not get to all of them, but I would like to start with a \nrecent one that was just stated.\n  It is not a case that tax cuts are more important than any other \nissue for those of us on this side of the aisle, not at all; growth of \nthe economy, because growing this economy is the only way we are going \nto get people employed, bringing in more revenue, and getting the \ndeficit down.\n  We are not going to get the deficit down by increasing taxes, and I \nwill explain that in just a minute. It is going to take economic \ngrowth. You have to get the economic engine started again. We have to \nget the unemployment down. It is the economy we are talking about.\n  I heard several of my colleagues this morning say if we do not go \nalong with big tax increases, we are giving a bonus to a lot of people \nin this country who maybe do not need any more money. Well, if you \naccept the idea that if Congress acts or does not act, we are giving \npeople a bonus, you are starting with a proposition that for all the \nincome people make in this country, Congress is going to decide where \nthat income ought to go and that somehow we are going to give people a \nbonus if we do not take some sort of action in the Congress. Well, that \nis ludicrous. That is the ultimate of the lack of economic freedom in \nthis country. Because every penny anybody makes, whether it is through \nthe work of their hands or their brain, is money that belongs to the \npeople of this country; otherwise, they have no economic freedom.\n  The Constitution gives the power to tax for the legitimate purposes \nof government. But it does not give us the opportunity to tax to give \nbonuses to people because the money is theirs in the first place. It is \nonly a question of how much we are going to take away from people for \nthe legitimate constitutional purposes of government.\n  Then, where do you get the idea that we are going to give a tax break \nif we do not do something in Congress? The issue is not tax breaks to \nanybody. The issue is the tax policy of the last 10 years passed in \n2001 that will sunset December 31 of this year. Should we continue that \ntax policy or should we increase taxes on some or all people? That is \nthe issue. We are not talking about a tax break for anybody. In other \nwords, there is not going to be any tax policy different than what we \nhave right now. That is what we feel is the best for the economy. We \nshould not increase taxes on anybody.\n  You get the impression from the other side that if we start taxing \ncertain people in this country more that somehow the deficit is going \nto go down. Well, I heard the President recently on some news program \ndiscussing this issue, and I do not have an exact quote, but, in \neffect, he said that as for as he is concerned, rather than not raising \ntaxes on people and bringing that money in to reduce the deficit, he \nsaid: I have better ways to spend the money.\n  I spoke earlier this morning about the fact that people do have a \nbetter way of spending the money, not only the increase in taxes that \nmight come in but even beyond that.\n  I have quoted some individuals so many times, but I brought the exact \nquotes with me now because I was paraphrasing them before. But Peter \nFerrara wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal entitled: ``Beware \nthe Balanced Budget Deal.'' He said:\n\n       Washington's traditional approach to balancing the budget \n     is to negotiate an agreement on a package of benefit cuts and \n     tax increases.\n\n  Then he went on to say:\n\n       What happens [if you do this] is the tax increases get \n     permanently adopted into law. But the spending cuts are \n     almost never fully adopted and, even if they are, they are \n     soon swept away in the next spendthrift budget. Then--because \n     taxes weaken incentives to produce--the tax increases don't \n     raise the revenue that Congress initially projected and \n     budgeted to spend. So the deficit reappears.\n\n  Then he talked about Reagan making such a deal with Democrats in the \nCongress to have $3 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases. \nThen he has this sentence:\n\n       Reagan went to his grave waiting for those spending cuts.\n\n  Then, recently, there was an article by Stephen Moore and Richard \nVedder that talks about raising taxes to reduce the deficit. There are \na few sentences I am going to read:\n\n       Instead, Congress will simply spend the money.\n\n  He uses the figures they have studied:\n\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\n\n       . . . we found that over the entire post World War II era \n     through 2009 each dollar of new tax revenue was associated \n     with $1.17 of new spending.\n\n  They refer to some other studies; that it is somewhere between $1.05 \nand $1.81.\n\n       But no matter how we configured the data and no matter what \n     variables we examined, higher tax collections never resulted \n     in less spending.\n\n  Madam President, do I have time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think it is important to lay a few \nfacts on the table.\n  The Senator from Oregon did a good job making this point clear, but I \nthink, frankly, very few people in the country understand this point, \nthis debate. To be honest, I think there are a good number of Members \nof the Senate who do not understand this point; the point being that \nunder my amendment, for those individuals who earn $200,000 or less, \ntheir tax cut is permanent. Under that amendment, it is important to \nremind all of us that every individual will get a tax break regardless \nof their income; that is, every individual who has more than $200,000 \nof taxable income will receive a cut of at least $5,400. So if you are \nabove $200,000, you still get a tax cut; you get a tax cut as an \nindividual of about $5,400; and if you are a couple, it is probably \nclose to double that. That is under my amendment.\n  The same is also true under the Schumer amendment. Under the Schumer \namendment, for those who make $1 million, their tax cut is going to be \nabout $40,000. Even though the cutoff is $1 million, those who earn \nmore than $1 million will get a tax cut. You get a tax cut under my \namendment and you get a tax cut under the Schumer amendment. The tax \ncut you will receive under my amendment is about $5,400, if you make \nover $200,000; and the tax cut you will receive under the Schumer \namendment, if you earn over $1 million, about $40,000. If you are a \ncouple, it is probably almost double that, most likely.\n  Add to that, in my amendment--and I think it is also in the Schumer \namendment--the dividends rates are lower from ordinary income to 20 \npercent. So those folks who rely on dividends are going to get an \nadditional tax break.\n  So the point I am making very clearly is, everybody gets a tax cut \nunder our amendments. It is not fair for the other side to characterize \nit that only some people are getting a tax cut. It is true those under \n$200,000 will get a bigger break on a percentage basis, but in dollar \nterms, they are going to get less of a break than those who earn \n$200,000 and above and under the Schumer amendment $1 million and \nabove.\n  The second point I wish to make is that we have to make choices. We \noften hear the expression: There is no free lunch. Nothing is free. \nLife is choices.\n  We make choices in this Senate. Sometimes the choices we make are \nquite difficult, but they are also significant.\n  I am a little bit bemused--I was bemused, and I still am bemused--\nbecause I heard the Senator from South Carolina praise the President's \ndeficit commission report, which recommends cutting the national \ndeficit through various mechanisms, revenue increases, and spending \ncuts, cutting the national debt by about $4 trillion over 8, 9 years. \nThe Senator was praising that. I say ``bemused'' because the basic view \nof the Senators on the other side is to increase the national debt by \nabout $4 trillion; that is, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nKentucky will, over the next 10 years, add $4 trillion to the deficit--\nnot subtracting $4 trillion from the deficit but adding $4 trillion to \nthe deficit, for a swing of about $8 trillion over 8, 9, 10 years. That \nis fairly important.\n  It is important because many commentators are concerned about the \ndebt we have as a country. They point out the problems Greece has, \nIreland, Portugal, and Spain. There are even articles that maybe \ncountries in Europe should break away from the euro and have a separate \ncurrency.\n  The main point is, we live in somewhat precarious times, and we have \nto not add to the deficit. The amendment I offer does add to the \ndeficit, I might say, in all candor. It adds about $2 trillion over 10 \nyears because we cut taxes in the manner in which I explained. The \nSchumer amendment adds a little bit more to the deficit. But that is \nonly about $2 trillion, $2.3 trillion, $2.4 trillion; whereas, the \nother side would like to add $4 trillion.\n  I am just saying, everybody gets a tax cut under the amendment I am \noffering, and those who make more than $200,000 get more in dollar \nterms than do people below $200,000. That is a statistical, \nmathematical fact. Again, it is about $5,400 for those whose income is \n$200,000 or above. Under the Schumer amendment, it is about $40,000 for \nthose whose income is $1 million or above; whereas, those below that \nget a tax cut as well but not as many dollars.\n  Just to remind everybody, we do have to make choices. We have to keep \nan eye on the debt. We should not increase the debt more. These various \nprovisions do a bit. Let's not increase the debt more than we have to.\n  I might add to that, too, and it is something I think we should be \nconcerned with, over the last quarter century, the top 5 percent \nwealthiest Americans received an aftertax break of about 150 percent; \nthat is, the aftertax income of the top 5 percent of the American \npeople, over the last quarter of a century, grew by about 150 percent. \nCompare that with middle-income Americans. Over the last quarter \ncentury, the aftertax income of middle-income Americans grew only 28 \npercent. So it is a huge difference.\n  So our policies cause those most wealthy to have much greater \naftertax benefits than for middle-income Americans. Add it all \ntogether, I think it makes sense. We have to have balance. We have to \nmake choices. Everybody gets a tax cut under our two amendments, and I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support the two amendments. I think it \nis not perfect, but it is a good, fair, balanced policy. It is the \nright thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I ask that all time be yielded back on both sides \nand that we proceed to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nreport.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to H.R. 4853, the Airport and \n     Airway Extension Act of 2010, with an amendment No. 4727.\n         Harry Reid, Charles E.

Madam President, I would like to tell the Senate what the \nschedule is going to be, but we can't do that unless we are able to \nhear each other.\n  The Republican leader and I had a conversation this morning, and here \nis how we are going to move forward. We are obligated to complete an \nimpeachment that Democrats and Republicans who were appointed to a \ncommittee worked very hard on, spending days and days on their own away \nfrom all the cameras, doing the tedious work that has to be done. We \nhave tried to find a place to do this that would be convenient, and \nthere is no place. So we are going to start Tuesday morning the \nimpeachment of a judge.\n  I will file cloture on a number of measures on Monday night for a \nWednesday cloture vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield on the question of the \nimpeachment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it not correct that we need Senators to be here \nTuesday morning in that regard?\n  Mr. REID. That is true. We are going to have to start early Tuesday \nmorning. We need to complete the impeachment as quickly as we can to \nmake sure everything is fair, and we will make sure that is the case. \nWe expect some work to be done on Tuesday, with votes required in the \nSenate. Most of the proceedings will be closed. We will have to be \nhere. We hope we can complete this on Wednesday. I am confident, having \nspoken to the managers, that we should be able to do that.\n  On Wednesday we hope to be able to complete the impeachment. If not, \nwe will complete it whenever we can. We will have the cloture votes on \nWednesday I have just indicated we will have. Then that leaves a pretty \nclear path to what we need to do.\n  We hope we can have some arrangements made on the tax issues by then. \nWe have tried to work to that point, and we have not yet done it. We \nhave to take care of spending for the rest of the year. I have had a \nnumber of conversations with the Republican leader on that.\n  We also hope there is time to do the START treaty, but we need to \nmove to that either with some kind of general agreement or we can just \nmove to it. That should give us ample time to do those things before we \nleave.\n  We want to leave the Friday before Christmas Eve. That would be 8 \ndays before Christmas. We hope we can do that. That is the plan. We all \nknow where we were last Christmas Eve, and we don't want to be in the \nsame place this Christmas Eve.\n  Any questions from the Republican leader?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Did the Senator also reference filing cloture on some \nitems?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I will file cloture on the 9/11 situation in New York, \nthe firefighters negotiation matter. The third would be the DREAM Act, \nand the fourth would be giving seniors a $250 COLA.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And those votes would occur on Wednesday?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. What was the fourth one?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. The fourth is the $250 COLA. Madam President, we would \ndo the votes an hour after we come in. We will try to work something \nout to do it after we complete the impeachment. The other thing I have \nindicated--in fact, we had a number of bipartisan conversations \nyesterday--is, we are trying to figure out a time to move forward on \nthe Defense authorization bill. The issue on that is what we do with \namendments.\n  Without belaboring the point, I would be happy to consider doing a \nnumber of amendments if we had time agreements on them. Just to have an \nopen process at this stage, I don't see how we can do that. I will \ncontinue to work with my friends, the chairman of the committee, and \nothers who are interested, both Democrats and Republicans, recognizing \nhow important that legislation is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, according to the strange logic of \nDemocratic leaders in Congress, the best way to show middle-class \nAmericans that they care about creating jobs is to slam some of \nAmerica's top job creators with a massive tax increase. Today's votes \nwere an affront to the millions of Americans who are struggling to find \nwork and a clear signal that Democrats in Congress still have not \ngotten the message of the November elections.\n  With unemployment over 9 percent for more consecutive months than at \nany time since World War II, the voters are looking for a different \napproach here in Washington. Two years of out-of-control spending and \nbig government policies have led to record deficits and debts, chronic \nunemployment, and deep uncertainty about our Nation's fiscal future. \nMeaningless show-votes and antibusiness rhetoric won't do anything to \nmake the situation better.\n  This Saturday's session is a total waste of the American people's \ntime. One of the votes we held today was opposed by every single \nRepublican and many Democrats. The other vote we held was a poll-tested \nplan opposed by every single Republican and the President of the United \nStates. As you can see, nothing we did today stopped the tax hikes that \nare now less than a month away. As the majority leader said this \nmorning, these theatrics need to end.\n  There is strong bipartisan opposition to these attempts to raise \ntaxes on small businesses across the country. Americans do not want \npolitical posturing; they want jobs. Today's votes are the clearest \nsignal yet that Democrats in Congress do not take our Nation's job \ncrisis seriously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. He is not the majority leader, I might add.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am sorry. Will the minority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I guess that is a no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I \nwas going to ask him how he felt about that. That is a tough place to \nstart a negotiation, which is why some of us are interested in how \nthese negotiations might be going with that as a starting point. But he \nran off the floor and did not answer that question. I am going to \ncontinue to ask it. Thank you.\n  Let me just add that I do not agree with every policy of the \nPresident. Obviously, I am in a major fight over offshore oil and gas. \nBut it is very interesting to us who have been in negotiations for \nquite some time on many important issues, how you start with saying: My \ngoal is to defeat you, but here is the package we want you to accept. \nSome of us are having a hard time with that kind of negotiation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  I was surprised to hear the minority leader suggest that today's \nsession of the Senate--a Saturday session, which I suppose is \ninconvenient but nonetheless something we ought to do to work on things \nthat are important for the American people--I was surprised to hear him \nsay it was a waste of the taxpayers' money. I will talk a little bit \nabout what I think is a waste of the taxpayers' money, but coming here, \ndoing the business, trying to reduce the Federal deficit, trying to \nmake important decisions about tax issues, is not a waste of time or \nmoney, in my judgment.\n  One of the things I find disheartening these days in the political \ndebate about these issues is the increasing tendency for one side of a \npolitical debate to create their new set of realities. They just invent \na new set of realities. Then, from that invention, they go ahead and \nmake their arguments.\n  By the way, most of the reporting then is off of that invention. It \nwould be nice if the reporting would say that is not a reality, that is \nan invention. If, for example, we said the Earth is round and there is \nsubstantial scientific evidence that the Earth is round, and the other \nside said, no, the Earth is flat, tomorrow there would be a story that \nsaid opinions differ on the shape of Earth. Of course, the facts do not \ndiffer, but that is the way these things exist these days--the creation \nof their own new reality.\n  Let me talk about what has happened with respect to the tax cuts, and \nlet me give just a bit of history because I think it is important.\n  In 2001, taxes were cut. I did not vote for it. I voted against it. \nLet me tell you why. I don't want to revisit that at great length, but \nthe proposal to cut taxes in 2001 came on the heels of the year 2000 \nwhen, for the first time in 30 years, this country had a budget \nsurplus--a budget surplus, mind you. The economists and others expected \nand projected that the surpluses would exist way into the future. For \nthe next 10 years, we would have budget surpluses, they predicted.\n  I did not believe that, but nonetheless President George W. Bush, new \nto the office, said: Well, if we are going to have budget surpluses \ngoing forward, let's make sure we give them back to the American people \nin the form of tax cuts.\n  I said: Why don't we be a bit conservative? What if we don't have \nthese surpluses? They are only projections, after all. We don't have \nthem; they are just projections by economists who, in many cases, can't \nremember their home phone number for 2 days but give us projections for \n5 and 10 years. Let's be a little conservative.\n  No, they said, we don't want to be conservative. Let's do these tax \ncuts, the bulk of which go to the wealthiest because those who \nconstruct these tax cuts always believe there is a trickle-\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\ndown effect in this country, so if you give money at the top, it will \ntrickle down and help everybody.\n  Immediately we discovered we were in a recession. Then we were hit \nwith a terrorist attack on 9/11. Then we were in a war in Afghanistan, \nthen a war in Iraq, and those wars have lasted for most of a decade. \nNot only were there no surpluses at all, no budget surpluses at all, in \nfact, there were giant budget deficits. None of the expenditures of \nthese wars were paid for, all of it was added to the debt, and the debt \nhas now ballooned to $13 trillion, with a yearly budget deficit of $1.3 \ntrillion, having now just gotten to the other side, the other plateau \non the deepest recession since the Great Depression.\n  So here is where we find ourselves. That is the history of it--tax \ncuts that were voted for by the Congress, proposed by George W. Bush, \nthen President Bush, in order to give back surpluses for the next 10 \nyears. No surpluses ever existed. Then we went to war and never paid \nfor a penny of the war. Now we end up with a deficit of $1.3 trillion a \nyear and a Federal budget debt of $13 trillion. The question is, What \ndo we do about all that? Clearly these deficits and debt threaten the \ncountry, they threaten our financial stability and solvency. I worry \nvery much that 1 day the bond traders and the currency traders might \nget an urge to say: You know what, we don't think that economy is very \nstable, and we are going to make a run on that economy--as they have \ndone. Nothing has changed in Spain from now versus 6 months ago. Yet \nonce they run against that economy, there are profound consequences and \ncould be for this country as well. I worry a great deal about that. We \nhave to get our house in order.\n  Let me talk about the debate this morning because I think most people \ndo not understand what the debate is. It is not reported very well and \nnot even described very well here.\n  The proposition is to extend the tax cuts. So the question is, For \nwhom? One proposal we voted on this morning was for single people \nearning up to $200,000 and married couples earning $250,000. But what \nis important to understand is that the proposal to extend the tax cuts \nextends to income earned by everybody. The first $250,000 earned by \nBill Gates and Warren Buffett and Donald Trump--they would get a tax \ncut on their first $250,000 of income. A lot of people don't understand \nthat. They think the proposal is, if you have over $250,000 of income, \nyou don't get a tax cut. That is not true.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I think the point the Senator is making is really \nimportant. I want to ask a question of him, through the Chair. So what \nwe just voted on, basically, that 53 Members of the Senate--that used \nto be a winning number around the Senate until this new era of we have \nto have 60 votes for motherhood and apple pie--53 Members of the Senate \nvoted to make sure everyone in America had no tax increase on their \nfirst $1 million in income. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. So it is not that we are not passing a tax cut for \neveryone, we are passing a tax cut for every person in America. We are \njust saying, maybe on that second million, we might ought to take that \n$300 billion and put it in deficit reduction. So it is not the first \nmillion, it is the second million and the third million and the fourth \nmillion and the fifth million that you would have to go back to a rate \nthat we had in the days when we had massive job creation, and these \nguys did well.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct. I voted for the $1 million. Although I \nthought it is probably good politics, I did not think that was good \npolicy either. But just to demonstrate, there is no level the minority \nwill support except all of the income for the wealthiest Americans.\n  I want to show my colleagues what we proposed; that is, these lines \nshow the amount of tax cuts that will go to all Americans under the \nproposal we offered this morning. Everyone would get a tax cut up to \nthat $250,000 of income because the rates were changed so they would \nall be changed back for everyone. That includes Bill Gates, Donald \nTrump, Warren Buffett, and everyone.\n  The average tax cut for the average American would be about $900. The \ntax cut under this proposal for those earning $1 million or more will \nbe over $6,000. So the wealthiest Americans will get six times the tax \ncut that the average American will get. That was our proposal.\n  The minority party said, well, that is not right. You cannot do six \ntimes more. We want you to do 1,000 times more for the wealthiest. So \nlet me show a chart that describes what the minority is insisting upon. \nAll of this yellow, which I just showed, would be tax cuts for every \nincome group, and this area are the proposed increases in tax cuts by \nthe minority.\n  What they have said is, for those with $1 million or more we insist \nthey get a tax cut that is 1,000 times the size of the tax cuts for the \naverage American. The average American gets a tax cut of about $900, \nand a person making $1 million, under the Republican plan, will get a \ntax cut of $104,000 a year--a year.\n  They are demanding that the wealthiest Americans get a tax cut that \nis 1,000 times the size of the average American. Why? Because we \nbelieve tax cuts should go all of the way across the board on the first \n$250,000 for everybody. All the way across on all incomes, for \neverybody, up to $250,000.\n  The minority says that is not enough. We want that tax cut to go all \nthe way up to every dollar of income to the wealthiest Americans. That \nis unbelievable to me. We are $13 trillion in debt. We are at war. We \nhave a $1.3 trillion annual budget deficit, and they are demanding that \nwe give $104,000 a year in tax breaks to people who make a $1 million a \nyear? That is unbelievable.\n  They say, by the way, well, this is all about small business. Again, \nthat is creating a new reality that is simply not accurate. I want to \nshow you what has happened to the Federal debt. This line looks like \nthe upslope on a roller coaster, a very steep, one by the way, $13 \ntrillion in debt. This shows 1995 to today.\n  Most people think this is urgent. This is a real serious problem. If \nthat is the case, what are we doing talking about giving tax cuts of \n$100,000 apiece to people who make $1 million a year?\n  The other point about this is all of the tax cuts that would be \noffered come from money that is borrowed. By the way, the projections \nby the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget \nOffice about what the deficits are going to be, those projections \nassume there are no extensions of any tax cuts--none, zero.\n  So anything that is extended increases the Federal budget deficit and \ndebt. So the proposition is, if we are going to provide tax cuts as the \nminority insists for all of the incomes of the wealthiest Americans, \nwhat they are saying is, let's borrow another $1 trillion, put it on \ntop of the debt, in order for us to provide tax cuts to the wealthiest \nAmericans.\n  Again, it is preposterous. Let me use this chart to see if maybe \ncommonsense travels over the decades. Will Rogers once said during a \nsignificant economic downturn:\n\n       The unemployed here ain't eating regular. But we'll get \n     around to them as soon as everybody else gets fixed up okay.\n\n  ``The unemployed around here ain't eating regular.'' Will Rogers \nsays: But we will get around to them as soon as everybody else is fixed \nup.\n  Well, you know, there are 2 million people a couple of days ago who \nlost their unemployment benefits, 2 million people. The other day I \ncame to the Senate floor and talked about Smith Barney versus Barney \nSmith.\n  There is a Barney Smith from Marion, Indiana who talked about losing \nhis job because his plant closed and his job went to China. Not \nunusual. Five million manufacturing workers have lost their jobs.\n  Barney Smith asked the question about this Congress. Is the Congress \nwilling to care as much about Barney Smith as it is about Smith Barney? \nBarney Smith from Indiana or Smith Barney from Wall Street? The answer \nis pretty evident these days. This fight today is about that kind of \ndistinction.\n  Who do you stand for? Who are you fighting for? Who are you standing \nwith? Is it because you believe this country only works if you put a \nlot of money in at the top and it will trickle\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\ndown to everybody? I have never believed that worked. I believe if you \ngive the American working family something to work with, the percolate-\nup theory, give the American family something to work with, and that \nAmerican engine will do just fine.\n  Let me just make the case that--I do not mean this in a partisan \nway--but I think it is important to say these tax cuts, since they were \nproposed in 2001, and the run-up in the deficit that came with it and \nthe creation of a sick economy, it is the lowest average annual \npercentage increase in job creation of any President since the 1940s, \ntalking about the Bush Presidency. He proposed very large tax cuts, the \nbulk of which goes to the wealthiest Americans, and the result is the \nlowest average annual percentage increase in job creation of any \nPresident since the 1940s.\n  I did vote in 1993--that is a long time ago--for the economic policy \nchanges proposed in the Clinton administration. Those were tough votes \nand controversial votes. And, yes, they increased some taxes and \nincreased some spending. You know what. In the coming years, during the \n8 years of that administration, as a result, in my judgment, of a \nchange in economic policy, we had 23.1 million new jobs created, 23.1 \nmillion new jobs.\n  Real median household income grew 14 percent. GDP growth averaged \n3\\1/2\\ percent. So it does not wash to say we have to follow the same \neconomic policy that was followed in the last decade, giving tax cuts \nto the wealthiest and then just praying that somehow it will all \ntrickle down to help everybody. This country is in some significant \ntrouble.\n  This country and the people in this country deserve and expect \nthoughtful, serious, tough decisions by this Congress. David Stockman, \nformer Director of OMB in the Reagan administration, was on television \na while back, and he said:\n\n       If there were such a thing as Chapter 11 for politicians, \n     the Republican's push to extend the unaffordable Bush tax \n     cuts would amount to a bankruptcy filing.\n\n  Well, let me say again. I am not someone who comes here talking about \nRepublicans and Democrats very often. I do not think either political \nparty is a great bargain for the American people, at least in recent \ntimes. We need to understand it is important to get the best of what \nboth parties have to offer rather than the worst of each. We need to \ncome to together to decide we serve the same interest; that is, the \nlong-term best interests of this country to put the country back on \ntrack.\n  But I cannot any longer watch people invent a reality in order to \nsupport a kind of proposal that is going to weaken this country and \nincrease the Federal indebtedness of this country. It simply makes no \nsense. I had originally tried to see if I could, because there needs to \nbe some reality, I tried to put a chart together. The problem is, it is \ntoo tall. So I taped it. But this chart shows, in reality, the 1,000 \ntimes there were tax cuts for millionaires and above versus the average \ntax cuts for the American people.\n\n  This shows the tax cuts that go to everybody under the plan that we \noffered this morning. Everybody, including the wealthiest Americans \nwill get a tax cut on their income up to $250,000 if they are married. \nThe Republicans have said--which these red lines represent, that is not \nenough. We want this not just to go all the way across, we demand it \ngoes all the way up.\n  Well, we are lucky it does not reach the ceiling because we are \ntalking about massive amounts of money to be borrowed in order to \nprovide tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. I wish this would fit on \na smaller chart, but the absurdity of it is demonstrated by the kind of \ntax cuts they are demanding for the wealthiest Americans.\n  Now, finally, let me say--I know others want to speak. Let me say \nthis: Historians are going to look back at this time, this moment, this \nCongress. In 100 years, when we are all dead, historians will evaluate \nwhat we did here. What did we do? They are going to be very troubled \nand very concerned to try to figure out what on Earth were we \nthinking--at war, deep in debt, and doing tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans. They are going to wonder, what on earth were they thinking?\n  A friend of mine once asked the question: If you were to be given an \nassignment to write an obituary for someone you had never met, and the \nonly information you had about this person now deceased was a check \nregister, and from that you needed to write an obituary, what would you \nwrite?\n  That question could be asked about this country. What would \nhistorians write about this country having only the Federal budget to \nevaluate about our value system? Who did we stand for? Did we stand for \n2 million people who are out of work? Two million times someone came \nhome and had to say to their loved one: Honey, I have lost my job. No, \nit was not because I did a bad job. My job has gone to China. I was \ntold that the company is contracting. I have lost my job. Two million \ntimes. Out of a job, out of work, out of hope, out of a home.\n  Then we are told, well, that is not the priority. Let's not help \nthem, let's not extend unemployment benefits, which we have always done \nduring a significant economic downturn. Instead, let's see if we can \nprovide more comfort to those who are the wealthiest Americans by \nproviding them tax cuts that are 1,000 times the size of the tax cut \nthat the average family will get when they open their mail and finally \nget their tax break.\n  I mean, I do not understand that at all. That is not in keeping with \nwhat I understand our obligations to be to this country, No. 1, to \nborrow $1 trillion. That is $750 billion plus the interest, borrow it, \nprincipally from China, increase the debt, and then say, well, how are \nwe going to use it?\n  Well, what we are going to do is use it to give to the wealthiest \nAmericans. By the way, this altered state of reality, which the other \nside uses in every debate these days--this altered state of reality is \nto say, this is about small business. That is fundamentally untrue and \nthey know it. But it does not matter to them because they know it will \nget reported as they are helping small business.\n  They are not. They are not helping this country. They are not helping \nsmall business. In my judgment, I wish they would understand the need \nto work with us for the common destiny and common purpose of this \ncountry's long-term economic health.\n  I will conclude by saying, I was disappointed this morning to see \nwhat happened. But I knew it was going to happen because there is \nprecious little opportunity in this Chamber for people to take a \nserious, sober look at these issues and decide what is best for the \ncountry. I think the American people deserve better, expect better, and \nI hope they get better in the coming days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to say to Senator Dorgan how much I \nappreciated his comments, how he brings us back to the central question \nof why we are here and whom we are fighting for. I will miss him, and I \nwish him well. He is a person who gets to the heart of it.\n  It is key for the American people who are watching this debate today \nto understand one basic fact. Because of their concern for one-tenth of \n1 percent of those Americans earning over $1 million a year, the \nRepublicans stopped a tax cut for everyone else.\n  I need to repeat that. Because of their concern for those 315,000, \nout of 307 million Americans, who earn over $1 million a year, the \nRepublicans, to a person, stopped a tax cut for 99.9 percent of the \nAmerican people. I cannot tell my colleagues how bizarre that is to me. \nNot only did they block tax cuts for everyone except for that one-tenth \nof 1 percent, they also turned their backs on the unemployed, 2 million \nof whom have lost their benefits or are about to lose their \nunemployment benefits. In my State of California, 400,000 people are \nlosing those benefits. They also blocked other important tax-cut \nextensions which I don't have the time to address.\n  When we block an unemployment insurance extension which gives people \nabout $300 a week to survive and keep their homes together, if they are \nactively looking for work and if they paid into the unemployment \ninsurance system--those are the people we are helping--when that is \nblocked, we hurt not only their families, but we hurt the economy. \nBecause it is very clear, from respected economists on both sides of\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\nthe aisle, that unemployment benefits are a big fiscal stimulus. In \nfact, for every $1 we give someone, it turns into $1.61 back into the \neconomy. Why? Because people spend the moneys in their communities, and \nthe trickle-down effect works. When we give a tax break to the top \npeople who are earning $10 million a year, they don't run down to the \ncorner store with it. They put it in a trust fund for their kids. \nClearly, either the Republicans don't understand what an economic \nstimulus is or they don't care. They certainly say they care about the \ndeficit. But from the bottom of my heart, I ask: How could they care \nabout the deficit when they say they want to give tax breaks to the \nwealthiest and not pay for them? Those tax breaks go on the backs of \nour kids and grandkids. It is unbelievable.\n  The Republicans in this body today showed whose side they are on. It \nis clear. We had two proposals. One said, for the first $250,000 of \nincome, the tax break will continue. We got 53 votes. By the way, as \nSenator McCaskill so noted, it used to be the majority ruled around \nhere. They filibustered. They said: You guys have to get 60 votes for \nthat. We got 53. We got a majority, not enough. That went down.\n  We said: OK. We know there was an election. We will go up to $1 \nmillion. We will meet you at the corner.\n  Let's shake hands.\n  No, that wasn't enough. They want to fight for people who earn over \n$1 million a year.\n  I wish everyone success. We all want to be very successful in life. \nSo there isn't anything wrong with what I am about to say. But if you \nearn $10 million a year, the Republicans want to give you an additional \n$450,000 every year in a tax break, and they don't want to pay for it. \nWhat is interesting is, last month 90 millionaires wrote us a letter, \nand they talked about how they felt about giving these tax breaks to \npeople earning over $1 million a year. Here is what they said:\n\n       For the fiscal health of our nation and the well-being of \n     our fellow citizens, we ask that you allow tax cuts on \n     incomes over $1,000,000 to expire at the end of this year as \n     scheduled.\n       We make this request as loyal citizens who now or in the \n     past earned an income of $1,000,000 per year or more.\n       We have done very well over the last several years. Now, \n     during our nation's moment of need, we are eager to do our \n     fair share. We don't need more tax cuts, and we understand \n     that cutting our taxes will increase the deficit and the debt \n     burden carried by other taxpayers. The country needs to meet \n     its fiscal obligations in a just and responsible way.\n       Letting tax cuts for incomes over $1,000,000 expire is an \n     important step in this direction.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: we are writing to urge you to stand \n     firm against those who would put politics ahead of their \n     country.\n       For the fiscal health of our nation and the well-being of \n     our fellow citizens, we ask that you allow tax cuts on \n     incomes over $1,000,000 to expire at the end of this year as \n     scheduled.\n       We make this request as loyal citizens who now or in the \n     past earned an income of $1,000,000 per year or more.\n       We have done very well over the last several years. Now, \n     during our nation's moment of need, we are eager to do our \n     fair share. We don't need more tax cuts, and we understand \n     that cutting our taxes will increase the deficit and the debt \n     burden carried by other taxpayers. The country needs to meet \n     its financial obligations in a just and responsible way.\n       Letting tax cuts for incomes over $1,000,000 expire, is an \n     important step in that direction.\n           Sincerely,\n         Cynda Collins Arsenault, Superior, CO; Lawrence B. \n           Benenson, New York, NY; Daniel Berger, Philadelphia, \n           PA; Nancy Blachman, Burlingame, CA; Brady Brim-\n           Deforest, Los Angeles, CA; Robert S.

The letter hits on a key point. If we are serious about \ndeficit reduction, then don't come to the floor and fight for the \nwealthiest Americans, many of whom say they are doing fine. If we are \ngoing to do it, tell us how you are going to pay for it.\n  No, the rhetoric is: We are hurting the economy when we are helping \n99.9 percent of Americans. We are hurting the economy when we talk \nabout fiscal responsibility. We are hurting the economy. We are hurting \nsmall business.\n  Let's be clear. As far as we can tell, not one small business over $1 \nmillion would be impacted. I know my friend in the chair is very \nconcerned about small business because we talked about it and he \nstudied this. He says, if we go up to 1 million, they are covered. So \nall their rhetoric is nonsense. We couldn't get one vote--not one. They \nvoted not to reduce the deficit. They voted not to help 99.9 percent of \nthe American people because of their deep, deep, deep worry and concern \nabout people who earn over $1 million a year. They don't care about \ndeficits, and they don't care about most of the people.\n  I don't know what else to say. That is the vote we had.\n  They say: We are going to come up with some grand compromise.\n  Maybe. But I have lived for quite a while, and I can tell my \ncolleagues, whenever I travel, when I go to the airport, if I have a \nflight but another flight is leaving, I jump on that first plane \nbecause you don't know how long you will be stuck.\n  We have this in our hand, tax cuts for 99.9 percent of the American \npeople, and they say: We will negotiate and come up with something. \nMaybe they will; maybe they won't. All I know is, the record will \nreflect they voted no today when they could have helped all those \npeople.\n  I will close by talking about juxtaposing whom they fight for versus \nwho needs us to fight for them. I am going to read a couple stories \nfrom people in my State. Yesterday, I read about Laura from Long Beach. \nToday, I am going to read some other stories. I will not use last \nnames. This is PJ from Palm Springs:\n\n       My husband suffered a brain injury 2 years ago. He is on \n     permanent disability. I lost my job as a paralegal in \n     January. My benefits end this month. I have no way to pay our \n     medical insurance. I will lose my house. I am trying to find \n     a way to keep from becoming homeless with a disabled husband \n     who is in constant need of medical care and 24/7 personal \n     care. Please extend unemployment insurance.\n\n  Adam from Santa Rosa:\n\n       I am a 25-year-old lifelong California resident. I \n     graduated from California State University. I found a good \n     job in the science\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\n     field. I was laid off 2 years later due to the poor economic \n     climate and forced to get unemployment insurance. I have been \n     desperately seeking work but to no avail, and my benefits \n     have run out. I am currently the sole provider for my wife, \n     two children and myself. And despite all of my efforts to \n     find work, no opportunities have presented themselves. I am \n     having trouble sleeping because I am so nervous about what \n     will happen if we are left stranded without any source of \n     income as we do not have much savings, and rent and living is \n     expensive. I fear other citizens are in the same boat. So I \n     am writing on my family's behalf as well as theirs in the \n     hope that some further UI benefits could be made available \n     for those families who are still suffering from unemployment \n     and need the assistance.\n\n  Tammie from Los Banos:\n\n       My husband worked non-stop for 33 years. In 2009 his job \n     was outsourced to Singapore.\n\n  By the way, while we are talking about tax breaks, our side wants to \nend tax breaks to companies who ship jobs overseas. That side, my \nRepublican friends--and this was a big issue in my campaign--want to \nkeep those breaks going. Listen to Tammmie from Los Banos. Her husband \nworked nonstop for 33 years.\n\n       He hasn't had any luck finding a job in California. Since \n     his layoff, we have lost our home. We have sold off almost \n     everything of value we have worked so hard for in our 32 \n     years of marriage. Now he is on extended unemployment and \n     that may be discontinued in December.\n\n  Of course, right now it has been discontinued because our friends \ndon't care about it one whit. We tried three, four, five, six, seven \ntimes to try and get them to go along with us on continuing this \nunemployment. By the way, not beyond 99 weeks, up to 99 weeks. We can't \nget their support.\n  She writes:\n\n       He is on extended unemployment and that may be discontinued \n     in December during the holidays when this country needs to \n     strengthen the economy not destroy it. We will have nowhere \n     to live; I will lose my car that takes me 200 miles per day \n     to my job. Please do not let this happen.\n\n  This goes on and on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Tracie from Fresno:\n\n       In July last year I lost my job. I am a single parent of \n     two children. At first I made cuts by not eating out or \n     spending money on things we didn't really need. Then I had to \n     give up my car versus being homeless. Now we take the city \n     bus to school in the morning and back home in the afternoon. \n     I look for work daily. I am a college graduate and have \n     worked for 20 years. I need the unemployment extension to \n     keep a roof over our heads and to feed my children. It is a \n     scary situation to not know if your life will be tossed \n     upside down at the hands of people that do not even know who \n     you are.\n\n  Tracie, we know who you are. I am painfully aware of who you are and \npainfully aware that my colleagues on the other side, who say they \ncare, didn't vote to help Tracie.\n  Again, if ever there was a time to focus on the differences between \nthe parties, it is now. Whom are we fighting for? Today it is clear. \nOur Republican friends, to a person--it pains me to say--stopped a tax \ncut for 99.9 percent of the American people, and they stopped the \nextension of unemployment benefits for people such as Tracie--good, \nhard-working, patriotic Americans, many of whose families served in the \nmilitary.\n  I hope for better days in this holiday season. We are not going to \ngive up. We are going to stand and fight. We are going to stay here. \nBut today was not a good day for 99.9 percent of the American people. I \nwant them to know why. I hope, in this little time I have had, I have \nexplained it so they do get it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I must compliment both my colleagues, \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Boxer, for calmly laying out the issue. \nFrankly, I feel a little bit like I am in the Twilight Zone. I \ncertainly paid attention to the results in November. Anybody who is in \nthis building paid attention to the results in November. Somehow the \nRepublican Party thinks what happened the first Tuesday in November is \nthat the American people wanted them to raise taxes on 99.9 percent of \nAmericans in order to make sure the tiniest little sliver at the top \ngets a deficit-busting, China-borrowing, print-more-money tax bonus? I \ndo not think that is what the people were saying.\n  It is beyond comprehension that these folks have talked about deficit \nreduction. Oh, ``deficit reduction''--how many speeches have we \nlistened to--``our grandchildren.'' I have listened to Dr. Coburn and I \nhave listened to Senator DeMint and I have listened to so many \nRepublicans talk about deficit reduction, deficit reduction, deficit \nreduction, and the tiny little fig leaf they are hiding behind is the \ncomplete fallacy that a small differential in personal tax rates to \npeople on their second million dollars of income is going to create \njobs. It is not going to create jobs.\n  The people who are making more than $1 million are not going to take \na 3-percent personal tax cut differential and create jobs. The job \ncreation occurs with small businesses. It occurs with people in the \nmiddle class. It does not occur when someone has another $100,000 to \nput in their investment fund or another $300,000 to put in their \ninvestment fund.\n  I think people need to understand that 53 Senators voted to give a \ntax cut to everyone--everyone, we do not care how rich you are--because \nyou get a tax cut on your first $1 million of income. So even if you \nmake $3 million, you are getting the tax cut. If you make $5 million, \nyou are getting the tax cut. If you make $10 million, you are getting \nthe tax cut. You are getting it on the first $1 million.\n  So everyone in America was denied a tax cut, by the vote that just \noccurred, by the minority of the Senate, not the majority. The majority \nof the Senators who were elected to come here voted to give 99.9 \npercent of America a tax cut and thinks maybe that other $300 billion \nwill be saved on that little 0.1 percent of America. That $300 billion, \nthat would be a good thing to put against the deficit. It would be a \ngreat thing to put against the deficit.\n  So do not take these guys seriously about deficit reduction. Do not \ntake them seriously. It is a joke. Some of these people who voted no \njust now did not even vote for the Bush tax cuts. Some of the people \nwho just voted no on giving a tax cut to 99.9 percent--in fact, to give \na tax cut to everybody in America on their first $1 million--some of \nthe people who voted no did not even vote for the Bush tax cuts. They \nknew they were irresponsible at the time. But now they have somehow \ntried to convince the American people they are looking after them.\n  As I said yesterday, I tell you who they are looking after. They are \nlooking after the families who are deciding which home to go to for \nChristmas: Should I go to my home in Florida or my home in California \nor maybe up in the mountains or should I stay in the city or the people \nwho are deciding: Where should we spend New Year's Eve? Should we go to \nParis? Maybe we should go to Rome for New Year's Eve. They are not \nfocused on the folks who are trying to figure out if they can get what \ntheir kids want for Christmas.\n  And 53 votes--if you think about that, there was a time in the Senate \nthat all kinds of things--in fact, my recollection is that is the exact \nnumber of votes Clarence Thomas got to join the Supreme Court. Can you \nimagine in this day and age a controversial Supreme Court nominee not \nhaving to get 60 votes? Clarence Thomas got the same number of votes as \nwe just cast to make sure everybody in America gets a tax cut on their \nfirst $1 million in income.\n  I come from a State where elections are very close and, in fact, I \nremember when I passed my first amendment on the floor of the Senate. \nThe vote was 51 to 49. It seems amazing to me now. That was just a few \nshort years ago that we had votes that were 51 to 49. They were not \nrequiring 60 votes. That was back before motherhood and apple pie \nneeded 60 votes. One of the Senators came over to me after that \namendment vote--it was 51 to 49--and they said: Boy--they were teasing \nme about how close the vote was. I said: Senator, in Missouri we call \nthat a landslide.\n  This vote we just had--53 votes--in Missouri is a landslide. It is \ndepressing to me that we have gotten to this level of posturing, that \nthey are saying: If you do not give people a tax break on their second \nmillion, nobody gets one.\n  I am going to say it again: If you don't give people a tax break on \ntheir second million, nobody gets one.\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\n  Really? Are they going to hold on to that position? Deep down in my \ngut I cannot believe they are going to do that, that they are going to \ngo home and explain to their voters: Yes, well, you don't get a tax cut \nbecause this guy I know on Wall Street who makes $15 million in his \nbonus this year didn't want to have to pay the same rate he paid in the \n1990s when everybody cut a fat hog and did very well. We created \nmillions and millions of jobs in the 1990s with these same tax rates.\n  It is not like we are going back to the Roosevelt era of taxes. We \nare not going back to 75 percent of your income going to taxes. We are \ntalking about a 3-percent difference for people who make more than $1 \nmillion.\n  So I hope this gets through to the American people, and I hope they \nrealize this is not what this election was about. This election was \nabout holding down government spending, and my colleagues and I agree. \nI have been working on trying to get a cap on Federal spending with \nSenator Sessions for over a year. It is about tightening our belt on \nspending. But it is also about having a level playing field for the \nmiddle class in this country and not making it about the special \ninterests that have jammed this Tax Code with so many provisions.\n  Most people do not realize that over 70 percent of Americans do not \neven itemize. So imagine how many tax provisions have been written for \nthe wealthy. We have books and books of tax loopholes for the wealthy. \nAs Warren Buffett has said--he does this great exercise every year in \nhis office, which I think is fascinating. He has everyone who works in \nhis office--from the people who clean the boardroom, to the people who \npark the cars in the parking lot--they calculate all the taxes they pay \nevery year and figure out everything from sales tax, personal property \ntax, Federal tax, State tax--earnings tax in some localities--they \ncalculate all of it and figure out what their real tax rate is. He said \nthe folks who work for him who have very modest incomes, pay, I think \nit is 33 percent, 34 percent of their income in taxes, and he pays 16 \npercent.\n  Now, what is wrong with this picture? Listen, I have nothing against \npeople who have captured the American dream. My husband is one of them. \nHis first job out of college was in a steel mill. Since then he has \ntaken huge risk as an entrepreneur, huge risk, and he has created \nthousands of jobs--thousands of jobs--in his lifetime, and he has done \nvery well. We are very blessed. Does he need this tax cut? No. Do we \nneed it? No, we do not. I think the people who are in that tax bracket \nhave a great deal in common with my family, those who are worried about \ngoing back to the 1990s tax rate on their second million and their \nthird million and their fourth million.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/04/senate-section/article/S8535-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8535-S8536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REQUIRING REPORTS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I also rise today to talk about a \nsubject that is, frankly, as depressing--in fact, more depressing--than \nthe reality we just faced this morning on the floor; that is, the \nheartbreaking incompetence that has been uncovered at Arlington \nNational Cemetery.\n  This is, in my opinion, the most sacred ground we have in this \ncountry. This is where our highest ideal of an American is laid to \nrest. The ceremonies that take place every day, day in and day out, at \nArlington National Cemetery are a great source of national pride. For \nthe thousands of families who have loved ones buried there, they \ndeserve to know that location is being run with the highest level of \nintegrity and professionalism.\n  In July of this year, my subcommittee on contracting discovered they \nhave to be bitterly disappointed because due to contracting problems, \nyou cannot be assured that people are buried where Arlington National \nCemetery tells you they are buried; that even though we spent millions \nof dollars on contracts to make sure the system was reliable in terms \nof the location of the burial of these heroes, the contracts have \nproduced nothing. In fact, the discovery was made that there were many \ninstances where what it said on the tombstone was not true.\n  We began working and the hearing was mind-boggling because there was \nso much finger pointing--``not my fault,'' ``not my fault,'' ``not my \nfault''--discovering there was no real chain of command at Arlington \nNational Cemetery. Unlike the rest of the military and the rest of the \nArmy, it was not clear who the people at Arlington even reported to. \nThat is the management incompetence that breeds all kinds of nonsense, \nwhen there is no accountability. And there was no accountability.\n  So I think the Army has taken this seriously. They clearly are \nembarrassed, as they should be. They are working to methodically go \nthrough the cemetery and make sure they find any instance where there \nis a discrepancy in terms of the burials. Just a few weeks ago, we \nlearned that they now discovered another grave site where eight urns of \ncremated remains were located. The tombstone was marked ``Unknown.''\n  Now, can you imagine there is actually someone who went back eight \ntimes to the same location to dump cremated remains in one grave?\n  We have been able to identify some of those remains, and those \nfamilies have been notified and they will have the proper burial. They \nwill know the location. Unfortunately, one of the sets of remains we \ncannot identify. It has been reburied ``Unknown.''\n  But as we methodically go through the cemetery and try to correct \nthese instances of heartbreaking incompetence, we have to have some \nlegislation in place that provides the right accountability and \noversight. I had introduced a piece of legislation along with my \nranking Republican on the Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight, \nSenator Brown of Massachusetts, and we have tried to work this through \nthe process, which everyone around here knows is painfully slow, and \neven more painfully slow over the last 18 months since the Republican \nParty has been rewarded for their strategy of block everything, \nincluding things they support.\n  I am encouraged that it is my understanding that after I came to the \nSenate floor yesterday and said I was going to make a unanimous consent \nmotion, not only have the Democrats all cleared this legislation but \nthe Republicans have also. I think that is a good sign. I wish we had \nmore good signs. But this at least is a good sign.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans Affairs' \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 3860 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3860) to require reports on the management of \n     Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nMcCaskill amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am proud we have been able to get \nthis passed today. This is a giant Christmas present with a bow on it \nor a Hanukkah gift with a bow on it to thousands of American families, \nto let them know we are paying attention. We have very short attention \nspans around here. When the cameras aren't rolling, we have a tendency \nto move on to something else. We are always kind of gravitating toward \nthe political fight.\n  This legislation should send the appropriate signal to our Nation's \nmilitary, to our Nation's veterans and, most importantly, to the \nfamilies who have loved ones buried at Arlington National Cemetery that \nwe are paying attention and that we are going to continue to pay \nattention until we get this right. Our American pride depends on it. It \nis the ultimate act of patriotism. So I am proud of the fact that we \nhave been able to get this legislation passed today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/04/senate-section/article/S8536-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     PRONUNCIATION OF ``ARKANSAS''\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I wish to share an interesting \npiece of Arkansas history with my colleagues and the American people. \nOver the last few centuries, the origin and pronunciation of \n``Arkansas'' has been shrouded in a bit of mystery, with many \nmispronunciations. So to correct any future mistakes before they are \nmade, I submit the following resolution on the proper pronunciation of \n``Arkansas.'' After a study by the Arkansas Historical Society and the \nEclectic Society of Little Rock, the resolution was introduced and \npassed by the Arkansas General Assembly in 1881. The resolution was \nincluded in an article edited by Margaret Ross that ran in the Arkansas \nGazette on December 4, 1960, and reads as follows:\n\n       Whereas, Confusion of practice has arisen in the \n     pronunciation of the name of our State; and it is deemed \n     important that the true pronunciation should be determined \n     for use in oral official proceedings.\n       And Whereas, The matter has been thoroughly investigated by \n     the State Historical Society, and the Eclectic Society of \n     Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct \n     pronunciation, as derived from history, and the early usage \n     of the American immigrants.\n       Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General \n     Assembly, That the only true pronunciation of the name of the \n     State, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the \n     French from the native Indians, and committed to writing in \n     the French word representing the sound; and that it should be \n     pronounced in three syllables with the final `s' silent, the \n     `a' in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent \n     on the first and last syllables--being the pronunciation \n     formerly, universally, and now still most commonly used; and \n     that the pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable \n     with the sound of `a' in `man', and the sounding of the \n     terminal `s', is an innovation to be discouraged.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues have found this small piece of \nArkansas history as enlightening as I did, and I would hope that any \nfuture mispronunciations of ``Arkansas'' be ``an innovation to be \ndiscouraged.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/04/senate-section/article/S8536-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8536-S8537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n               Enrolled Bills and Joint Resolution Signed\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2009, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on December 3, 2010, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills and \njoint resolution:\n\n       S. 2847.
