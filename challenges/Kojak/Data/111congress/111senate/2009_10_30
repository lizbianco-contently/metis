Mr. President, following leader remarks, there will be a \nperiod of morning business. We have no set time on it this morning, \nalthough Senators will be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each \nduring the pendency of that morning business. There will be no rollcall \nvotes today. The next rollcall vote will occur at 5 p.m. on Monday, \nNovember 2. The vote will be on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nsubstitute to amendment H.R. 3548, the Unemployment Benefits Extension \nAct, which has attached to it the very important extension of the \nfirst-time home buyers tax credit, which has been modified to allow \npeople other than first-time home buyers to now buy homes.\n  In addition to that, there is an extremely important provision to \nhelp the economy, the loss carryback, and we hope to complete that as \nsoon as possible. If, in fact, cloture is invoked Monday night, that \nwould be done quickly. The House said they would accept that, and that \ncould be done as early as Tuesday and signed by the President, which \nwould be a great relief to realtors all over the country. It would be \nimportant for banks, especially community banks, so that they would be \nin a position to start helping small businesses more as a result of the \nlegislation that is attached to that, the loss carryback. If, in fact, \nthe Republicans are going to keep stalling, then we won't be able to do \nthat until probably sometime Tuesday night.\n  Each day that goes by is critical. We have a million people--1 \nmillion people--who are eligible for this; 7,000 new people every day, \n49,000 a week. We have been stalled for 3 weeks with this, meaning \n150,000 people have lost their benefits during the time the Republicans \nhave stalled this very important piece of legislation. It is \nlegislation that is paid for. It doesn't increase the debt. It allows \npeople who have been unemployed for long periods of time to continue \nreceiving unemployment benefits. It is stunning to me to understand how \nthe Republicans can hold this up, but they have. I hope that stops on \nMonday night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/30/senate-section/article/S10945-7", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10945-S10946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 NEVADA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the story of Nevada is the story of America, \nreally. We became a State on October 31, 1864,\n\n[[Page S10946]]\n\nthe 36th State to join the Union. As America has grown and grown up, so \nhas my State in many different ways. America isn't the only one that \nhas grown up; so has the State of Nevada. As America has changed, \nNevada has evolved just as dramatically. Lands that were once frontier \nare now cities on the front lines of technology and industry. Where our \nland was once dominated by homesteads, it is now dotted by energy-\nefficient homes.\n  In these 145 years since the birthday of Nevada, which will be \ncelebrated this Saturday, we have come a long way. But one thing has \nnot changed since that Halloween in 1864: Forward-thinking Americans \nare still coming westward, calling Nevada home, and many of them are \ncoming eastward from California, where we get a lot of new residents.\n  The State of Nevada was joined to the Union at the height of the \nCivil War. Just as Congress was voting on the 13th amendment that would \nabolish slavery, ``Battle Born''--which is our motto--``Battle Born'' \nNevadans continued to fight for equality, freedom, and progress, \nincluding nearly 1,000 Nevadans who today serve bravely in our Nation's \nArmed Forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, around the globe, and here at home.\n  The day before yesterday, I called the mother of three children who \nhad lost her husband in Afghanistan. I see in the morning news coming \nout of Nevada that I am going to have that same responsibility later \ntoday when I call the family of Josue Hernandez Chavez, who was killed \nyesterday in Afghanistan. He is from Reno, NV, just like the soldier's \nfamily I called the day before yesterday was from Reno. These two men \ndied following a long, strong tradition of soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines who have defended America in both war and peace.\n  Nevada is honored to be the home of some of our most important and \npremier military installations in the world, and certainly in the \nUnited States, including Nellis Air Force Base, Creech Air Force Base, \nNaval Air Station Fallon, which is the home of Top Gun, and the \nHawthorne Army Depot, as well as many National Guard armories and \nReserve readiness centers.\n  Outside of Nevada, much attention is paid, of course, to the \nentertainment capital of the world, Las Vegas. That attention is \ndeserved, as Las Vegas has built itself from a desert outpost to the \nentertainment capital of the world as well as the city on the vanguard \nof the clean energy revolution. But every corner of the State is \nplaying a critical role in leading our Nation toward energy \nindependence. It is a revolution fueled by Nevada's boundless \ninnovative spirit and its unlimited natural resources.\n  Indeed, Nevada is an outdoor enthusiast's dream. A lot of people \nthink of Nevada as a desert, but it is not. We are the most mountainous \nState in the Union, except for Alaska. We have more than 300 mountain \nranges. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. We have one \nmountain about 14,000 feet high. We have some of the most beautiful \nwilderness areas in all of the Nation, Alpine Meadows, mountain sheep. \nA lot of places don't have--we have mountain goats in Nevada; Sheldon \nAntelope Range set forward by Theodore Roosevelt, the most sparsely \npopulated area in all of the United States except for Alaska; and, as \nMark Twain said, Lake Tahoe, the fairest place the whole Earth affords. \nIt is a beautiful lake shared by California. There is only one other \nlake like it in the world, and that is in Russia, Lake Baikal. It is a \nbeautiful lake. It is really the gem of the Sierras. So from its \nsnowcapped peaks to its searing desert, the Nevada landscape is as \ndiverse as the backgrounds of those who helped settle it, those who \nlive and work there today.\n\n  It is also a wonderful place to raise a family. I know that firsthand \nbecause I was born and raised in Nevada, as have been all of my five \nchildren. My wife is like so many people--in fact, the majority of \npeople; she was born in California and worked her way into Nevada with \nher family.\n  When we ensure that all Nevadans can afford quality health care and \ncan count on a good-paying job, it will be even better. That is why I \ncome to work each day, to make life easier for my neighbors back home. \nThat is why I am working to help our country prosper, our economy be \nraised up as it once was. That is why I am working to protect our \nState's natural beauty. That is why I fought to end the plan that would \nhave made Nevada the Nation's nuclear dumping ground.\n  I am really proud to be a Nevadan. I am humbled that the people of \nNevada have asked me to represent them in various capacities for a long \ntime. I am proud that the Senate has recognized the 145th anniversary \nof our State's ratification of the Constitution.\n  Nevada is going to recover economically. It remains open for \nbusiness. In the words of the State song, it will always be home to me. \nHome means Nevada, home means the hills, home means the sage and the \npines. That is our State song.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/30/senate-section/article/S10946-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10946-S10947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STOPPING PROGRESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to shift gears a little bit here this \nmorning and focus on a problem we have here in the Senate. The problem \nis caused by our Republican colleagues.\n  The Republicans have become the party of no. What we want to question \nis this: We have back here the breakdown of the 85 times they have \nstopped progress in America today, some in the form of filibusters, \nothers in the form of various ways of objecting to things--just \nobjecting to things. For example, with health care, there is an article \nin the New York Times today where one Senator said his main goal is to \ndefeat health care. One Republican Senator said they want health care \nto be President Obama's Waterloo. Eighty-five times, taking not hours \nof the Senate's time but weeks and months, the American taxpayers' \nmoney being wasted.\n  I came to the floor yesterday and talked about what has happened with \nnominations. Every one of these nominees is a human being, a person who \nhas decided to devote their life to public service.\n  Yesterday, I came to the floor and talked about Dr. Benjamin, a woman \nwho is a medical doctor from Alabama who has devoted her life to taking \ncare of the poor and the oppressed. President Obama selected her to be \nSurgeon General of the United States a long time ago. It wasn't until \nlast night, after months, that somebody decided over here: Well, maybe \nthat is a little too much. We have an emergency declared with the swine \nflu. Maybe we should let her go.\n  I received a call Monday from the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nJanet Napolitano, indicating that a woman by the name of Jeanne \nO'Toole--I ran through her resume yesterday. There might be somebody \nbetter educated than she and who has written more on matters relating \nto what Janet Napolitano knows is needed, but I don't know who it would \nbe. Dr. O'Toole is a well-educated medical doctor, having written \nnumerous pieces on bioterrorism, all kinds of weapons of mass \ndestruction, Anthrax, the plague. She has written about all that in \nsome detail. Janet Napolitano said the Department of Homeland Security \nneeds someone as Under Secretary to work on bioterrorism, to work on \nthe swine flu that is sweeping the country.\n  No, it is held up. We were told yesterday, when I offered her name, \nby the Republican leader that we need to work on this a little longer. \nWhat is going on here in the Senate some day will be written about--a \ntime like no other time in the history of the Senate. A minority party \nhas held up progress for so long for so many unnecessary reasons. In \nfact, there are no reasons, except--I guess I have to change that a \nlittle bit. One of the important nominees of President Obama being held \nup is someone to be a Trade Representative. We have all kinds of \nproblems dealing with trade around the world. There is a hold on that. \nWe know that the hold isn't based on a law that one of the Republican \nSenators doesn't like; it is not a law being discussed in the House of \nRepresentatives here. It is not a law being discussed in the Senate or \nin one of our capitals around the country; it is a law dealing with \ntobacco that is being discussed in Canada. He is holding up this \nimportant job for a person waiting to go to work, who served in two \nRepublican administrations, one Democratic administration previously, \nand he is being held up because of a tobacco debate taking place in \nCanada. We have no control over that.\n  We have the General Services Administration. They take care of all \nFederal\n\n[[Page S10947]]\n\nproperty. This is the Administrator. That name has been submitted by \nPresident Obama, and it is being held up over a building in Kansas \nCity--somebody wants a building built in Kansas City, one of the \nRepublican Senators. He is holding up this nominee.\n  There is a hold on two State Department officials, who are extremely \nimportant. One is to be the person working with Secretary Clinton to \ntake care of Mexico, Central America, and South America. That will be \nhis responsibility someday--if he can ever get cleared. It is being \nheld up because they don't like what is going on in Honduras. I guess \nthey will be really upset today, because the problem has been solved. \nWhat they want over there is the international community, which is \ntotally against the coup having taken place in Honduras--one took place \nand they say it was the right thing to do, even though the Organization \nof American States and the whole international community opposes what \nhas taken place. I guess they are going to be upset now because the \nproblem was solved last night. That person who was illegally taken from \nthat country was brought back--he has been in hiding in the Swiss \nEmbassy for more than a month--and he is now going to take office \nagain. We have the person who is going to be handling Central America \nbeing held up, in addition to an Ambassador to one of those countries \ndown there, for the same reason.\n  This isn't a single problem. Take, for example, President Bush--the \nsecond President Bush. At this time during his Presidency, there were \nfive nominees on the Senate calendar. One had been reported out of \ncommittee in September, and four were reported out in October. We are \nstill in October. They had five. President Obama has 52 nominees on the \nSenate calendar and another 175 pending in committee. That is 52 \ncompared to 5. Some of these have been out for a long time. Some have \nbeen reported out in March, May, June, July, and August. They are being \nheld up for reasons about as ridiculous as I have told you already.\n  Sadly, many of these holds are women and minorities. Republicans have \nbeen stalling President Obama's nominees for months on end. There is a \nbacklog of good, qualified nominees who are awaiting confirmation. \nThese are people who have decided they are going to spend time in the \nFederal Government, giving up, in many instances, professorships at \nmajor universities, leaving law firms and accounting firms, medical \nschools, giving up private practice, and they are waiting, waiting \nuntil the Republicans decide they are going to let them through.\n  Some may say, why don't you move forward on them? Let me give those \nwithin the sound of my voice a little explanation. We have had to file \ncloture motions on nominees to stop filibusters. During the same time \nduring President Bush's Presidency, not a single one. We have had eight \nor nine now. Each one of those takes a long time. You move to it, you \nwait 2 days, and there is 30 hours, and then 2 more days, 30 hours. \nWith these 53 they have held up here, there aren't enough hours in the \nday to do this--working weekends and all night. It is a real \ndisappointment.\n  We have a situation here where the only response we have from the \nminority is to stop everything. They have become the party of no. If \nthat is what they feel they should be known as, that is what it is \ngoing to be. We are going to remind the American people what is taking \nplace here. This never happened before, where they are opposed to \neverything, whether it is somebody who has an unfortunate situation in \ntheir life where they can't work because there is no job--150,000 \npeople have been deprived, by their stalling, of a simple check to pay \ntheir rent, or to make a payment on their car.\n  I hope that Republicans around the country--and there are so many \npeople of good will who are Republicans around the country, just like \nDemocrats and Independents. I have a little bit of experience. When I \ncame to the Senate, I didn't know how things worked. It has only gotten \nthis way this Congress, to the degree that it has. When I came here, we \nhad so many moderate Republican Senators who would work with us and we \nwould work with them--Hatfield, Packwood, Danforth, Heinz from \nPennsylvania, D'Amato from New York, and Senator Warner from Virginia \nwas always somebody who would work with us. There were lots of \ndifferent Senators. But I am sad to say we don't have that now. They \nare going to have to sell themselves to the country as the party of no. \nThat is not the party I know in Nevada and around the country. \nRepublicans are good, law-abiding people, who believe in good \ngovernment. They have a political philosophy that is not in keeping \nwith the Democrats, but that is OK. We work together on issues. I hope \nthey will see the light and become the party of working with us. That \nis what they should be--not the Senate Grand Old Party, the party of \nno.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/30/senate-section/article/S10947-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week I was in Findlay, OH, and toured \nthe banks of the Blanchard River with the Northwest Ohio Flood \nMitigation Partnership, a nonprofit organization comprised of elected \nofficials, business leaders, and community foundations.\n  Mayor Pete Sehnert, former mayor and current president of the Flood \nMitigation Partnership Tony Iriti, and other community leaders briefed \nme on the flood mitigation efforts in the aftermath of one of the worst \nfloods in northwest Ohio history.\n  Two years ago, a torrential downpour resulted in the massive flood of \nthe Blanchard River and its tributaries, wreaking havoc in Findlay, \nShelby, Bucyrus, and Ottawa in northwest Ohio.\n  Shortly after the flood, I traveled to the region with Governor Ted \nStrickland and officials from Homeland Security and FEMA.\n  While we saw the flood's devastation, we also saw the communities of \nnorthwest Ohio work together to clean up debris and rebuild the homes, \nschools, and businesses that suffered terrible damage.\n  Today the partnership is working to put into place a flood control \nplan in 3 years, when nationally similar plans have taken 5 years to \ndevelop. I saw that work in action last week in Findlay, where they \nadvanced or accelerated their efforts much faster than almost any other \ncommunity in the country has been able to do after natural disasters.\n  Implementing a plan so efficiently saves taxpayer money, while \nspurring economic development earlier and protecting community safety \nif another flood occurs. It is an example of how a bipartisan and a \npublic-private effort among local, State and Federal governments, \nbusinesses, and community foundations is making a difference for \nFindlay and other communities across northwest Ohio.\n\n  In Findlay, we are establishing a national model in flood prevention \nplanning. The Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA have worked closely with \nmy office and Senator Voinovich, Congressmen Bob Latta and Jim Jordan, \nand other local officials. Corporations, community foundations, and \ncounty commissioners are working to develop flood control strategies to \nprotect neighborhoods and businesses alike.\n  Local leaders are working to attract new businesses and create jobs \nonce the cleanup is completed--and they have come a long way from my \nfairly regular visits to the community and seeing what happened, \nstrengthening the economy's tax base to keep taxes lower in the future.\n  Working together, we have secured a $1.5 million FEMA grant to \ncontinue recovery and flood mitigation efforts. This grant matches the \n$1.5 million national emergency grant that Findlay was recently \nawarded.\n  NEG funding in northwest Ohio will help provide job training and \nincrease opportunities for permanent employment for more than workers \nin the region. These workers earn good wages\n\n[[Page S10948]]\n\nand make up the crews that are removing blockages from rivers and \nwaterways and reducing the risk of future flood damage. NEG funding \nalso alleviates the burden faced by local governments with already \nstretched budgets.\n  While the public-private partnership is vital for the flood recovery \nefforts, we know there is much more work to do.

Mr. President, I was watching television this morning, \nand I was contemplating the challenge that confronts our country, this \neconomy, and the American people when it comes to jobs, seeing that \nmore and more people, unfortunately--even though the stock market \nappears to be coming back some and people's 401(k)s are perhaps no \nlonger ``201(k)s'' or ``101(k)s,'' but still unemployment continues to \ncreep up and up. Even the administration estimates that unemployment \nwill exceed 10 percent in the near future.\n  It occurred to me that there are a number of things that we are doing \nhere in Congress that actually, rather than encouraging job creation or \nfacilitating job creation, are job-killing policies.\n  Today I wish to concentrate on whether the proposed health care \nreforms we have seen out of the House and those that at some point will \ncome out of the Senate when Senator Reid's bill is revealed contribute \nto job-killing policies coming out of Washington or whether they are \ngrowth, progrowth, and job-incentivizing policies.\n  Yesterday we learned that 530,000 Americans filed for unemployment \nbenefits for the first time, more than half a million Americans. So \ndespite the fact that our economy grew in the third quarter, and the \nrecession is over from a technical point of view, for more than half a \nmillion Americans this recession we are growing out of just got worse.\n  It reminds me of--I think it was Ronald Reagan who said a recession \nis when a neighbor loses their job; a depression is when you lose your \njob. The fact is that a lot of Americans are hurting with roughly 9.8 \npercent unemployment, with people unable to make their house payments, \nand the foreclosure problem continues unabated. In my State, we have \nnot been immune from the recession, but I am glad to say our economy \ncontinues to outperform other States. Instead of the 9.8 percent \nunemployment, we are at 8.2 percent. I never thought I would be \nbragging about 8.2 percent unemployment, but I am grateful it is not \nworse.\n  The relative success of Texas is due to our job-friendly business \nenvironment. This is an important lesson to which I think Washington \nought to pay more attention: What kind of policies emanate from \nWashington, just like what kind of policies emanate from Austin, which \nencourage job creation and which policies destroy job creation.\n  One of the keys to our relative success is we have kept taxes \nrelatively low. According to the Tax Foundation, 42 States have taxes \nhigher than Texas. In other words, we are in the bottom 8 of all 50 \nStates. We have kept our regulatory burden relatively light, meaning it \ndoes not cost businesses a lot of money to comply with redtape and a \nheavy regulatory burden. We are a right-to-work State, so people are \nnot compelled to join a union in order to qualify for a job. We have \nadopted sensible legal tort reforms, which I think has created a \npredictable business environment and litigation environment. Rather \nthan chasing people away from the litigation lottery, they are now \nencouraged to come, understanding what the rules of the road are and \nwhat is expected of them. That has helped.\n  In contrast, Washington is considering delivering several job-killing \nproposals. For example, our national debt is projected to grow by $9 \ntrillion over the next 10 years.\n  We don't know whether the higher energy costs we will face in the \ncap-and-trade bill that has been proposed will actually pass, but if \nthey do, it is projected to add a lot of costs to small businesses, \nwhether they are an agricultural producer just paying for diesel fuel \nor those businesses that have high electricity costs, such as Texas \nInstruments in Dallas, TX. They have one of the highest electricity \ncosts in the State because of the nature of their manufacturing \nbusiness. If cap and trade imposes additional costs on them, it is \ngoing to kill their ability to maintain their level of business and \ngrow their business and create more jobs.\n  American employers don't know whether card check will become law. Of \ncourse, this is the bill that would deny the secret ballot for workers \nto decide whether to join a union, and we don't know whether a new era \nof global protectionism will reduce global trade and investment \nopportunities. My State of Texas loves free trade because we realize \ncreating more markets globally for our goods and services creates more \njobs in our State. Unfortunately, the message in Washington is \nconfusing, to say the least, if not hostile, to free trade.\n  Yesterday we got to look at more job-killing policies coming out of \nWashington in the form of Speaker Pelosi's health care bill which, to \nher credit, was revealed to the public. It was posted on the Internet. \nI wish Senator Reid would post his bill that he sent over to the \nCongressional Budget Office on the Internet so we could take a good \nlook at it, read it for ourselves, see how this impacts our \nconstituents and our States, and so the American people can read it and \nsee how it will affect them. Will it drive insurance up? Will it impose \nmore taxes? Will it cut Medicare benefits, for example, if you are a \nMedicare Advantage beneficiary? I give Speaker Pelosi credit. At least \nshe put her bill on the Internet.\n  What we have learned from this 1,900-page bill so far--and we are \nstill scouring it to find out what its impact will be, both its \nintended impact and its unintended consequences. Initially, the \nCongressional Budget Office said the House bill, Speaker Pelosi's bill, \nwill actually bend the cost curve up. It said:\n\n       On balance, during the decade following the 10-year budget \n     window, the bill would increase both Federal outlays for \n     health care and the Federal budgetary commitment to health \n     care, relative to the amounts under current law.\n\n  I thought health care reform was supposed to bring costs down. We \nheard the President and all of us have spoken in terms of bending the \ncost curve. Nobody thought we would be bending the cost curve up. We \nthought we were unified in a bipartisan way determined to bring the \ncosts down. But that is not what the Congressional Budget Office says \nthe Pelosi bill does.\n  Then we learned that this much vaunted public option would actually \ncost more than private insurance plans. That is what the Congressional \nBudget Office said. They wrote:\n\n       A public plan paying negotiated rates would attract a broad \n     network of providers but would typically have premiums that \n     are somewhat higher than the average premiums for the private \n     plans in the exchanges.\n\n  Here, again, I assume these are unintended consequences, those we \nought to be very careful about avoiding.\n  Surely, the purpose was not to make the public option or a \ngovernment-run plan more expensive than private insurance. But that is \nwhat the Congressional Budget Office believes the Pelosi bill would do.\n  The public plan would have lower administrative costs, to be sure, \nbecause it would be subsidized by the taxpayers but would probably \nengage in less management of utilization by its enrollees and attract a \nless healthy pool of enrollees.\n  Then when we look at job-killing provisions of these health care \nproposals, we have to look at the tax penalty on individuals who do not \nhave insurance, the so-called mandate, the government directive that \neverybody buy insurance or pay a penalty. That would generate, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, under the Pelosi bill, \n$33 billion in new penalties and taxes.\n  Then there is perhaps the unkindest cut of all, and that is the so-\ncalled pay-or-play requirement for businesses which would tax \nemployers, the very people we are looking to help us retain\n\n[[Page S10949]]\n\nand create jobs, an additional $135 billion penalty.\n  It is important to remember this so-called pay-or-play mandate is \nessentially a tax on workers and take-home pay. Most of the increased \ncosts of this new mandate on employers will simply be shifted to \nworkers in the form of lower wages. Employers may also respond by \ncutting jobs, particularly for low-income workers, or deciding to \noutsource more jobs or relying more on part-time workers. You don't \nhave to take my word for it. Let me cite Ezekiel Emanuel. That name may \nsound familiar because he is the brother of chief of staff Rahm \nEmanuel. He writes with Victor Fuchs in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association:\n\n       It is essential for Americans to understand that while it \n     looks like they can have a free lunch--having someone else \n     pay for health insurance--they cannot. The money comes from \n     their own pockets.\n\n  Harvard professor Kate Baicker has said:\n\n       Workers who would lose their jobs are disproportionately \n     likely to be high school dropouts, minority, and female. . . \n     . Thus, among the uninsured, those with the least education \n     face the highest risk of losing their jobs under employer \n     mandates.\n\n  We also know there are members of the administration--the Cabinet--\nwho are, I guess as every Cabinet does, cheerleading for the proposals \nof the administration which they serve. Certainly that is the case with \nSecretary Sebelius. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has made \nthe claim on the agency Web site, among other places, that health care \nreform would be good for job creation. But I suggest that the report of \nSecretary Sebelius is riddled with errors and false assumptions.\n\n  Independent, nonpartisan studies have shown that these proposals will \nactually raise premiums on people who already have insurance. So when \nthe President says: You can keep what you have if you like it--well, \nyou are not going to be able to keep it at the same price. You are \ngoing to end up paying a lot more for it.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has found these ``reforms'' will also \nincrease taxes on the middle class, as well as hurt jobs, as I have \nexplained, and small businesses. Of course, in order to pay for it, the \nSenate Finance Committee bill--which I presume will be included in the \nReid bill, but we have not seen it yet--will actually cut Medicare \nbenefits for seniors in order to pay for it.\n  I suggest it is not helpful to the cause of health care reform to \nrelease flawed reports filled with false promises. I hope the Obama \nadministration and all of our colleagues in the Senate will try to work \ntogether on a step-by-step approach to try to address the problems that \nmake health insurance unaffordable and to cover people who currently \nare not covered.\n  I think the American people would be better served if Secretary \nSebelius directed her attention instead to addressing shortages and \ndelays in the distribution of the H1N1 vaccine. In Texas, we were \npromised 3.4 million doses of vaccine by October, and we have been \ndelivered about half of that, 1.7 million, even though the peak of the \nswine flu, H1N1 season is upon us in the next couple of weeks.\n  I am afraid it doesn't build a lot of confidence when this \ngovernment-run health care plan or program delivers about 50 percent of \nwhat it promises. It is not a confidence builder.\n  Going back to the health care plans, let me just say that every \nindependent analysis of the health care bills we have seen so far, \nwhether they are Speaker Pelosi's bill or the one that came out of \nSenator Dodd's committee or Senator Baucus's committee, have found that \ncosts will actually increase, not go down, for small businesses.\n  The Pelosi health care bill released yesterday increases taxes on \nsmall businesses. Specifically, it imposes a 5.4 percent surtax on \nindividuals with incomes over $500,000 and families with income greater \nthan $1 million. One may say these are rich people; they can afford it. \nBut half of the people who will be captured are small businesses that \nare not big corporations. They are individuals, they are sole \nproprietors, they are partnerships, they are subchapter S corporations \nwhere the principal employer receives their income as a flowthrough and \npaid on a personal income tax return.\n  These kinds of additional fees and taxes on small businesses and job \ncreators have the opposite result of what I thought we were about, \nwhich is to encourage job creation and retention.\n  All told, just the surtax in the Pelosi bill would cause small \nbusinesses to face the highest marginal tax rate in 25 years. And, of \ncourse, it also imposes the pay-or-play mandate on employers that I \ntalked about earlier.\n  Former Congressional Budget Office Director Peter Orszag, who now \nserves in the Cabinet at the Office of Management and Budget, has \nindicated a pay-or-play mandate will hurt workers' wages. He said:\n\n       The economic evidence is overwhelming, the theory is \n     overwhelming, that when your firm pays for your health \n     insurance you actually pay--\n\n  The worker--\n\n     through take-home pay. The firm is not giving it to you for \n     free. Your other wages or what [you would have earned \n     otherwise] are reduced as a result. I don't think most \n     workers realize that.\n\n  I agree with him when he said that workers actually end up paying a \nhigher cost. It is not absorbed by the employer, but it also ultimately \nresults in reduced wages.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said:\n\n       [I]f employers who did not offer insurance were required to \n     pay a fee--\n\n  Here again talking about the pay-or-play mandate in the Pelosi bill \nand Senate bill--\n\n     employees' wages and other forms of compensation would \n     generally decline by the amount of that fee from what they \n     would otherwise have been--just as wages are generally lower \n     (all else being equal) to offset employers' contributions \n     toward health insurance.\n\n  Again, I end with the question that I asked earlier: Is what we are \ndoing in Washington on health care or in a variety of other areas \nactually killing jobs rather than encouraging and facilitating jobs? I \nthink, unfortunately, in the examples I mentioned, we are considering \njob-killing policies. The American people are worried about it. That is \nwhy they want to be able to read the bills.\n\n  I hope we will be able to read the Reid bill soon--the bill the \nmajority leader has written behind closed doors--because the American \npeople are entitled to see how it will impact them; whether they will \npay higher premiums; whether they will pay more in taxes, even if they \nare middle-class workers; and whether, if they are a senior, their \nMedicare benefits are going to be cut, as I fear they will be.\n  The Gallup Poll says the American people are understanding the \nconsequences of this debate well. It says Americans have become more \nlikely to say the cost their family pays for health care will get \nworse, not better, if these proposals pass; 76 percent say their costs \nwould get worse or not change, only 22 percent believe their costs \nwould be reduced by these proposals.\n  I think this is another reason why we need to slow down, be careful, \nand let's read the bill. Let's show the bill to the American people, \nget input from our constituents so we don't engage in job-killing \npolicies, either intentionally or inadvertently, at a time when we \nought to be very gravely concerned about growing unemployment and more \nand more people losing their homes due to foreclosures. Certainly, we \nshould not be doing anything which would make the matter worse rather \nthan better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/30/senate-section/article/S10949-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10949-S10951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise to talk about issues very similar \nto those of my friend from Texas and echo his concerns about the \ncurrent proposal for health care. We found out yesterday the proposal \nthat was put forth by the Speaker of the House is nearly 2,000 pages. \nIt is a $1 trillion proposal. That is $\\1/2\\ billion per page. It is \nsort of staggering to think about.\n  When I came to Washington, just a couple months ago, appointed by my \nGovernor--Charlie Crist of Florida--it was my cause to come and be a \nproblem solver, to help work on issues that both Republicans and \nDemocrats could work on together. I learned from Gov. Charlie Crist \nthat there are lots of issues we can disagree about principally, but \nthere are plenty of issues\n\n[[Page S10950]]\n\nwe can work on together and do things that are right for the people. \nThat may not be in vogue in Washington, DC. It may not be in vogue to \ntry to find issues--the low-hanging fruit--we can work on together to \nsolve problems, but it is something I wish to pursue.\n  Additionally, when I came to Washington, I recognized--and I spoke \nabout this last week in my first address in this August body--there are \nlots of times most folks in Congress would like to discuss grand new \nplans, grand new ideas for the future of this country. That is exciting \nto talk about--a new program or a new administration, more government \nemployees working on a new program, perhaps, in some new government \nbuilding. But I don't have a passion necessarily for following up on \nthose great ideas for future plans. I have a passion for helping us do \nbetter what we already do. Oftentimes, in government, that is not the \ncase. We spend billions, trillions of dollars a year on existing \ngovernment programs, but many times we don't do it effectively and \nefficiently. If we spent as much time caring about the money we are \nspending now, as opposed to the money some in this Chamber want to \nspend, I suspect we could find plenty of money to either return to the \npeople or to find money for these new programs.\n  Today, I wish to talk about just such an idea, an idea to recover \nsome of the waste, fraud, and abuse that is currently happening in our \nsystem of government. We know in our current provision of health care--\nin Medicare and Medicaid--there is tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. \nEstimates are that some $60 billion to a staggering $226 billion a year \nto waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  This health care proposal that was put forth by Speaker Pelosi and \nthat we are discussing in the Senate, just for comparison purposes, is \n$1 trillion over 10 years. I think anybody who has watched the \ngovernment knows that if you estimate something is going to cost $1 \ntrillion, it is going to be a whole lot more than that when it actually \ngets implemented because we don't do much in government that comes in \nunder our estimates. Most times, almost every time, it is a lot more \nthan is estimated. But let us compare these numbers, $1 trillion over \n10 years. That is about $100 billion a year. We may be wasting $226 \nbillion a year.\n  If we captured just half of that, we might be able to pay for this \nprogram. Better still, we could take those dollars we are wasting in \nfraud and abuse and we could put them back into the Medicare Program to \npay for health care for seniors. Wouldn't that be a good idea? Because \nthe estimates tell us that in 8 years we are going to be in a situation \nin Medicare where we are going to be in a deficit. We are going to be \ntaking in less money than we need to spend. Workers will be paying in \nless than retirees need for their health care. We will have to, as the \nFederal Government, shore up Medicare certainly at that point. So why \ndon't we concentrate now, while we can, on an issue Democrats and \nRepublicans can agree upon, which is trying to stop waste, fraud, and \nabuse.\n  Yesterday, I had the honor of filing my first bill in the Senate--S. \n2128--and I wish to talk to the Senate and the American people about \nthat bill. S. 2128 is the Prevent Health Care Fraud Act of 2009. What \nthis bill simply will do is try to go after the waste in the health \ncare system the government currently runs. It is estimated that $1 out \nof every $7 we spend on health care for seniors is captured by \ncriminals or is wasted and is not going to help seniors--$1 out of \nevery $7. That is where we get to that number of potentially $226 \nbillion a year.\n  I have a lot of experience in this. Before coming to the Senate, I \nhad an opportunity to serve as the deputy attorney general in Florida \nand to run--under then-attorney general Charlie Crist--an office of \nabout 400 lawyers. Within that office, we had a Medicaid fraud control \nunit where we focused on fraud in Medicaid. We were able to recover \n$100 million a year--just in Florida--by stepping up enforcement \nactions to capture bad guys who were taking dollars out of the system. \nWhat I wish to try to do with this new act, in S. 2128--the Prevent \nHealth Care Fraud Act of 2009--is not just go after these bad guys once \nwe have figured out they have taken the money but to prevent them from \ngetting the money in the first place.\n  The American people would be shocked to know how little we do to \nprevent health care fraud. You might expect, sitting at home in Orlando \nor wherever you are in the country listening to this address today, \nthat we have a very comprehensive system to stop health care fraud; \nthat if the government is spending billions of dollars, trillions of \ndollars over time on health care, that we would have hundreds and \nthousands of people who would be working to stop health care fraud; \nthat we would have sophisticated computer models that stopped health \ncare fraud before it happened. That is simply not true.\n  I introduced this bill yesterday, and I am speaking about it today, \nto help try to stop this fraud before it starts. My goal is to be a \nproblem solver in Washington, to work on issues everybody can agree \nupon. Let me tell you about what S. 2128 does. It does three things, \nbasically. We are going to create, within the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, a Deputy Secretary who will be the chief health care \nfraud prevention officer of the United States. That individual will be \nin a No. 2 role in that agency. That person will report directly to the \nSecretary and will be nominated by the President of the United States. \nThat Deputy Secretary will not have seven different jobs. He or she \nwill have one job--to prevent health care fraud. If that Deputy \nSecretary does not do his or her job, they will come to the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives and be called on the carpet. This chief \nhealth care fraud prevention officer of the United States is going to \nrun a division that is going to work every day to stop this health care \nfraud before it starts.\n\n  How are they going to do it? Oftentimes, the private sector gives us \na model that we can use and we can copy in the government to help us \nprevent health care fraud or anything we do in government, to do it \nmore efficiently and more effectively. So what model is out there to \nprevent fraud that is being used every day and that affects all our \nlives, that stops fraud before it starts? That model is the credit card \nbusiness, a business that is roughly the same size as the health care \nbusiness.\n  A couple of trillion dollars a year passes through the exchange of \ncredit cards for the purchase of goods and services. The health care \nindustry is a multitrillion-dollar-a-year industry as well. The level \nof fraud in the health care industry is $1 out of every $7. The \nincidence of fraud in the credit card industry is 7 cents for every \n$100--$1 out of every $7 versus 7 cents for every $100. How do they do \nit? Well, we all have had this experience. You use your credit card to \npurchase something and then a couple minutes later you get a phone call \nor e-mail which asks: Did you authorize the purchase that just happened \nwith your credit card?\n  This just happened to me a week ago. I went to buy a television, in \nWashington, DC, at Best Buy. I have my family here so they can be close \nto me during my time in the Senate, and we have to have a television. \nSo I go to Best Buy and use my credit card. I walk out the door and my \nBlackBerry vibrates. There is an e-mail from my credit card company \nasking: Did you authorize the purchase of a television at Best Buy? Why \ndid that happen? They have a computer modeling predictive system that \nsays this is a questionable transaction. George lives in Tallahassee, \nFL; someone is using his credit card to buy a television--which is \nsomething that is probably bought a lot of times on a stolen credit \ncard--something is up. The computer--no person does this, this has been \nprogrammed--goes into action and I get an e-mail. That transaction is \nnot authorized for payment until I call my credit card company and tell \nthem, yes, I actually authorized that purchase.\n  Why can't we do the same thing the credit card companies are doing \nfor health care? Why can't we use a predictive modeling system that \nsays a health care claim is not going to be paid when a red flag comes \nup? Right now we are on a pay-and-chase system. We pay these people who \nprovide health care, allegedly--many of whom are not providing health \ncare because a good portion of them are criminals, frankly--and then we \ntry to go after them to enforce the law, and we barely\n\n[[Page S10951]]\n\never capture the money back. We capture some but not near enough. If we \nput this model in place, it stops the fraud before it happens.\n  S. 2128--the Prevent Health Care Fraud Act of 2009--would put this \npredictive modeling system in. The Federal Government would have to go \nout and hire folks to do it. We would have a competitively bid process. \nIt is no different than what we do in other parts of the government. In \nthe Defense Department, we go through a bunch of checks before there is \nan acquisition for the Defense Department. Why can't we put this \npredictive modeling system over in health care to use real-time data to \nstop these fraudulent transactions before they happen?\n  According to Harvard University Professor Malcom Sparrow, the credit \ncard industry establishes benchmarks for acceptable business risk and \ntheir threshold is one-tenth of 1 percent. By contrast, fraud losses in \nthe health care business run from 3 to 14 percent. That is 100 times \nthe acceptable business risk.\n  Another thing this bill does is it requires background checks for all \nhealth care providers. If you are supposedly providing health care, \nwhether you are providing a wheelchair or a doctor providing actual \nhealth care services--someone who is a physician's assistant or whoever \nit may be--if those folks are being reimbursed by the Federal \nGovernment, getting paid for the health care they are providing, they \nshould not be criminals. You might think that right now we are doing \nbackground checks on all these health care providers, but we are not.\n  I know this, specifically, because Florida, unfortunately, is ground \nzero for health care fraud. We have tremendous problems in Florida, \nespecially the southeast part of Florida, where I am from--Fort \nLauderdale, Miami-Dade County--with health care fraud.\n  Let me cite some examples.\n  Mr. President, ``60 Minutes,'' last week, aired a special on this. \nThey talked about the rampant fraud in south Florida. One of the \nperpetrators was responsible for $20 million of health care fraud \nalone, and he said: We get a Medicare book of codes and our bidder \ntells us which ones to use and we run the codes. So they get one \nwheelchair and they sell it a thousand times and get reimbursed a \nthousand times for it. There is no computer modeling system that puts \nthe red flag up, such as there would be on your credit card, that says: \nStop that; wait a minute; after the third wheelchair is sold in 60 \nseconds, maybe we should not pay this guy's claim.\n  It has gotten so easy to steal money from the Federal Government that \norganized crime has gotten involved. There have been stories of a \nRussian-Armenian organized crime ring that defrauded Medicare by $20 \nmillion, and they said it was easier than trying to be involved in the \nillicit drug business because there was no one going after them.\n  I wish to take a moment to applaud my colleague from Delaware, \nSenator Kaufman, who just introduced some legislation called the Health \nCare Fraud Enforcement Act of 2009 to increase the penalties for health \ncare fraud.\n  I think that is great. We should be doing that. But in combination \nwith that, we should do what we propose in S. 2128, which is to stop \nthe fraud before it happens. These instances of fraud across the \ncountry are rampant.\n  I will give you another example. South Florida is home to 8 percent \nof the Nation's AIDS patients, but 72 percent of Federal AIDS \nmedication payments are paid in South Florida. That is 72 percent, when \nwe only have 8 percent of the patients. Why is this happening? These \nmedications for AIDS are extremely expensive. Some bad guy runs the \ncode all day and says: I have given this many injections of AIDS \nmedication at $2,500 a pop; runs 1,000 codes and we pay them. We pay \nthem.\n  It makes no sense to me. So we have had big disagreements about how \nwe are going to solve health care, how we are going to provide more \naffordable health care to our people in this country, how we are going \nto provide more access to health care.\n  But we certainly can agree we should run whatever program we have \nefficiently and effectively. We can certainly agree we should not have \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. If we can reduce the $60 billion to more than \n$200 billion in fraud a year by simply putting somebody in charge of \nhealth care fraud prevention, put predictive modeling in such as we \nhave in the credit card industry, and not let people be health care \nproviders unless they have a background check and, if they are a \ncriminal, not let them provide health care, we can save billions of \ndollars.\n  Those dollars can go back into Medicare, which is running at \ndeficits. As I said when I opened my remarks today, it is very much in \nvogue in Washington to propose brandnew plans. I understand that. But \nwe need to be focused and have as much zeal about brandnew plans as \nrunning the programs we have efficiently and effectively.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this piece of \nlegislation, S. 2128, the Prevent Health Care Fraud Act of 2009.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/30/senate-section/article/S10951-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10951-S10953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAILURE IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a serious failure in \nour justice system, something we are going to need to talk and think \nabout. It has been talked about before, but the matter drives home the \nissue in a specific way.\n  Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri--al-Marri, as he is now usually referred \nto--is a terrorist who entered the country under the instructions of 9/\n11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. While here, he researched \nhazardous chemicals and his potential targets included dams and \nreservoirs. He was apprehended in 2001. In 2003, he was held as an \nenemy combatant under the orders of the Bush administration. He was \nseen at that time as an individual at war with the United States since \nhe was associated with al-Qaida and al-Qaida had declared war on the \nUnited States.\n  The Nation made a firm decision that these kinds of cases should not \nbe handled in the normal course of prosecutions of crimes but should be \ntreated under the historic and well-established rules of war for these \nindividuals.\n  The Obama administration has moved him into a civilian justice system \nand decided they would try him for this offense as a crime. He ended up \npleading guilty, which seemed dubious as a plea by the Department of \nJustice, but they chose to allow him to plead guilty to the charge of \nconspiring to support terrorists. He was sentenced yesterday. How much \ntime will this terrorist be spending in jail? How long before he is \nreleased and then could reassume his mission of waging jihad against \nAmerica? Five years. That is right, 5 years. The judge in Peoria, IL, \nsentenced him to only 8 years and gave him credit for time served in \nmilitary prisons, apparently, and he is expected to be released in 5 \nyears. This is an outrage. Our brave soldiers and intelligence agents \nrisk their lives every day to find and capture these terrorists.\n  I received a phone call from a friend I have known for a number of \nyears whose son is in Iraq now as a marine. He wants to talk about what \nwe are doing there. We have American soldiers, some of the finest \npeople this country has ever produced, at risk at this moment fighting \nagainst these kinds of terrorists who are committed to attacking us. In \nrecent days, we have seen plot after plot, fortunately being frustrated \nby good investigative agents. We have investigators and our military \nout there at risk today. We capture terrorists. What do we do? Do we \nput them in jail a few years and then let them go?\n  Not only did the Justice Department pursue a lesser charge against \nal-Marri, but the judge only sentenced him to 8 of the possible 15 \nyears he could have served on that charge.\n  Without doubt, as a former Federal prosecutor--and the Presiding \nOfficer is a former U.S. attorney--there are real procedures every \nAmerican is provided under our legal system for trials in Federal \ncourts. We are proud of\n\n[[Page S10952]]\n\nthose, and we adhere to them. But there is a danger of trying people \nwho are at war with us, who want to destroy us and the government this \nNation possesses, in civilian courts. They are not common criminals; \nthey are members of global terror networks, bent on waging war against \nAmerica, its allies, and our vital interests. Yet the administration \nhas announced plans to begin trying more and more terrorists and enemy \ncombatants through our normal Federal criminal justice system.\n  Our court system was never designed to prosecute terrorists and enemy \ncombatants and soldiers attacking this country. Such trials turn the \ncourthouse and the jury system into targets. They rely on evidence that \nmay not be admissible, evidence seized by the military in defending the \ncountry. That evidence may not be admissible in court under our normal \nrules of evidence. They risk bringing confidential information to \npublic light, including the identity of informants or even undercover \nagents. And it means, ultimately, that more terrorists bent on taking \ninnocent American lives will be released to return to the battlefield--\nabroad or right here in cities and towns across America. I ask, is this \na risk we can afford? Is it a risk we are required to take under our \nlaws and Constitution?\n  The proper setting for these prosecutions is military commissions, \nmilitary tribunals. These terrorists are the most violent and dangerous \nkillers in the world. They are not criminals; they are on an unswerving \nmission to spill American blood. I wish it were not so. Overwhelmingly, \nthe Muslim community does not believe in this kind of activity. It is \nonly a small group, but it is a very effective group because they have \nlearned how to utilize modern capabilities, such as airplanes and \npoisons and explosives, to wreak untold damage, especially when they \nare prepared to martyr themselves.\n  We need to use all lawful resources at our disposal to combat and \ndismantle this threat. We cannot and we must not allow more enemy \ncombatants like Ali Kahlah to use our justice system against us. We \ncannot and we must not be naive and think our good will and kindness \nwill shield us from these kinds of forces, this kind of evil in the \nworld. We cannot and we must not forget the danger we face or the \nimperative to use every last resource at our disposal to keep this \ncountry, its liberties, and its people safe.\n  There was an article in the Washington Post of today that raises an \nimportant issue about sentencing. It quotes Kirk Lippold, the commander \nof the USS Cole, where 17 of our sailors were murdered by an Islamic \nattack in the Persian Gulf in Yemen in the harbor in the year 2000. \nThis is what he said about the verdict: The sentence was ``appalling'' \nand ``grossly inadequate.'' He said that if prosecutors move other \ndefendants from the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for trials \nin regular U.S. Federal courts, it could ``create an era of \nunacceptable compromise to our national security.''\n  I have a vivid memory from several years ago, maybe 5 or 6, 7 years \nago, of being at the commissioning of the Ronald Reagan aircraft \ncarrier at Newport News as a member of the Armed Services Committee, \nwalking out of that ceremony, not too long after the Cole was attacked \nand those sailors killed. And a sailor screamed out--and the hair still \nstands on my neck when I think about it--``Remember the Cole.''\n  The United States has a responsibility to defend our men and women \nabroad. U.S. warships ought to be able to move in peaceful commerce \naround the world and not be subject to attack. When they are attacked, \nit is the responsibility of this Nation to act against it. Commander \nLippold has expressed some concern in times past about how that has \nbeen handled.\n  They also quote Robert Chesney, a law professor at the University of \nTexas at Austin who studies sentencing in terrorism cases. He said that \nthe Marri sentence ``probably comes with the territory in switching \nsomebody out of military detention and into the criminal justice \nsystem.'' It comes with the territory. That is exactly right. That is \nwhat a number of us have been saying for some time, why this is not a \nwise policy.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The case is one of the few concrete examples, Chesney said, \n     of the ongoing debate over whether the U.S. criminal justice \n     system is ``up to the task'' of trying and convicting \n     terrorist suspects.\n\n  I absolutely agree with that. It is not equipped to do it. The \nAmerican criminal justice system assumes that a person commits some \nsort of crime. They give a certain sentence, and there is a reasonable \nprospect that they won't commit crimes again. But when we are dealing \nwith people who are committed to martyrdom, if we are dealing with a \nperson who has made a lifetime oath to fight to the death to destroy \nAmericans and who has the capability to kill not only one person in \nsome sort of assault or fight but thousands of Americans and who is at \nwar with the United States, we need to utilize the great and historic \nprinciples of military commissions to try them as we always have. We \ndidn't try German prisoners of war in Federal courts. We didn't try \nJapanese or North Vietnamese or North Koreans in Federal court when \nthey were captured. They were treated as they were, as prisoners of \nwar, and detained as long as they represented a threat to the United \nStates. That is the way this should be. Military commissions are \nreferred to in the Constitution.\n\n  In World War II, in the famous case of Ex parte Quirin--Franklin \nRoosevelt was President--a submarine appeared off the Atlantic Coast, \nand a group of people got out who were saboteurs. They were sent by \nNazi Germany to blow up places in the United States, kill Americans, \nand sabotage our war efforts.\n  That was a serious matter. They were caught. Were they tried as \ncommon criminals? No, they were not. How were they tried? They were \ntried by a military commission. They were tried under the laws of war \nthat have been longstanding for quite a number of years. They were \nconvicted within a matter of a few months, and they were executed \nbecause they were clearly in violation of the laws of warfare. They \nwere not normal prisoners of war acting in uniform. They were acting \ncontrary to the Geneva Conventions, contrary to the rules of warfare. \nThey were acting in a way--they did not wear uniforms. They did not go \nopenly about. They were targeting innocent civilians. So they violated \nthe rules of war. They were tried and executed. The Supreme Court \nupheld that. This is what other nations do also. They do not try people \nwith whom they are at war in civilian courts.\n  I am worried about this. I do not think it is a little bitty matter. \nI do not think this is the first time we are going to see this or the \nonly time we are going to see it. I think we are going to see it more \nand more often. I call it to the attention of my colleagues.\n  One other thing I think we should point out: that unclassified \ndeclaration by Jeffrey N. Rapp, the Director of the Joint Intelligence \nTask Force for Combating Terrorism. This is what he said about this \nmatter:\n\n       Multiple intelligence sources confirm that Al-Marri is an \n     al Qaeda ``sleeper'' agent sent to the United States for the \n     purpose of engaging in and facilitating terrorist activities \n     subsequent to September 11, 2001, and exploring ways to hack \n     into the computer systems of U.S. banks and otherwise disrupt \n     the U.S. financial system. Prior to arriving in the United \n     States on September 10, 2001--\n\n  Not the 11th: September 10, 2001--\n\n       Al-Marri was trained at an al-Qaida terror camp. He met \n     personally with Osama bin Laden and other known al Qaeda \n     members and volunteered for a martyr mission or to do \n     anything else that al Qaeda requested. Al-Marri was assisted \n     in his al Qaeda assignment to the United States by known al \n     Qaeda members and traveled to the United States with money \n     provided for him by al Qaeda. Al-Marri currently possesses \n     information of high intelligence value, including information \n     about personnel and activities of al Qaeda.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Al-Marri was trained by al Qaeda in the use of poisons. In \n     the hard drive of Al-Marri's laptop, FBI agents discovered a \n     folder entitled ``chem,'' which contained bookmarked Internet \n     sites of industrial chemical distributors. Analysis revealed \n     that Al-Marri had visited a number of sites related to the \n     manufacture, use and procurement of hydrogen cyanide.\n\n  So I do not think this is an itty-bitty matter. We have normal drug \ndealers going to jail every day for 10, 12, 15 years. We have somebody \nwho is plotting to kill American citizens, who came here the day before \n9/11, is part of an al-Qaida plot--and he gets 5 years? I\n\n[[Page S10953]]\n\nthink it is unacceptable, and it is also an indication to us in \nCongress we cannot proceed further with this idea that we are going to \ntry terrorists in Federal criminal courts.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/30/senate-section/article/S10953-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10953-S10956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is a lot going on in public policy \nin Washington, DC. However, today is Friday and the Senate is not \nvoting, so there is not much happening on the Senate floor. But there \nremains a lot of work to do between now and the end of this year to try \nto put this country back on track and fix a number of things that are \nwrong.\n  If the coming weeks are like recent weeks, we will have very little \ncooperation in this Chamber, which is regrettable. You would think if \never there is a time for cooperation, it is when the country is in a \nvery deep economic hole. This country saw, a year ago, its economy fall \noff a cliff. Unbelievable unemployment: Over 7.5 million Americans have \nlost their jobs, lost their homes, lost hope. This has been the deepest \neconomic recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s.\n  I understand everybody can take and look at this and see things \ndifferently. Our colleague Senator Byrd used to tell about the \ncaterpillar that would climb up on a clump of grass and look around and \nsay: I see the world. And then a squirrel would alight on the same \nidentical spot and say, after gazing around: I see the world. And an \neagle, flying over the identical spot, taking a look, would say: I see \nthe world. They all were in the same spot but all had a very different \nview--the caterpillar, the squirrel, and the eagle. Senator Byrd's \npoint was, you can have a different view depending on exactly how you \nsee things, and I understand that.\n  I have great respect for my colleagues who have different views. I \nwould only say this: that when the country is in trouble, it seems to \nme there ought not to be two teams. There ought to be one team; that \nis, our team working to try to figure out: How do we get out of this? \nHow do we restart the economic engine, get America moving again, and \nput people back to work again?\n  There is no social program in this Congress that we work on or that \nwe create, no social program that is as important as a good job that \npays well. That is what allows everyone to be able to make a living and \ntake care of their families, and so on. So the question for us is, What \nis the agenda? We are where we find ourselves. So what is the agenda \nfrom here forward?\n  The President has described the agenda of saying that, obviously, the \neconomy is very important, health care is very important, and energy \nand climate change are also very important. That represents the agenda. \nMy colleague Senator Reid, the majority leader, is trying to move \nlegislation that includes other things, including the appropriations \nbills that we are required to move. We have not gotten a bit of \ncooperation on anything, not even the noncontroversial issues do we get \ncooperation on. In each case, we are required to file cloture, wait 2 \ndays for it to ripen, then have a vote, and then wait 30 hours \npostcloture while they object to anything else happening on the floor. \nSo we are in a situation where there is no cooperation on anything, \nwhich I think is pretty remarkable and pretty disappointing. The \nmajority leader is trying very hard in those circumstances to still \nmove things and get things done.\n  My own view of the priorities is pretty simple. I think health care \nis important, and I think energy and climate change are important. In \nmy judgment, both rank behind the issue of the economy and trying to \nrestart the economic engine and putting people back to work. I think \nthat is the most important priority for the Congress and the country. \nIt makes everything else possible, and without it very little is \npossible. You cannot have millions of people out of work without \nunderstanding it is a priority to find a way to expand the economy and \nput them back on payroll. Last month, 263,000 Americans lost their \njobs. Think of each case of someone coming home from work saying to \ntheir spouse or to a loved one or to a family member: I have lost my \njob today. No, it is not because I am a bad worker. It is not because I \ndid not do a good job. I had sterling references and sterling \nperformance appraisals. They just decided my job was going to be gone.\n  Yesterday, by the way--after last month, 263,000 people coming home \nto say: I have lost my job; and that adds up now to 7.5 million \nAmericans who are unemployed--yesterday, we discovered that the economy \ngrew by 3.5 percent in the third quarter. Well, that is good news. But \nit is news that is tempered with the understanding that we do not have \njust one economy, we have a couple of economies. We have an economy in \nwhich some are doing very well, with very high incomes, very large \nbonuses, and significant profits, mostly on Wall Street. I will \ntalk about that in a moment. And then others are still struggling to \nfigure out: Where can I find a job? How on Earth can I get back on a \npayroll to begin to provide for myself and my family?\n\n  Even as that was happening, I was on an airplane last week, and I sat \nnext to a man, and I said: Where are you headed?\n  He said: Well, I am going to Thailand and Singapore and China.\n  I said: What are you going to do there?\n  He said: My company buys products from suppliers and we are trying to \nmove our network of suppliers to Singapore and Thailand and China so we \ncan dramatically reduce the cost of products we buy.\n  I said: But that is moving those American jobs overseas, isn't it?\n  He said: Yeah. It is not something I like to do. It is something I \nthink our company has to do. We decided we have to buy cheaper \nproducts, so we are going to look for the China price.\n  He was going to be gone 2 weeks. I assume by now he has been in \nThailand and Singapore and China, arranging to have those who are now \nemployed in this country have their jobs be shipped to another country \nwhere they pay a fraction of the wages. Maybe those workers don't know \nit yet. I assume they do not. But they probably will in a few weeks. \nThat is part of the story, as well of what is happening in this \neconomy.\n  As I said, I think health care is very important. It is 17 percent of \nthis economy. I think it is important for us to try to figure out: What \ndo you do about health care? How can you put the brakes on \ncircumstances where health care--which, by the way, is not just some \noption, some luxury, but a necessity for most Americans--how can you \nput the brakes on a health care system that says to most American \nfamilies, when they open the mail and find the bill by the insurance \ncompany: Oh, by the way, the coverage you have is now going to cost 10 \npercent more or 12 percent more or 18 percent more--year after year \nafter year--and people say: Well, I can't afford that. I can't afford \nthat coverage. How do you put the brakes on those kinds of cost \nincreases? How do you expand coverage so more people can afford health \ncare coverage?\n  There are a lot of priorities. But I have been at odds with the \nPresident and others, believing that the first priority--by far, the \nfirst priority--and the first exclusive priority ought to be to find a \nway to restart this economic engine. We have to get that done. I am not \nsaying health care should not be done. I am saying, in my judgment, the \nability to restart this economic engine and put people back on payrolls \ntrumps everything else.\n  I want to talk about the issue of two economies because some people \nwill say: Well, that has already started. I give the President credit. \nThe fact is, he has proposed a series of things that have pumped some \nlife into this economy. Without it, we probably would not see the kind \nof opportunities that are going to come from the bottoming out of the \neconomy and then the beginning to rebuild opportunity. I give the \nPresident credit for that. But we have a long way to go.\n  We have two economies. One economy is doing very well, and one not so \nwell. Let me describe the one that is not doing so well in the words of \nWill Rogers. Will Rogers, a long time ago, said:\n\n       The unemployed here ain't eating regular, but we'll get \n     around to them as soon as everybody else gets fixed up OK.\n\n\n[[Page S10954]]\n\n\n  It sounds just like Will Rogers, doesn't it: The unemployed ain't \neating so well, but we'll get around to them as soon as everybody else \ngets fixed up OK.\n  The question is, What about all those folks who ``ain't eating so \nwell'' in Will Rogers' description?\n  Let me describe why, in my judgment, the economy is, by far, the most \nurgent priority. As shown on this chart, here is the rise in \nunemployment and underemployment from 2007 to 2009. We all know it. It \nhas gone up, up, and up. And behind those statistics are unbelievable \nstories of pain. Not everybody is experiencing this.\n  Here is a September 11, 2009, Steven Pearlstein column in the \nWashington Post:\n\n       It's been a year since the onset of a financial crisis that \n     wiped out $15 trillion of wealth from the balance sheet of \n     American households, and more than two years since serious \n     cracks in the financial system became apparent. Yet while the \n     system has been stabilized and the worst of the crisis has \n     passed, little has been done to keep another meltdown from \n     happening.\n\n  Business as usual on Wall Street.\n\n       ``A Year After Lehman, Wall Street's Acting Like Wall \n     Street Again.'' That is the title of an article in the \n     Washington Post, dated September 8, 2009.\n       It's been 12 months since Lehman Brothers failed, setting \n     off a chain reaction that came horrifyingly close to \n     destroying the world's financial system. . . .\n       Even though some once-iconic names have vanished and others \n     are shadows of their former selves, Wall Street hasn't \n     changed all that much. It still operates on the principle of \n     taking care of itself first, really big and important \n     customers second, everyone else last.\n\n  That is an article by Allan Sloan.\n  Two economies: The folks who are still losing jobs; and then:\n\n       Bailout helps fuel a new era of Wall Street wealth. Many of \n     the steps policymakers took last year to stabilize the \n     financial system, reducing interest rates to near zero, \n     bolstering big banks with taxpayer money has helped set the \n     stage for this new era of Wall Street wealth.\n\n  To continue this discussion, the New York Times, Graham Bowley:\n\n       Even as the economy continues to struggle, much of Wall \n     Street is minting money and looking forward to hefty bonuses.\n\n  Los Angeles Times, September 14:\n\n       The Financial Meltdown: Crisis has not altered Wall Street.\n       Bellwether firms led by Goldman Sachs Group are churning \n     out mouth-watering profits. Risk-taking and aggressive \n     securities trading are mounting a comeback. And \n     compensation--the lifeblood of Wall Street--is pushing back \n     toward pre-crisis levels.\n       Certainly the greed on Wall Street has not changed and will \n     never change, said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale \n     Securities.\n\n  The key part is ``risk-taking and aggressive securities trading are \nmounting a comeback''--the very things that put this economy in the \nditch.\n  Why do I go through all of this? I do it for this reason. The Federal \nReserve Board had a strategy. They committed trillions of dollars in \ntaxpayer funds to try to prevent the economy from falling into an \nabyss. I am not here to criticize them for that. They did what they \nbelieved they had to do in order to provide some foundation for this \neconomy\n  Now, Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Fed, testifying before the \nCongress, a joint House-Senate hearing said:\n\n       Transparency is a big issue.\n\n  Transparency is a big issue for the Fed.\n  So the Federal Reserve Board decided for the first time in its \nhistory to allow direct lending to investment banks. The Federal \nReserve said investment banks could get direct loans, and they did. Now \nwe see--for example, two companies that got TARP funds--troubled asset \nrelief program funds--and undoubtedly went to the Fed for loans and \nnow, by the way, are paying, I think, a total of about 50 people an \naverage of $18 million each in bonuses.\n  Let me say that again: Companies that got TARP funds very likely went \nto the Fed, to the Fed window, to get direct loans and are now paying \nabout 50 people an average of $18 million apiece.\n  So when one of them comes home and the spouse says: Honey, how much \nmoney are we making? The spouse says: $1\\1/2\\ million a month--$1\\1/2\\ \nmillion a month. Pretty unbelievable, isn't it? Anybody here make that, \ndo you think? I don't think so. They are making $1\\1/2\\ million a \nmonth. These are the companies that got themselves in deep trouble, \nneeded a bailout by the American people, and needed direct lending by \nthe Federal Reserve Board.\n  So now the question is, Should we have a right to see who the Fed \ngave money to? Well, some folks took the Federal Reserve Board to \ncourt, and here is the Bloomberg Report:\n\n       The Fed last year began extending credit directly to \n     companies that aren't banks for the first time since it was \n     created in 1913 and it has refused to divulge details about \n     the companies participating in those 10 lending programs.\n\n  All right. Some folks took them to court:\n\n       Court orders Fed to disclose emergency bank loans.\n\n  The point is, the American people were at risk. The American people, \nthrough the Congress, created the Federal Reserve Board. The Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board said transparency is a big issue. All \nright. Be transparent. Tell us, where did you put the money? Who got \nthe money? How much? At what rates? What were the concessional rates?\n  The court says:\n\n       The Federal Reserve must for the first time identify the \n     companies in its emergency lending programs after losing a \n     Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The judge said the \n     central bank improperly withheld agency records.\n\n  Well, the problem is, the order was then appealed and a judge stayed \nthe order. So at this point, we don't know the answer. So I and 9 of my \ncolleagues wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board \nto say: You know what. The American people deserve to understand, who \ndid you give money to? What were the rates? What were the terms? We \ndeserve to know that.\n  We sent a long letter to him. We got a letter back from the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board, and he says: I don't intend to do that. \nThat would compromise some firms. Oh, really? It will compromise \ncompanies if they tell us who they gave loans to for the first time in \nthe history of the Federal Reserve Board? How about compromising the \nright of the American people and the right of the Congress to \nunderstand what they did.\n  The reason it is important is this: Are 50 people getting $18 million \neach, $1\\1/2\\ million a month, because they got concessional loans at \nthe Fed? Is that how they are given these funds? Is that why? I don't \nknow. Is it taxpayers' money? I don't know. We have a right to know, in \nmy judgment. I think it is an outrage that we and the American people \nare having to demand from the Federal Reserve Board to turn over \ninformation when the Chairman of the Fed himself said transparency is \nimportant.\n  So here we are every day reading about these unbelievable bonuses on \nWall Street, every day reading about it, and in many cases from \ncompanies that steered this country into a ditch with credit default \nswaps, subprime loans, you name it, securitizing everything with \nunbelievable wagering, and trading derivatives for their own \nproprietary accounts in FDIC-insured banks.\n  I wrote about that 15 years ago. The cover story of the Washington \nMonthly magazine was my cover story, and it was titled ``Very Risky \nBusiness.'' Derivatives were only $16 trillion then in the United \nStates. But I said then, 15 years ago: You can't allow FDIC-insured \nbanks to trade on their own accounts for derivatives. You might just as \nwell put a Keno table in the lobby of the bank. If you want to gamble, \ngo to Las Vegas, I wrote.\n  It is not a surprise that we saw this unbelievable, spectacular crash \nthat hurt a lot of people but now appears not to have hurt those who \nengineered it in the first place because they are making record \nprofits.\n  My point is pretty simple. It is that we have a right to know, and \nthe Federal Reserve Board has a responsibility to tell us, what the \nfacts are. The American people are plenty upset and have a reason to be \nupset about the two economies they see, one in which people are doing \nvery well, making $1\\1/2\\ million a month in bonuses, and then others \nin which people are continuing to be told: Your job is gone. We are \nsorry. This economy isn't working quite right, so your job is gone.\n  Well, in my judgment, our first and most important responsibility, \nall of us, is to try to get this economic engine restarted and running \nwell. This\n\n[[Page S10955]]\n\nPresident is trying very hard. My colleague, the majority leader, is \ndoing everything he can. We need some cooperation to help make that \nhappen. But I hope all of us are committed to understanding that we are \non one team, and that team ought to have an identical goal; that is, to \nbegin to restore our economic health, and even as we do that, to do \nfinancial reform that will make sure this can't happen again.\n  That is also coming in a while and is pretty controversial. I have \nsome significant differences with some who are writing these things. I \nthink the issue of too big to fail ought to be gone and done. We ought \nnot have institutions that are too big to fail. If they are too big to \nfail, that is no-fault capitalism, and I am not in favor of no-fault \ncapitalism.\n  I wish to mention that I have just talked about the two economies and \nwhat I think is the priority. I have had great angst. I have talked to \na lot of folks who are probably tired of hearing from me to say: You \nknow what. Health care is important, yes; but it doesn't rank No. 1 \nwith me. Getting this engine started ranks No. 1 with me. Getting \npeople back on payrolls, putting people back to work, getting jobs \ncreated, finding out how do you--especially with small- and medium-\nsized businesses who, by the way, can't get loans. Too many of them \ntoday are failing because they can't get credit anyplace.\n  The biggest economic institutions are out there buying and selling \nand trading and effectively gambling on their own proprietary accounts \nwhile not enough money is going out with respect to lending to small- \nand medium-sized businesses. Isn't it interesting that the Federal \nReserve Board was a big old sponge to say: Come to us; we will now do \ndirect lending to the biggest financial firms. How about opening that \nwindow to small businesses and medium businesses so they can go \ndirectly to the Fed? They will not do that. I suppose you can't do \nthat. But why not? If you are doing it for the biggest, how about doing \nit for the folks on Main Street who are struggling, trying to get \nthrough this recession. That is what I mean by two economies.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Now, because we are on health care--we are going to have health care \non the floor of the Senate very soon--I wish to make a couple of \ncomments about it and then complete my statement. This is about \npriorities. Yes, health care is a priority. It doesn't rank above the \neconomy for me but, nonetheless, it is coming to the floor.\n  The President said: I campaigned on it. It is important. We need to \naddress health care.\n  I don't disagree. The question is, Are we going to sit around and \njust decide whatever happens, happens on health care? That seems to be \nthe policy of a good number of my colleagues on the other side, to just \nsay no to everything. If that is the case, what do we do when the next \n10 percent increase in your insurance bill or the next 12 percent \nincrease drives that business out of business because they can't afford \nto pay it or says to that family: Here is the bill, and I know you \ncan't afford to pay it, so tough luck. You are without health \ninsurance.\n  I met a woman a while back that 10 years ago had $600,000 in the \nbank, she told me. She owned a home, she had a job, and she had health \ninsurance. She had pretty decent equity in her home. It is 10 years \nlater. She is a quadriplegic, she has had unbelievable expenses with a \nhealth condition that has continued to deteriorate in a dramatic way. \nShe needs an unbelievable amount of care. It is all gone. Her job, the \n$600,000 saved for retirement, the equity in her home, it is all gone.\n  By the way, yes; she was insured. But insurance policies in most \ncases have a cap, and most people don't know that, a lifetime cap. That \nmeans a good many people are one serious illness away from bankruptcy. \nSo what do we do? Do we say to that woman: You know what. That is just \ntough luck. You live in this country and those are the rules. Or do you \npass some legislation that maybe changes the rules a bit?\n  I have been trying now for I think 3 years to eliminate lifetime caps \non insurance policies. The impact of it is very small nationally but \ncan be critical individually to someone who is hit with a devastating \ndisease. Nearly one-half of the bankruptcies in this country are a \nresult of health care costs. Think of that. We are one of the few \ncountries left to say: If you get sick, if something awful happens to \nyou or a member of your family, you might well have to file for \nbankruptcy. Tough luck. It doesn't happen in many other countries.\n  Well, the question for me at the end of the day on health care--and I \nam one of those who hasn't signed up to anything. We have had five \ncommittees, I think, work on it. I have not been part of a Gang of Six. \nI have not been part of the Finance Committee or the HELP Committee, so \nI am a gang of one. Probably, we are going to have maybe 60 or 70 gangs \nof one who have never had a chance to offer suggestions or amendments \non health care. To me, at the end of the day, if whatever is done on \nthe floor of the Senate doesn't effectively and really--I am talking \nabout really--find a way to put the brakes on health care costs, we \nwill have wasted a lot of time and not passed legislation because that \nis not something I am particularly interested in supporting.\n  If we are not going to put the brakes on these dramatic cost \nincreases, this is, in my judgment, a wasted exercise. We have to try \nto see if we can control costs and expand coverage. Even as we do that, \nthere are some other things that are important to me. None of these \npieces of legislation deal with the issue of prescription drugs. One of \nthe fastest rising costs of health care is the cost of prescription \ndrugs. I have often used this description which describes it better \nthan I can, and I will ask unanimous consent to show these bottles I \nhave in my desk.\n  This is Lipitor. It is made in Ireland. In Ireland they make Lipitor, \nthe best-selling cholesterol medicine, I think, in this country, to \ncontrol cholesterol. The same pill, put in the same bottle, made in the \nsame plant, FDA-approved, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the \ndifference is the price. They put it in this bottle and ship it to \nCanada, and you pay $1.83 per capsule. In this bottle, to the U.S. \nconsumer, it is $4.40 per capsule. The difference? No difference, 20 \nmilligrams of Lipitor, the difference is price.\n  We get to pay the highest price in the world. It is not just the \nUnited States or Canada; it is Italy, Germany, France, you name it. We \nget to pay the highest price in the world for brand-name drugs. And it \nis just not fair. It is just not fair.\n  I intend to offer an amendment with my colleagues that tries to \nprovide some fair pricing on prescription drugs. That will be important \nto me. The question of whether that is part of this will be important \nto me.\n  I know there is a tremendous push-back by the pharmaceutical \nindustry. Let me be quick to say, I admire the pharmaceutical industry. \nThey have produced lifesaving prescription drugs. They actually spend \nslightly more money on advertising and promotion than they do on \nresearch and development, which I think is rather strange. I have said \nmany times that when you are brushing your teeth in the morning with \nthe radio on or television on and you hear an ad that says: You know \nwhat you should do today? You should go ask your doctor whether the \npurple pill is right for you.\n  Every day they do that. It almost makes you feel like you want to \nfind a doctor and say: Should I be taking the purple pill? Maybe you \nneed Flomax or whatever. They advertise every single day and spend more \nmoney on marketing, promotion, and advertising than on research and \ndevelopment. A substantial amount of the research and development comes \nfrom the National Institutes of Health and then it is distributed to \ncompanies around the country that produce the medicine. Prescription \ndrug prices have to be a part of this. I intend to offer the amendment \nwith my colleague.\n  The reimbursement issues with respect to the smaller States, with the \nhighest quality have received the lowest historical reimbursement \ndating back to when Medicare started. That is fundamentally wrong and \nhas to change. There are a series of things that I think will need to \nbe done on the floor of the Senate to address some of the issues with \nthis legislation.\n  Finally, I will conclude by saying another part of this agenda that \nis being discussed is climate change. Some say\n\n[[Page S10956]]\n\nthat we have take up climate change right now, because Copenhagen is \ncoming up. We have to address climate change. My view is we passed an \nenergy bill 6 months ago, in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee that does exactly what you would do to address climate \nchange. Including maximizing renewable energy and building the \ntransmission to move the energy from places where it is produced to the \nload centers. The bill passed by the Senate Energy Committee also \nincludes increasing building efficiency, which is the lowest hanging \nfruit. This legislation also includes a renewable electricity standard, \nwhich will be the first time in the history of this country that we \nwill say that 15 percent of all electricity must come from renewable \nsources. I want that to be increased to 20 percent. The Senate Energy \nCommittee's bill, in my judgment, should be brought to the floor ahead \nof climate change. You should take care of the policy changes that move \nyou in the right direction first, and then bring climate change to the \nfloor of the Senate and deal with the timetables.\n  Many of my colleagues feel that is an inappropriate approach. I think \nit is exactly what we should do. In my judgment, I don't think we are \ngoing to do climate change on the floor between now and the end of the \nyear. If we don't get to climate change this year, nor bring the Senate \nEnergy Committee bill to the floor, it means that we turned the corner \nthis year without considering climate change legislation or the Senate \nEnergy Committee's bill. That doesn't make sense to me. I will speak to \nthat later. My colleagues are waiting to speak, so I will speak about \nthat later.\n  I think, in the context of what is important, and how we should \nproceed, for me, with respect to energy and climate change. It is not \nthat I oppose climate change legislation, although I do oppose the \n``trade'' portion of cap and trade. I have no intention of creating a \n$1 trillion securities trading market on Wall Street, to have them \ntrade on Monday and Tuesday with investment speculators, so we can find \nout the cost of our electricity on Thursday and Friday. I have very \nlittle confidence in the creation of a market to trade carbon \nsecurities. I believe there are other ways to do it.\n  It is not that I am opposed to climate change legislation, if it is \nstructured properly. I think something is happening to our climate. We \nought to take no-regret steps to address climate change. Senator \nBingaman and I along with others have written an energy bill that ought \nto come before climate change legislation, that will advance our \ncountry's interests in addressing the policies needed to do to deal \nwith climate change.\n  I will speak about energy at another time at greater length. Those \nrepresent some of my thoughts about the agenda. Again, on health care, \nI think a lot of people will come to the floor on health care, with a \nvery open notion about wanting to vote on a lot of amendments. At the \nend of the day, saying: Is this something that advances our country's \ninterests or doesn't it? I have not made that judgment at this point on \nhealth care. I will be a part of the people who make amendments. Then I \nwill make a judgment. I will measure it two ways: Does this put the \nbrakes on health care costs and is it paid for? Second, does it extend \ncoverage to those folks who don't have coverage because they cannot \nafford it? If we do that, we will have done something good for the \ncountry. If not, there will be great difficulty in passing it on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/30/senate-section/article/S10956-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10956-S10957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LEADING THE WAY ON GREEN JOBS\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, my home State of Delaware has been the \nrecipient of some good news this week and so I thought this would be a \ngood time to come to the floor and discuss how Delaware is leading the \nway in responding to the challenge of climate change and creating green \njobs.\n  This is a critical time in our history. At stake are the jobs and \neconomic future of our children and grandchildren. Unfortunately, as we \nemerge from this economic crisis, many of the jobs we have lost will \nnot return. To make a full recovery, we need to create the next \ngeneration of jobs. I believe that the jobs leading the way will be the \nclean and green energy industries of tomorrow.\n  I am proud to say that my home State of Delaware is already leading \nthe way.\n  Like many States, my State once had a proud record of automobile \nmanufacturing. All of my colleagues know, though, that the recent \neconomic downturn has hit already downtrodden auto companies especially \nhard, and, in recent months, our two auto plants were closed.\n  This is not simply a question of economics.\n  For the families who saw paychecks end and the dignity of work \ndisappear, these closures were a real personal tragedy.\n  The men and women who worked in our auto plants are some of the most \ndedicated, capable workers I have ever met. They embraced an American \ndream--the chance to work hard at a decent job and provide for a \nfamily. And then, in the midst of an economic crisis not seen in \ndecades, they found themselves looking to start over.\n  They did their job. They held up their side of the bargain. They went \nto work everyday and worked hard at their job--and in the process made \nour GM plant and our Chrysler plant two of the most productive and \nefficient plants around.\n  That is why we from Delaware have been fighting to help them land on \ntheir feet. We know the potential of these trained, hard-working, eager \nemployees, and we know the decency of these families.\n  Just recently, I was able to join Vice President Biden, Delaware \nGovernor Markell, and our congressional delegation in announcing that \nFisker Automotive will begin building plug-in hybrids at the old \nGeneral Motors Boxwood Road plant.\n  In a few years time, we expect that Fisker will be building cars that \nget more than 100 miles per gallon--and building as many as 100,000 of \nthem per year. This will mean nearly 1,500 permanent manufacturing \njobs.\n  Before we get there, there will be hundreds or thousands of good \nconstruction jobs created by revamping and renovating the plant to \nproduce these state-of-the-art vehicles.\n  But this happy tale is not possible without crucial support. Fisker \nwas awarded a loan by the Department of Energy, part of a program \ndesigned to jump start the production of advanced vehicles.\n  At the same time, Governor Jack Markell has worked hard to keep the \nplant in condition to be retooled, and to convince Fisker that Delaware \noffers the ideal market to begin building tomorrow's cars.\n  And I believe the clincher was the highly trained workforce we had to \noffer.\n  In fact, Fisker will be hiring many of the GM employees to work back \nin their old building--to work at building a state-of-the-art advanced \ncar.\n  At the same time, the University of Delaware has announced a plan to \nbuy the old Chrylser Newark plant and convert it to an advanced \nresearch facility. These 272 acres adjacent to the campus are truly, as \nUniversity of Delaware president Patrick Harker has said, a ``once in a \nlifetime opportunity.''\n  And the university has indicated that much of this research and \ndevelopment to be carried out there will be toward the energy \ntechnologies we will need to combat climate change and to compete in \ntomorrow's economy.\n  In fact, the university is already a leader in any of these fields. \nIt is a recognized center of excellence for solar power research and \neducation, as designated by the Department of Energy, and a center of \nexcellence for composite materials as well.\n  Just this week, the university was awarded nearly $4.5 million for \nresearch into magnetic materials from a new program called ARPA-E.\n  The Advanced Research Projects Agency--Energy has a mission, ``to \ndevelop nimble, creative, and inventive approaches to transform the \nglobal energy landscape while advancing America's technology \nleadership.''\n  The research the University of Delaware is doing could greatly \nincrease the efficiency of electric motors--for electric and hybrid \nvehicles and for wind turbines alike. At the same time,\n\n[[Page S10957]]\n\nit could drastically reduce our imports of rare Earth minerals that \noften come from the darkest corners of our world.\n  At the same time, DuPont was winning $9 million from ARPA-E for its \nresearch into seaweed-based biobutanol.\n  What is biobutanol, my colleagues may ask. The answer is that \nbiobutanol is an advanced fuel designed for use in place of gasoline.\n  We have heard a lot about ethanol and how it can transform our energy \nlandscape and it will play a very significant role--and already does.\n  But it is not flawless. It tends to be corrosive, meaning that we \ncannot use our existing pipeline infrastructure and that we must \nretrofit our vehicles.\n  At the same time, it has a lower energy density than gasoline--in \nother words, fewer miles per gallon.\n  Biobutanol may very well have fixed those problems. It has nearly the \nenergy density of gasoline and is much less corrosive than ethanol. And \nnow, thanks to research from DuPont and others, we are learning how to \nmake it from seaweed.\n  Imagine a scalable source of biomass--solar-powered, low-carbon \nbioenergy--that does not take up existing arable land or demand potable \nwater.\n  Imagine a fuel built from that source that operates like conventional \ngasoline.\n  Wouldn't that be a big step forward for addressing our climate \nchallenges and for ensuring that tomorrow's vehicles will be powered by \nAmerican ideas?\n  And DuPont is leading in several other fields. It is an innovator in \nthin-film solar panels, cellulosic ethanol, and fuel cells.\n  Across town, W.L. Gore, whom we all know for the miracle fabric Gore-\nTex, is a market leader in the membranes essential for fuel cells.\n  If we hope to move someday to a hydrogen vehicle, and I do, we will \nneed their expertise and excellence.\n  Perhaps the most significant renewable energy project underway in \nDelaware, however, is actually happening just outside of Delaware. It \nis happening in our ocean.\n  A company called Bluewater Wind is leading the way in developing \noffshore wind power in the United States.\n  In countries like Denmark and the United Kingdom, they have already \nrecognized that the abundant ocean breezes provide a vast, constant, \nrenewable source of electricity. It is time for us to catch up.\n  In fact, the Delaware offshore wind park will be larger than all \noffshore wind farms currently in existence, although other large farms \nare being planned and built in other countries.\n  What it will be is America's first.\n  In fact, Delaware yesterday hosted the Nation's first Federal \noffshore renewable energy task force meeting.\n  When the Department of Energy has concluded that offshore wind can \nmeet 70 percent of all domestic electricity needs, how can we afford to \nignore this resource?\n  And when nations around the world have wind, waves, and electricity \ndemand, shouldn't we try to claim the leadership position in this \ntechnology?\n  That is why I am glad that the Federal Government, by providing the \nright incentives for wind power, and the State of Delaware, by working \nwith Bluewater to ensure that there will be demand for that power, have \nconvinced Bluewater Wind that Delaware is the place to start.\n  Mr. President, I could name hundreds of other areas where Delaware \nand Delawareans are leading the way in creating tomorrow's jobs.\n  We are installing combined heat and power projects to increase the \nefficiency of a chemical factory and of a community college. Our port \nis aiming to revamp its infrastructure to take advantage of green \ntechnologies that will make it cleaner and cheaper to operate.\n  We have set up an innovative new financing mechanism, the Sustainable \nEnergy Utility, that will help get clean technologies through the so-\ncalled ``valley of death.'' Even our schools are getting in on the act, \ninstalling solar panels on gymnasium rooftops.\n  We have small start up companies that are leading the way on a whole \nhost of technologies, from less toxic disinfectants to safety \nreflectors, windmills and biofuels to recycling old carpet.\n  Companies like ILC Dover, that manufacture components of space suits, \nare leading the way in developing advanced materials, while CMI \nElectric, a solar panel seller and installer, has a banner on its Web \nsite that says ``We are hiring apply here.'' We need more of those five \nwords.\n\n  I congratulate the leaders of my State, in industry and government, \nin academia and private life, for recognizing that the future of our \neconomy and, thus, the legacy we leave future generations depends on \nleading the way on green technologies and in green industries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/30/senate-section/article/S10957-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10957-S10958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GOLDSTONE REPORT\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, my colleague in the New York State \nAssembly, Alec Brook-Krasny, wrote two letters regarding the United \nNations fact finding mission led by Justice Richard Goldstone, the \nGoldstone Report. Assembly Member Brook-Krasny represents the \nsignificant Russian speaking community of New York. He voiced the \nconcerns of our constituents in writing to the Russian Minister of \nForeign Affairs Lavrov to raise concerns about Russia's vote in favor \nof the recommendations in the Goldstone Report. Likewise, he \nrepresented the community's views in voicing appreciation of Ukraine's \nvote along with the United States against adoption of the report's \nrecommendations.\n  I commend Assembly Member Brook-Krasny for his leadership on this \nissue. I and a bipartisan group of 31 other Senators sent a letter of \nconcern about the bias and flaws in the original mandate and ultimate \nrecommendations of the Goldstone Report. We commended the State \nDepartment's leadership on this issue. As the report moves forward for \nconsideration by the United Nations General Assembly, I believe it is \nimportant that the United States continue to do what it can to ensure \nthat the Goldstone Report is not used unfairly and cynically to condemn \nIsrael without looking at all of the facts and events leading to the \nconflict.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attached letters from New York State \nAssembly Member Alec Brook-Krasny to Russian Minister of Foreign \nAffairs Lavrov and Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Poroshenko, \nrespectively, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              The Assembly, State of New York,\n\n                                     Albany, NY, October 23, 2009.\n     H.E. Sergey Lavrov,\n     Minister of Foreign Affairs, Russian Federation, Moscow.\n       Dear Minister Lavrov: First, I would like to note that \n     although foreign relations is not a part of my job \n     description as a member of the New York State Assembly, I \n     found it impossible to ignore an event that has seriously \n     concerned more than ten thousand of my constituents--natives \n     of the former USSR.\n       I write to you in regards to the recent vote at the United \n     Nations Human Rights Council. Russia has voted in favor of \n     endorsing the conclusions of former South African Judge \n     Richard Goldstone's commission. The report states that \n     antiterrorist operations in Gaza in January 2009 by Israel \n     should be considered as war crimes and deliberate destruction \n     of civilian population. The Goldstone Report mentions some \n     anonymous armed groups, but it says nothing about eight years \n     of the daily firing of rockets at civilians in the south of \n     Israel by Hamas and other terrorists.\n       I consider the decision of the Russian Government to \n     endorse the Goldstone Report at the UN Human Rights Council \n     deeply troubling. This decision is directed not only against \n     Israel; it significantly reduces Israel's ability to protect \n     its citizens, including the thousands of Russian citizens \n     living today in Israel.\n       Support of Goldstone's report by the Human Rights Council \n     has surprised and aggravated many people, including one of \n     founders of Human Rights Watch, Robert Bernstein. On October \n     19, 2009, New York Times published his article in which he \n     condemned this one-sided report. Even Richard Goldstone \n     himself, in a recent interview with the Swiss newspaper Le \n     Temps, has recognized that in his report ``there is no phrase \n     with condemnation of Hamas''.\n       The decision of the UN Human Rights Council will have a \n     negative effect on the continuation and development of the \n     peace process in the Middle East. In the resolution approved \n     by 25 out of 47 members of Human Rights Council, there is no \n     mention of the criminal and terrorist characteristics of \n     Hamas activity. In addition, nothing is mentioned about the \n     long-term bombardments of Sderot and other cities of Israel \n     from Gaza prior to the IDF operation. During eight years of \n     incessant rocket bombardments of Israeli territory, the \n     United Nations kept silent and never adopted a resolution \n     protecting Israeli civilians. When Israel finally\n\n[[Page S10958]]\n\n     decided to end the bombardment of its cities, the Human \n     Rights Council endorsed a resolution that demonized Israel \n     and its army in the eyes of the international community.\n       The resolution supported by Russia undermines the interests \n     of those moderate forces in the Palestinian autonomy which \n     would be willing to establish peace with Israel. Goldstone's \n     one-sided report strengthens Hamas's position and sharply \n     weakens the position of the Palestinian government led by \n     Mahmud Abbas. As a result of the Human Rights Council's \n     resolution, the ``Hezbollah-Syria-Iran'' Axis, has gained \n     support, legitimacy and international approval.\n       Additionally, Goldstone's report has strengthened Israel's \n     belief that all of their attempts to negotiate a peace with \n     the Palestinian Arabs, including voluntary withdrawal from \n     Gaza and other territorial concessions, will always be \n     ignored by the international community. At the same time, \n     reciprocal steps against terrorists will lead to condemnation \n     by the United Nations.\n       Lastly, approval of Goldstone's report will lead to new \n     problems in the struggle against terrorism. In Gaza, Hamas \n     and Jihad widely applied the tactic of using civilians as a \n     ``human shield''. Thus, the resolution of the Human Rights \n     Council has actually proven this is a successful form of \n     terrorist activity. This resolution will complicate the \n     struggle of civilized countries against terrorist activity. \n     It is surprising that Russia, whose citizens constantly \n     suffer from actions of terrorism, has voted for the \n     resolution, thereby justifying these ``human shield'' \n     tactics.\n       Russian-speaking Americans have a number of close relatives \n     and friends in Israel. But there is another reason for our \n     anxiety about the unilateral position of the UN Human Rights \n     Council. Israel is a deeply peaceful country, the only \n     democracy in the Middle East, surrounded by autocratic \n     regimes. In Israel, more than 80 human rights organizations \n     freely operate, a free press exists, and the judicial system \n     often rules against other branches of its government. There \n     are many political parties, democratic elections, liberal \n     journalists, a politically active and creative scientific \n     community, and independent courts. This is the country \n     accused of deliberate attacks against civilians and crimes \n     against humanity?\n       In the last few years Israel has undertaken many steps for \n     rapprochement with Russia, including the canceling of visa \n     requirements for Russian tourists. I was born and raised in \n     Moscow, and still hope that Russia will become a strategic \n     partner of Israel and will not always automatically vote in \n     the United Nations, as the USSR did, for anti-Israel \n     resolutions. We in America hope that the Russian government \n     aspires to achieve peace in the Middle East, instead of \n     creating new problems and conflicts. A country of such great \n     culture and greater human achievements cannot be on a par \n     with rogue countries such as Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, \n     and Syria.\n       I thank you for your attention to this matter, and I hope \n     to receive a concrete and constructive answer to this letter.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Alec Brook-Krasny,\n     Member of the Assembly, 46th District.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              The Assembly, State of New York,\n\n                                     Albany, NY, October 23, 2009.\n     H.E. Petro Poroshenko,\n     Minister of Foreign Affairs,\n     Kyiv, Ukraine.\n       Your Excellency: I am writing to express my deep \n     appreciation to your Government and to you personally, for \n     voting against the one-sided resolution adopted by the Human \n     Rights Council in Geneva early this month. I express this \n     appreciation also on behalf of my constituency, which is \n     comprised of thousands of immigrants from Ukraine to the U.S. \n     who now live in the district that I represent at the New York \n     State Assembly. I am especially satisfied by the principled \n     stance of your government, as I know that the most respected \n     American Jewish organization, AJC, urged your predecessor to \n     take this position at their meeting with the Ukrainian \n     delegation in New York last month.\n       Regrettably, this harmful resolution was endorsed by the \n     majority of 47 members of the Council, but the vote taken by \n     Ukrainian Government, and other democratic nations, \n     underscores the moral bankruptcy of that resolution. As you \n     know, the resolution endorses the recommendations contained \n     in the Goldstone report, which seeks to set the international \n     community in a comprehensive political campaign against \n     Israel. I trust that Ukrainian Government will continue to \n     oppose attempts to single out and censure Israel in the \n     international arena.\n       By voting against the endorsement of Goldstone report your \n     government decided to be in the minority rather than forsake \n     its values. We salute your government for adhering to this \n     noble principle.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Alec Brook-Krasny,\n     Member of the Assembly, 46th District.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/30/senate-section/article/S10958-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10958-S10959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GLOBAL CHILD SURVIVAL ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the Global \nChild Survival Act of 2009, which I introduced earlier this week along \nwith Senators Corker and Durbin.\n  I do so in the hopes that the United States will take these important \nsteps towards living up to its obligation as the world's wealthiest \nnation.\n  Ours is a moral obligation, of course; reducing mortality rates for \nchildren in developing areas of the world is within our grasp. We--we \nin this very body--have the power to save millions of innocent and \nvulnerable lives.\n  Ours is also a literal obligation. As part of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, the United States has made an explicit commitment--\nalong with 188 other nations--to doing its part to reach this goal.\n  To date, we have made significant progress and improved the lives of \ntens of thousands of individuals. But unless we bring to bear the full \nforce of our knowledge, our creativity, our compassion, and our \ncommitment to implementing effective strategies, we will ultimately \nfail to keep our promise to millions around the world who need us.\n  I can't accept that.\n  Not when nearly 9 million children under the age of five die every \nyear--more than 24,000 every day. That is a number equal to the \npopulation of South Windsor, CT, dying every day--mostly from \npreventable and treatable causes like pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, and \nsepsis.\n  Not when nearly 4 million newborns every year die in the first 4 \nweeks of life.\n  Not when 2.5 million children die each year from diseases for which \nvaccines are readily available.\n  Not when it is clear that simply by living up to the commitments we \nhave already made, to say nothing of furthering our commitments, we \ncould save so many lives so easily.\n  This is a moral imperative. But it is also a strategic imperative. \nThe state of a country's public health is inextricably linked to its \nsecurity. Poor health systems around the world represent a danger to \nAmerica. Last year, the Director of National Intelligence reported as \nfollows:\n\n       Chronic, non-communicable diseases; neglected tropical \n     diseases; maternal and child mortality; malnutrition; \n     sanitation and access to clean water; and availability of \n     basic health-care also affect the US national interest \n     through their impacts on the economies, governments, and \n     militaries of key countries and regions.\n\n  Countries with high child and maternal mortality are inherently less \nstable and more prone to violence. The consequences of failing to live \nup to our commitments under the Millennium Development Goals will be \nfelt around the world.\n  These goals are not beyond our reach. Already, the increased \ndistribution of simply technologies like mosquito nets and basic \nvaccinations has reduced child mortality to its lowest level since we \nbegan keeping track of the statistics in 1960.\n  Simple efforts like distributing bed nets and micronutrients are \nsaving 10,000 children a day.\n  But our success to date is not an excuse for complacency going \nforward. There is more we can do.\n  We could save 1.4 million newborns by encouraging exclusive breast \nfeeding for the first 6 months of life.\n  We could cut in half newborn mortality and reduce maternal mortality \nsimply by providing basic childbirth assistance--things like clean \nequipment and trained attendants.\n  If we make simple remedies like oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea \nand antibiotics for respiratory infections available in accordance with \nthe Millennium Development Goals, we could cut the child mortality rate \nby two-thirds, saving nearly 6 million lives a year.\n  The legislation requires the administration to develop and implement \na strategy to improve the health of, and reduce mortality rates among, \nnewborns and children in developing countries.\n  It supports effective, life-saving programs to provide children and \nmothers with basic minerals and vitamins that we daily take for \ngranted, and it takes on the scourge of easily treatable and \npreventable diseases such as pneumonia and cholera.\n  It empowers young girls by helping them get good educations, and \nprotects them from abusive practices such as female genital cutting.\n  It establishes a task force to monitor and evaluate the progress of \ngovernment agencies responsible for ensuring that we meet our \ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals.\n\n[[Page S10959]]\n\n  It puts Congress on record as supporting innovative intervention \nstrategies--from community based health centers to ready-to-use food \ntherapies.\n  It authorizes the President to put our money where our intentions \nare.\n  Finally, this bill makes an important statement at a pivotal time. We \nare close to reaching a key milestone on the road to achieving our \nMillennium Development Goals in 2015. This legislation will put the \nSenate on record supporting robust child survival health programs as \nthe international community redoubles its efforts to achieve these \ngoals and prepares for the 2010 G8 and G20 summit in Canada, where \nchild survival and maternal health will be a major priority for the \nassembled nations.\n  It doesn't cost a lot to save a life. Children in developing \ncountries die of diarrhea every day--but the oral rehydration therapy \nneeded to treat it costs just 54 cents. Children die of respiratory \ninfections--but the treatment is just 71 cents.\n  The United States does a lot to combat child mortality. We have \ndevoted more than $6 billion to child survival programs over the past \n20 years. It has worked. But we can do more. We have committed to do \nmore. We must do more.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort, which has already \ngarnered bipartisan support. Millions of lives hang in the balance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/30/senate-section/article/S10959-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that it agreed to \nthe concurrent resolution (S.

A bill to extend the temporary duty suspensions on certain \ncotton shirting fabrics, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I seek recognition to introduce \nlegislation entitled the Cotton Shirt Industry Tariff Relief and \nPromotion Act. This legislation will strengthen our domestic dress \nshirt manufacturers and the pima cotton growers. My bill extends a \ntechnical correction that levels the playing field by correcting an \nanomaly from previous trade agreements that has unfairly advantaged \nforeign producers and sent hundreds of jobs offshore.\n  This legislation extends the reduction of duties levied on cotton \nshirting fabric that is not made in the United States. U.S. law \nrecognizes this lack of fabric availability and has granted special \nfavorable trade concessions to manufacturers in Canada, Mexico, the \nCaribbean, the Andean region, and Africa. The U.S. allowed shirts to \nenter this country duty-free from many other countries, while failing \nto reduce tariffs on those manufacturers that stayed in the U.S. and \nwere forced to compete on these uneven terms. My bill extends the \ncorrection of this inequity.\n  This legislation also recognizes the need to promote the U.S. \nshirting manufacturing and textiles sectors, and does so through the \nextension of a Cotton Competitiveness grant program, which is funded \nthrough a portion of previously collected duties.\n  Our country has experienced an enormous loss of jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector. It is critical that our domestic manufacturers \nare able to compete on a level playing field. My legislation is a \nconcrete step that this Congress can take to reduce the hemorrhaging of \nU.S. manufacturing jobs.\n  One group of beneficiaries of this legislation is a Gitman Brothers \nfactory in Ashland, PA. The Ashland Shirt and Pajama factory was built \nin 1948 and employs 132 workers. This factory in the Lehigh Valley \nturns out world class shirts with such labels as Saks Fifth Avenue that \nare shipped across the U.S. Their shirts are made of pima cotton that \nis grown in the Southwestern U.S., but spun into fabric only by special \nmills in Western Europe. Gitman must compete against Canadian shirt \ncompanies that import the same fabric tariff-free and who can then ship \ntheir shirts into the U.S. tariff-free under NAFTA. These workers and \ntheir families deserve trade laws that do not chase their jobs \noffshore.\n  This legislation enjoys the support of the domestic shirting \nindustry, UNITE, and the Pima cotton association. I offer this \nlegislation on behalf of the men and women of the Gitman factory in \nAshland, the domestic dress shirting industry, and the pima cotton \ngrowers, so that for them, free trade will indeed be fair trade as \nwell.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2607.
