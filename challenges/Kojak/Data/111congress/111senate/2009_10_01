Madam President, as the Senate fulfills its \nconstitutional duty this week of providing for the common defense, it \nwill also have an opportunity to fulfill its oversight responsibilities \nin the global war on terror and, more specifically, in the crucial \ntheater of Afghanistan. Later today, the ranking member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, Senator McCain, will offer an amendment to \nthe Defense appropriations bill that calls on our top commander in \nAfghanistan, GEN Stanley McChrystal, and the Centcom Commander GEN \nDavid Petraeus, to come to Washington to explain to Congress and the \nAmerican people why they believe the situation in Afghanistan is so \nperilous, what they believe is necessary for our success, and why.\n  There is recent precedent for this. Many Americans will recall that 2 \nyears ago, in accordance with a requirement contained in another \nDefense appropriations bill, GEN David Petraeus came to Washington to \nexplain what had gone wrong in Iraq and what he and the rest of our \nforces were doing to turn things around. By providing a sober \nassessment of the situation that cut through the political cross-\ncurrents of the moment, General Petraeus's testimony, along with that \nof Ambassador Ryan Crocker, focused the national debate. It left us \nnewly confident in their ability to lead us in Iraq. And it set us on a \npath of progress that continues today.\n  No one is arguing that the two situations are identical. They are \nclearly not. But it is hard to deny the urgency of the assessment that \nGeneral McChrystal sent to the White House in late August, parts of \nwhich have been made public. And it is impossible to ignore his \ndepiction of a grave and deteriorating situation on the very soil where \nal-Qaida terrorists plotted the \n9/11 attacks. General McChrystal's assessment of the worsening \nsituation in Afghanistan should be of concern to all of us, \nparticularly its account of a resurgent Taliban and a resilient al-\n\n[[Page S9994]]\n\nQaida. As the President told a Turkish audience in April, ``The world \nhas come too far to let this region backslide, and to let al Qaeda \nterrorists plot further attacks.''\n  But there is also reason to be confident. At a time of worsening \nviolence in Iraq, America was fortunate to be able to turn to General \nPetraeus, the man who literally wrote the book on counterinsurgency. \nAnd now, at a time of worsening violence in Afghanistan, we are just as \nfortunate to be able to turn to General McChrystal, who in reported \nprevious combat experience supervised, planned, and executed \ncounterterrorism operations.\n  No one is better equipped to assess the situation on the ground--and \nwhether it calls for a new counterinsurgency strategy, or for a \ncontinuation of the same kind of counterterrorism strategy which the \nprevious administration pursued, and which the current Vice President \nis reportedly urging the current administration to embrace.\n  Earlier this year, President Obama expressed his confidence in \nGeneral McChrystal by appointing him to his current mission. Following \nthe President's lead, the Senate expressed its confidence in General \nMcChrystal by confirming him for his current mission without dissent. \nNow it is time for Congress and the President to work together on a \nplan for success.\n  Since no strategy will succeed without the support of the public, the \nPresident will doubtlessly want to explain to the American people why \nhe plans to accept or reject the McChrystal Plan. This is especially \ntrue of a counterinsurgency strategy, which, by definition, requires a \nlarge commitment of troops and resources and great endurance on the \npart of the Armed Forces and the public alike.\n  Congress, for its part, has a responsibility to fund and to oversee \nour armed forces. Part of that is ensuring that we have the best \ninformation possible, and that we make that information available to \nthe American people. And that is why it is crucial that we have an \nopportunity to hear General McChrystal's personal assessment of the \nmission that we confirmed him for, and that we give him an opportunity \nto explain why he has concluded that more troops are needed to avoid \nfailure in Afghanistan.\n  General Petraeus's testimony served a necessary purpose during an \nearlier debate over strategy. General McChrystal's will do the same in \nthis one.\n  We know he would be a willing witness. General McChrystal has spoken \nfreely about his assessment on network television. And he recently told \na visitor to Afghanistan that, if asked, he would welcome the \nopportunity to come to Washington to make the case for additional \ntroops. He also said that it is his sacred duty to provide the \nunvarnished truth. With today's vote--which I urge our friends on the \nother side of the aisle to support--the Senate will give him a chance \nto do both.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S9994-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEALTH CARE WEEK XI, DAY II\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, americans have been watching the \nhealth care debate play out in various committees in Congress, and they \nare wondering where it's all headed. I will make it easy for them. The \nfinal bill is going to cost about a trillion dollars. It is going to \ninclude $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to seniors' Medicare in order to create \na new government program. It is going to raise hundreds of billions of \ndollars in taxes on individuals and businesses. And it is going to \nexpand the government's role in the health care of every single \nAmerican, whether they like it or not, limiting choices and leading to \nthe same kind of denial and delay we have seen in other countries.\n  And then there is the issue of rushing through a bill and denying the \nAmerican people the chance to read it. Imagine that, a trillion dollars \nout of the taxpayers' wallets for a bill that will affect the health \ncare of every single American, and the majority has already voted to \ndeny a mere 72-hours of public review before voting on it. This is \noutrageous, and hopefully this is not the way the majority decides to \ngo forward.\n  One group that has become increasingly vocal in its criticism of this \nlegislation is our Nation's Governors. Over the course of this debate, \nat least one in three of them have issued statements expressing their \nurgent concerns about a proposed expansion of Medicaid, which will \nforce them either to cut services, raise taxes, or both. That is on top \nof the tax hikes that come about on the Federal level as a result of \nthis bill.\n  One Democrat Governor had this to say of the Medicaid proposal: ``. . \n. it's very scary for governors to be saying as soon as the revenues \nget back there, the Federal Government is going to come in and say \nhere's how you're going to spend your new money.''\n  Governor Schwarzenegger of California says he won't support Federal \nhealth care reform proposals that impose billions of dollars in new \ncosts on California.\n  Governor Crist of Florida says the proposed Medicaid expansion would \nhave a crippling effect on Florida's State economy.\n  Governor Linda Lingle of Hawaii says the proposed Medicaid expansion \nwould be tantamount to mandating a tax increase on every resident of \nHawaii . . . and further harm residents who are struggling to make ends \nmeet.\n  Idaho Governor ``Butch'' Otter calls the proposal ``an . . . \nirresponsible effort to shift a substantial and unmanageable financial \nburden to the states.''\n  Those are just a few of the comments we have heard from Governors. \nThey are issuing the same kind of dire warnings about the proposed \nhealth care legislation that Americans have been sounding for months.\n  The fact is, supporters of this legislation know that most Americans \noppose it. That is why they are not listening. And that is why they are \ntrying to rush it through without giving anybody a chance to study the \ndetails. The American people understand these proposals. They \nunderstand the strategy. And they are not happy about either.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S9994-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, a week ago, freshman Democratic \nSenators came to this floor to discuss as a group how our current \nhealth care system is broken and unsustainable. Today, we return to \naddress the challenge of runaway costs and how health care reform can \nbend the cost curve, making health care more affordable and more \naccessible to our families and our businesses.\n  Many folks have said to me: Is this really the time to take on health \ncare reform, when we are in the middle of the worst recession since the \nGreat Depression? The answer is an unequivocal yes. Now is the time. \nNow is the time because health care costs are a runaway train that can \ndo great damage to our families and our small businesses and large \nbusinesses. Indeed, consider the situation of a family when health care \ncosts have doubled in the last 9 years, so families who could afford \ninsurance just a few years ago cannot afford it today. Now health care \npremiums are rising even faster. They are expected to double in the \nnext 7 years. As a result, many families and many individuals who are \nstruggling to pay those health care premiums right now won't be able to \ndo so in just a few more years. So fixing our broken health care system \ncannot wait. Indeed, reform is essential to our families, our small \nbusinesses, and our large businesses.\n  Consider this: For a working family, every additional dollar that \ngoes into a health care premium comes out of the wages that would \notherwise go to increase the family's purchasing power.\n\n[[Page S9995]]\n\nSo rising health care premiums are a tax on family wages, a tax on \nfamily purchasing power, making it much harder for our families to get \nahead and provide for their children and establish a high quality of \nlife.\n  Controlling cost is also essential to small businesses. Small \nbusinesses want to offer health coverage to attract and keep good \nemployees, to do what is right for their employees' quality of life. \nBut runaway costs are making that more and more difficult.\n  Consider the example of the Hawthorne Auto Clinic founded and \noperated by Jim Houser and his wife Liz Dally. When they opened 26 \nyears ago, Jim and Liz were committed to offering those who worked for \nthem and with them a good benefits package, including comprehensive \nhealth care.\n  They are still able to provide health insurance to their employees, \nbut it is getting tougher. Premiums have gone from 9 percent of their \npayroll to 18 percent in just the last 5 years. As a result, they have \nhad to cut back on the benefits they have offered. Over the last \ndecade, health care premiums have skyrocketed for small businesses \nacross the board like they have for the Hawthorne Auto Clinic.\n  Large businesses see the effect as well. If you build a car in \nAmerica, it costs $1,500 in health care. If you build that same car \nacross the border in Canada and Europe, the cost is zero. In fact, in \n2007, GM spent more on health care than they did on steel. So \ncontrolling costs is essential for our large businesses to be \ncompetitive in the world, to be able to build products here in America.\n  If we do not build products in America, we will not have a middle \nclass in America. So health care reform cannot wait. Our families need \nhelp with runaway costs. Our small businesses are looking for us to \nhelp control costs, and our large businesses need reform to be \ncompetitive in the world and to build the strong economy that will \nraise all boats.\n  Today, freshmen Democratic Senators are here to discuss this from a \nnumber of perspectives. First will be Senator Roland Burris of \nIllinois. As comptroller and attorney general of Illinois, Senator \nBurris committed himself to serving the health and well-being of \nunderserved populations in his State.\n  I yield 4 minutes to my distinguished friend from Illinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I am proud to join my freshmen \ncolleagues on the floor today.\n  Across America there is a broad agreement on the need for meaningful \nhealth care reform. But there is much debate about what reform means \nand who pays the bills for keeping all our Nation's citizens well, \nincluding the disadvantaged.\n  As the center of this controversy is a simple question of dollars and \ncents, what is cost-effective reform? According to a recent study by \nthe Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, eliminating ratios \nand ethnic health disparities in this country for the period between \n2003 and 2006 would have reduced direct health care expenditures by \nnearly $230 billion.\n  Further, when the study factors in indirect economic losses, such as \nmissed days of work and premature death, the total cost of health care \ndisparities to our economy approaches $1.25 trillion over the same \nperiod. This is a cost our country cannot bear.\n  Part of the problem is a lack of coverage. People of color make up \nabout one-third of the population of the United States, but they \nrepresent one-half of the Nation's uninsured. Providing quality, \naffordable health care options, including a public plan, will help \naddress this problem.\n  We must also change the way people receive their care. In \ndisproportionately high numbers, many Black and Hispanic Americans use \nhigh-cost emergency room care for all their health needs. Often, by the \ntime they seek treatment, their ailment has reached catastrophic \nlevels. This drives everyone's costs up and puts extra strain on a \nsystem that is already stretched to the breaking point.\n  But with certain basic steps on the front end, we can create a \nhealthier nation and save a lot of money on the back end. For example, \nby encouraging and enabling health care providers to reach out to their \ncommunities, with culturally competent prevention and wellness \ninitiatives, we can prevent some of the chronic conditions and \ncatastrophic health care problems that have such a high cost for our \neconomy.\n  Basic nutrition education and access to healthy foods could \ndrastically reduce the wide disparities in diabetes and heart disease. \nExpanding the prevalence of racial and ethnic minority health care \nprofessionals could increase the cultural competence of our health \nworkforce.\n  The health reform bills under consideration take significant steps to \naddress the health disparities our country faces. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to thank the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee \nfor their tireless work in this effort.\n  As a final combined bill comes to the floor, I look forward to an \nopportunity to debate and improve upon the provisions that will help \nour Nation's disadvantaged populations get access to the health care \nthey need.\n  This is not only a moral imperative in its own right, but it will \nhelp us achieve the health cost savings our health system so \ndesperately needs.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator very much for his comments and his \nemphasis on making the best use of every dollar while addressing ethnic \ndisparities in our health care system and the dire need to invest in \nprevention and wellness.\n  Next, we will hear from Senator Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire. As \nGovernor of New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen enacted the New Hampshire \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, which provides affordable health \nand dental coverage to tens of thousands of children in her State.\n  She also initiated a senior prescription drug program, providing \nseniors with lower cost prescription drugs. I yield 4 minutes to the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Senator \nMerkley for coordinating this effort today. I am pleased to be able to, \nonce again, join my fellow freshmen Senators discussing how critical it \nis for the Senate to act on health care reform.\n  As the Senate moves to reform our broken health care system, we must \naddress the skyrocketing cost of health care. We must ensure quality in \nour health care system. Over the past several months, I have heard from \nmany individuals and families from New Hampshire who are dealing with \nthe rising costs of health care. The stories they tell me are the most \npoignant reminders of why we must reform our health care system.\n  Recently, I heard from a man named Jeff, who is from Loudon, a small \ncommunity close to the capital city of Concord. Jeff had recently lost \nhis job and with it his health insurance. So when he experienced \nswelling of his right leg and shortness of breath, he was afraid to go \nto the doctor because he was afraid he could not afford the cost.\n  So he ignored the symptoms until they got so bad he had to call 911. \nHe was taken to a local hospital. Doctors realized he had a blood clot \nin his leg which had migrated to his lung. This was a life-threatening \ncondition called a pulmonary embolism. Since treatment, his condition \nhas improved dramatically.\n  However, the final bill from the hospital was over $200,000. To this \nday, Jeff remains in debt. Think how much we could have saved if he \ncould have gone to the doctor when he first felt those symptoms. \nStories such as these are unacceptable. They can happen to anybody. The \ntruth is, similar to Jeff, we may all be one medical condition away \nfrom financial disasters because of the high cost of health care. So we \nmust work to protect hard-working individuals and families as we put \nforward a bill.\n\n  I am proud to come from New Hampshire for so many reasons but one of \nthem is because of the great work that is done by the Dartmouth \nInstitute of Health Policy. For more than 20 years, Dartmouth has been \na leader in comparative effectiveness research and has revolutionized \nour understanding of our health care system. Because of the Dartmouth \nAtlas Project, we now know there are huge variations in the way health \ncare resources are used and how money is spent depending on where we \nlive.\n  This chart shows the difference in spending among different regions \nper\n\n[[Page S9996]]\n\nMedicare patient. It is amazing to me that Medicare costs can range \nfrom the lowest spending referral region, which as you can see is just \nover $5,000, to the highest spending referral region, where in some \nparts of the country Medicare pays over $14,000 to provide the same \nkind of treatment that in other parts of the country is provided for \nonly a little over $5,000.\n  Unfortunately, the research also shows that just because someone is \nin a higher spending area, it does not mean they are going to live \nlonger or have better health outcomes. Simply put, more costly care \ndoes not mean better care. There is a fundamental problem with our \nhealth care system, and this is something we have to work on.\n  Things do not have to be this way. We can find savings in our system \nand still provide high-quality care. As I mentioned last week, we can \nsave significantly on Medicare costs by reducing hospital readmissions. \nI have introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Collins to do \nthat. We have the opportunity to fix a problem that has been around for \ngenerations. We need to work together to achieve this goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank Senator Shaheen so much. It is enormously \nvaluable to have her experience fighting for health care at the State \nlevel and bringing that to this conversation, recognizing we do have a \npartnership between what the State can do and what the Federal team can \ndo and that the goal of reforming the way we deliver health care can \nhave a huge impact on price.\n  Next, we turn to Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado. As the highly \nsuccessful superintendent of Denver Public Schools, Senator Bennet \ncommitted himself to ensuring the health and educational well-being of \nDenver's school-aged children.\n  I yield 4 minutes to my friend from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  It is good to be here this morning with all my colleagues to talk \nabout health care reform. There is a lot of disagreement about what the \nright answer is.\n  What I would like to spend my time on this morning is why the status \nquo is not an answer. I think that if we can get agreement on that, we \ncan solve the issues that confront the working families in my State and \nall across the country.\n  The median family income in Colorado has actually declined by $800 \nover the last 10 years. At the same time, the cost of health insurance \nhas gone up by 97 percent. It has doubled during that time. That has \nhappened all over the country. This slide shows the difference between \nthe rate of increase in wages in my State, from 2000 to 2007, versus \nthe rate of the increase in insurance.\n  I have talked to small businesspeople all over the State of Colorado \nwho have said they are trying to continue to insure their employees \njust as they have for generations in family-owned businesses, but they \nare finding they are having to make a tradeoff between people's wages \nbecause the cost of insurance is getting so large.\n  By 2016 in my State, working families in Colorado are going to be \nspending roughly 40 percent of their income on health care if we do not \nchange the status quo. It is also having a profound effect on the \nfinances of the Federal Government. The biggest drivers of our deficit, \nas the red line shows, are rising Medicare and Medicaid costs. If we \ncan change that, we can begin to restore our Government to fiscal \nhealth. If we do not change it, we are going to continue to pile \nmountains of debt onto our kids and our grandkids, something that no \none in my State wants us to do.\n  Finally, the last slide shows we are consuming almost 20 percent of \nour gross domestic product on health care, devoting almost one-fifth of \nour economy to health care, when all our competitors across the globe \nare devoting less than half that to health care. It is no different \nthan if you had two small businesses across the street from each other, \none spending one-fifth of their revenue on their light bill, the other \nis spending less than half of that on their light bill. You do not need \nan MBA to know which of those two companies is going to be able to \ninvest and grow their business.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire talked about a very important cost \ncontrol measure in this bill that has to do with the transition of \ncare. Right now in this country, one out of five Medicare patients is \nreadmitted to the hospital within the first month that they leave. That \nis because nobody is following up to make sure they are getting the \ncare they need to stay well. Nobody is checking to see whether they \nfill their prescriptions or whether they are taking it.\n  In Colorado, we have a great model in Mesa County and Grand Junction, \nwhere the hospital readmission rate is not 20 percent but 2 percent. \nThis alone is costing us $17 billion a year.\n  If we can do it smarter, more cheaply, and provide the kind of \nquality we see in Grand Junction, the Mayo Clinic, and other places \nacross the country, we should. That is what this reform is about. It is \ntime for us to put politics aside and come to an agreement that will \ncreate a much improved situation for working families and small \nbusinesses. The status quo is eating people alive. We ought to be able \nto do better than that.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator. I appreciate his pointing out how \nhealth care costs are also a factor in the rising deficit contributing \nto the national debt and challenging our international competitiveness \nin the world.\n  I now turn to Senator Mark Begich of Alaska. As mayor of Anchorage, \nhe was committed to protecting and strengthening the health care needs \nof small businesses and has continued his advocacy in the Senate.\n  I yield 4 minutes to Senator Begich.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I thank Senator Merkley.\n  I am pleased to stand here again with my freshmen colleagues and \nresound the call for meaningful health insurance reform. We know reform \nis critically important and long overdue. We know reform will provide \ncoverage to tens of millions of currently uninsured Americans. As I \nsaid last week, we know reform will bolster America's small businesses \nand help rebuild the economy. Here is something else we know: We must \nhave reform that bends the cost curve and slows down the growth of \nhealth care costs. If we extend insurance to millions more people but \ndo nothing to slow skyrocketing health care costs, we will not have \nreformed anything. We only will have added to the problem of an \noverburdened, unsustainable health system. Today we stand together to \noffer our ideas for reducing overall health care costs.\n  My focus this morning is on promoting good health and preventing the \nburden of chronic disease. The HELP and Finance Committees have done a \ngreat job on this subject. I commend them. I also want to make sure \nthat when the final reform bill comes to the floor, we will not waiver \non our commitment to prevention. I want to frame these brief remarks \naround a handful of words: nutrition, physical activity, tobacco use, \nand personal responsibility. Common sense tells us that smart \ninvestments that reduce the burden of chronic disease will make a huge \ndifference not only in cost savings but also in healthier and more \nproductive lives. The dollar amounts are staggering. Here are a few \nexamples of why health reform must include a substantial commitment to \nprevention and good health.\n  Each year we spend $2.2 trillion on health care, and 75 percent of \nall health care costs go to treat chronic diseases, many of which could \nhave been prevented. Each of our States is paying the price. Listen to \nthe most recent numbers from the State of Alaska and think again of \npoor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and the toll of tobacco. \nAlaska currently spends $600 million annually for heart disease and \nstroke hospitalization, $419 million for treatment related to diabetes, \n$491 million for medical care related to tobacco use and lost \nproductivity from tobacco-related deaths. We spend $477 million on \ndirect medical costs of obesity. We need to do something, and we need \nto start now, in my State and every State.\n  We know prevention can work. Even though youth smoking in Alaska is \nstill too high, it has been cut in half since 1995, thanks to sustained\n\n[[Page S9997]]\n\nantitobacco funding. I know as a former mayor, when I came into office \nwe had double-digit increases in health care costs; when I left, a less \nthan 1-percent increase. Why? Because we created wellness programs, \ncreated personal responsibilities and incentives for people to live a \nhealthier lifestyle.\n  Let's make a similar commitment in health reform this year. Let's \npromote personal responsibility. Let's give more American families the \ntools they need to take charge. Let's improve our Nation's highways and \ntransportation systems. And as we do it, let's make sure sidewalk \ntrails are part of the package. Let's hire more PE teachers and build \nupon proven community programs. Let's save lives and save dollars by \nkeeping tobacco away from kids.\n  As reform moves forward, our promise is to keep it deficit neutral, \nnow and into the future. Health care reform, health insurance reform \nnow, is important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague from Alaska for his remarks and his \nemphasis that prevention and management of chronic diseases are \nessential to bending the cost curve. I now turn to Senator Warner from \nVirginia. Before serving as Governor of Virginia, Senator Warner helped \ncreate the Virginia Health Care Foundation, which is providing health \ncare to more than 600,000 underserved Virginians. I yield 4 minutes to \nSenator Warner.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nOregon, for helping organize this morning. I thank all other colleagues \nfor once again coming together and speaking with different voices but \nwith similar themes. I also thank our newest colleague, the new Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, for being here. I know he will take time in another \nmoment to give his maiden speech. Being here and giving us moral \nsupport is helpful.\n  One of the things we all get to do as freshmen Senators is sit in \nthat chair and preside over the Senate at various times. Consequently, \nwe often get, perhaps more than other colleagues, a chance to hear the \nfolks on the other side and their talking points. Monday afternoons, I \nget to hear it for uninterrupted hours. What I hear time and again from \nour colleagues on the other side is complaints about the various \nproposals this side--and, hopefully, some on the other side will join \nus on--has put forward.\n  What I do not hear from the other side is what happens if we take \ntheir approach, which is doing nothing. What I do not hear from the \nother side is a simple recognition not of the moral challenges of \ncovering close to 30 million additional Americans, but the fiscal \nchallenges of not acting, a fact that we all brought forward last week \nwhen we pointed out, if we fail to act, we will see Medicare go \nbankrupt by 2017; if we fail to act, our deficit numbers will continue \nto explode; if we fail to act, an average Virginia family, and an \naverage Colorado family as well, will be spending close to 40 percent \nof their disposable incomes within the next decade paying for health \ncare. Senator Merkley and Senator Begich have mentioned if we fail, \nAmerican business cannot compete when we have to pay $3,000 to $4,000 \nmore per employee than our competitors across the world in terms of \nincreased health care costs.\n  Some may say that the simple reason for these increasing health care \ncosts is because we have an aging population. We do. But an aging \npopulation is not the only reason for rising health care costs. Our \nrising health care costs are increasingly driven by an inefficient \ndelivery system, by a system that does not reward value, by a system \nthat does not compensate based upon any rational basis. That is where \nso many of the reforms are focused through the Senate Finance Committee \nand the HELP Committee bills--and others we will be putting forward in \nlater weeks, perhaps even on the floor, that will bring these reforms \nto the overall delivery system.\n  Again, some of my colleagues have already mentioned wellness. Senator \nShaheen mentioned the enormous differential between states in terms of \nMedicaid reimbursements. We can and must do a better job.\n  For example, if as we see here, we can put health care reform in \nplace and drive system reform, we could potentially save $3 trillion \nover the next 10 years across the entire system. If we fail to act, we \nleave those costs in a system that does not provide good quality health \ncare and, with 70 percent of the cost going for chronic diseases, does \nnot provide better coverage, either.\n  On this last chart, in terms of what we are talking about in expanded \nsavings, if we fail, if we simply expand the current system--this is \nbased upon Lewin Group studies, the Commonwealth Fund that has been \ncited many times on the other side--if we simply put in place expanded \ncoverage without reform, we will continue to explode the deficit. But \nif we put in place the kinds of reforms we are talking about, which is \nwellness, and increased transparency--and I strongly believe in a free \nmarket system--but we have no transparency in our system in terms of \nwhat costs are and what people actually pay. If we take advantage of \nsome of the best examples in the private sector, where health reform is \ntaking place right now, we can bring about not only reform but bring \nabout reform with lower costs, higher value, and truly make sure \nAmericans all across the country get the coverage they need and that \ndoes not break the deficit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator from Virginia, particularly for \nnoting the consequences if we fail to act and the absolute necessity to \nreform an inefficient delivery system. I turn now to Senator Tom Udall \nof New Mexico. As a Member of the House, Senator Udall was a champion \nof preventive health care initiatives, including legislation to \nencourage employers to offer wellness programs to workers.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, if we want to do something \nabout runaway health care costs, the way to control them is to \ninstitute prevention and make prevention a major part of this bill. We \nare in danger of systematically neglecting prevention. I believe if we \nfocus on prevention, we can get control of the cost curve. Prevention \ncan mean clinical services such as mammograms and colonoscopies and \ncholesterol screens. The good news is that most of the bills being \nconsidered would make these services much more accessible and \naffordable. But successful reform also means addressing another aspect \nof prevention. I am talking about primary prevention, the kind that \nkeeps people from getting sick in the first place.\n  Evidence suggests that primary prevention should focus on three \nbehaviors: physical activity, nutrition, and smoking. But the reality \nis, whether through personal choice or lack of options, too many \nAmericans are struggling. Today two-thirds of Americans are overweight \nor obese and often more than 20 percent smoke. Things are even worse \nfor minorities who often suffer the most from the lack of preventive \ncare.\n  In my State, we have a diabetes epidemic among Native Americans and \nHispanics. We are in this crisis today because we have neglected \nprevention for years. Of the more than 2 trillion we spend on health \ncare each year, only 4 cents of every dollar is invested in prevention. \nIt doesn't make sense. Studies have shown that primary prevention will \nnot only save lives, it will also save money. In New Mexico, a $10-per-\nperson investment in community-based prevention programs would save $88 \nmillion annually. Nationally that translates to more than $16 billion \nannually. That is a return of $5.60 for every $1 invested.\n  We have solid evidence that we can spend less on health care while \nsaving more lives. So what should we do? Experts say effective \nprevention must address three levels: the individual, the \ninstitutional, and the environmental. Individual prevention is about \nAmericans making the right choices for themselves. This means choosing \nnutritious foods, maintaining an active lifestyle, avoiding excess \nweight, avoiding smoking, drug abuse, and excessive drinking. \nInstitutional and environmental prevention helps individuals stay on \nthe path to a healthy lifestyle. This could mean incentives for \nphysical activity, disincentives for smoking, and nutritional labeling \non menus. \n\n[[Page S9998]]\n\nIt could also mean more bike paths and more school gardens.\n\n  Legislation approved by the HELP Committee would establish a new fund \nto support these activities. This kind of dedicated, stable funding \nstream is critical to effectively address America's legacy of neglect \nregarding prevention. There is an often-quoted parable that tells of a \nnurse fishing downstream. As she fishes, she sees a person coming down \nthe river struggling for life. The nurse pulls him out. Then, another \ncomes and again must be rescued. This happens all afternoon and the \nnurse tires from constantly pulling people out of the river. \nEventually, she realizes she has to get upstream, to see what is \npushing them in the river in the first place.\n\n  It is time for America to look upstream, to see where the real \nproblems lie. It is time to honestly address these preventable health \nproblems.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I thank Senator Udall for his clarion \ncall for primary prevention to save lives and save dollars.\n  We now turn to Senator Mark Udall of Colorado. As a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, Senator Udall championed legislation \nhighlighting the health benefits of physical activity for the public.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, let me start by thanking my \ncolleague, the Senator from Oregon, for holding this important \ngathering on the floor of the Senate this morning.\n  Mr. President, as my fellow freshmen have stressed, health insurance \nreform is essential in helping us lower spending, chip away at our \nFederal deficit, and strengthen our economy.\n  While the reform proposals before us would contain costs across the \nboard, I wish to focus on a particular area of health care reform near \nand dear to nearly 45 million Americans, and that is Medicare. \nReforming how we pay for Medicare and how we spend those valuable \ntaxpayer dollars is one of the biggest cost-containing tools we can \ninclude in health care reform, and it will also improve the health of \nseniors.\n  Coloradans have rightly asked me and Senator Bennet how health care \nreform can reduce government spending on Medicare while at the same \ntime strengthen benefits and improve their health. They want to know \nhow they can be getting more as the government spends less.\n  The answer is that health insurance reform can make our government \nand us smarter consumers. Because right now, 30 to 50 percent of \nspending on health care does not make a patient healthier. That is a \nlot of room for savings.\n  Let me give you an example. Today, Medicare actually pays doctors and \nhospitals more to amputate a leg than it does to treat early diabetes \nand actually prevent that amputation. Our government should be paying \nfor quality outcomes, not writing checks that encourage expensive care \nthat could have been prevented in the first place.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples of how reform can change these \nincentives, help improve care for our seniors, and also decrease costs \nfor all of us, the taxpayers.\n  First, reform can lower the rate of unnecessary hospital \nreadmissions. Right now, one-quarter of all Medicare patients who are \ndischarged from a hospital end up going back into that hospital for the \nsame problem. Health reform would reward hospitals such as Saint Mary's \nin Grand Junction, CO, which coordinates care and followup to make sure \npatients do not end up back in the hospital.\n  Second, reform can hold hospitals accountable if they are not doing \nenough to reduce the number of patients who develop infections in their \nfacility. Such infections cause seniors to stay in the hospital longer, \ncost tens of thousands of additional dollars to treat, and--in the \nworst cases--they are life threatening.\n  Health care reform would also invest in and encourage innovative ways \nto deliver more efficient care to seniors. So-called patient-centered \ncare can prevent seniors from being admitted to the hospital in the \nfirst place.\n  You will notice a theme here: The government would be paying less \nwhen we pass health reform, and seniors would be healthier for it.\n  I have not even touched on the billions of dollars per year in waste, \nfraud, and abuse that health insurance reform will help wring out of \nthe system. I also have not discussed the tough cost-controlling \nmechanisms, such as a new Medicare payment advisory body to ensure \nMedicare dollars are being spent efficiently to improve patient care \nand balance our Federal checkbook.\n  The reforms we are considering are critical to changing the way the \ngovernment pays for Medicare so we can ensure its long-term \nsustainability. The reality is, if we do not act, as was mentioned \nearly this morning--if we keep spending as we do today--Medicare will \nbe bankrupt by 2017, just 8 years from now. That is a sobering thought.\n  If we take the step to reform our health care system, it will have \nthe immediate effect of extending the life of our Medicare trust fund \nfor 5 more years, and at the same time we will lay down a foundation \nthat will keep costs down in the long term so we can make Medicare \nsustainable for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Udall very much for his \nremarks. I thank the Senator for his emphasis on quality outcomes and \npatient-centered care as a way to improve care and to decrease costs.\n  We will now turn to Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina. As a State \nsenator in North Carolina, Senator Hagan worked to extend health \ninsurance to uninsured children, to expand care for uninsured patients \nliving in rural areas of the State, and to end insurance discrimination \nagainst mental health care patients.\n  I yield Senator Hagan 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I thank my fellow colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Merkley. I also welcome our new colleague from Massachusetts.\n  I am joining my freshmen colleagues on the floor today to talk about \nhow health care reform will improve women's access to care. I received \na heartbreaking e-mail this week from a young woman in North Carolina. \nWhen this woman was 27 years old, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. \nShe had a 16-month-old son and was in an abusive relationship with her \nhusband. Her husband knew she would not leave him because she could not \nafford medical treatment without his employer-provided insurance. She \nlooked into COBRA. She looked into other individual insurance plans. \nBut her breast cancer was, obviously, considered a preexisting \ncondition. So for 7 years, this woman stayed in an abusive relationship \nbecause she had to have health insurance for herself and her child. \nUnfortunately, women across America face similar challenges to exactly \nwhat that woman has faced. Inefficiencies and discriminatory practices \nin our health care system disproportionately affect women. In a \nmajority of States, insurance companies are permitted to charge women \nmore than men for the exact same insurance policy. In Washington, DC, \nand in eight States, insurance companies can deny coverage to victims \nof domestic violence, citing that as a preexisting condition. In all \nbut 12 States, insurance companies are allowed to charge women more \nthan they charge men for coverage. In my family, my daughter, who just \ngraduated from college--out there looking for health insurance on her \nown--was quoted many times more money for her coverage than if she had \nbeen a male.\n  Only 12 percent of individual market policies provide comprehensive \nmaternity care. When women do have health insurance, it often does not \ncover basic preventive care such as mammograms and Pap smears. In the \nHELP Committee and in the Finance Committee bill, insurance companies \ncan no longer charge women more than men or use preexisting conditions \nto prevent anyone from purchasing health insurance, and we are ensuring \nthat basic preventive screenings will be covered.\n  I am focused on sending our President a bill that ends discriminatory\n\n[[Page S9999]]\n\npractices against women, provides security and stability for people \nwith insurance, expands access to health insurance for those without \nit, and slows down the skyrocketing cost of health care. Women across \nAmerica cannot afford inaction any longer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hagan very much for her \ncomments and her observations about how the current health care system, \nthe current rules of insurance, including the ability to turn down \npatients and to deny folks with preexisting conditions, works to \ndiscriminate against women and prevent preventive health care.\n  We will now turn to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. As a \nMember of the House of Representatives, Senator Gillibrand was a \nchampion of children's and family health care issues and was a leading \nvoice on the need to improve health care services for America's \nveterans.\n  I yield my friend from New York 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, right now we are engaged in a \nhistoric debate about the future of our health care system. The crisis \nhas reached historic proportions, and Congress must act now.\n  In 2000, family health insurance purchased through an employer was \napproximately $6,700. In 2008, it nearly doubled to $12,600. If we do \nnot act now, by 2016, family health insurance is expected to double \nagain, to nearly $24,300.\n  We pay nearly twice the average of what other developed nations pay \nfor health care: $2.2 trillion a year--more than 16 percent of our \ngross domestic product. However, the United States ranks 29th in the \nworld in infant mortality.\n  We have more than 47 million uninsured Americans. In 2007 and 2008, \n86.7 million Americans--1 out of every 3 Americans under 65--went \nwithout health insurance for some period of time.\n  There is a hidden tax in America's health care system that all \ninsured Americans pay to cover the cost of emergency care for the \nuninsured. For more than half of the 47 million Americans who do not \nhave insurance, the only care they receive is through the emergency \nroom. In fact, that hidden tax costs about $1,100 per year for family \ninsurance premiums and over $400 per year for individual insurance \npremiums.\n  Every day we fail to act, 14,000 Americans lose their health \ninsurance. We must provide affordable, quality health insurance to \nevery man, woman, and child in this country. But we also must take \nadditional steps to contain costs and make sure our system is more \nefficient. The health care reform plans we are considering today will \naddress a number of these issues.\n  First, health care providers will be rewarded for the quality of the \ncare they provide, not just the quantity. Hospitals and clinics around \nthe country will model the success at places such as Bassett Healthcare \nwhich is in Cooperstown, NY, and is one of the leading health care \nproviders in terms of positive outcomes because of the quality of care. \nWe will also employ new methods to reduce medical errors through \naccountability and through health care IT, and prevent costly illnesses \nthrough better care management, through diet, exercise, and preventing \ndiseases, such as preventing childhood obesity.\n  Second, we will address the needless redtape and excessive \nadministrative costs in our current health care system. Senate health \ninsurance reform combats this problem by setting administrative \nstandards that insurance companies must meet, and providing new tools \nto combat fraud. I would like to see a universal, one-page form that \nall people can use for reimbursements for all insurance companies that \ncan be submitted on line. Changes like that could transform \nefficiencies in the market.\n  Finally, we will make use of health care technology that could reduce \nhealth care spending by $77 billion a year. Currently, just 1 in 25 \nAmerican physicians utilizes fully functional electronic medical \nrecords. Senate health insurance reform expands the use of electronic \nprescribing, electronic health records, and electronic support for \ndiagnosis and treatment options. Studies have shown that one out of \nevery four tests is needlessly done because there is no record of that \ntest. This must change.\n  We know our Nation's health care costs are steadily bankrupting our \ngovernment and our citizens, and we owe it to every generation that \ncomes after our own to act now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank my Democratic freshmen colleagues \nfor coming to the floor today to talk about our broken health care \nsystem and the absolute necessity to control costs in this system, that \nwe are on a train headed for a wreck. It is making it so difficult for \nfamilies and small businesses and large businesses to afford health \ncare, to establish a high quality of life, strong, thriving small \nbusinesses and international competitiveness for our large businesses. \nWe can and must improve our health care system. The moment is now.\n  I thank my colleagues for coming to the floor and sharing their vast \nexperience in so many different capacities and bringing it to bear on \nthis challenge that touches the life of every single American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the Senator from Georgia and I wish \nto talk a little bit today about the health care plans coming through. \nFundamentally, our position is that we do not want to see another \nWashington takeover. We are deeply concerned about the cuts in Medicare \nthat will affect seniors, about the taxes--both the increase in Federal \ntaxes and State taxes, which we will talk more about--about the \ntrillion dollars in new spending, and about the threats to the health \ncare choices the legislation coming through would pose.\n  Instead of such a large enterprise as what I have just described, we \nwould propose that we take practical, small steps to reducing costs \nsuch as allowing small businesses to pool their resources, reducing \njunk lawsuits against doctors, allowing consumers to purchase across \nState lines, and creating health insurance exchanges. There are other \nsteps that could be taken; in other words, instead of scaring the \ncountry half to death with new taxes and Washington takeovers and \nthreatening their health care choices, let's don't throw the whole \nsystem out. Let's take practical steps to reduce costs and to improve \nservices.\n  Today we wish to specifically talk more about two government-run \nprograms that already exist. One is Medicaid, which is the program for \nlow-income Americans that today serves about 59 million Americans. \nAbout 60 percent is paid for by the Federal Government and about 40 \npercent by the States. The second is Medicare, which seniors know very \nwell because about 40 million American seniors are dependent upon \nMedicare. We are concerned because the proposals coming through the \nSenate Finance Committee would shift costs of Medicaid to the States, \ncausing State budgets to be put in ruin, according to the Governors of \nthose States, and either taxes go up or services are cut. We are \nconcerned because the President and others have said we are going to \npay for this big new program by savings in Medicare, not to be put in \nMedicare for seniors, but for the new program.\n  A lot of people say it is hard to find opportunities for \nbipartisanship when we talk about health care, but I think\n\n[[Page S10000]]\n\nI have found one. I am on the Senate floor today to say I would like to \nbe a cosponsor of the Reid amendment, the proposal by the majority \nleader of the Senate--the respected Harry Reid from Nevada. The New \nYork Times reported yesterday that the majority leader had heard from \nhis Governor and from other people in his State, and he was deeply \nconcerned about the legislation that is coming through because it would \nincrease costs in Nevada.\n  In fact, I have a copy of the letter from the Governor of Nevada to \nmajority leader Harry Reid, and it says: As you know, like the U.S. \nConstitution, most State constitutions require a balanced budget, \nincluding Nevada. Nevada will spend $907 million for programs on \nMedicaid. This is about 14 percent of our budget. We can't afford more \ntaxes. Revenues are down.\n  So the majority leader did exactly what I think a Senator would do. \nHe introduced an amendment, or proposed an amendment, to the Senate \nFinance Committee and said: Take care of Nevada. If the Federal \nGovernment is going to expand coverage for Medicaid, then the Federal \nGovernment ought to pay for it.\n  That is exactly what I believe. That is exactly the opinion of all of \nthe Governors. The National Governors Association, of which I used to \nbe chairman, has said to us: If you are going to expand Medicaid, if \nthat is your big idea in Washington, then pay for it.\n  Nothing irritates Governors and legislators more than Washington \npoliticians who come up with big ideas, announce them, take credit for \nthem, and then send the bill to the Governor and the legislature. I was \na Governor. The Senator from Georgia was in the Georgia Legislature for \n17 years. He was the leader of the Republicans in the senate for 8 \nyears. He knows a good deal about State budgets and about the Medicaid \nProgram and how it is an integral part and a very difficult problem for \nState governments.\n  I am wondering if the Senator from Georgia thinks there might be \nopportunity for more bipartisan support for Senator Reid's amendment to \nhave the Federal Government pay for 100 percent of Medicaid costs if \nMedicaid is expanded.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Well, I think the majority leader is exactly right. \nThere is a prime example of what happens when the Federal Government \nmandates a benefit or a program and doesn't pay for it; the States end \nup having to do it. Just take No Child Left Behind or take the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, and IDEA. Back in 1978 we \nmandated funds to be appropriated for individuals with disabilities in \nAmerica. In fact, we mandated States spend 40 percent per FTE more on a \nspecial needs child than on a regular child. We never sent them a dime \nfor about 20 years. We finally, in 1999, started paying part of that 40 \npercent. Now we are only paying half of it.\n  So now we take Medicaid. Medicaid is a program, for the people out \nthere who are listening today, where the States pay about one-third of \nMedicaid and the Federal Government pays about two-thirds. It changes a \nlittle bit, but that is about right. The State runs the program; the \nFederal Government mandates the program.\n  When I was first elected to the Georgia Legislature, the expenses for \nMedicaid the year I was elected in the State budget were $20 million, \nState funds. That was 1 percent of the State's $2 billion budget. Now, \ntoday, this year, even with all of the cuts that have taken place, \nMedicaid is 12 percent of Georgia's budget. So it has grown from 1 \npercent of the budget to 12 percent of the budget in about 30 years.\n  Plans in the health care bill that are being talked about in the \nFinance Committee and that have been talked about in the House would \nmandate an increase of 150 percent--from 100 percent of poverty to 150 \npercent of poverty for Medicaid eligibility. It is said the States will \nbe held harmless until 2013 or 2014 but no promises after that.\n  Let me tell my colleague what would happen to my State of Georgia if \nwe raised mandatory eligibility to 150 percent of poverty and the State \npaid its third of that one-third, two-thirds matched by the Federal \nGovernment. It would raise Georgia's Medicaid budget expenses annually \nfrom 12 percent of our budget to 20 percent of our budget, $3.32 \nbillion. States can't afford to do that.\n  As the Governor of Nevada said, 43 of our States can't deficit spend; \n43 percent of our States must balance their budgets. Medicaid has been \ncarved on and worked on as it is to try and preserve it under the \nexisting law. With a 150-percent increase in eligibility and no funds \nfrom the Federal Government guaranteed, the States would be put in a \nposition of spending one penny out of every five on Medicaid, which is \nabout 12 percent of my State's population. That is disproportionate and \nit is not fair.\n  I think Senator Reid is exactly right. Our States should be held \nharmless on any mandated increases in Medicaid.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, going back to the Senator's point, the \nthing I think about, those of us who have been a Governor or in the \nlegislature--in fact, I have said to some of my colleagues many times \nthat if we expand Medicaid for low-income Americans--which States have \nto pay a third or more of--without paying for it, that we Senators \nought to be sentenced to go home and serve as Governor for 8 years to \nsee what it is like. I mean that because I can remember as Governor for \n8 years balancing budgets, first I would come up with the money for \nkindergarten through the 12th grade--that was a pretty set amount--then \nfor the highways, and then for the prisons, and I would get down toward \nthe end and there would be a certain amount of money left to either go \ninto higher education or it would go for increasing Medicaid costs. \nAlmost always that was the choice. If I put it into Medicaid, I had to \ntake it out of education, and that would keep the University of \nTennessee or Georgia or the community colleges from getting better.\n  Guess what happens when the State can't put the money in. The tuition \nrates go up.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. It is interesting the Senator talked about that. By the \nway, his experience as Governor was a great experience for Tennessee, \nand the Senator's leadership in education was phenomenal. But already \nwith the restricted economy we have today and the recession in my \nState, our teachers this year are having to take a minimum of 3, and at \nthe university system a maximum of 6, furlough days without pay just to \ntry and meet the balanced budget. Part of that is the pressure of \nMedicaid, which is an entitlement. We cannot decide to just not pay \nMedicaid, we have to do it. It is a Federal law; the State has to run \nit.\n  What the States are having to do this year--my State of Georgia and I \nthink the State of Tennessee has probably experienced some of the same \nthing--they are having to cut back on other programs in order to still \nmanage Medicaid.\n  In a State, when they say ``other programs,'' they are talking first \nand foremost about education. In Georgia, 54 percent of the budget is \nthe university system and elementary and secondary education, one out \nof every two cents. Well, if they can't cut Medicaid because it is an \nentitlement, then they have to cut education first and foremost, which \nis the most important function of State government. So the unintended \nconsequences of such a mandate are going to be devastating. They only \nhave two choices: to continue to cut education or to raise taxes. \nNeither one of those are a good choice.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. There is an article in the New York Times today which \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 1, 2009]\n\n        Rate of Enrollment in Medicaid Rose Rapidly, Report Says\n\n                            (By Kevin Sack)\n\n       The recession is driving up enrollment in Medicaid at \n     higher than expected rates, threatening gargantuan state \n     budget gaps even as Congress and the White House seek to \n     expand the government health insurance program for the poor \n     and disabled, according to a survey released Wednesday.\n       The annual survey of state Medicaid directors, conducted \n     for the Kaiser Family Foundation's Commission on Medicaid and \n     the Uninsured, found that the program had been spared the \n     worst effects of massive state budget shortfalls because of \n     federal aid in the stimulus package. But it also revealed \n     grave concerns about what will happen when that relief dries \n     up at the close of 2010.\n       As unemployment surged, enrollment in state Medicaid \n     programs grew by an average of 5.4 percent in the previous \n     fiscal year, the\n\n[[Page S10001]]\n\n     highest rate in six years, according to the Kaiser survey. In \n     eight states, the growth exceeded 10 percent.\n       Last year's average growth was well above the 3.6 percent \n     that had been forecast by the Medicaid directors a year \n     earlier. In this year's survey, the directors projected that \n     enrollment would continue to accelerate in the current 2010 \n     fiscal year, growing by 6.6 percent.\n       The states and the federal government share the $333 \n     billion annual cost of Medicaid, which insured 62 million \n     low-income and disabled people at some point in 2007. It is \n     the states, however, that regulate that spending by setting \n     eligibility cutoffs, benefit levels and provider payments, \n     within federal guidelines.\n       The Kaiser survey found that the growth in Medicaid \n     spending in 2009, at 7.9 percent, was the highest in five \n     years. That number also may increase this fiscal year. Three-\n     fourths of the agency directors said they already fear their \n     appropriations will not be enough and that lawmakers will \n     have to find more money or, more likely, cut benefits or \n     provider payments.\n       One such state is Nevada. ``We're seeing the trajectories \n     of our enrollment growth as well as our revenues all going in \n     the wrong direction,'' said Charles Duarte, administrator of \n     the state's Division of Health Care Financing and Policy.\n       Medicaid is, by definition, a countercyclical program. \n     Demand for it is always highest at the time that states can \n     least afford it because of slumping tax revenues.\n       The highest spikes in Medicaid enrollment often trail the \n     worst recessionary indicators. It was not until a year after \n     the 2001 recession that the growth in Medicaid enrollments \n     peaked at 9.3 percent.\n       Vernon K. Smith, who directed the survey for Health \n     Management Associates of Lansing, Mich., said he doubted that \n     enrollment growth would reach that level as a result of this \n     recession, but that it was not out of the question. \n     ``Significantly many states said the pace of growth \n     accelerated as the year went on,'' he said.\n       Some states did cut certain Medicaid benefits last year, \n     and two-thirds of them either froze or reduced payments to \n     providers. Those payments are typically the lowest made by \n     any insurer--often falling below actual costs--and as a \n     result some physicians decline to accept patients with \n     Medicaid.\n       Nonetheless, state budgets were buffered from even worse \n     pain by the federal stimulus package enacted in February. The \n     largest single component of state aid in the package, worth \n     about $87 billion, provided a temporary increase in federal \n     Medicaid reimbursement to the states.\n       The survey found that 38 states used the money to avoid or \n     reduce cuts in provider payments and that 36 avoided benefit \n     cuts. Because the federal money was conditional on states not \n     reducing eligibility for Medicaid, 14 states reversed \n     previously enacted restrictions and five abandoned plans to \n     tighten coverage.\n       But state officials are already panicking about how to \n     compensate when the spike in federal matching funds expires \n     at the end of 2010. Few anticipate any significant reduction \n     in their Medicaid rolls by then.\n       ``Many states believe they may be pressured to consider \n     previously unthinkable eligibility and benefit reductions,'' \n     the Kaiser report concluded. Unless Congress and President \n     Obama extend the federal aid, the cuts needed to balance \n     state budgets may be ``on a scale not ever seen in \n     Medicaid,'' the authors warned.\n       ``What we will have to look at is wholesale elimination of \n     eligibility groups,'' Mr. Duarte said.\n       Deborah Bachrach, New York's Medicaid director, said her \n     state would face a $5 billion annual gap and would have to \n     consider deep cuts in home and personal care.\n       Both Mr. Duarte and Ms. Bachrach said there likely would be \n     further cuts in provider payments. ``This could affect \n     access,'' Mr. Duarte said, ``but we're at the point where \n     that may be a secondary consideration.''\n       Governors also have expressed concern about the fiscal \n     impact of the health care legislation being negotiated in \n     Washington, which would vastly expand eligibility for \n     Medicaid as one means of covering the country's 46 million \n     uninsured.\n       The program is largely limited at present to low-income \n     children, pregnant women and parents of qualifying children. \n     But under bills in both houses, eligibility would be granted \n     to anyone with an income of up to 133 percent of the federal \n     poverty level (currently $29,326 for a family of four). That \n     could add an estimated 11 million people to the rolls.\n       Initially, the federal government would absorb most of the \n     cost. But the bills vary on that score and some states may \n     bear higher costs than others. Three-fourths of the Medicaid \n     directors said they thought the changes might deepen their \n     budget holes.\n       ``Many officials felt that their states would be unable to \n     finance the cost of a Medicaid eligibility expansion unless \n     the federal government assumed 100 percent of the costs, \n     especially during the early years,'' the report said.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the headline is ``Rate of Enrollment in \nMedicaid Rose Rapidly, Report Says.''\n\n       The recession is driving up enrollment in Medicaid at \n     higher than expected rates, threatening gargantuan State \n     budget gaps--\n\n  This is the New York Times; this is not the Republican Party saying \nthis--\n\n     even as Congress and the White House seek to expand the \n     government health insurance program for the poor and \n     disabled.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       As unemployment surged, enrollment in State Medicaid \n     programs grew by an average of 5.4 percent in the previous \n     fiscal year, the highest rate in 6 years . . . in eight \n     States, the growth exceeded 10 percent.\n       Three-fourths of the agency directors of Medicaid said they \n     already fear their appropriations will not be enough and that \n     lawmakers will have to find more money or, more likely, cut \n     benefits or provider payments.\n       One such State is Nevada.\n\n  The home State of the majority leader.\n\n       We're seeing the trajectories of our enrollment growth as \n     well as our revenues all going in the wrong direction--\n\n  Said their head of financing. State budgets were buffered from even \nworse pain by the stimulus package, but the New York Medicaid director \nsaid her State would face a $5 billion annual gap and would have to \nconsider deep cuts in home and personal care, and that is before we \nmake any changes or add any costs.\n  When the Federal Government talks about adding State Medicaid costs:\n\n       Three-fourths of the Medicaid directors--\n\n  The New York Times said--\n\n     said they thought the changes might deepen their budget \n     holes.\n\n  What do you suppose in Georgia--already struggling in the way you \nhave just described--would happen if--and this is why we said we insist \non reading the bill before we vote on it and knowing how much it costs \nbefore we vote on it. We want to know exactly what the provisions are \nbecause I hear that States will be required to pay 5 to 22 percent in \nthe first 5 years of the Medicaid expansion, and then after 5 years \nthey might have to go up to 35 percent or so.\n  What do you suppose will happen to Georgia if these kinds of costs \nare added to the State budget?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will tell you a little story that happened in the \nmonth of August that is indicative of what is going to happen in \nMedicaid services if we have the continuing pressure. I was in Forsyth, \nGA. It is about halfway between Macon and Atlanta. I had done a speech \nat the Law Enforcement Training Center and decided to go into the local \nsandwich shop in downtown Forsyth and have a sandwich and greet people \nand say hello. I had greeted people and said hello. There were about 10 \nof them in the room. I went up to get my sandwich. When I came back \nthis lady had circled all the tables around and saved a seat for me, \nand said: Senator, we are going to have a townhall meeting. They \nstarted talking to me about their concerns.\n  Toward the end of the meeting, one gentleman at the end of the table \nfinally said: Senator, I want to tell you a story. I am a pediatric \nophthalmologist. I am the last pediatric ophthalmologist who takes \nMedicaid patients.\n  He said: I just want to tell you what is happening because of the \npressure on Medicaid expenses.\n  He said: I have a child right now who has a condition where if it is \nnot addressed, the child will go blind. There is a medicine, it is very \nexpensive, but it can restore the cornea and the lens and help that \nchild to be able to see. We have submitted it three times to Medicaid, \nand they will not pay it. It is the only drug. There is not an option. \nThere is not a generic substitution. It is one of the breakthroughs.\n  So what we have already going on in health care and in our \nentitlement programs, but in particular in Medicaid, is we try and \nmanage the expense by lessening the amount we reimburse. The unintended \nconsequence of that is we lose physicians who finally say: I am just \nnot going to take Medicaid patients anymore.\n  Then, the ones who finally are doing it, then we start to see what \nthey submit as a treatment not being approved for reimbursement. So the \nunintended consequence of putting even more pressure on the Medicaid \nsystem is going to put more pressure to ration health care for all \nMedicaid patients, and that is not fair nor is it right.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. No, it is not fair or right. The Governors have said, \nDemocratic and Republican Governors--and the Senator raised a second \npoint about this Medicaid expansion: that dumping millions more low-\n\n[[Page S10002]]\n\nincome Americans into Medicaid is not health care reform because \nMedicaid, as the Senator just pointed out, so poorly reimburses the \ndoctors and the hospitals that about 40 percent of doctors will not see \nMedicaid patients.\n  So when we say to someone: Congratulations, we have just fixed the \nhealth care system; we have dumped you into Medicaid, you are giving \nsomebody a bus ticket to a bus system that operates 60 percent of the \ntime. So the first thing we are doing with the proposal as it is coming \ntoward us is we are--and I am not exaggerating--we are potentially \nbankrupting States.\n  Speaking of States, let me just share one letter with Senator Isakson \nfrom the Governor of California.\n  This is a State that has really struggled with its budgets. They have \na number of problems.\n  Here is what the ``Terminator'' has to say. He wrote to Senator Reid \nand to Senator McConnell on the Republican side and Speaker Pelosi. It \nis a long letter. This is the basic idea. Arnold Schwarzenegger says:\n\n       I will be clear on this particular proposal: if Congress \n     thinks the Medicaid expansion is too expensive for the \n     federal government, it is absolutely unaffordable for states.\n\n  Governor Schwarzenegger goes on to say:\n\n       Proposals in the Senate envision passing on more than $8 \n     billion in new costs to California annually--crowding out \n     other priorities or constitutionally required state spending \n     and presenting a false choice for all of us. I cannot and \n     will not support federal health care reform proposals that \n     impose billions of dollars in new costs on California each \n     year.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 31, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. John A. Boehner,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, Madam Speaker and Mr. \n     Boehner: I appreciate your commitment and hard work toward \n     reforming the nation's health care system. I think we can all \n     agree that the current system is not working as it should, \n     and I have long supported a significant overhaul. Costs \n     continue to explode, while tens of millions remain uninsured \n     or underinsured. Many families are one illness away from \n     financial ruin--even if they do have insurance. We have the \n     greatest medical technology in the world at our fingertips, \n     yet Americans' health status lags behind many countries that \n     spend less than half what we do per capita. Any successful \n     health care reform proposal must be comprehensive and built \n     around the core principles of cost containment and \n     affordability; prevention, wellness and health quality; and \n     coverage for all.\n\n\n                   Cost Containment and Affordability\n\n       Cost containment and affordability are essential not only \n     for families, individuals and businesses, but also for state \n     governments. Congress is proposing significant expansions of \n     Medicaid to help reduce the number of uninsured and to \n     increase provider reimbursement. Today, California \n     administers one of the most efficient Medicaid programs in \n     the country, and still the state cannot afford its Medicaid \n     program as currently structured and governed by federal rules \n     and regulations. The House originally proposed fully funding \n     the expansion with federal dollars, but due to cost concerns, \n     members decided to shift a portion of these expansion costs \n     to states. I will be clear on this particular proposal: if \n     Congress thinks the Medicaid expansion is too expensive for \n     the federal government, it is absolutely unaffordable for \n     states. Proposals in the Senate envision passing on more than \n     $8 billion in new costs to California annually crowding out \n     other priority or constitutionally required state spending \n     and presenting a false choice for all of us. I cannot and \n     will not support federal health care reform proposals that \n     impose billions of dollars in new costs on California each \n     year.\n       The inclusion of maintenance of effort restrictions on \n     existing state Medicaid programs only compounds any cost \n     shift to states. We simply cannot be locked into a cost \n     structure that is unsustainable. Governors have three primary \n     ways to control Medicaid costs: they can adjust eligibility, \n     benefits and/or reimbursement rates. Maintenance of effort \n     requirements linked to existing Medicaid eligibility \n     standards and procedures will effectively force state \n     legislatures into autopilot spending and lead to chronic \n     budget shortfalls.\n       The federal government must help states reduce their \n     Medicaid financing burden, not increase it. A major factor \n     contributing to Medicaid's fiscal instability, before any \n     proposed expansion, is that the program effectively remains \n     the sole source of financing for long-term care services. \n     Therefore, I am encouraged by congressional proposals that \n     create new financing models for long-term care services. \n     Proposals that expand the availability and affordability of \n     long-term care insurance are steps in the right direction, \n     but they must be implemented in a fiscally sustainable way. \n     More fundamentally, however, the federal government must take \n     full responsibility for financing and coordinating the care \n     of the dually eligible in order to appreciably reduce the \n     cost trend for this group. This realignment of \n     responsibilities is absolutely essential to controlling costs \n     for this population, while ensuring that state governments \n     will be better positioned to fill in any gaps that will \n     undoubtedly arise from federal health care reform efforts.\n       I also encourage Congress to incorporate other strategies \n     to help stabilize Medicaid costs for states. Delaying the \n     scheduled phase-out of Medicaid managed care provider taxes \n     pending enactment of new Medicaid rates, reimbursement for \n     Medicaid claims owed to states associated with the federal \n     government's improper classification of certain permanent \n     disability cases, and federal support for legal immigrant \n     Medicaid costs are examples of federal efforts that could \n     provide more stability to state Medicaid programs. Moreover, \n     given the fiscal crisis that many states, including \n     California, are experiencing, I strongly urge Congress to \n     extend the temporary increase in the federal matching ratio \n     to preserve the ability of state Medicaid programs to \n     continue to provide essential services to low-income \n     residents pending full implementation of national health \n     reform.\n\n\n                Prevention, Wellness and Health Quality\n\n       Prevention, wellness and health promotion, along with \n     chronic disease management, can help to lower the cost curve \n     over the long run and improve health outcomes in the near \n     term. This was one of the cornerstone pieces of my health \n     care reform proposal in California, and I continue to believe \n     it should be a key piece of the federal efforts. Prevention, \n     wellness and chronic disease management programs should \n     include both the individual and wider population levels.\n       At the individual level, proposals to provide refunds or \n     other incentives to Medicare, Medicaid and private plan \n     enrollees who successfully complete behavior modification \n     programs, such as smoking cessation or weight loss, are \n     critical reforms. To ensure they are widely used, individual \n     prevention and wellness benefits should not be subject to \n     beneficiary cost sharing.\n       Because individuals' behaviors are influenced by their \n     environments, health reform must place a high priority on \n     promoting healthy communities that make it easier for people \n     to make healthy choices. California has demonstrated through \n     its nationally recognized tobacco control efforts that \n     population-based strategies can be effective and dramatically \n     change the way the people think and act about unhealthy \n     behaviors, such as tobacco use. A similar model, community \n     transformation grants, has been advanced in the Senate \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension \n     legislation, and it should be included to support policy, \n     environmental, programmatic and infrastructure changes that \n     address chronic disease risk factors, promote healthy living \n     and decrease health disparities.\n       Quality improvement measures are also critical to health \n     reform. The House proposal for a Center for Quality \n     Improvement to improve patient safety, reduce healthcare-\n     associated infections and improve patient outcomes and \n     satisfaction is a positive step. Coordinated chronic disease \n     management is necessary to improve outcomes for chronically \n     ill people. Systematic use of health information technology \n     and health information exchange, including access for public \n     health agencies, is vital to providing the necessary tools to \n     measure the success of quality improvement efforts. Finally, \n     investments in core public health infrastructure can be \n     facilitated through the creation of the proposed Prevention \n     and Wellness Trust.\n\n\n                            Coverage for All\n\n       Coverage for all is also an essential element of health \n     care reform and I believe an enforceable and effective \n     individual mandate, combined with guaranteed issuance of \n     insurance, is the best way to accomplish this goal. The \n     individual mandate must provide effective incentives to help \n     prevent adverse selection that could occur if the mandate is \n     too weak. Creating transparent and user-friendly health \n     insurance exchanges to help consumers compare insurance \n     options will also help facilitate participation. States \n     should maintain a strong role in regulating the insurance \n     market and have the ability to maintain and operate their own \n     exchanges, with the understanding that some national \n     standards will need to be established. California has a long \n     history of protecting consumers through our two separate \n     insurance regulators, one covering health maintenance \n     organizations and the other monitoring all other insurance \n     products. Maintaining a strong regulatory role at the state \n     level is in the best interest of consumers, and I urge \n     Congress to maintain this longstanding and effective \n     relationship as you design these new market structures.\n       I hope our experience in California working toward \n     comprehensive health care reform has informed the debate in \n     Washington. There will be many short-term triumphs and \n     seemingly insurmountable roadblocks for\n\n[[Page S10003]]\n\n     Congress and the nation on the road to comprehensive health \n     care reform. We must all remain focused on the goal of fixing \n     our health care system and remember that we all have \n     something to gain from the reforms, and we all have a shared \n     responsibility to achieve them. I look forward to working \n     with you as you move forward on this desperately needed \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Georgia \nthat we are not being clever when we say we would like to be cosponsors \nof the Harry Reid amendment. The problems of the States are so well \ndocumented today. They don't just exist in Nevada or the two or three \nother States he picked out yesterday; they exist in California, which \nis now not part of the Reid amendment. I guess that Senators Feinstein \nand Boxer would be happy to cosponsor the Reid amendment if it included \nCalifornia. I certainly would be if it included Tennessee. I know the \nSenator from New York and others would be also.\n  Our States cannot afford to have the Federal Government say: We are \ngoing to expand your health care, Mr. and Mrs. Low-Income American. It \nis not a very good health care program. And then we are going to send \n40 percent of the bill to States that are already bankrupt, making it \nmore difficult for them to provide good care.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator from Tennessee has said frequently over the \nlast couple of months that what we really need to do is take a step-by-\nstep approach. Comprehensive health care reform's unintended \nconsequences will be a disaster because it affects 17 percent of the \neconomy. You are taking the entitlements and 86 percent of the people \nwho have some coverage and you are threatening that they have to go \ninto a government option. This Medicaid debate is a good example of how \nwe need to take a step-by-step approach, we need to take first things \nfirst.\n  In the report before our committee, the HELP Committee, on which we \nserve together, we spent 67\\1/2\\ hours in the markup on that bill \nduring the months of June and July. We heard about the uninsured and \nthe uncovered in America. Of that 14 to 16 percent we hear about, a \nnumber of them are Medicare or Medicaid eligible, and they are not \nenrolled. So the first step we ought to take is to say we are going to \ncreate a mechanism where every Medicaid-eligible person and Medicare-\neligible person is covered, which would probably mean that when someone \nvisits a hospital because they are ill and they are qualified for \nMedicare or Medicaid, they get enrolled automatically so that they do \nhave the coverage. That is the first step we ought to take in terms of \nentitlement.\n  Then we can take another part of the uninsured--those people you and \nI talk about, the independent contractors, small businesspeople--and we \ncan allow the forming of risk pools across State lines and insurance \nsales across State lines and allow like professions to associate \ntogether to form larger risk pools to compete with major corporations. \nAnd then insurance becomes more accessible and affordable.\n  This debate we are having over Medicaid and the Governors' immediate \nreaction--which is 100 percent of the Governors, not just a couple--\ndemonstrates to us that we need to slow down and take step-by-step \napproaches to begin addressing the uncovered and uninsured without \ncreating unintended consequences that bankrupt States and ration health \ncare.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator is being very sensible. I think most \nAmericans would agree with us that our goal is to reduce the costs of \nhealth care--reduce the costs of your health care insurance when you \nbuy it and reduce the costs to your government that is running up a big \ndebt every year.\n  The Senator from Georgia mentioned two specific ways we can take \nsteps in the right direction without getting into this business of \ntaking over so much in Washington, with trillions of dollars of debt, \npassing on big taxes to States, and cutting Medicare and threatening \nseniors in a whole variety of other ways. One was to allow small \nbusinesses to pool their insurance so they could offer more to their \nemployees. That could affect millions of Americans. Another was to sign \nup more people who are already eligible. Another is to do something \nabout junk lawsuits against doctors that are driving up costs. Another \nis to create more insurance exchanges in the States. We have proposed \nthese.\n  People say: Where is the Republican plan? If they are looking for \nsome comprehensive, trillion-dollar, thousand-page bill, they are not \ngoing to see it. If they are looking for four or five practical steps \nto move in the right direction, we talk about that every day, and we \nare not afraid to warn against the big, thousand-page bill plans. We \ncompliment the Senator from Nevada for recognizing that it would ruin \nhis State if we passed this bill, and we hope we have the opportunity \nto cosponsor that amendment so it applies to every State.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. There is no question--when the Senator referred to \nindependent contractors, I had a flashback to my 33 years in business. \nFor 22 of those years, I ran a real estate brokerage company. I had \naccountants, secretaries, and backroom operators. All my salespeople \nwere independent contractors. I provided group medical under ERISA for \nmy secretaries, backroom operators, and my employees, but the Federal \nlaw--the IRS Code--prohibits an employer from providing health care to \nan independent contractor.\n  So here we have another unintended consequence of a Federal mandate \nthat says to somebody: Simply because of the way in which you establish \nyourself and earn your income, some people can get group medical \ncoverage and some cannot. In the case of those who worked for me, it \nforced second-career, middle-aged people not to be able to participate \nin a group policy. They had to buy insurance in the spot market. That \nspot market in health care is expensive because there is no shared \nrisk. You don't have young people, older people, and well people to \nbalance the cost of the pool. You have one individual who, if they \nalready have health problems, may be uninsurable because of a \npreexisting condition.\n  It is important that we look at the existing unintended consequences \nin the Tax Code that prohibit companies from being able to offer group \nmedical insurance to the independent contractors who work for them.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is exactly right.\n  As we think about Senator Reid's amendment and also the step-by-step \nproposals, one way to describe his amendment is to say to Nevada--and \nOregon, Rhode Island, and Michigan--that we are going to pay 100 \npercent of your Medicaid costs. That is a step in the right direction. \nI think that is the way I should characterize that. That is not a \ncriticism of the majority leader. That is saying: Mr. Majority Leader, \nyou are going in the right direction, but you didn't include Tennessee, \nand Tennessee is not expected to recover to the 2008 levels until 2014. \nState employees won't receive raises for 6 years, the reserves will be \ndepleted, and there will be no new construction projects.\n  Our Governor, a Democrat, said this proposal is the mother of all \nunfunded mandates. So I think Tennessee Senators would like to be \nincluded in the Reid amendment. I imagine the Texas Senators would too. \nThe Texas Medicaid office says the proposal would cost their State $20 \nbillion over 10 years if we here expand Medicaid there and make them \npay for a third or 40 percent of that. The South Carolina Governor says \nit would cost their State $1.1 billion over 10 years. I imagine those \nSenators would like to be a part of this. The Alaska Governor says it \nwould cost $140 million in State general funds. I imagine the Alaska \nSenators would like to cosponsor the amendment. Governor \nSchwarzenegger--I suppose his Senators would like to be part of this as \nwell. The Nebraska Governor says this could mean higher taxes in \nNebraska, cutting State aid to Nebraska school districts as well as \nState appropriations to universities. This proposal is not in \nNebraska's best interest. The South Dakota Governor said so as well.\n  This is serious business for the States. It is easy, when you come to \nWashington, to forget about the States. In the States, if you are a \nGovernor or if you are a legislator, as the Senator from Georgia and I \nhave been, you have to put all your responsibilities out there ahead of \nyou. The first one is education. You take the available money and spend \nit as best you can and you balance your budget. Then\n\n[[Page S10004]]\n\nyou look up to Washington, and here comes some Congressman or Senator \nsaying: I have a great idea; let's expand health care all over your \nState and you will pay for it. That is called an unfunded Federal \nmandate. It is the wrong thing to do. The Senator from Nevada noticed \nit in his State.\n  All States would like to be part of that amendment.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I agree. You cannot just treat 4 States differently from \nthe other 46. You have to treat everybody alike.\n  I say to Senator Alexander that there is another step-by-step thing \nwe ought to talk about. In the pay-fors--the Medicaid increase of 150 \npercent is a pay-for. It is part of the cost of insuring everybody. \nThere is another one; that is, the assumed $500 billion in savings from \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. I got a phone call----\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That often confuses people. Medicaid is the program we \nhave been talking about, of which States administer and pay a third or \n40 percent. That has about 59 million people in it. The proposal is to \nmove it to where one out of four Americans would be on Medicaid. There \nis also Medicare, which has about 40 million people, all seniors.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. This is my Medicare month. I am supposed to enroll. So \nit is now a personal issue with me.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is the way it is with most Americans. It has \nbecome a personal issue, and I think that is why so many people are \ngoing to townhall meetings.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I did a telephone townhall meeting, and a fellow said: \nSenator, I have a question for you. If there is $500 billion in savings \nin Medicare, why aren't you all using it now to help save Medicare \ninstead of giving it to another program to pay for it? Medicare is \ngoing broke by 2017.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes, and that is not just a casual statement. Those \nare the Medicare trustees, whose job it is to look over the Medicare \nmoney, who are saying it is going broke by 2015 to 2017.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. They are saying it is over. So we are selling a revenue \nsaver to pay for the expansion of health care at the Federal level by \nsaying we are going to reduce payout for seniors in Medicare by $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in waste, fraud, and abuse. Well, assuming we know there is \n$\\1/2\\ trillion there, it ought to already be cut out and it ought to \nbe going into the Medicare trust fund to shore it up so it lasts longer \nthan 2017. We should never promise we are going to pay for something on \nsomething we think is there and then just move the numbers down for the \nconvenience of making a sale today.\n  I think, as a senior, and on behalf of all seniors, we all realize if \nthat $\\1/2\\ trillion isn't there in waste, fraud, and abuse, the first \nthing you are going to do is have reimbursements cut; the next thing, \ninstead of three out of four doctors taking Medicare patients, it will \nonly be two out of four or one out of three; and pretty soon the next \nthing is that seniors will have health care that is inaccessible and \ntheir doctors will not be available. That is a dangerous road to go \ndown.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I hear our friends on the other side say: Republicans \nare trying to scare you about Medicare cuts. We are not trying to scare \nanybody about Medicare cuts. We just listen, and the President said in \nhis speech to us that the savings for this program--nearly $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in savings to pay for the new program is coming from savings \nin Medicare. That is Medicare cuts. We know the specific proposals are \n$130 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage, which one out of four \nMedicare seniors has; $120 billion in Medicare cuts to hospitals; $40 \nbillion to home health agencies; $8 billion to hospices.\n  Our point, if I am correct about this--and if I am not, please \ncorrect me--of course there could be savings in Medicare, in the growth \nof it, but if we have savings in Medicare, we ought to put the money \ninto Medicare; we ought not to take it from grandma and spend it on \nsomebody else. That is the problem. The other day, the Senator from \nKansas said it is like writing a check on an overdrawn bank account to \nbuy a big, new car. Whatever money we ought to have ought to go in the \noverdrawn bank account, which is Medicare.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. That is correct.\n  Social Security is another example of what happens when you don't \nhave good fiscal discipline. Unfortunately, for the better part of half \na century, when people have paid their FICA taxes to go into the Social \nSecurity trust fund, it goes in and then immediately it is replaced by \nan IOU and the money is moved to general appropriations and spent. That \nis why Social Security is going broke in 2037. I just got my statement \nlast week, and on the cover--everybody ought to read their Social \nSecurity letter, the column on the right-hand side which tells you what \nthe trustees are telling you about the solvency of Social Security.\n  We cannot make any more hollow promises to the American people. We \nhave to keep the promises we have made, and those promises are \nMedicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. So instead of expanding things \nwe already can't afford, we need to be finding ways to stabilize them \nbefore we run off and make a promise we can't keep.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 13 minutes 54 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Two minutes fifty-four seconds. If the Senator from \nGeorgia will permit me, I ask unanimous consent to put in the Record \nthe following----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 13 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thought you said 2 minutes 54 seconds. We will \ncontinue. I remember former Senator Warner once said when he first came \nto the Senate, he was sitting there wondering what to do. One of the \nolder Senators came over and said to him: Son, you will have no trouble \ngetting used to this. All you have to do is stand up and start talking \nand eventually you will think of something to say.\n  I think we have something of considerable importance to say. What we \nare saying is we need health care reform and the focus should be on \nreducing costs and we ought to go step by step toward those costs. That \nis our proposal, instead of these big, comprehensive, trillion-dollar, \n1,000-page bills with all these unintended consequences.\n  We are talking about one of those unintended consequences, which is a \nvery severe consequence for the States. The idea that Senators and \nCongressmen would decide to expand a program that is going to cover one \nout of four Americans, called Medicaid, and just send the bill to the \nStates which, according to today's Wall Street Journal: ``plunging \nstate revenues noted that the second quarter was the worst performance \nfor state taxes since at least the 1960s.'' This is not just Nevada and \nMichigan and Oregon and Rhode Island, which are the four States that \nwere in the majority leader's amendment. This is virtually all the \nStates.\n  If the Senator from Georgia will indulge me for a moment, I have \nseveral letters from Governors to Senators that I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record at the end of our remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, here is a letter to Mr. Bill Nelson, \na Senator from Florida, from Gov. Charlie Crist, talking about \nenrollment in Florida's Medicaid Program increasing and how the State \nof Florida cannot afford to spend more.\n  I have a letter from Governor Otter of Idaho to Senator Crapo: ``It \nhas been estimated that combined federal-state Medicaid costs in Idaho \ncould increase by $501 million.''\n  I have a letter from Governor Daniel of Indiana to Senator Lugar \nwhich says: ``We have estimated that the price for Indiana could reach \nupwards of $724 million annually.''\n  We talk about big numbers in Washington so much that maybe this \ndoesn't sound like much. But I did an estimate of what it would cost, I \nsay to Senator Isakson, in Tennessee if we expanded Medicaid in the way \nit is proposed here and we increase the reimbursement rate so patients \nin Medicaid will actually have somebody to go see, a doctor or a \nhospital to go see. I said it equaled about a new 10-percent State \nincome tax. Some group in Tennessee said: The Senator is wrong, it is \nonly\n\n[[Page S10005]]\n\nabout a 3-percent new State income tax. Well, either one, we don't want \nelected representatives in Washington deciding for us whether we want a \nnew 10-percent or 3-percent State income tax.\n  There are just a few more I wish to include. I have a letter to \nSenator Reed from the Governor of Rhode Island. Of course, Rhode Island \nwas included in the majority leader's amendment. They should feel \npretty good. They are going to get 100 percent of their Medicaid paid.\n  The Governor of Arizona has written to Senator McCain and Senator Kyl \nto point out that ``Arizona is facing one of the worst financial \ndeficits in the nation. . . .'' If Arizona is facing one of the worst \nfinancial deficits in the Nation, why is it left out of the majority \nleader's amendment? It seems to me the citizens of Arizona deserve just \nas much attention. I imagine their Senators would like to cosponsor it \nas well.\n  I have a letter from the Governor of Louisiana talking about an \nunprecedented fiscal situation and the Governor of Mississippi saying:\n\n       In Mississippi, the issue of Medicaid expansion hits close \n     to home, since our state's share of the Medicaid is currently \n     $707 million. . . .\n\n  ``According to the National Association of State Budget Officers, \nGovernor Barbour said, Medicaid expenses . . . were $336 billion'' for \nState and local government and a third of that is State money, and we \nare just going to up it. We don't raise that money, we just send them \nan edict from Washington and say: We have decided that a good thing to \ndo is to increase the number of low-income Americans in your Medicaid \nProgram and you pay for it, you take it out of this road, you take it \nout of this teacher's salary, you raise the tuition at the University \nof Tennessee or Georgia and you cut their State funds. That is up to \nyou, but we are going to pass the program.\n  Here is a letter to the Senator from Nebraska saying this new \nunfunded Federal Medicaid mandate could result in higher taxes in \nNebraska or in cutting State aid to Nebraska school districts. I \nimagine the Senators from Nebraska, both of whom were Governors, would \nbe happy to be cosponsors of the Reid amendment.\n  Here is the letter to Senator Graham from the Governor of South \nCarolina. Another from the Governor of Alabama; a letter from the \nGovernor of Alaska and the Governor of Guam.\n  I say to Senator Isakson, we have been fairly specific on one point. \nI heard on the television this morning someone said this is so \nconfusing to the American people; they don't understand it. I think \nthey can understand an unfunded Federal mandate. I think they can \nunderstand the Governor has to raise taxes unless Congress pays 100 \npercent of it. I think they can understand it when the majority leader \npicks out four States and says we will pay 100 percent of ours and the \nrest want to be part of that as well.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The American people understand. This colloquy has been \nhelpful to demonstrate something, I say to Senator Alexander. We on the \nRepublican side have been accused from time to time of being \nobstructionists on health care reform. I think we indicated this \nmorning we have been instructive, going on a step-by-step basis, \ndealing with the problems manageable one at a time, not sacrificing \nSocial Security or Medicaid or Medicare, not sacrificing our States and \nforcing them into the impossible position of declining revenues and \nincreasing costs through a mandated Federal program that, in the end, \nis only going to result in rationing of care to Medicaid-eligible \nbeneficiaries and more and more pressure on our States already.\n  We are not trying to obstruct anything. We find it very instructive \nthat there are ways, on a step-by-step basis, that we can close the gap \non the number of uninsured people without taking away the benefits \nothers have.\n  I thank the Senator for allowing me the opportunity to participate in \nthis discussion. We are learning from our Governors. I have learned \nfrom my townhall meetings and from my visits in Georgia. We understand \nAmerica is tuned in and a lot of America, 16 percent of it, needs \nattention for more affordable, accessible health care. Let's be about \nthe business, on a step-by-step basis, of providing that and closing \nthat gap without threatening to destroy the programs we have \nestablished over the years and promised to our seniors and to those \nless fortunate.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nhis experience in State government and for his comments today. We want \nthe majority leader to know our comments yesterday were not to be \ncritical of him, just to say we think he is on the right track. He said \nto four States: If we expand your Medicaid, we are going to pay for it. \nWe would like to include all States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                             State of Arizona,\n\n                                       Phoenix, AZ, July 16, 2009.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n     Senator Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain and Senator Kyl: Thank you for the \n     opportunity to provide information about Arizona's Medicaid \n     program, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System \n     (AHCCCS).\n       As you know, Arizona is facing one of the worst financial \n     deficits in the nation and projections show that the State is \n     expected to make a slow recovery. In the meantime, \n     unemployment has continued to increase and counter-cyclical \n     programs like AHCCCS have continued to experience record-\n     breaking enrollment. In the last four months alone, AHCCCS \n     has grown by more than 100,000 new enrollees, and July 2009 \n     enrollment is almost 17 percent above the same month in 2008. \n     Total enrollment, including our Title XXI KidsCare program, \n     in July reached 1,275,109 members, which is almost 19 percent \n     of the state's total population.\n       I am proud that AHCCCS program has served as a model for \n     other state Medicaid programs across the country in terms of \n     cost containment. This is due, in large part, to the fact \n     that AHCCCS is a capitated managed care model and 65 percent \n     of its long-term care members receive home and community \n     based services rather than institutional care. According to \n     the Kaiser Family Foundation, AHCCCS has the lowest per \n     member per year (PMPY) cost among Medicaid programs in the \n     country. The average PMPY costs are: 1) $5,645.52 for acute \n     care; 2) $45,960.72 for long-term care, which is a blended \n     average of our elderly and physically disabled and \n     developmentally disabled programs. The weighted average PMPY \n     cost across all Title XIX groups is $7,182.60.\n       I am concerned that the Medicaid expansion proposals being \n     discussed at the federal level do not consider the fiscal \n     difficulties states are facing and are likely to continue to \n     face over the next few years. At the same time as Congress is \n     considering prohibiting states from changing their Medicaid \n     eligibility standards, there have been discussions about \n     establishing a federal floor for Medicaid provider rates, \n     which even further limits state flexibility in setting \n     funding levels. State flexibility has been key to Arizona's \n     success in developing and efficiently managing a Medicaid \n     program that provides high quality care at a low cost.\n       Even with our strong cost containment measures, I remain \n     concerned about Arizona's ability to sustain the existing \n     AHCCCS model, let alone a mandatory expansion to 150 percent, \n     regardless of whether the federal government provides full \n     financing of the expansion for the first five years. Medicaid \n     is already an increasing share of state budgets--Arizona's \n     General Fund spending on AHCCCS has increased by 230% over \n     the past ten years, and has risen from 8 percent of General \n     Fund spending in FY 1999 to an estimated 16 percent in FY \n     2009. Maintaining this level of spending increases will be \n     difficult, especially given that Medicaid enrollment and \n     costs continue to rise. Moreover, Arizona's revenues are not \n     expected to turn around for several years and, even when they \n     do rebound, we would require significant revenue growth in \n     order to sustain rising expenditures for the existing \n     Medicaid program.\n       Attached, please find data responsive to your requests. \n     There is a summary sheet that provides an overview of the \n     information requested, along with several other sheets that \n     provide additional detail. As you know, there are many \n     unanswered questions regarding the proposals. This analysis \n     includes the assumptions that were used to develop the \n     figures, which will obviously change as the proposals are \n     refined.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have \n     questions or should require additional information. I share \n     your concern regarding Arizona's ability to expand its \n     Medicaid program and what the long-term fiscal implications \n     will be for Arizona, and I hope you find this information \n     useful as you consider the various proposals that are before \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Janice K. Brewer,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n[[Page S10006]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                             State of Indiana,\n\n                              Indianapolis, IN, September 8, 2009.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: During your summer recess I am sure \n     that many, if not all of you heard from your constituents \n     regarding health care reform.\n       I have heard from them as well. In fact, over the past few \n     months, I have watched Americans come forward to passionately \n     express their anxieties about the legislation currently \n     making its way through Congress. Their worries are well-\n     founded.\n       There is no disputing the fact that aspects of American \n     health care, such as access and affordability, truly do need \n     to be restructured and improved. Yet, I have serious concerns \n     about Congress's proposed solutions to these problems. In \n     fact, I fear the current rush to overhaul the system will \n     ultimately do more damage than good and create far more \n     problems than it solves.\n       And unfortunately, Indiana would bear the brunt of many of \n     the reckless policies being proposed. For example, our \n     Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP), an innovative and successful \n     state sponsored health insurance program for uninsured \n     citizens, would suffer greatly as Congress expands Medicaid \n     coverage, forcing many of the Hoosiers already enrolled in \n     HIP out of the plan and into a broken Medicaid program that \n     does not focus on prevention, healthy lifestyles, or personal \n     responsibility.\n       Additionally, states will likely have to pick up the tab \n     for this extension of Medicaid. We have estimated that the \n     price for Indiana could reach upwards of $724 million \n     annually. These additional costs will overwhelm our resources \n     and obliterate the reserves we have fought so hard to \n     protect.\n       While these reforms could do serious damage to our state, I \n     fear they will also have harmful consequences all across the \n     country by reducing the quality and quantity of available \n     medical care, stifling innovation, and further burdening \n     taxpayers.\n       There is another way. Americans from all walks of life and \n     every political stripe should work together with President \n     Obama and Congress to create a set of measured and sensible \n     reforms that bring down costs, increase access and \n     portability and stress the importance of innovative state-run \n     health insurance programs.\n       The majority of Americans do believe that health care \n     reform is needed, but do not believe that the legislation \n     currently on offer is the answer. I agree. And I will do \n     everything in my power to raise these concerns and work with \n     you to find a solution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                M.E. Daniels, Jr.,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               State of Idaho,\n\n                                 Boise, Idaho, September 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Mike Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Crapo: Idaho has a proud history of fiscal \n     responsibility, ensuring that our State government serves its \n     proper role for the people of Idaho while staying within \n     their financial means. As the United States Congress attempts \n     to address the healthcare challenges facing our nation, it is \n     important that we remain diligent in assessing the \n     implications of our decisions, always ensuring that we take \n     seriously our duty to safeguard the financial resources of \n     the American public, and allocating taxpayer money in an \n     efficient and effective manner.\n       As revised healthcare proposals continue appearing in \n     Congress, the full consequences of these reforms remain \n     unknown and we are uncertain of the possible negative impacts \n     on local businesses, families and senior citizens. However, \n     it is clear that these sweeping proposals would irresponsibly \n     shift a substantial and unmanageable financial burden to the \n     states. Like Idaho, many states already are functioning under \n     severely limited and strained budgets. It is certain that the \n     burden of these reforms would be placed upon the shoulders of \n     hardworking Americans.\n       The costs associated with these proposed reforms are \n     astounding. Conservative estimates from the Idaho Division of \n     Medicaid indicate that the bill's Medicaid eligibility \n     proposal would increase our state share of Medicaid and the \n     federal matching rate effective would drop in the middle of \n     fiscal year 2011, leaving Idaho struggling to fill the void. \n     Idaho's tax base could not support this large unfunded \n     mandate without resorting to tax increases, including a \n     possible increase in Idaho's already 6-cent sales tax--an \n     irresponsible action which would do serious harm to Idaho \n     taxpayers. The proposed reforms would impose an undue burden \n     on citizens already struggling in this difficult economy.\n       It has been estimated that combined federal-state Medicaid \n     costs in Idaho could increase by $501 million. In addition, \n     raising the Medicaid reimbursement rate to 110 percent of the \n     Medicare reimbursement rate would increase total federal-\n     state costs $50 million more.\n       This proposed change in the federal reimbursement rate \n     likely would reduce the number of plans that are offered to \n     persons on Medicare, resulting in increased premiums and \n     reduced services and access to service providers. Seniors in \n     rural Idaho already have trouble finding providers who accept \n     Medicare patients. Should these changes be approved, that \n     trend could continue statewide--severely limiting access to \n     medical care for some of Idaho's most vulnerable residents.\n       The people of Idaho have entrusted us with a responsibility \n     to use our government resources wisely and efficiently. \n     Imposing costly federal mandates that cannot be sustained in \n     the long run is an irresponsible violation of this public \n     trust. Quite simply, these proposals are financially \n     irresponsible and would not adequately address the needs of \n     senior citizens and other vulnerable groups.\n       I encourage you to join me in opposing current health care \n     reform proposals. By ending these nonsensical debates and \n     stopping the proposed reforms, we can move forward in a more \n     positive, measured and reasonable direction, using common \n     sense to find a workable healthcare solution that benefits \n     all Americans.\n           As Always--Idaho, ``Esto Perpetua,''\n                                             C.L. ``Butch'' Otter,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         State of Mississippi,\n\n                                                September 8, 2009.\n     Hon. Roger Wicker,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wicker: Governors across the nation are \n     growing increasingly concerned about the financial strain \n     rising healthcare costs are putting on state budgets. During \n     the National Governors Association (NGA) meeting in July, \n     governors--both Republicans and Democrats--formalized their \n     opposition to current Congressional reform proposals by \n     issuing a policy opposing unfunded mandates that shifts costs \n     to the states. This will necessarily require almost all \n     states to raise taxes to manage this burden. In Mississippi, \n     the issue of Medicaid expansion hits close to home, since our \n     state's share of the Medicaid program is currently $707 \n     million, or 12 percent of a $5.87 billion state-supported \n     budget, which includes temporary stimulus funds.\n       Nevertheless, the current proposals, both in the House and \n     Senate, will expand the Medicaid program at additional costs \n     paid not by the federal government, but passed down to the \n     states. After a call with the governors representing the NGA \n     Healthcare Task Force and the Senate Finance Committee, \n     Chairman Baucus told the news media it would be impossible \n     for the federal government to pick up all the costs for new \n     Medicaid recipients; thus, states would have to bear some of \n     the costs.\n       Why? Although CBO appears to estimate that H.R. 3200 will \n     cost more than $1 trillion over the next ten years, the fine \n     print reveals the true cost would be much higher. By imposing \n     tax increases early in the budget window, before the bulk of \n     the spending occurs, the true cost of the bill is hidden by \n     budget gimmickry. Delaying the implementation of the program \n     until the fourth year also uses budget tricks effectively to \n     hide the immense long-term cost of this proposal. CBO has \n     projected a 10-year deficit of more than $200 billion \n     associated with the bill as is. However, when the full cost \n     of the bill is taken into account after it is fully \n     implemented, the spending in the bill skyrockets to nearly $2 \n     trillion over 10 years (2014-23) with a deficit of more than \n     $600 billion. I have included an attachment showing the \n     scoring of H.R. 3200 the only comprehensive health care \n     reform bill CBO has scored.\n       According to the National Association of State Budget \n     Officers, Medicaid expenses in 2007 for federal and state \n     government combined were $336 billion. This number is \n     projected to reach $523 billion by 2013, a 56 percent \n     increase in just six years. Should the reforms being debated \n     in Congress become law, Mississippi would be saddled with an \n     average increase of $360 million in additional costs, on top \n     of the already $707 million it costs to fund Mississippi's \n     annual state share of the Medicaid program. These proposals, \n     which would cover all individuals at 133 percent federal \n     poverty level (FPL), will burden state budgets, forcing \n     states to raise taxes. In Mississippi, that would necessarily \n     mean increases in our state income or sales tax rates. \n     Mississippi, like so many states, simply can't afford to pick \n     up the tab for another unfunded mandate passed by Congress.\n       Such state tax increases would be on top of the federal tax \n     increases already included in the House and Senate bills, \n     like huge tax increases on small businesses whether in the \n     form of an additional 8 percent payroll tax or a 5.4 percent \n     income tax surcharge. During a deep recession, when most \n     people believe job creation and economic growth should be top \n     priorities, huge tax increases will make it more expensive to \n     employ people; consequently, employers will employ fewer \n     people.\n       Medicare, the nation's largest provider of health coverage \n     for the elderly and people with disabilities covering over 46 \n     million Americans, is on the chopping block. CBO has \n     estimated that provisions in H.R. 3200 would lead to a total \n     of $162.2 billion in cuts being taken from Medicare Advantage \n     plans. This $162.2 billion impacts 11 million people and \n     represents nearly $15,000 in new costs passed to every \n     Medicare Advantage senior beneficiary. These harmful and \n     arbitrary cuts could result in Medicare Advantage plans \n     dropping out of the program, harming beneficiary choice, and \n     causing millions of seniors to lose their current coverage. \n     Moreover, the bill grants federal bureaucrats the power to \n     eliminate the Medicare Advantage program entirely, making the \n     oft-repeated statement, ``if you like your plan you can keep \n     it,'' ring hollow for seniors.\n\n[[Page S10007]]\n\n       Lastly, if we are trying to make health care more \n     affordable, how do you leave out tort reform? After all, \n     litigation and the resulting practice of defensive medicine \n     add tens of billions to the cost of health care. In \n     Mississippi we passed comprehensive tort reform in 2004, \n     partially to stop lawsuit abuse in the area of medical \n     liability. It worked. Medical liability insurance costs are \n     down 42 percent, and doctors have received an average rebate \n     of 20 percent of their annual paid premium. The number of \n     medical liability lawsuits against Mississippi doctors fell \n     almost 90 percent one year after tort reform went into \n     effect. Doctors have quit leaving the state and limiting \n     their practices to avoid lawsuit abuse.\n       With all the issues concerning a government-run health care \n     system, I wanted to warn you of the state tax increases \n     Mississippi will shoulder on top of the federal tax increases \n     in the pending bills as well as my concern for the increased \n     costs our senior citizens will face as Medicare Advantage is \n     cut. Congress must slow down and work in a bipartisan manner. \n     Everybody agrees that health reform is needed, but it should \n     be done thoughtfully. I hope you'll keep this important \n     information in mind when proposals that shift costs to \n     states--or to our senior citizens--are considered.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Haley Barbour,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S10007-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10007-S10009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ALASKA TERRITORIAL GUARD\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, on January 22 of this year, I came to \nthe floor to inform our colleagues in the Senate about a decision by \nthe Department of Defense that service in the Alaska Territorial Guard \nduring World War II would not be regarded as Active-Duty service for \npurposes of military retirement. That decision reversed the position \nthat had previously been taken by the Army that this service did count \ntoward military retirement.\n  As a consequence, 26 elderly Alaskans, descendants of the aboriginal \npeople who originally inhabited Alaska, 26 Native people, predominantly \nEskimo, were about to see a substantial reduction in their military \npensions, this all happening in the dead of an Alaska winter when we \nwere paying extraordinarily high fuel prices.\n  At that time when I came to the floor, I wondered out loud what kind \nof government, what kind of ``Cruella'' would cut the pensions of 26 \nelderly people who stood up to defend Alaska and our Nation during \nWorld War II with absolutely no prior warning, no advanced notice? The \nanswer was our government, on advice of the lawyers.\n  In the Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2001, Congress \nrecognized service in the Alaska Territorial Guard as Active-Duty \nservice. Section 8147 required the Secretary of Defense to issue \ndischarge certificates to each member of the Alaska Territorial Guard \nunder honorable conditions if the Secretary determined the nature and \nduration of the service of the individual so warrants. The military \nfirst concluded that included retirement benefits and then abruptly \nreversed that position with immediate effect.\n  As Lieutenant Colonel McNorton explained in a story carried by the \nAssociated Press, section 8147 applies to military benefits, including \nhealth benefits, but it does not make members of the Territorial Guard \neligible for retirement pay.\n  I must emphasize, at this point, that no Alaska Territorial guardsman \nclaimed a military pension solely because of his service in the \nTerritorial Guard. The Alaska Territorial Guard was created in 1942 and \ndisbanded in 1947. Many members of the ``Tundra Army,'' as some called \nit, continued to serve in the Alaska National Guard and other units of \nthe military. That service, combined with service in the Territorial \nGuard, forms the basis for the claim.\n  I have come to learn that when you use the term ``Cruella'' on the \nSenate floor, people sit up and take notice. My remarks were \ntelegraphed across the blogosphere and national media outlets. The \nresponse that came from across the country to the plight of the 26 \nelderly Alaskans was truly heartwarming. Across the ideological \nspectrum, the response from the American people was outrage over this \nsituation. The high level of national interest in the plight of these \nAlaska Territorial Guard members was not lost on the senior leaders of \nthe Army. The Secretary of the Army rose to the occasion. He reached \ninto his emergency and extraordinary expense fund--the triple E fund--\nto continue the payments to those elders for 60 days, in the hope that \nCongress would have an opportunity to address the issue by then.\n  My colleague, Senator Begich, and I promptly introduced legislation \nto correct that situation, but the legislation was not considered \nbefore the 60 days of temporary payments ran out. The Alaska \nLegislature stepped up to fill the gap, and they enacted legislation to \ncontinue the payments from State funds until February of 2010 in order \nto, again, give Congress the time to fix the problem.\n  With the support of our colleagues--and I especially appreciate the \nleadership and support from Senator Levin, my colleague and friend \nSenator Inouye, and Senator Cochran--language to clarify that service \nin the Alaska Territorial Guard counts toward eligibility for \nretirement pay that was included in that 2010 Defense authorization \nbill----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, it was my understanding that I was to \nhave 15 minutes under this time agreement; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair is aware of no such \nagreement, and the time for the Republican side has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I do have additional comments I wish \nto make. I ask unanimous consent that I have 5 minutes to conclude \nthese remarks, if that is acceptable.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I also wish to recognize my friend \nand colleague, Senator McCain, who was there at the end to help us with \nthis issue.\n  The people of Alaska thank our colleagues, Senator Inouye, Senator \nMcCain, and so many others for the consideration that was given these \nAlaska Territorial guardsmen. Last Friday, we were disappointed to \nlearn that some in the administration might not share our enthusiasm \nfor putting this matter to bed and restoring the retirement benefits \nfor the 26 elderly Alaska Native veterans.\n  The statement of administration position on the Defense \nappropriations bill contains two sentences that read as follows:\n\n       The administration objects to a new General Provision that \n     would count as ``active duty'' service the time the Alaska \n     Territorial Guard members served during World War II. This \n     provision would establish a precedent of treating service \n     performed by a State employee as active duty for purposes of \n     the computation of retired pay.\n\n  The notion that restoring these benefits establishes a precedent of \ntreating service performed by a State employee as active-duty service \ndefies logic and it defies history. Not only is it inconsistent with \nthe letter of Congress's finding in section 8147 of the 2001 Defense \nAppropriations Act that the service was indeed Federal service, it is \ninconsistent with the facts, and I believe it is inconsistent with the \nlaw.\n  When our Lieutenant Governor--retired LTG Craig Campbell--heard this, \nhe remarked:\n\n       The administration doesn't understand what the territorial \n     guard is. This was an initiative of the Federal Government. \n     They provided a federal service.\n\n  General Campbell recently retired as Adjutant General of the Alaska \nNational Guard, and he is absolutely correct on this.\n  The Alaska Territorial Guard was created back in 1942 to protect \nAlaska from invasion by the Japanese. The notion that Japan had an \ninterest in Alaska was far from speculative, as we know. The Japanese \nbombed Dutch Harbor and landed in Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Chain. \nEnemy submarines lurked in the Bering Sea.\n  The ATG was organized by U.S. Army MAJ Marvin Marston under the \nleadership of a territorial Governor who reported to Washington. These \nwere Uncle Sam's men. All who served were volunteers. They were not \nState employees. It was organized in the name of the President of the \nUnited States, and it was armed by the U.S. Army. The operations of the \nunits were inspected by the U.S. Army, and the unit was disbanded in \n1947 by order of the U.S. Army. The unit was well known\n\n[[Page S10008]]\n\nfor its skill in protecting Alaska. These gentlemen were Native hunters \nand fishermen, but they knew the land better than any soldier that the \narmy might have sent up from the lower 48. They kept watch over 5,000 \nmiles of coastline for enemy vessels and submarines, shooting down \nJapanese balloon bombs, protecting the Lend-Lease Route between Alaska \nand Russia and recovering downed airmen. These were the core missions \nof the territorial guard.\n  It is very disappointing that 62 years after the Alaska Territorial \nGuard was disbanded the value of their service to our Nation and to our \nsuccess in World War II has been drawn into question.\n  When I came to the floor on January 22 of this year, I gave the \nDefense Department the benefit of the doubt. I believe, as did General \nCampbell and his staff judge advocate, that the 2000 legislation \nentitled members of the ATG to all the military benefits merited by \ntheir service. The military at one time held that position, but then on \nJanuary 22, they didn't. I called upon the Department of Defense to \nwork with me, to work with Senator Begich, to make things right. The \nAlaska congressional delegation wrote to the President to enlist his \npersonal support for this effort.\n  Nine years now have passed since Congress determined that service in \nthe Alaska Territorial Guard during World War II was Federal service. \nNine years have passed since the Secretary of Defense ordered that \nthese brave members of the tundra army who remain alive are entitled to \ndischarge certificates from the U.S. Army; 9 years since they were \ngranted full Federal veterans benefits. I would suggest it is 9 years \ntoo late for the Defense Department to reopen the question of whether \nservice in the ATG was Federal service. The Congress has answered this \nquestion with finality.\n  I mentioned that many Americans have registered their opinions on the \nInternet over the administration's position on territorial guard \nretirement benefits. Many think it is cruel to continue to deny these \nbenefits. And many believe the administration's position denigrates the \nservice of the Alaska Territorial Guard. Some have suggested the men \nwho served deserve an apology. But one perceptive individual suggested, \nI doubt that President Obama actually made this decision or even knows \nabout it.\n  So once again, I ask that President Obama personally support us in \nour quest to obtain justice for a few elderly Alaska Natives who once \nserved our Nation with patriotism, with pride, and with distinction.\n  President Obama, show some heart, do the right thing, and support our \nefforts to restore military retirement benefits for these 26 \nindividuals.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 7 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I rise today to seek the continued \nsupport of my colleagues for recognition of a group of patriotic heroes \nwho defended our Nation and Alaska from our enemies in World War II.\n  In 1935, famed Army GEN Billy Mitchell told Congress:\n\n       I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will \n     hold the world. I think it is the most important strategic \n     place in the world.\n\n  General Mitchell was right. Less than a decade later, Alaska became \nthe first American soil occupied by a foreign enemy since the \nRevolutionary War. To counter Japanese aggression against the territory \nof Alaska during World War II, a group of Alaskan Natives voluntarily \nformed the Alaska Territorial Guard. These brave men engaged in direct \ncombat, as described by my colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, \nwith the enemy in protecting all of Alaska. They shot down Japanese air \nballoons, conducted scouting patrols, carried out rescue missions of \ndowned airmen, and built military airstrips and rescue shelters.\n  They played a key role in logistics support for the U.S. military \nstationed in Alaska by delivering food, ammunition, and other equipment \nto the forces. Their actions were vital to successful U.S. military \nefforts, preventing our enemies from securing a strategic location \nduring the war.\n  As you can see by these photos surrounding me, the Alaska Territorial \nGuard was a unique group. They were mostly subsistence hunters and \nfishermen--the main breadwinners in their families--living in some of \nthe most remote villages in the entire country. Receiving no pay or \nrecognition for their service, the territorial guard mission was driven \nby a single value: patriotism.\n  Many of these members continued their service for years in the U.S. \nmilitary after the Alaska Territorial Guard was disbanded in 1947. \nUnfortunately, the contributions of the Alaska Territorial Guard during \nWorld War II went unrecognized for half a century. In 2000, Congress \nfinally acknowledged our Nation's debt to these brave men by qualifying \ntheir time spent in the Alaska Territorial Guard as Federal service.\n  Congress also directed the Secretary of the Army to issue discharge \ncertificates to all those who served in the territorial guard. These \ndischarge certificates entitled ATG members to veterans' benefits and \nwas interpreted by the Department of Defense to count as service in the \nAlaska Territorial Guard toward retirement credit. Twenty-six former \nmembers of the Alaska Territorial Guard finally began receiving a well-\nearned pension from the government. At long last, the sacrifice and the \ncontributions of Alaskan Natives during World War II were recognized.\n  Then in January of this year, abruptly and without warning, the \nDefense Finance and Accounting Service stopped issuing pensions to \nthese 26 guardsmen. This was based on the finding that their service \nwas not Federal and, therefore, the payments were not legal. \nThankfully, former Army Secretary Pete Geren issued temporary payments \nto ease the economic hardship experienced by these heroes while \nwe worked on a more permanent solution.\n\n  To its credit, the Alaska legislature stepped up where the Federal \ngovernment fell short. The State is paying their pensions until \nCongress can provide a permanent legislative solution or until February \n2010, whichever comes first. I cannot imagine another situation where \nCongress would stand by and let veterans' entitlements be revoked and \ntheir sacrifices go unrecognized.\n  Luckily, my Senate colleagues also recognized this injustice. I thank \nmy colleague, Senator Murkowski, who introduced S. 342, a bill to \nprovide for the treatment of service as a member of the Alaska \nTerritorial Guard during World War II as active service for purposes of \nretired pay to restore pensions. I am a proud cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  Working together with the leader of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Levin, and the ranking member, Senator McCain, we were able to \nsecure similar legislation to restore those pensions in an amendment to \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for the year 2010, supported \nunanimously by the Senate. Most recently, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee included the same provision in the Defense Appropriations Act \nfor fiscal year 2010.\n  However, I was extremely disappointed to learn in the statement of \nadministration policy for fiscal year 2010 Defense Appropriations bill \nthat the national administration has voiced objection to the provision \nthat would count Alaska Territorial Guard service as active-duty time \nfor retirement purposes. I remind my colleagues that the Alaska \nTerritorial Guard members were not State employees. They were patriotic \nAlaska Natives answering the call of duty from their country.\n  Allowing their service in the Alaska Territorial Guard to count as \nFederal service cannot set a precedent because there is no other group \nlike them in this country. They served the United States in a time of \nwar by defending an American territory from the enemy. They engaged in \ncombat. And they did this because they felt the same sense of \npatriotism during World War II that every active member of the Army and \nAir Force and every other military branch did.\n  These brave Alaskans are now in their 70s and 80s. Just this past \nMonday, one of them--Nicholai E. Nicholai\n\n[[Page S10009]]\n\nof Kwethluk--passed away before he could see this issue resolved. I ask \nmy colleagues for their continued support to ensure that the now 25 \nAlaskan Natives who defended this Nation receive their earned pension \nby supporting the provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act \nand Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2010.\n  I also join my colleague Senator Murkowski in asking the \nadministration to reexamine their objection to restoring the retirement \npayments and honoring our World War II veterans.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 3326, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3326) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McCain amendment No. 2575, to provide for testimony before \n     Congress on the additional forces and resources required to \n     meet United States objectives with respect to Afghanistan and \n     Pakistan.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I believe that the McCain amendment is \nthe pending amendment. We will be offering or suggesting that a \nunanimous consent agreement be entered into where an amendment of mine \ncould be voted upon side by side with the amendment, with the vote on \nmine occurring first, under the traditions of the Senate. We are trying \nto see if we can enter into a time agreement.\n  I believe our staff is working on a unanimous consent agreement that \nwould allow for that to happen pending the offering and acceptance of \nthat, hopefully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, may I say through the Chair to my \nfriend, the distinguished chairman, I understand there will be side-by-\nside amendments. I would be glad to enter into a time agreement that is \nagreeable to the chairman, and not an extended length of time--it is \nnot a complicated issue--and then votes on both side-by-sides. I hope \nwe could announce that agreement shortly, and I thank the chairman for \nhis courtesy.\n  We are discussing now two amendments, as I understand it, and both of \nthem call for testimony before Congress on meeting the United States \nobjectives on Afghanistan and Pakistan. Many of us have been very \nconcerned about the fact that we have not heard from General McChrystal \nand General Petraeus on this issue of our strategic policy in \nAfghanistan, and of course most importantly the disposition or \ndispatch, I might say, of American troops, and increasing American \ntroops to Afghanistan to implement the strategy that, according to \nAdmiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was agreed \nupon last March.\n  I must say, without mentioning any classified information, the \nbriefing that I attended yesterday with General Jones doesn't seem to \ncorroborate that statement by Admiral Mullen. But the point is we need \nto hear from the architects and the commanders.\n  If the President does not want to talk to the commander in the field, \nGeneral McChrystal very often--in fact, it was reported in a ``60 \nMinutes'' interview that he gave he said he had spoken to the President \nonce in 70 days, although the President talks to labor leaders almost \non a daily basis pushing his health care agenda--the fact is we as \nMembers of Congress, a coequal branch of government, also have a \nresponsibility in this decisionmaking process.\n  I respect the President's role as Commander in Chief. I respect the \nPresident of the United States making a decision. But I also cherish \nthe role of the Senate and House of Representatives in being informed \nas to the views of our military commanders in whom we place the \nresponsibility for the lives of our young men and women who are in \nharm's way.\n  All we are seeking with this amendment is a date certain, not \nimmediately--the date for this requirement of testimony by General \nMcChrystal, General Petreaus, General Stavridis and perhaps others if \nnecessary--by November 15. That is a month and a half from now. Should \nnot we hear a month and a half from now, within a month and a half, as \nto what we are considering? I hope the decision would be made clear.\n  Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, in testimony said:\n\n       The President has given us a clear mission: disrupt, \n     dismantle and defeat al Qaida . . .\n\n  But the President, in March, said of the situation--the President of \nthe United States said the situation there was ``increasingly perilous \nand that the future of this troubled nation is inextricably linked to \nthe future of its neighbor Pakistan.'' He also called it a ``war of \nnecessity,'' and declared ``America must no longer deny resources to \nAfghanistan.''\n  Obviously I agree with him. Time after time I have made my commitment \nof willingness and desire to work with him. But it is very difficult \nfor members of the Armed Services Committee and Members of the Senate \nto work with him if we are not informed by the uniformed commanders in \nthe field. Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nemphasized in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \ntime is not on our side. There are already somewhere between 62,000 and \n68,000 American troops in the field in danger. Tragically, casualties \nhave gone up. We have a responsibility also. We have a responsibility \nto hear from our commanders in the field.\n  Let me point out, General McChrystal was on ``60 Minutes'' talking \nabout what we needed to do in Afghanistan. General McChrystal gave a \nspeech in London just yesterday talking about what we needed to do. So \nit is OK with the administration for General McChrystal to go on ``60 \nMinutes.'' It is OK for him to give a speech at the Institute for \nStrategic Studies in London. But the administration does not want \nGeneral McChrystal and General Petreaus before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. How does that work?\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for my amendment, which calls for the \nsame, basically, testimony by the commander of the United States \nCentral Command, commander of the United States European Command, and \nSupreme Allied Commander--Europe, Commander of the United States \nForces--Afghanistan, and of course we would like to hear from the \nUnited States Ambassador to Afghanistan, Ambassador Eikenberry.\n  This is pretty clear. This is a very clear decision we have to make. \nWe are asking that within a month and a half from now these individuals \nappear before the respective committees and testify as to what they \nbelieve the best strategy is to be employed in order to achieve \nvictory. Why should not the Senate and the Congress and the people of \nthe United States hear, directly in testimony before the Congress, what \nthey believe is the best way to ensure victory in Afghanistan?\n  I understand the debate that is going on within the White House and \nthe deliberations that the President is undertaking as he considers the \nmost heavy responsibility that any President has, and that is to send \nour young men and women into harm's way. I have some sympathy. But I \nwould point out there are already close to 68,000 young Americans \nthere, and casualties are going up.\n  According to Admiral Mullen, according to every expert, the situation \nis deteriorating in Afghanistan, so this should not and must not be a \nleisurely exercise. Decisions have to be made and we--I speak for \nmyself and I am sure all of my colleagues--we want to be part of that \ndecisionmaking. We do not want to make that decision because that is \nthe responsibility of the President of the United States, but it\n\n[[Page S10010]]\n\nis also the responsibility of the Congress of the United States to \nappropriate the money for it.\n  When a President lost the confidence of the American people and the \nCongress of the United States in a war long ago and far away, the \nCongress of the United States did cut off the funding for further \nassistance in Vietnam.\n  I hope the Senate will act in a positive fashion and act on what I \nthink is a reasonable request, that within a month and a half we could \nhave the testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I remind my colleagues, the chairman of the House Armed Services \nCommittee, the distinguished Congressman Ike Skelton, and the ranking \nmember of the House Armed Services Committee, also want this testimony \nto take place. The majority leader of the House of Representatives, \nCongressman Hoyer, has also called for testimony before the Congress of \nthe United States. Why the administration should be reluctant to send \nthese people before us so we can, in any way we can find possible, \nsupport the President of the United States as he makes these tough \ndecisions--which we cannot do unless we are informed of the opinion of \nthose we are sending to command and lead in battle--then it is \ndifficult for us to show our support for the President in the form of \nappropriations bills and authorizations as to what is needed without \nhearing from the commanders in the field.\n  There will be discussion about General Petreaus's testimony before \nthe Congress of the United States. I remind my colleagues the decision \nwas made by the President on the surge very rapidly; that the decision \nwas made and General Petraeus was called before what--appeared before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee to give the reasons for that. I \nthink it is very important. It is very important that the man the \nPresident of the United States fired, the previous commander--let's be \nclear, fired the previous commander because he had confidence in \nGeneral McChrystal--that we should also be allowed the ability to hear \nabout his vision and his strategy that would bring about a successful \nconclusion of a long, tragic, hard involvement in Afghanistan.\n  I hope we can have the same luxury that the Institute for Strategic \nStudies in London received with General McChrystal giving a speech \nthere and answering questions; that we would have the same courtesy \nthat ``60 Minutes,'' the producers and commentators on ``60 Minutes'' \njust received. I hope the Senate would receive that same ability to \ndirectly question General McChrystal, General Petreaus, and others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I don't know if the unanimous consent \nagreement has been cleared yet, so I will proceed to debate both the \nMcCain amendment but also the amendment I will be offering as though it \nis currently pending, because I do expect both amendments will be voted \non at the same time.\n  First, to comment on the two statements that were just made by \nSenator McCain, one has to do with when did General Petraeus testify \nrelative to the Iraq surge. This is a very critical point because \nindeed General Petreaus did testify relative to the Iraq surge, but he \nonly testified after the decision was made relative to that surge by \nthe President of the United States. The person who was the commander in \nIraq at that time, while the deliberative process was underway in the \nWhite House as to whether a surge should take place, did not testify \nand was not asked to testify. There was no pressure placed on the \nPresident of the United States during those 3 months when he was \ndeliberating on whether to surge troops into Iraq, to have his Iraq \ncommander come up here and testify right in the middle of that \ndeliberative process. There was no resolution, there was no request, \nthere was no pressure being placed on the Bush White House to have his \ncommander, who was then General Casey in Iraq, to come up and testify \nabout whether additional troops should be sent to Iraq.\n  I have no doubt as to what the response would have been by President \nBush and his folks: We are in the middle of a deliberative process--\nwhich took about 3 months. Secretary Gates has testified to this. He \nhas spoken about this 3-month deliberative process and we have gone \nback and checked. It was about a 3-month deliberative process that the \nPresident then was engaged in.\n  The first thing that happened was that President Bush announced this \nsurge on January 10, 2007. Then and only then did Secretary Gates and \nGeneral Pace, who was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, testify before \nthe Armed Services Committee. And then and only then did General \nPetreaus testify before the committee on January 23. The commander in \nIraq during those critical months--September, October, November, \nDecember of 2006--was General Casey.\n  I think history records that he, as a matter of fact, opposed \nadditional troops to go in to Iraq. But there was no effort made here \nto get General Casey to come before us and to testify as to why he was \nopposed to putting troops into Iraq at the same time that President \nBush was considering whether to adopt a policy which would send \nadditional troops into Iraq. We did not do that and we didn't do it for \na good reason. We didn't think it was appropriate.\n  So my first comment has to do with whether the kind of policy that we \nadopted relative to the President of the United States when President \nBush was President, and undergoing the same kind of deliberative \nprocess as to whether additional troops should be sent into a country--\nvery similar to what President Obama is undergoing right now--whether \nthe commander there now should be put in a position which we did not \nput General Casey in? We know what the response of the Bush White House \nwould have been. There was no doubt as to what the response would be. \nWhile the President of the United States is thinking through whether to \nsurge troops into Iraq, his commanding general, General Casey, was not \ncalled before us. We did not have resolutions here saying call General \nCasey in. Those of us who opposed additional troops going into Iraq \nprobably had an ally in General Casey, as history has written; in \nopposition to sending in additional troops.\n  But there was no effort to put pressure on President Bush by having \nhis commander in the field come before us at a public hearing and say \nhe was opposed to the very thing the President of the United States was \nconsidering.\n  The commander, General Casey, was not put in that position. No \ncommander should be put in that position while the President is hearing \nfrom the commander as part of a deliberative process on the very \ncritical issue of whether to send troops in.\n  So a request was made of me by a number of my colleagues to have a \nhearing at which General McChrystal would be called. My answer was: We \nshould not do that at this time. There will be an appropriate time. \nThere will be an appropriate time.\n  The appropriate time is the same time General Petraeus was called in \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was called in, which was after the \ndecision and not in the middle of that deliberative process.\n  So the White House is now undertaking a rigorous review of General \nMcChrystal's assessment of the situation and approach in Afghanistan. \nBy the way, before I go any further on this, I read the transcript of \nGeneral McChrystal on ``60 Minutes.'' I have not seen the speech in \nLondon that my good friend, Senator McCain, made reference to, but I \nhave read the ``60 Minutes'' transcript. There was no effort to obtain \nfrom General McChrystal what his advice was relative to the resource \nquestion, the troops question, which lies before the President.\n  I know what his response would have been had he been asked, which is, \nthat is between him and the President. But the very purpose of the \nhearing which is the subject of the McCain amendment, the very purpose, \nis a hearing on the resources needed or recommended for Afghanistan. \nThat is the very subject which is now under consideration by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  So we have now a President, with his security team, including General \nMcChrystal, who I understand was on a TV monitor yesterday with his \nresponses--we have a President of the United States undertaking a \nrigorous\n\n[[Page S10011]]\n\nreview of General McChrystal's assessment. We have the assessment \nrelative to the situation in Afghanistan that has already been provided \nand has now been made public.\n  What is now under consideration is whether there ought to be a change \nin strategy from the March strategy, given the problems that have \noccurred in Afghanistan since the election, and given the other changes \nthat have taken place, including in neighboring Pakistan, which has an \neffect on Afghanistan.\n  According to General McChrystal himself, a policy debate is \nwarranted. What he has said over and over again in his assessment is: \nDebate strategy before you debate resources. He said: Resources are \ngoing to be needed whatever the strategy is. That is General \nMcChrystal's statement: There will be needed resources.\n  General McChrystal: ``Additional resources are required.'' This is \nhis assessment. But it is the second half of his sentence which is \nignored too often, particularly in the media. After he said additional \nresources are required, without specifying what they are, that is left \nto this document which is now in the hands of the President, he said:\n\n       Additional resources are required. But focusing on force or \n     resource requirements misses the point entirely. The key \n     takeaway--\n\n  He said from his assessment, these are his words--\n\n     is the urgent need for a significant change to our strategy \n     and the way that we think and operate.\n\n  Yet it is a hearing on resources that could come in the middle of a \ndeliberative process. We are not sure whether by November 15 that \ndeliberative process will be completed. I have every reason to believe \nit will be by November 15, but we do not know. So the McCain amendment \nhas an arbitrary date, whether this deliberative process is completed \nby November 15 or not under this resolution--and I will be offering an \nalternative to this. Under this McCain resolution, he must come before \nappropriate committees before November 15.\n  That is an arbitrary date, whether the deliberative process of the \nPresident of the United States is completed or not. But it is on the \nvery subject, on the very subject that is now under consideration by \nthe President. That subject is resources, troops. But listen to what \nGeneral McChrystal says. He said: Yes, there are going to be resources \nneeded--without specifying what they are.\n  As far as we know, he has not, at least in the assessment that is \nunclassified. But then he says:\n\n       New resources are not the crux. To succeed, ISAF requires a \n     new approach with a significant magnitude of change, in \n     addition to a proper level of resource.\n\n  So it is not the crux. He says strategy is the crux. But the McCain \namendment says: We want to hear from McChrystal by a specific date, \nwhether there has been a decision on the crux of the matter or not, \nwhich is the strategy. That is not me talking, that is General \nMcChrystal who is saying: The crux of the matter is the strategy.\n  So now we have the White House--by the way, I am happy to interrupt \nmy comments at any time if there is a unanimous consent agreement that \nhas been reached. So if either the ranking member or Senator McCain \nknows whether we are in a situation--I would tell you so everybody can \nknow what the proceedings are here, that at any time there is a \nunanimous consent agreement that can be offered, I would be happy to \ninterrupt.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to respond to my colleague on \nthat issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my colleague, we are asking if there are \nany other speakers. We should know that in a few more minutes. Then we \nwould agree to a time agreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n  So now General McChrystal himself talks about the value of a policy \ndebate. Here is what he said in the article in the New York Times: He \nwelcomes alternative proposals for how to stabilize Afghanistan and \nPakistan. Then he says: ``This is the right kind of process.'' He says: \n``I have been given the opportunity to provide my input to the \ndecision.''\n  So we have this internal deliberation going on in the White House, \nwhich I think we would all agree is a matter of supreme importance; \nthat is, whether we put troops in harm's way, and how many, what is the \nstrategy they are following, what is their mission. That is the most \nimportant decision I believe a President of the United States can make. \nIt should be a deliberative decision. It is going to be a deliberative \ndecision. This President has made it clear.\n  There was a March strategy, but there are a number of things that \nhave changed since March, including an election where there are \nsignificant allegations of fraud. When such an election takes place, \nthat lowers the support of the people of Afghanistan for a strategy \nwhich involves them. They must succeed. It is the people of Afghanistan \nwho have to succeed. It is the Army of Afghanistan that has to succeed. \nIt is the police in Afghanistan. It is the civil administration which \nmust succeed in Afghanistan.\n  If there is this question about an election which then might impact \nthe support of the people for the very policies in Afghanistan, the \ninstitutions that need to be fought for, that could change things. \nThere are events in Pakistan. The Pakistani Government is doing a lot \nbetter relative to some of the threats they face. That can make a \nchange. But the President of the United States is committed to \nreviewing what has happened since March, to see whether that strategy \nstill applies or whether he wishes to change that strategy. It is a \ndebate General McChrystal himself has said is warranted. There are a \nnumber of differences between the amendment which I am going to be \noffering and the pending amendment of Senator McCain.\n  Madam President, I think we now have a unanimous consent agreement \nwhich has been cleared. I ask unanimous consent that amendment numbers \n2593, which is the Levin amendment, and 2575, which is the McCain \namendment, be debated concurrently for a period of 30 minutes, with the \ntime equally divided and controlled between Senators Levin and McCain \nor their designees; that no amendments be in order to either amendment \nprior to a vote in relation thereto; that the vote sequence be as the \namendments are listed above; further, that once this agreement is \nentered, Senator Levin be recognized to call up amendment 2593; and \nthat prior to the second vote in the sequence, there be 2 minutes, \nequally divided and controlled, prior to each vote, with the second \nvote 10 minutes in duration; and that the votes in relation to the \namendments be at 2 p.m. today; provided further that following this \ndebate, the amendments be set aside until 2 p.m.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nask the distinguished chairman, does that mean 30 minutes from now, \nequally divided, or the time that has already been consumed?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand it means from now.\n  Mr. McCAIN. From now. I do not object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2593\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Arizona. I now call up amendment \nNo. 2593.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2593.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2593\n\n  (Purpose: Relating to hearings on the strategy and resources of the \n        United States with respect to Afghanistan and Pakistan)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Hearings on Strategy and Resources With \n     Respect to Afghanistan and Pakistan.--Appropriate committees \n     of Congress shall hold hearings, in open and closed session, \n     relating to the strategy and resources of the United States \n     with respect\n\n[[Page S10012]]\n\n     to Afghanistan and Pakistan promptly after the decision by \n     the President on those matters is announced.\n       (b) Testimony.--The hearings described in subsection (a) \n     should include testimony from senior civilian and military \n     officials of the United States, including, but not limited \n     to, the following:\n       (1) The Secretary of Defense.\n       (2) The Secretary of State\n       (3) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       (4) The Commander of the United States Central Command.\n       (5) The Commander of the United States European Command and \n     Supreme Allied Commander, Europe.\n       (6) The Commander of United States Forces-Afghanistan.\n       (7) The United States Ambassador to Afghanistan.\n       (8) The United States Ambassador to Pakistan.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I believe that the Congressional \nhearings, which are appropriate, should now be handled in the same way \nas was done when President Bush was deliberating on a surge strategy \nfor Iraq. That is when the President has received his recommendations \nand has made a decision.\n  We will, at that point, properly have administration officials come \nup to Congress, explain the President's decision. We will hear from our \nmilitary chain of command at that time, including General McChrystal \nbut not limited to General McChrystal. We have a Secretary of Defense \nwhom we need to hear from. We have a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff whom we need to hear from, as well as our CENTCOM commander and \nour Afghanistan commander.\n  First, we need to be clear on our strategy. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We need to be clear on our strategy first, then address \nthe question of the resources that are needed to be committed to that \nstrategy.\n  Under the amendment which I am offering, which will be voted on \nconcurrently, or at the same time as the McCain amendment, we are going \nto have, if this amendment is adopted, a hearing not just on resources \nbut on strategy and resources.\n  We are going to have that hearing, if this amendment is adopted, at \nthe appropriate time, not with an arbitrary deadline, which sets a very \nbad premise. I believe in this circumstance, similar to the Bush Iraq \nsurge circumstance, where the President of the United States, be it \nPresident Bush or President Obama, has before him and is considering, \nin a very deliberative way, this kind of a life-and-death decision.\n  Under the Levin amendment, there will be a hearing without an \narbitrary deadline, but the hearing will take place and could take \nplace long before November 15. The hearing under my amendment will take \nplace promptly after the decision is made by the President.\n  There is another difference between the two amendments. In addition \nto the Levin amendment including a hearing on strategy as well as \nresources, again, General McChrystal says the strategy is the crux of \nthe matter, not just resources. So under the Levin amendment, the \nhearing will look at both the decision on strategy as well as on \nresources.\n\n  Secondly, under the Levin amendment, the testimony will come after \nthe decision of President Obama, just the way we had hearings after the \ndecision by President Bush.\n  Third, the hearings will include testimony not only from the Central \nCommand commander and from General McChrystal, our Afghanistan \ncommander, and the Ambassador to Afghanistan, under the Levin amendment \nthe hearing will also take testimony from senior civilian officials and \nmilitary officials not included in the McCain amendment, including the \nSecretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, and the Ambassador to Pakistan. That is the third \ndifference between the two amendments which we will be voting on at 2 \no'clock.\n  Finally, in addition to outlining those three critical differences \nbetween the two amendments, I want to read from a letter received \nyesterday--or this morning from Secretary Gates by the majority leader.\n\n       I am writing in response to your request for an update on \n     the . . . strategy and resource assessments prepared by \n     General Stanley McChrystal.\n\n  He goes through a number of paragraphs describing pretty much what we \nall know, including that General McChrystal's initial assessment, which \nhas been available to us, ``will serve as the prime focus'' of the \nreview the President has undertaken, ``although other options and \nperspectives will also be included.'' So in addition to General \nMcChrystal's initial assessment, he will also be looking at other \noptions and considering other perspectives.\n  Then Secretary Gates says the following in this letter to the \nmajority leader:\n\n       The decisions that the President faces may be some of the \n     most important on Afghanistan in his presidency, so it \n     behooves us to take the necessary time to make sure we get \n     this right. That said, there are a number of internal \n     meetings scheduled over the next few weeks on this topic. I \n     do not expect decisions on the overall strategy--or the \n     resources necessary to carry it out--to take an extended \n     period of time.\n\n  He concludes as follows:\n\n       Until the President makes his decision on the way forward \n     in Afghanistan, it would be inappropriate for me--or our \n     military commanders--to openly discuss the advice being \n     provided or the nature of the discussions being carried out \n     with the President. However, once the President acts, I will \n     be happy to testify before the appropriate committees of the \n     Congress and to facilitate similar testimony by commanders \n     and other senior Department leaders.\n\n  I believe that is the right approach. It is the approach we took when \nPresident Bush was considering for 3 months whether to surge troops in \nIraq. We did not try to bring his Iraq commander before the Congress \nfor public hearings, a commander who history has indicated--at least it \nwas fairly clear at the time--had a very different perspective than his \nCommander in Chief. We did not put him in that position. We didn't do \nthat to the President of the United States, to have his commander in \nthe field come before us and say what his opinions were that he was \ngiving to the President at that time. We should not do that now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to point out what Admiral \nMullen at the Joint Chiefs of Staff said: Time is not on our side. We \ncannot afford to leisurely address this issue. I believe the Congress \nneeds to be involved. The Commander in Chief is the Commander in Chief. \nBut the Congress has a role to play because only the Congress can \nprovide needed funding and develop other policies as regards the \nresponsibility we all have when our government decides to send young \nAmericans into harm's way.\n  I have watched a lot of decisions being made in my time. I have \nagreed with some and disagreed with others. One of the earliest \ndecisions I was involved in was many years ago when Ronald Reagan \ndecided to send marines to Beirut. At the time, I thought the mission \nwas not sufficiently resourced and I thought it would unnecessarily put \nyoung marines in harm's way. I objected; I spoke against it. \nUnfortunately, I was correct.\n  History does have a tendency to repeat itself. The fact is, unless \nthis effort in Afghanistan is properly resourced, as recommended by \nGeneral McChrystal, as recommended by Admiral Mullen and supported by \nhistory, we are doomed to failure. To think that a month and a half \nwould elapse before that decision was made, because the strategy was \ndecided on last March, and then to go through a bizarre sequence of \nevents--I have never seen anything like it. First, General McChrystal \nwas told not to send his troop request to Washington while these \ndiscussions were going on. After that was revealed to be the farce it \nwas, now the Secretary of Defense is not going to forward the troop \nrequest to the White House as they make decisions on the number of \ntroops needed. How does that work?\n  Let's get this straight. The Secretary of Defense has said he is not \nsending over the number of troops requested by General McChrystal, \nwhich is known to everyone as 30,000 to 40,000 troops. Apparently, it \nwill be known to everyone except the President, who is supposed to make \nthe decision. We have legitimate questions about a process such as that \nto start with. No Commander in Chief can make a decision about how to \nconduct a conflict unless that Commander in Chief knows what resources\n\n[[Page S10013]]\n\nare required. Without having the recommendation for the number of \ntroops being transmitted to the Commander in Chief, there is no way a \nrational decision can be made.\n  What is going on here is pretty obvious. It is very obvious what is \ngoing on. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Petraeus, General \nMcChrystal--all know we need additional troops in the range of 30,000 \nto 40,000, and the administration is backing off of that or trying to \nfind the exit sign. It is well known. It had been broadcast all over \ntelevision that there are individuals--including the Vice President, \nnow, unfortunately, the National Security Adviser, the chief political \nadviser to the President, Mr. Rahm Emanuel--who don't want to alienate \nthe left base of the Democratic Party. That is what this is all about.\n  The American people need to know what our military commanders, in \ntheir best judgment, think we need to defend this Nation. They need to \nknow it within the next month and a half. Do I need to remind my \ncolleagues we have 68,000 Americans there now? Just a few days ago, \nfive brave young Americans died in 1 day. Admiral Mullen said in \nhis testimony before the Armed Services Committee that the clock is \nticking. We are running out of time. This is an urgent situation. This \nis not a decision as to whether to send troops into harm's way. Troops \nare already in harm's way. They are already there, and they are getting \nwounded and killed while, according to the President's National \nSecurity Adviser, we are considering all options. Shouldn't we consider \nseriously the option of the recommendations of military commanders? I \nam not saying they have the final say; I am saying they should be given \ngreat weight.\n\n  Here we are asking for testimony from those people who, again--the \nPresident fired the commander in the field to replace him with General \nMcChrystal, and yet we are not transmitting the fundamental and most \ndifficult aspect of General McChrystal's recommendations as to how to \nimplement a strategy that was agreed on last March.\n  I fear that domestic political considerations are impacting a \ndecision which has to do with the future security of the United States. \nJust recently, the former President of Pakistan, President Musharraf, \nsaid that American delay is being interpreted as a sign of weakness by \ncountries in the region. We left Afghanistan once. We helped the brave \nAfghans drive out the Russians who were then trying to make Afghanistan \npart of the Soviet Union. We drove them out and we left. What happened? \nThe Taliban took control. Al-Qaida cooperated with them, and the \nattacks on the United States of 9/11 took place by people who were \ntrained in Afghanistan.\n  Let's have no doubt what is at stake. The American people and their \nrepresentatives at least need to hear within the next month and a half, \n45 days, as to what the recommendations and strategy of our military \nleaders are. I emphasize, they are not the last word. The Commander in \nChief has the last word. But the Commander in Chief, whatever decision \nhe makes, also has to come to Congress for the necessary assets and \nauthorization to do whatever his strategy is. So we do play a \nsignificant role. The American people and their elected \nrepresentatives, as the chairman of the House Armed Services has said, \nas the majority leader of the House of Representatives has said, need \nto hear from these military leaders.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  It is clear that a number of things are happening. One is, there is a \ndeliberative process going on. There is not much doubt that the clock \nis ticking. That is clear. The question is--and this is what General \nMcChrystal says--get your strategy straight. Take the time to get your \nstrategy straight. He also recommends that there will be new resources, \nwhatever the strategy. But he says the key here--these are his words--\ntake the time to get your strategy right. We can either spend the time \nthat the President deserves and President Bush took to get the strategy \nright or we will be jeopardizing the lives of the men and women who put \non the uniform of the United States, if there is a wrong strategy in \nplace.\n  The clock was ticking in Iraq. Back in September 2006, there was a \nrecommendation that there be a change in strategy in Iraq, that there \nbe a surge of troops. The recommendation was made by General Keane in \nSeptember 2006, start a surge. For over 3 months, while the clock was \nticking, President Bush considered whether to change the strategy in \nIraq. He finally changed it in January of 2007, taking 3 or 4 months to \nmake that decision.\n\n  Do you know what. He got the strategy right, finally, in January of \n2007, because the surge had a positive effect. But he took the time to \nmake a decision. We did not put pressure on him by calling a commander \nfrom the field, who apparently had a very different perspective, for \nhearings during that process. We respected that process. We did not try \nto put pressure on a President of the United States by calling the \ncommander, General Casey, in to tell us: No, we do not need more \ntroops, which is apparently what he would have told us, while the \nPresident of the United States was considering whether to send \nadditional troops.\n  The analogy is incredibly close to what is going on now. We should be \ntreating the President of the United States, President Obama, with the \nsame respect for the deliberative process that we provided to President \nBush.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter which was sent \nby Secretary Gates to the majority leader, Senator Reid, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: I am writing in response to your \n     request for an update on the ongoing evaluation of the \n     strategy and resource assessments prepared by General Stanley \n     McChrystal, Commander, International Security Assistance \n     Force (ISAF).\n       As we stay on the offense against Al-Qaeda, from here at \n     home to around the world, the President and his national-\n     security team are in the midst of an ongoing evaluation of \n     the mission in Afghanistan in order to assess the overall \n     situation and our strategy following the Afghan elections. \n     Those elections, as well as the evolving situation in \n     Pakistan over the last number of months, require us to review \n     the U.S. approach in the region to ensure that, first, we \n     have the right strategy and, second, we have the necessary \n     resources in place to carry it out.\n       You will recall that when the Administration announced the \n     results of the initial review of Afghanistan strategy in \n     March 2009, we also acknowledged the need to reassess our \n     approach following the national elections this fall. \n     Accordingly, the President has asked that we conduct a \n     careful and thorough assessment of these questions in order \n     to provide him with the considered best judgment of his \n     national security team and military leadership. General \n     McChrystal's initial assessment will serve as the prime focus \n     of this review, although other options and perspectives will \n     also be included.\n       The decisions that the President faces may be some of the \n     most important on Afghanistan in his presidency, so it \n     behooves us to take the necessary time to make sure we get \n     this right. That said, there are a number of internal \n     meetings scheduled over the next few weeks on this topic. I \n     do not expect decisions on the overall strategy--or the \n     resources necessary to carry it out--to take an extended \n     period of time.\n       Until the President makes his decision on the way forward \n     in Afghanistan, it would be inappropriate for me--or our \n     military commanders--to openly discuss the advice being \n     provided or the nature of the discussions being carried out \n     with the President. However, once the President acts, I will \n     be happy to testify before the appropriate committees of the \n     Congress and to facilitate similar testimony by commanders \n     and other senior Department leaders.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert M. Gates.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, unfortunately, a lot of the \ninformation we have to get is through the media rather than testimony \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee. I do think it is worthy of \nnote that there is a story dated October 1, 2009, which says:\n\n       The top military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. \n     McChrystal, rejected calls for scaling down military \n     objectives\n\n[[Page S10014]]\n\n     there on Thursday and said Washington did not have unlimited \n     time to settle on a new strategy to pursue the eight-year-old \n     war.\n       . . . General McChrystal said that the situation in \n     Afghanistan was serious and that ``neither success nor \n     failure can be taken for granted.'' . . .\n       General McChrystal was asked by a member of an audience \n     that included retired military commanders and security \n     specialists whether he would support an idea put forward by \n     Mr. Biden to scale back the American military presence in \n     Afghanistan to focus on tracking down the leaders of Al \n     Qaeda, in place of the current broader effort now under way \n     to defeat the Taliban.\n       ``The short answer is: no,'' he said. ``You have to \n     navigate from where you are, not where you wish to be. A \n     strategy that does not leave Afghanistan in a stable position \n     is probably a short-sighted strategy.''\n       He did not mention Mr. Biden by name.\n\n  All of us here have great affection and appreciation for the Vice \nPresident. We have all gotten to know him and like him over the years. \nBut the fact is, the Vice President of the United States, in the first \ngulf war, after Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait, voted against the \nresolution, saying it would be another Vietnam war. He has voted \nconsistently against U.S. involvement. And the latest, of course, was \nwhen his idea was to divide Iraq into three different countries. So the \nVice President does have a clear record of being consistently wrong. I \nhope that is taken into consideration when he comes up with his ideas \nabout Afghanistan.\n\n       General McChrystal has been reported to be seeking as many \n     as 40,000 additional American troops for the war, a number \n     that has generated concern among other top American \n     commanders.\n\n  But that number--which is known to everyone, and keeps being \nreported--that number is not going to be transmitted to the President \nby the Secretary of Defense. You can't make that up. Everybody knows \nit, but it is not going to be sent to the President by the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Anyway:\n\n       In a confidential assessment of the war last month now \n     under consideration by the Obama administration, General \n     McChrystal said that he needs additional troops within the \n     next year or else the conflict ``will likely result in \n     failure.''\n\n  Mr. President, we have a limited amount of time, but I do not have to \ntell most people and colleagues here what the consequences of failure \nin Afghanistan might be. So what we are asking is, sometime within the \nnext month and a half--the next month and a half--that we get General \nMcChrystal in particular but also the most brilliant general I have \never encountered in my life, General Petraeus, and others, to testify \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee. Maybe the House Armed \nServices Committee, whose chairman said they needed that testimony, \nwill proceed without us. I would feel very badly if the U.S. Senate \nwere not given the same opportunity to have General McChrystal and \nGeneral Petraeus appear before them, as the House Armed Services \nCommittee chairman has said they want.\n  I want to emphasize to my colleagues, we are asking, sometime within \nthe next 45 days, an appearance by the leaders we have put in charge of \nthe lives of our young American men and women. We are just asking for \nthem to come and testify before our committees of jurisdiction, to \nexercise our responsibilities as representatives of our States. That is \nall we are asking. That is all we are asking.\n  There are already 68,000 there. They are being wounded and killed as \nwe speak. And as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has said: \nTime is not on our side. The situation is deteriorating.\n  Shouldn't the Senate Armed Services Committee and, through us, the \nAmerican people and the Senate Appropriations Committee, which has its \nresponsibilities, also hear from these great leaders who are in charge \nof the lives and safety and well-being of our men and women in uniform \nand are charged with achieving victory and not defeat, achieving \nsuccess and not failure in Afghanistan?\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the stakes here are truly huge. We \nobviously share one goal; that is, to succeed in Afghanistan. What \nGeneral McChrystal has pointed out repeatedly in his assessment is that \nthe way to succeed is not just with resources. He says the crux of the \nmatter is to get a new strategy. His words: get a new strategy.\n  The question is, are we going to allow this President the same \nopportunity to put a strategy in place or to change it, as President \nBush did in Iraq, as we have afforded to other Presidents, including \nPresident Bush?\n  The right strategy here is key, as well as the resources. And to set \nan artificial date is a terrible precedent. To put a commander in the \nfield at a public hearing to try to pressure a Commander in Chief to \nreach a certain result is unacceptable, inappropriate. The Secretary of \nDefense is not going to allow it, nor should he, and we are not going \nto ask it, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I hope the \nSenate does not ask for that to happen either. We did not do that to \nPresident Bush. We should not do that to President Obama.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, Mr. President, let me say, if I could--I will use \nmy remaining 2 minutes--I appreciate very much the relationship I have \ndeveloped over more than 20 years with the chairman of the committee. \nFrom time to time, we have had differences and vigorous debate. I want \nto emphasis, I respect the opinions and views and authority of the \nchairman of the committee. We just simply have an open and honest \ndisagreement.\n  I hope my colleagues will understand the urgency of this situation \nand agree to my amendment that does not in any way diminish my respect \nand appreciation of the way the Senator from Michigan chairs the \ncommittee and acts on a bipartisan basis, which is a long tradition of \nthe Armed Services Committee. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield my remaining 2 minutes to Senator \nKaufman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I cannot think of two better people to be \ninvolved in a discussion about what we should be doing in Afghanistan \nthan Senator McCain and Senator Levin.\n  Where I come down on this issue is with Senator Levin because I \nbelieve it is very important we give the President time to discuss this \nissue in detail. There are a lot of different pieces to this puzzle. It \nis not just General McChrystal's report. It is a report by Ambassador \nEikenberry. It is a report by Ambassador Holbrooke. I think he would \nhave a report from Ambassador Patterson from Pakistan. I think we need \na report from the DOD in terms of force structure and what additional \ntroops we would have beyond that.\n  There are a number of issues that have to be dealt with here. I think \nas in the past with President Bush, where there was a 3-month process \nbefore the surge--during that time, people were able to talk to the \nPresident, and to work their way up the chain of command in the \nmilitary, and the civilians to work their way up in the Department of \nDefense, to talk to the President so the President could have their \ncounsel before the President made his decision.\n  I think that is what we need here. I think one of the most important \nthings President Obama said in his speech the other night to the joint \nsession was: I am going to be here for a long time, so I want to get it \nright.\n  We have to get it right in Afghanistan. I think this is the obvious \ntime to proceed. Clearly, the present election and the flaws in the \nelection, in addition to General McChrystal's report which points out \nthe rise of the Taliban, demonstrates it is time for us to sit down and \ntake a hard look at what our strategy in Afghanistan is. I think the \nPresident is going to do that. He is going to go through a process. \nMany people have to be involved. Many\n\n[[Page S10015]]\n\ndifferent issues have to be done. And then the President will come with \nhis plan for Afghanistan.\n  At that time, after that happens, I think then--Chairman Levin is \ncorrect--we should have hearings, we should have people come and \ntestify, and that will be the time to do it. In the meantime, I think \nwe owe it to the military chain of command that everyone involved in \nthat chain of command be allowed to come and talk to the President so \nhe can make the best decision he can possibly make before the Senate \ngets an opportunity to deal with everyone who is going to be involved \nwith the President.\n  So, again, I support Senator Levin's amendment. I think it is \nessential we have a process that allows it to go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 10 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator McCain for his warm \ncomments. I feel very strongly about our relationship. It is a great \nrelationship. It could not be possibly affected by differences over \npolicies. I have great respect for the Senator and the huge \ncontributions he makes to this body and to the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what is the order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Levin amendment is the pending amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2569\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and amendment No. 2569 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2569.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To restore $294,000,000 for the Armed Forces to prepare for \n    and conduct combat operations by accounting for the August 2009 \n   Congressional Budget Office economic assumptions and by reducing \n funding for congressionally directed spending items for low-priority \n                   research and development projects)\n\n       On page 239, beginning on line 21, strike ``the total \n     amount'' and all that follows through ``$236,000,000'' and \n     insert ``the total amount appropriated in title III of this \n     Act is hereby reduced by $322,000,000, the total amount \n     appropriated in title IV of this Act is hereby reduced by \n     $530,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have several amendments that go along \nthis line, but my question to the Appropriations Committee is one of \ntrying to clarify for the American people the numbers that were used to \ndownsize the operation and maintenance account based on what the \nexpected inflation rate was.\n  It is important to know. The O account is what runs everything. \nWhat came out of the bill was $294 million because you chose to use an \ninflation rate that was less than what CBO and OMB had stated it would \nbe. You did use the one that was the one prior. But the one presently \nwould, in fact, add another $294 million to the operation and \nmaintenance account. I would be glad to hear the reasoning why we chose \nto use it. I think I know why the reasoning--because it allows more \nability to do other things Members would like to do.\n\n  What this amendment is trying to do is to restore that money to truly \nreflect the inflation rate that OMB and CBO have said it would be. \nThree-tenths of 1 percent makes a big difference when you are talking \nabout taking something from our military. I would remind my colleagues \nthat last year the Navy ran out of O money and we needed an emergency \nsupplemental to supply it. So by undershooting what the real inflation \nfactor is for their costs, both in fuel and maintenance and operations, \nif we undervalue that account, what it means is we are going to take \naway from readiness. I know that is not the intent of this committee. \nThe intent of this committee is to make sure our military has the needs \nand the means with which to carry out their requirements.\n  Let me get a little more detailed on it. When the committee set the \nO number, they used a GDP index inflation rate from the Congressional \nBudget Office that was 3 months old, and they ignored the updated one \nfor August, which was three-tenths of a percent higher. That means that \nif--and I agree, they are estimates; they may not be correct. What I \nwould like to know is, what if you are wrong with the lower number you \nput in? Are we going to be coming back with a supplemental to be able \nto drive the O? For the American people what that means is, when we \ndo a supplemental, it is outside the budget rules, which means we \nborrow it. We borrow the money.\n  This amendment says let's realistically predict what the inflation \nrate is going to be in the operation and maintenance account. Let's \ntruly put the money there that should be there. What this amendment \ndoes is simply restore it.\n  We know, by history, that O has been rising faster than inflation \nfor the past 9 years. We have not gotten it right once, in terms of the \nactual amounts. How this amendment technically works is it restores \n$294 million by striking part of section 8091 of the bill that reduces \nthat funding.\n  I will not spend any more time on it. I will discuss it again later.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2563\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this pending amendment be \nset aside and amendment No. 2563 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2563.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To require public disclosure of certain reports)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act and except as provided in subsection (b), any report \n     required to be submitted by a Federal agency or department to \n     the Committee on Appropriations of either the Senate or the \n     House of Representatives in this Act shall be posted on the \n     public website of that agency upon receipt by the committee.\n       (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply to a report if--\n       (1) the public posting of the report compromises national \n     security; or\n       (2) the report contains proprietary information.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a straightforward amendment, and \nthe Appropriations Committees heretofore have agreed with it. This \nsays, other than in terms of national security or something that should \nnot be released for general circulation, the reports that are \nauthorized and paid for in this bill, which are going directly only to \nthe Senators on the Appropriations Committee, be made available to the \nrest of the Senators in the body as well as the rest of the American \npublic. If there is a good national security reason not to do so, fine, \nthere is no problem with that, but all the rest of the American people \nought to see it. It is called transparency. The American people are \npaying for them. The American people have a right and an obligation to \nsee them if they are going to be involved in the governance of our \ncountry. In fact, they are supposed to be in charge of the governance \nof our country.\n  So what it will do is allow the American citizens to see how their \nmoney is actually being spent and allow them to get to see the results \nof those reports. It is very simple.\n  My hope is the chairman and ranking member would be inclined to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside.\n\n[[Page S10016]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2565\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2565 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2565.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure transparency and accountability by providing that \neach member of Congress and the Secretary of Defense has the ability to \nreview $1,500,000,000 in taxpayer funds allocated to the National Guard \n              and Reserve components of the Armed Forces)\n\n       On page 177, line 23, strike ``the modernization'' and all \n     that follows through line 25 and insert the following: ``and \n     the Secretary of Defense, who upon completion of a thorough \n     review, shall provide to each standing committee of Congress \n     a modernization priority assessment for their respective \n     Reserve or National Guard component.''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, in this bill we are attempting to address \nwhat I agree is a very serious problem, the funding of our National \nGuard and Reserve. I do have some concerns, though, about how we are \ngoing about doing that.\n  I would love to be corrected by either the chairman or the ranking \nmember. As I understand the bill, the $1.5 billion in upgrades for the \nNational Guard and Reserve actually bypasses the Department of Defense, \nbypasses the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and goes directly to the committee \nin terms of the approval of how they do that. I would inquire of the \nchairman if that is accurate.\n  Mr. INOUYE. If I may, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. This matter has been requested by two Members of the \ncaucus, the National Guard caucus. They would like to say a few words \nabout it. If I may, can we set this aside?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely. I am happy to do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set this amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to the \nconversation coming from the other side of the aisle this morning. A \ncouple of things I have been watching make it very clear to me, and it \nis probably very clear to the American people: One side stands for \nchanging the health care delivery system and the other side stands for \nkeeping things the way they are.\n  We need to do something to keep our broken health care system from \nrunning off the tracks completely. It is already headed off the tracks. \nThere is a wide range of ideas out there--a range as diverse as the \npeople of this Nation--and that is the way it should be. I am confident \nthose details will be worked out in the legislative process, and we are \nin the midst of that.\n  We Democrats fundamentally agree on one bottom line: We must act and \nwe must act now to make it easier for people in America to live a \nhealthy life.\n  I can't blame the American people for feeling somewhat frustrated \nbecause we have all these fake controversies, such as death panels--a \nway to divert attention from what we are trying to do. There are no \ndeath panels. The only thing that has been suggested is that people \nhave an examination every year and sit down with their physician and \nfind out what the future holds in the way of treatment. Death panels is \na diversion.\n  The abortion issue is a diversion. We want to keep things the same \nway they have been in this country for a long time: Use the so-called \nHyde amendment, which is now the so-called Capps amendment, which, in \neffect, just carries that over.\n  One of their real diversions in this is a bill to help undocumented, \nillegal aliens. All these are diversions. They have nothing to do with \nwhat we are trying to do: to improve the health care delivery system.\n  There are so many examples. A woman from Las Vegas came to see me \nyesterday. She was raised in Reno, now from Las Vegas, living a \nwonderful life. She gets sick. She has breast cancer at age 29. It \nchanged her life dramatically. Because why? Her health insurance was so \nterribly inadequate. I am from Searchlight, NV. A woman whom I have \nknown for many years, she is the assistant postmistress. She helps me \nat my home. I give her a few dollars every month. Her husband is \nretired. They have a 23-year-old son. Of course, he goes off their \ninsurance when he is 23. He is young. He is healthy. Within 6 weeks of \nturning 23, he no longer has health insurance, he is diagnosed as \nhaving testicular cancer. He has no insurance. What does that do to \nthat family?\n  What we are doing is we are trying to change that so that 29-year-old \nwoman with breast cancer, the 23-year-old with testicular cancer has \nsome coverage, insurance coverage. That is what we are trying to do.\n  We were here yesterday talking about four States: Oregon, Rhode \nIsland, Michigan, and Nevada, four States that have been hit so hard by \nthis recession--I mean, so hard. Nevada has led the Nation in \nforeclosures for 31 months in a row. People on the other side of the \naisle are complaining because, in the Finance Committee, they are \ntrying to help Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Michigan. Does that \nmean those are the only States they are going to try to help? Of course \nnot.\n  Every day in Nevada, 220 people lose their health insurance. People \nwoke up this morning with insurance and they will go to bed tonight \nwithout it. That is 7 days a week they are losing their insurance in \nNevada. Do we want to change that? Of course, we want to change that.\n  Thirteen percent of Nevadans are employed. More than 18 percent are \nuninsured. A lot of people have insurance that is inadequate. They are \nunderinsured. It is not good insurance. We have had some come from the \nother side of the aisle over the last few days saying they don't care \nabout Nevadans hurting. They think the status quo is just fine, and \nthey refuse to help their fellow citizens who are suffering. They seem \nto want me to apologize for helping my constituents who are struggling. \nI am never going to apologize for trying to help the people of Nevada. \nI was born there. I am going to do everything I can to help the people \nin the State of Nevada.\n  Let me tell everyone within the sound of my voice something else. I \nwas talking to one of my Republican colleagues recently. He is from the \nState of Georgia, a wonderful man, Johnny Isakson. I said: How about \nthose rains? He said: Well, I have a rain gauge in my home. In 24 \nhours, it rained 18 inches. I can't comprehend that. In Las Vegas, the \naverage rain fall per year is 4 inches, but he got 18 inches in 24 \nhours, and the next day I think he told me they got 8 inches. That \ntorrential rain they had in Georgia has created problems the State \ncan't handle, and they are asking for Federal emergency help. I want to \nhelp them. I am a Senator of the United States. I am not a Nevada \nSenator; I am a Senator of the United States. My first obligation is to \nhelp my people in Nevada, but if there is a problem in Georgia because \nof the rains or the fires in California, I am going to do everything I \ncan to help them, just as I am going to do everything I can to help the \npeople of Michigan, Oregon, and Rhode Island, as I spoke yesterday.\n  So we have to look out for each other. We have mutual \nresponsibilities. I am disappointed that people would complain about \nthe fact that we have situations in our States that we need help for. \nWe have a lot of poor people and a lot of people getting poorer real \nquick.\n  It is becoming increasingly clear that Republicans simply don't have \nany ideas for helping the American people as it relates to health care, \neven people in their own States who are suffering\n\n[[Page S10017]]\n\nso desperately. It is another excuse. It is more of the same. It is \nmore evidence that some on the other side think it will never be a good \ntime--never be a good time--to reform the health care system.\n  For the latest episode on that, look what is going on in the Finance \nCommittee. Are there constructive amendments offered? No. Just \nnitpicking, just a way to slow things down. It is more proof they want \nto defend the status quo, refuse to take care of their suffering and \nstruggling constituents, and ignore the will of the American people--at \nany cost. We know that cost is great.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while the majority leader is on the Senate \nfloor and talking so eloquently about the inadequacy of health \ninsurance and specific examples, one of the statistics--and I know it \nis just a statistic, not a specific example--which has moved me so \ndramatically in the direction the majority leader described is, if I \nunderstand this correctly, the majority of people in this country go \ninto personal bankruptcy because they cannot pay their health care \ncosts. That is bad enough; nobody should go bankrupt because they \ncannot pay for health care. That is unacceptable in this country.\n  But what compounds that is that a majority of them do have health \ninsurance. The American people focus on that statistic, and I know \nstatistics are difficult to put our arms around. But the majority of \npeople who go bankrupt because of not being able to pay health care \nbills have health insurance. This isn't just a matter of trying to get \npeople covered who are not covered; it is a matter of also trying to \nfill in for the inadequacy of the uncertainty that exists, the \ninstability that exists for people to have health insurance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend, President \nObama told me on a telephone call 6 weeks ago to make sure when we \nfinish this health care legislation it is not a program for only the \npoor but that it is a program for the American people; that in the \nprocess the poor and middle class will be taken care of. I agree with \nthe President.\n  What the Senator has said is true. The majority of the people who \nfile bankruptcy do so because of health care costs. That says it all.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the leader. We are not going to be able to get to \nthe needed health care reform without his leadership. He also pointed \nout a particular circumstance that a number of our States are in. I am \ngrateful for this situation.\n  In Michigan, we are losing 27,000 jobs a month. I believe we have the \nhighest unemployment rate in the country, which is 15.2 percent. It is \ngrowing, and it will continue to grow, apparently. People are losing \ntheir health care. The number of people eligible for Medicaid is \nincreasing.\n  The bill before the Finance Committee has a provision in it that we \nwill have more people eligible for Medicaid. That is critically \nimportant. That is one way to get more people eligible for health care. \nBut what the Finance Committee does in its current mark is also say \nthat certain States--including Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, and \nMichigan--are suffering particularly, and in particular ways, and we \nare a long way from economic recovery. So the additional Medicaid \nsupport for those States is highly appropriate. There are reasons for \nthat.\n  The majority leader talks about the flooding in Georgia or the \ndisaster we had in Louisiana a few years ago or the fires in \nCalifornia. We have an economic fire taking place in my home State of \nMichigan. I thank the majority leader for his willingness not just to \ngrapple with the entire issue of health care reform but to also \nrecognize not just the situation in his own State, with all the \nforeclosures they have been facing, but the situation we face in a \nnumber of other States economically. We are very grateful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I join the majority leader and the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee to express my appreciation to \ncolleagues who will support the provisions for Federal assistance for \nhigh-need States. Rhode Island is one of those high-need States.\n  One of the key targets to being a high-need State is a high \nunemployment rate. Right now, ours in Rhode Island is about 12.8 \npercent--nearly 13 percent. Since the beginning of this crisis, we have \neither been the second or third highest unemployment State in the \nNation, only behind Senator Levin's State of Michigan. It is the \nhighest level of unemployment Rhode Island has seen since World War II, \nin a generation. It amounts to, in our very small State with a \npopulation of fewer than 1 million people, 73,000 people who are \nunemployed. That is only counting the ones who qualify as unemployed \nunder the labor standards; for people out too long, they are even more. \nAfter a while, they don't count them any longer in the statistics. It \nis actually more than 73,000 people unemployed in a State of less than \n1 million; 73,000 families are facing unemployment and are worrying \nabout how to care for their loved ones.\n  We know this is a national problem, and we know many States are \nsuffering. To be in this category of these four States that are high-\nneed States and that are getting a little extra attention in the \nFinance bill is not something we want. I would love for Rhode Island to \nhave a 7- or 8-percent unemployment rate. I would be delighted. This is \na real trial for the people of Rhode Island, and I appreciate that \nthere are people, including our distinguished majority leader, who are \nreaching out to try to help Rhode Island while we are in this period of \nintense economic suffering.\n  From my perspective, I have supported others when we went to help the \nStates that depended on the auto industry. I have watched billions of \ndollars flow across this floor to support those big auto States. I have \nwatched and supported billions of dollars flowing across this floor to \nsupport the big finance industry States--Wall Street--and to protect \nour banking industry. I have supported it when billions of dollars \nflowed across this floor to support coastal States that were hit hard \nby storms and hurricanes. I watched billions of dollars flow through \nhere for the States hit by flooding recently with the terrible floods \nin the South and a little while ago when the terrible floods hit the \nupper Northwest. I have watched enormous support go to States when they \nexperienced wildfires, and when our distinguished leader on the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Conrad, argued so effectively for the States \naffected by drought.\n  I am on the Environment and Public Works Committee. The coal States \nare getting taken care of in amazing ways. Over and over again, when we \nhave seen our fellow States in trouble, we have been willing to help \nthem out. All I am asking is, from Rhode Island's perspective, we have \nwatched all of these things go by, and there is yet to be anything for \nRhode Island.\n  I hope very much that my colleagues will not take this opportunity to \nturn what has been a very collegial atmosphere about helping each \nother's States when they are in trouble and, for purposes of politics, \npile onto little Rhode Island. This is something that we need. This is \nsomething that is important to us.\n  Do we depend on coal? No. Do we depend on the auto insurance \nindustry? No. Do we depend on Wall Street? No. Have we had a big \nhurricane? No. Nor have we had flooding, wildfires, or drought. But the \ncondition of our people, economically, is just as bad as if those \nthings had occurred.\n  Rhode Island is at nearly 13 percent unemployment. I urge my \ncolleagues to stand with the leader and with the tradition of kindness \nand collegiality that has always characterized this body when a State \nis experiencing particular distress and difficulty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I listened to my leader with great \nadmiration. I wish him to know that I support his action in support of \nthe health reform measures before us.\n  The leader touched upon two problems. One was that each day in the \nState of Nevada, 221 men, women, and children will go to bed and the \nnext morning find themselves without health insurance coverage. I \nbelieve it should be noted that, as we speak, over 15,000 men, women, \nand children of the United States will wake up in the morning finding \nthat they have no insurance coverage--15,000 a day. That\n\n[[Page S10018]]\n\nmeans close to half a million every month. This is not acceptable. I \ndon't think we should tolerate this and set it aside.\n  Mr. President, my leader, the very distinguished Senator from Nevada, \nbrought up the matter of the death panel. It is the responsibility of \nphysicians throughout this land, when confronted with terminal cases, \nto tell their patients of the condition. They should also notify the \npatients that as long as they want care and life-sustaining medicine, \nit will be done. But I believe it is the right of the patients to \nsuggest that they would like to rest.\n  Three years ago, I lost a wife. We were married for 57 years. It \nwasn't an easy moment, believe me. One evening--and I have never \ndiscussed this publicly before--as I sat near her, she said, ``I have \nsomething I would like to discuss with you that is very important.'' \nShe looked at me and said, ``I will be dead in 10 days.'' I said, \n``Now, you must be kidding.'' She said, ``No, I have discussed this \nmatter with the doctor. We all know it is terminal. This cancer is \nbeyond control, and I don't wish to continue this agony. I hope you \nwill support me.'' She said, ``I will be OK for a week, but on the \nseventh day I will go into a coma. During those 7 days, I would like to \ndiscuss with you certain things, such as where my funeral services \nshould be held.''\n  She kept all these details. There was no death panel. What the doctor \ndid was to provide her with comfort--comfort of her emotions, her \nsenses. She passed away happy. She knew that things were going to be \ndone.\n  I am sorry to see--and it hurts me to see--fellow Americans distort a \ngood aspect of health care and turn it into something murderous. They \nshould be ashamed of themselves.\n  Mr. President, our leader is a good man.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, it has become clear that our health care \ndebate is entering the twilight zone. We have such a challenge in this \nNation of individuals who have no health care, small businesses \nstruggling to provide health care, and large businesses that are having \na difficult time competing and producing products in America for the \nworld because of the accelerating price of health care.\n  So often, over the last couple of months, I have heard colleagues \ncome and attack this effort to repair our broken system. Those repairs \nare essential to our family members. They are essential to our workers, \nto our small businesses, and to our big businesses. We have had very \nstrange stories shared in this Chamber--stories, as my colleague from \nHawaii mentioned, about death panels, a creation in the mind of the \nformer Governor from Alaska, having nothing to do with anything that \nhappens to be in any bill before this body. We have had strange stories \nabout benefits provided to individuals who are here undocumented, in \ndirect opposition to the straightforward language that is in the House \nbills and the Senate bills.\n  We have had strange stories about a murky government takeover, when \nthe heart of this plan is to create the same sort of marketplace that \ngives 8 million Federal workers access to multiple private plans, to \ncreate that same marketplace and access for every single American. Now, \nin the last day, there is something even more strange: an attack on \nStates that are having the most difficult time in this recession.\n  We are deep in the twilight zone when Members come to this body to \nattack efforts to assist the States most severely damaged by this \nrecession--the States of Michigan, Rhode Island, Nevada, and my home \nState of Oregon.\n  Oregon is having a difficult time for a host of reasons. We are a \nState that does a lot of trading, and a lot of the countries we trade \nwith have had year-over-year recessions even worse than our own. For \nexample, South Korea, 20-percent year-over-year drop in gross domestic \nproduct.\n  We have a timber industry that provides a lot of dimensional lumber \nto build houses and build commercial buildings around this Nation. The \ncollapse of building has damaged it severely.\n  We have a wonderful section of our economy involving growing fruits \nand growing Christmas trees, and the Mexican tariffs have hit that very \nhard. Add it all up and Oregon is one of the four States worst hit.\n  I read a few weeks ago that if we include the underemployed as well \nas the unemployed, Oregon is the single worst hit State in our Nation.\n  I applaud the efforts of Members of this Chamber to say we have a \nbroken health care system and we are going to repair it. They are \nabsolutely right. I am pleased to be a member of that team working to \nmake those repairs.\n  I applaud the Members of this Chamber who said we must help those \nStates worst hit by this recession, continuing a great American \ntradition. When a State is hard hit by drought, we reach out and \nassist. When a State is hard hit by a hurricane, we reach out as a \nnation to gather and assist. When a State is hard hit by a flood, there \nis a natural disaster called, and we as a nation respond. When an \nearthquake strikes, as a nation we are there.\n  Now we have another disaster, an economic disaster, that is hitting \nparticularly hard in four States. I applaud the efforts to reach out \nand assist those States together as a nation, as we have so many other \nStates in so many other circumstances.\n  Let's pull this conversation out of the ``Twilight Zone.'' Let's come \ntogether, as we have so many times before, to take on the challenge of \na broken health care system, to take on assistance to the worst hit \nStates and help them adjust to providing Medicaid that is so urgently \nneeded by their populations.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend Senator Merkley, Senator \nWhitehouse, and Senator Reid of Nevada for their eloquent and accurate \ndescription of the situation that faces several States.\n  Throughout this country, there is a crisis in unemployment. But in \nStates such as Michigan, Oregon, Nevada, and Rhode Island, it is a \ncatastrophe--over 12 percent unemployment.\n  As my colleague pointed out, that is just the official number. That \nnumber does not include those who have lost their job, but not filed \ntheir official employment status. That number does not include those \npeople who are looking for work and not finding employment. It is a \nsituation that is extremely difficult on the individuals and families \nof Rhode Island.\n  We are engaged in a very serious debate about health care reform. \nThere seems to be a consensus that the status quo will not work. Yet \nour proposals to change it are dismissed without appropriate response \nin terms of alternatives. Our colleagues in the minority are simply \nsaying the status quo is bad, but it is good for us.\n  We have to make changes, and we have to make those changes that \nrecognize not only the inefficiencies in our medical care system but \nalso the overall economic system.\n  One of the impetuses for this reform is not just access and \naffordability of health care, it is the economic future of the country. \nAgain, in States such as Rhode Island, Michigan, Oregon, and Nevada, \nthis is an issue that is incredibly important.\n  We understand that some States have taken a much more aggressive \napproach to their Medicaid populations. In recognition of our costly \nhealth care system, they have tried to enroll as many people as they \ncould. They recognize a higher level of poverty, one that I think is \ngoing to be recognized in federal reform initiatives. But effectively, \nthese States, unless they are given some help, will be punished for \nbeing ahead of their colleagues, for trying to extend health care \ncoverage before the Nation was ready to do that. In that sense, we have \nto also recognize the need to support the Medicaid Program and also \nsupport particularly those States that are in this economic \ncatastrophe.\n  As Senator Whitehouse pointed out, we routinely come together and \nrecognize the special needs of regions and States--wildfires in \nCalifornia, agricultural disasters throughout the middle\n\n[[Page S10019]]\n\nof the country and elsewhere, the great crisis of Katrina. To say now \nthat we cannot recognize something as extraordinarily important, such \nas health care, to several States, including my own of Rhode Island, \nis, I think, neglecting what we do here on a relative routine basis.\n  The other fact is that some of the criticism directed at proposals \nthat have been made in the Finance Committee have been made by \nGovernors who simply say you cannot shift the burden to us, and that is \nparticularly the case in Rhode Island. We are facing a significant \ncrisis in State funding. If we give them a responsibility without \nresources at a time of this great unemployment crisis, it would add a \nfurther burden. We would be, I think, not only disadvantaged by the \neconomic situation but, as I suggested before, punished for a good \ndeed, which is to try and incorporate more people into our Medicaid \nsystem.\n  We have to support the Finance Committee's approach. In fact, I thank \nthe Finance Committee and Senator Baucus for considering this issue. \nThis is critical. Again, we all wish we would be in a situation where \nunemployment could confidently be seen in the future as not a factor to \nsupport the States, but we know it is going to be.\n  The support the chairman and the members of the Finance Committee \nhave given is appropriate. I strongly support it and urge my colleagues \nto do so, as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2578\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 2578.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Kaufman], for himself, Mr. \n     Lugar, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2578.\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for continuing support of certain civilian-\n       military training for civilians deploying to Afghanistan)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  The Secretary of Defense shall, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the \n     United States Agency for International Development, continue \n     to support requirements for monthly integrated civilian-\n     military training for civilians deploying to Afghanistan at \n     Camp Atterbury, Indiana, including through the allocation of \n     military and civilian personnel, trainers, and other \n     resources for that purpose.\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from the \nState of Hawaii and the Senator from the State of Mississippi for their \nwork on this very important bill. I also thank Senator Jack Reed from \nRhode Island, Senator Lugar, and Senator Bayh for their support of this \namendment, which instructs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation \nwith the Department of State and USAID, to continue to support the \nintegrated civilian-military training for all civilians deploying to \nAfghanistan, occurring once a month in Indiana at Camp Atterbury.\n  The civilian role in Afghanistan is absolutely critical to achieving \nthe broader goals of counterinsurgency. As we discuss the way forward \nin Afghanistan, it is essential to remember that troop levels are only \none part of that strategy.\n  In order to cultivate support among the population and implement an \neffective counterinsurgency, civilians from across government agencies \nmust continue to partner and work in tandem with the military.\n  In May, I offered an amendment to the supplemental which aimed to \nensure that civilians deploying to Afghanistan receive training that \ncultivates greater civilian-military unity of mission and which \nemphasized the importance of counterinsurgency and stability \noperations.\n  Prior to passage of this amendment, joint civil-military training was \nonly occurring once every 9 months to coincide with scheduled military \ndeployments. Since then, officials throughout the government--and \nespecially the State Department--realized this was insufficient to meet \nthe increased needs presented by the civilian surge in Afghanistan.\n  As such, the joint training schedule was increased to once a month, \nand Ambassadors Eikenberry and Holbrooke recently mandated that all \ncivilians working in the field in Afghanistan must receive this \ntraining prior to deployment.\n  On Monday, I visited Camp Atterbury to observe and express my support \nfor the training, to thank these brave men and women for their service, \nand to emphasize the key role of our civilians in Afghanistan.\n  Civilians from across the interagency process--including the \nDepartment of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, and the \nDepartment of Agriculture--have come together in Camp Atterbury for a \n1-week intensive course with the military, where they simulate real \nlife experiences in Afghanistan.\n  This includes participating in vignettes with role players and the \nmilitary to brainstorm ways to help their Afghan partners deliver \nessential services, security, and economic opportunity.\n  This essential skill set and level of familiarity with the military \nwould take weeks to achieve once in theater. But the integrated \ntraining at Camp Atterbury allows our civilians heading to Afghanistan \nto hit the ground running.\n  Given the increased demand for this training, I am offering an \namendment to ensure that training at Camp Atterbury continues to \nreceive the support it needs in terms of military and civilian \npersonnel, trainers, and other resources.\n  With a new mandate from Ambassadors Holbrooke and Eikenberry, the \nclass size for this training has obviously increased. As we continue \nwith the civilian surge, I hope the training at Camp Atterbury will \nreceive a commensurate level of increased funding and support which it \nneeds.\n  We owe it to our brave men and women in Afghanistan to get this \nright. It is critical to remember that our strategy in Afghanistan is \nnot just about the troops; it is also about the civilians.\n  Just as we seek to ensure our troops headed to the field have the \nproper preparation and equipment, it is critical our civilians have the \nsame level of training to ensure their effectiveness and security.\n  As the number of civilians in Afghanistan continues to grow--up to \nnearly 1,000 by the end of the year--our support for this mandatory \ntraining must also increase.\n  Integrated civilian-military training is a great example of steps \nbeing taken to improve our counterinsurgency strategy. In order to \nsucceed in Afghanistan, civilians must successfully partner with the \nAfghans to help provide essential services, to promote economic \ndevelopment, and to improve systems of governance.\n  I am especially grateful to the Indiana National Guard. General \nUmbarger, adjutant general of the Indiana National Guard, and General \nTouley are so involved in this and doing such a wonderful job. They are \nto be commended. I also am grateful to the staff at Camp Atterbury and \nthe broader training support team from the Departments of State, \nDefense, and USAID.\n  Most important, I am extremely grateful to the thousands of our brave \nmen and women--civilian and military--who are serving in Afghanistan.\n  I believe this amendment is noncontroversial, and with support of the \nbill managers, I will be more than happy to adopt it by voice vote at \nthe appropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2592\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about an \namendment, one we are going to be spending more time on in the next \ncouple hours--amendment No. 2592. I will not call it up at this time, \nbut I will speak about it.\n  First, I am very honored that our assistant majority leader, Senator \nDurbin, has worked with me and our staffs have worked together on this \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that Majority Leader Reid, Senator \nKerry\n\n[[Page S10020]]\n\nof Massachusetts, and Senator Bill Nelson of Florida be added as \ncosponsors of amendments Nos. 2591 and 2592, which I filed for \nconsideration during the debate on H.R. 3326, the Defense \nAppropriations Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. President, the first amendment I will speak about is 2592.\n  This amendment has three major goals:\n  First, this amendment will make sure the shoddy electrical work on \nAmerican military bases gets fixed immediately. When I say shoddy \nelectrical work, in some of the circumstances I will describe, that is \nan understatement.\n  Second, it would also ensure that the brave men and women serving in \nwar zones have clean water. It is kind of hard to believe we have to \nhave an amendment to deal with that. We should have that anyway. But \nonce again, it is something we have to correct and fix.\n  Third, the amendment would establish and enforce strict standards for \npreventing and prosecuting sexual assault on Army bases.\n  These are the three goals and objectives of this amendment. These \nsimple, commonsense reforms are long overdue. These problems should \nhave been corrected a long time ago, but they haven't, so we have to \ntake action.\n  For the moment, I would like to focus on the first provision of the \namendment, which requires immediate correction of substandard \nelectrical work.\n  Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, 10 brave servicemembers and civilian \ncontractors in Iraq have died--have died--as a result of electrocutions \nthat could have been prevented. This includes SSG Ryan Maseth of \nShaler, PA, which is in the southwestern corner of our State.\n  Ryan died on January 2, 2008, when he was electrocuted while \nshowering in his barracks in Iraq. It is hard to describe in a short \npresentation and a few number of words the horrific nightmare he had to \nlive through and was killed by and the nightmare his family has lived \nthrough ever since. His mother Cheryl Harris is someone I have come to \nknow. She has been a strong advocate not just for finding out what \nhappened to her son but also making sure this doesn't happen to other \nsons and daughters serving in harm's way.\n  Just imagine this: A brave soldier, willing to take on the enemy and \ntrained to do that, willing to go into the battlefield and endure a \nfirefight, is killed in a shower because someone didn't do their job in \nensuring a shower was grounded or installed correctly to prevent shock \nor electrocution and death.\n  Ryan was not killed in combat. He was killed by the mistakes of \nothers in a place where he should have had a reasonable expectation of \nsafety and security away from the battlefield. In one of those few \nmoments when our soldiers can relax and get a breather, he was killed. \nSo this amendment is necessary because Ryan's tragic death could have \nbeen prevented if the bad electrical work had been fixed in a timely \nmanner.\n  Ryan's case is not an isolated incident. Other incidents involve \nservicemembers and contractors from all over the country, including \nGeorgia, Texas, California, Nevada, Oregon, Hawaii, Minnesota, and, as \nI mentioned, my home State of Pennsylvania. The risk continues to \npersist, and it has been going on since 2004.\n  Ryan died in January of 2008, but the risk is still there for our \nsoldiers. On September 1 of this year, the beginning of last month, a \ncivilian contractor, Adam Hermanson, died as a result of being \nelectrocuted--again, just like Ryan--while showering.\n  Adam grew up in San Diego and Las Vegas. He served three tours in \nIraq--three tours--with the Air Force before leaving at the rank of \nstaff sergeant. Adam Hermanson was planning to move to Pennsylvania \nwith his wife Janine. Janine is currently living in our State with her \nparents and searching for an explanation--an explanation as to why this \nhappened to her husband. The Departments of Defense and State have an \nobligation to provide this explanation.\n  We have had lots of investigations and lots of reviews but not enough \nin the way of answers. We have an obligation in the Senate as well to \nprevent any further electrocutions of our troops in these \ncircumstances.\n  This amendment attempts to right a wrong by ensuring that the Army \nreviews the language of a contract at the time of formation of that \ncontract to ensure that it includes explicit language that clearly \nrequires contractors to immediately correct deficiencies, such as \nimproperly ground equipment or facilities which could cause the death \nor serious bodily harm of a soldier. This review should be happening \nalready, but the facts make clear that it isn't. The Senate needs to \ntake concrete steps now to reduce and ultimately eliminate this danger \nto our troops. No family should have to endure the pain suffered by \nRyan's mother Cheryl Harris or Adam's wife Janine Hermanson or any \nother family members of the other eight fallen soldiers.\n  Americans serving in this theater of war or any theater of war face \nchallenges on the battlefield that most of us can't even imagine. I \nknow Chairman Inouye understands what I am talking about. He served in \ncombat and we know of his great heroic story. He can understand it, but \nI am not sure I can, not having faced those challenges myself. But the \nrisk of death should not follow these brave men and women into the \nbarracks, where they should have a reasonable expectation of safety and \nsecurity away from the battlefield.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe names of the 10 servicemembers and contractors who have died in \nIraq as a result of electrocutions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Electrocution Deaths in Iraq\n\n       Since the March 2003 invasion, 19 people have died from \n     electrocution, including 10 from the Army, 5 from the Marine \n     Corps, 1 from the Navy, 2 military contractors and 1 State \n     Department contractor.\n       According to the Inspector General of the United States \n     Department of Defense, nine of the 19 electrocutions involved \n     accidental deaths that resulted from the victims touching or \n     coming into contact with live electrical power lines. The \n     Inspector General's report on these incidents concluded that \n     ``[w]hether equipment maintenance complied with proper \n     electrical standards or grounding requirements were not \n     issues in these nine electrocutions, and the investigations \n     conducted in the cases sufficiently established \n     responsibility for the deaths.''\n       The remaining ten electrocutions involved equipment \n     malfunctions that could have related to whether equipment \n     maintenance complied with proper electrical standards or \n     whether the respective chain of command acted responsibly in \n     protecting Service members.\n       1. Army Spc. Marvin A. Camposiles, 25, of Austell, Georgia: \n     Army Spc. Composiles died in Samarra, Iraq, when he was \n     electrocuted while performing routine generator maintenance. \n     He was assigned to 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd \n     Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, Schweinfurt, Germany. Died on \n     April 17, 2004.\n       2. Marine Pfc. Brian K. Cutter, 19, of Riverside, \n     California: Marine Pfc. Cutter died in Al Asad, Iraq, after \n     being electrocuted while working on a cooling system for a \n     tent, only two days after arriving in Iraq. He was assigned \n     to 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, 1st Marine Division, I \n     Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Pendleton, California. Died \n     on May 13, 2004.\n       3. Spc. Marcus ``O.'' Nolasco, 34, of Chino, California: \n     Spc. Marcus Nolasco died in Baji, Iraq, when he was \n     electrocuted while showering. He was assigned to Battery B, \n     1st Battalion, 33rd Field Artillery, 1st Infantry Division, \n     Bamberg, Germany. Died on May 18, 2004.\n       4. Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class David A. Cedergren, 25, \n     South St. Paul, Minnesota: Petty Officer 3rd Class Cedergren \n     died near Iskandariayah, Iraq, died as a result of being \n     electrocuted. He was assigned to the 2nd Marine Division \n     Fleet Marine Forces Atlantic. Died on September 11, 2004.\n       5. Spc. Chase R. Whitham, 21, of Harrisburg, Oregon: Spc. \n     Whitham died in Mosul, Iraq when an electrical current surged \n     through a swimming pool in which he was swimming. Died on May \n     8, 2005.\n       6. Sohan Singh, Civilian Contractor Employee: Mr. Sohan \n     Singh was electrocuted while attempting to enter his quarters \n     at Fallujah Surgical, Camp Fallujah, Iraq, on July 19, 2005. \n     Mr. Singh was a third country national from India.\n       7. Staff Sgt. Christopher L. Everett, 23, of Huntsville, \n     Texas: Staff Sgt. Everett died in Al Taqqadum, Iraq, when he \n     was electrocuted while power washing sand from a Humvee. He \n     was assigned to the Army National Guard's 2nd Battalion, \n     112th Armor Regiment, 56th Brigade Combat Team, Arlington, \n     Texas. Died on September 7, 2005.\n       8. Army Sgt. Michael J. Montpetit, 31, of Honolulu, Hawaii: \n     Army Sgt. Montpetit died when he was electrocuted while \n     working on a\n\n[[Page S10021]]\n\n     generator outside of Baghdad. He was assigned to the 15th \n     Forward Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st \n     Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas. Died on June 22, 2007.\n       9. Staff Sgt. Ryan Douglas Maseth, 24, of Shaler, \n     Pennsylvania: Staff Sgt. Maseth was electrocuted while \n     showering in his barracks in Baghdad in January 2, 2008.\n       10. Adam Hermanson, 25, of Las Vegas, Nevada: While working \n     as a State Department contractor, Adam was electrocuted on \n     September 1, 2009 while showering in Baghdad. According to \n     press reports, military medical examiner told her that \n     preliminary findings indicate that Adam died from low voltage \n     electrocution. Adam served three tours in Iraq with the Air \n     Force before leaving at the rank of staff sergeant. Died on \n     September 1, 2009.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, let me conclude with a couple of remarks.\n  The Associated Press published a story written by Kimberly Hefling on \nSeptember 8, 2009, and I ask unanimous consent to have this article \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Sept. 8, 2009]\n\n                State Department Contractor Electrocuted\n\n                         (By Kimberly Hefling)\n\n       Washington.--A State Department contractor apparently has \n     been electrocuted while showering in Baghdad even as U.S. \n     authorities in Iraq try to remedy wiring problems that have \n     led to the deaths of American troops there.\n       The contractor, Adam Hermanson, 25, died Sept. 1, his wife, \n     Janine, said Tuesday. She added that a military medical \n     examiner told her that preliminary findings indicate her \n     husband died from low voltage electrocution.\n       Electrical wiring has been an ongoing problem in Iraq. At \n     least three troops have been electrocuted in the shower since \n     the start of the Iraq War, while others have been \n     electrocuted under other circumstances such as while \n     operating a power washer. Inspections and repairs are under \n     way at 90,000 U.S.-maintained structures there.\n       Hermanson grew up in San Diego and Las Vegas. He joined the \n     military at age 17, and did three tours in Iraq with the Air \n     Force before leaving at the rank of staff sergeant. He \n     returned to Iraq as an employee of the Herndon, Va.-based \n     private contractor Triple Canopy.\n       Jayanti Menches, a spokeswoman for Triple Canopy, said in \n     an e-mail that the company was saddened by his death but \n     would not be commenting further until an investigation was \n     complete.\n       State Department spokesman Robert Wood also offered \n     condolences to the family, but would not elaborate further on \n     the cause of death, pending an investigation.\n       Janine Hermanson said her husband took the contracting job \n     so they would have money to buy a house in Muncy, Pa., where \n     they were planning to live. She said she'd already moved \n     there and was living with her parents.\n       The two would have celebrated their fourth wedding \n     anniversary on Sunday.\n       ``He was supposed to come back and we had a lot of plans,'' \n     said his wife, who also served in Iraq with the Air Force.\n       Besides three Iraq tours, Adam Hermanson served in \n     Uzbekistan with the Air Force. His mother, Patricia \n     Hermanson, 53, of Las Vegas, said everyone in her family was \n     struggling to understand how he could survive four war tours, \n     then die suddenly in a seemingly safe place.\n       ``We all know that Adam was as strong as a tank,'' his \n     mother said. ``He was in good health.''\n       In July, the Defense Department's inspector general said \n     that of the 18 electrocution deaths of U.S. soldiers and \n     contractors in Iraq, eight involved possible equipment faults \n     or malfunctioning that caused or contributed to the \n     electrocutions. The accidental touching of live wires was \n     blamed in about half the deaths.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I won't read all of this Associated Press \nstory but will just make note of two statements by two people who loved \nAdam Hermanson very much.\n  There is a statement in this story about his wife and his mother. His \nwife said, when reflecting upon what had happened to her husband and \nthe circumstances: He was supposed to come back, and we had a lot of \nplans. So after serving three tours as a soldier and then going back as \na contractor, he would have hoped to have come back to be with his \nwife, and she says in the story that they had a lot of plans. And then \nAdam's mother, Patricia Hermanson of Las Vegas, said everyone in her \nfamily was struggling to understand how he could survive so many tours \nof duty and then die suddenly in a seemingly safe place. That is a \nquestion all of us should ask and have answered--those who are family \nmembers who have lived through this nightmare and those who are \nSenators trying to do something about it.\n  I know there are many people here in this Chamber who want to do \nsomething about this, so I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I hope someone can tell me whether we can call it up \nat this time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CASEY. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for his \namendment. I support the intent and the purpose of that amendment. \nHowever, I have been advised there are certain technical changes that \nhave been recommended for better acceptance by this body. So if I may \nask that the Senator's staff and the staff of the committee get \ntogether, I think we can work it out.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the chairman for his comments, and we will \ncertainly act in accordance with his statement.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2578, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 2578 be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  The Secretary of Defense may, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the \n     United States Agency for International Development, continue \n     to support requirements for monthly integrated civilian-\n     military training for civilians deploying to Afghanistan at \n     Camp Atterbury, Indiana, including through the allocation of \n     military and civilian personnel, trainers, and other \n     resources for that purpose.\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment at \nthis time?\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to advise the Senate that the \ncommittee has no objection to the Kaufman amendment and we accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2578), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2567\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the Center on Climate Change \n       and National Security of the Central Intelligence Agency)\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask the pending business be set aside and I be \nallowed to call up my amendment, No. 2567, and make it pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Barrasso] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2567.\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S10022]]\n\n       Sec. __. No amounts appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be available for the Center on \n     Climate Change and National Security of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on September 25 the Central Intelligence \nAgency announced the creation of the CIA Center on Climate Change and \nNational Security. I am proposing an amendment today to the fiscal year \n2010 Defense appropriations bill that would prevent funds in this bill \nfrom going to that center. The CIA is responsible for gathering foreign \nintelligence information for the United States. We have threats from \naround the world. The most immediate of these threats is the prevention \nof future terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. I do not believe that \ncreating a Center on Climate Change is going to prevent one terrorist \nattack.\n  Why is this administration having our intelligence officials, the men \nand the women who protect this country, have these men and women staff \nand operate a climate change center? The creation of this center \nappears to elevate the issue of climate change to the level of \nterrorism and foreign espionage.\n  To me, this raises a number of questions. The CIA always claims to \nhave scarce resources and competing priorities. What are the costs \ngoing to be of creating this new climate center? Isn't there a more \nefficient way to achieve the same results using existing resources? Why \ncan't the CIA get this information through traditional channels, such \nas the State Department officials in the field, the EPA, the National \nOcean and Atmospheric Administration, and other Federal agencies?\n  How does the CIA get information about other issues--world hunger, \ndisease, financial markets--to make their decisions? Do they have \ncenters for all of these issues as well? Is this center going to make \ndemands on the current CIA bureaucracy? Will they use existing \npersonnel? Will they hire new people? Will necessary personnel have \ntasking authority?\n  Tasking authority means the ability to take satellites off of \nwatching terrorists and having them instead watching arctic ice sheets. \nWill someone sitting in a dark room watching satellite video of \nnorthern Afghanistan now be sitting in a dark room watching polar ice \ncaps?\n  The priorities seem to be out of focus. I believe the Senate should \nsupport this amendment and bring the focus back in line with America's \nnational security interests. The CIA has an important job to do. It \nmust not be distracted by being forced to deal with climate change.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have two things to do. First, there is an \namendment from the Senator from Oklahoma on the National Guard REA \naccounts. I think the amendment would miss the point and make a faulty \nassumption that the National Guard/Reserve equipment accounts do not go \nthrough a process.\n  The Secretary of Defense and service chiefs already review the \nunfunded list that the NGREA funds are put toward. The Air National \nGuard and Army National Guard, working closely with their major command \ncounterparts, have been able to use these funds on critical capability \nrequirements by leading with funding for integration and procurement of \nvarious weapons systems capabilities.\n  The Army and the Air Force are responsible for equipping their \nReserve components, and they do so within budgetary constraints.\n  We know historically that the Air National Guard has been equipped at \na level significantly lower than the Active components and, \nconstitutionally, the Congress has the explicit power to provide for \nequipping the militia. Even in recent history the Air National Guard's \nequipment requirements are placed in the supplemental or in the \noutyears, which often do not survive.\n  Congress has traditionally understood that the Army cannot meet the \nReserve component's equipment requirements. The National Guard has a \nFederal ``wartime'' mission as an operational Reserve and, in order to \nensure that the Reserve component, specifically the Guard, can meet \nboth its Federal and domestic missions, Congress provides the NGREA.\n  After Katrina, the Guard had only 33 percent of the homeland \nequipment needed to respond to its State emergency response mission. \nThe Guard primarily focuses its NGREA procurements on critical dual-use \nitems that support both the Chief and the National Guard Bureaus' \n``Essential 10'' capabilities--their overseas military responsibility--\nand the Governors.\n  The funding provides for the modernization, unfunded MTOE equipment \nrequirements, and items of equipment that are not managed by the Army \nG4 or G8.\n  With all that said, I hope my colleagues will continue to recognize \nthat investments in our citizen soldiers and airmen provide the best \nbang for the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars and, further, that the \nfunds in the National Guard and Reserve equipment account are subject \nto an internal process review by the Secretary of Defense and \nrespective Guard Chiefs.\n  Mr. President, I also will ask to call up another amendment that I \nhave. I believe it is at the desk. This is an amendment on behalf of \nthe citizen airmen in the Air National Guard.\n  At present, the Air Force possesses sufficient numbers of fighter \naircraft to accomplish its national military strategy objective which, \nas its first priority, is the defense of the homeland. However, even \nwith an aggressive strategy to reflow legacy aircraft to Air Guard \nunits, the Air Guard will experience a significant drawdown of fighters \nas existing fighters reach the end of their service life.\n  Unfortunately, this is the result of year after year of failing to \nrecapitalize our fighter fleet. This is due to cost growth and \nproduction delays of the so-called fifth generation aircraft that have \nresulted in reduced purchases of aircraft and chronic delivery delays \nwhich threaten to put a tremendous bathtub in the available craft \nneeded by the Air Guard for its mission.\n  Most of us all know what happens when the pot shrinks in the \nPentagon. The Guard gets the short end of the stick. The Air Force must \nrecapitalize its older fighter force, the F-15s and F-16s. Fifth \ngeneration aircraft investment, proposed investment, is crowding out \nother Air Force priorities with limited resources when we have to have \nthe resources now for work that the Guard is continuing to do.\n  Of the F-16s in the Air National Guard, 80 percent will begin to \nreach the end of their service life in less than 8 years. The net \nresult is the Air Guard is facing a major gap between when the jets are \nretired and when aircraft to replace them are available.\n  That is the fighter gap. The result is units would not be capable of \nsupporting the Air Sovereignty Alert; that means defending the skies of \nthe Homeland.\n  Currently, the Guard covers series 16 of 18 sites where units stand \nalert 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. Recapitalizing \nthe Air National Guard and modernizing must occur proportionally and in \nparallel with the total Air Force; otherwise, mission gaps, such as the \nall-important Air Sovereignty Alert, will come down and the absence of \nnecessary aircraft will leave many units eviscerated.\n  There is no program or plan that prevents the fighter gap from \noccurring. I was very pleased to hear the Air Force Chief of Staff, GEN \nNorton Schwartz, announce at the National Guard Association his intent \nto work with the Guard to develop a preservation strategy.\n  The strategy is being developed. At the time, it will be presented to \nthe Air Force, the Guard, and the Adjutant Generals in November. \nSenator Leahy and I have continued to endorse the procurement of 4.5-\ngeneration aircraft to address the shortfall.\n  I believe we will have to consider purchasing more F-16s, F-15s or F/\nA-18s that are relevant to the current and foreseeable war on terror, \nare cost-effective, and are available to bridge the Guard through the \nfifth generation.\n  The Air Guard absolutely needs to be a part of the fifth-generation \nmissions but not at the expense of the vast majority of units it would \nlose due to a\n\n[[Page S10023]]\n\nlack or delay in follow on. We do not need to accept a smaller Air \nForce, particularly when it is not based on thoughtful analysis but \nbased on the need to cut budgets and cost growth in the procurement of \nthe new planes that are so far behind schedule, underperformance, and \noverbudget.\n  We will see too many units shut down. That is why Senator Leahy and I \nhave offered an amendment to restrict the retirement of the current \ngeneration aircraft until the Secretary reports to the Congressional \nDefense Committees a detailed plan on how the Secretary of the Air \nForce will fill the force structure, a description of the follow-on \nmissions, an explanation of the criteria for selecting the bases, a \nplan for the reassignment of regular and Reserve Air Force personnel, \nand an estimate of the cost avoidance to be achieved by the retirement \nof such tactical air.\n  Many of the efforts we have had to wage over the last few years have \nbeen the result of the Guard getting shut out of key decisions on \nresources and equipment. America's oldest fighting force is now more \nrelevant than ever. In today's world, the need for a National Guard is \ngreater than ever before. The Guard has experienced and capable \nfighting units. There is no program or plan that prevents this fighter \ngap from occurring. Unless we pass this amendment, the issue remains \nunresolved. This amendment will prevent the loss of any additional \nforce structure until we get the information needed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call \nup this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I reserve the right to object. Let me inquire as to what \nis pending now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Barrasso \namendment No. 2567. Five other amendments are also pending.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we consider the Defense Department \nAppropriations bill, the most important question we face concerns our \nmilitary operations in Afghanistan. That is why I have filed an \namendment which commends the President for focusing on Afghanistan and \nPakistan and for developing a comprehensive, interagency strategy for \nthe region. It also expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nPresident should provide Congress and the American people with some \nbasic information before he authorizes any potential increase in troop \nlevels in Afghanistan. In particular, it urges the President to inform \nCongress how much such an increase would cost, how long he expects it \nto last, the likelihood that it will have any impact on our ability to \nconfront the al-Qaida safe haven in Pakistan, and the likelihood that \nit will actually destabilize one or both countries. I realize that we \ncannot know these things with absolute certainty, but we should have \nsome idea of the expected costs, duration, and likelihood of success or \nfailure before embarking on such a significant undertaking. The \nPresident should not send tens of thousands of brave young men and \nwomen into harm's way, if he so decides, without first answering these \nquestions, and Congress should not support such a decision without \nfirst obtaining this information.\n  My amendment, which is nonbinding, does not attempt to pressure the \nPresident to make a decision about troop levels. I, for one, am pleased \nto see that this administration is apparently asking some very tough \nquestions about our Afghan strategy. I think it is unfortunate that \nsome, including in this body, have suggested that any delay in \nresponding to General McChrystal's request is unacceptable. The stakes \nare too high for a rushed decision, and not only for the troops who \ncould be deployed. After 8 long years of war, we need to question all \nour assumptions and rethink our approach from top to bottom. What was \npossible and desirable 5 or even 2 years ago may now be neither. \nGetting Afghanistan right has serious implications for our national \nsecurity, and the answers to the questions I raise in my amendment will \nhelp us, and the people we represent, to know whether we have done so.\n  Eight years ago, I voted in favor of the authorization to use \nmilitary force against those who planned and carried out the 9/11 \nattacks. Since then, I have remained focused on that goal and have \nnoted with alarm the resiliency of al-Qaida's leadership in Pakistan \nand its growing footholds in Yemen, Somalia, North Africa and \nelsewhere. The decision to go to war in Iraq was a tragic mistake that \nundermined our ability to go after al-Qaida. That initial mistake was \ncompounded by flawed thinking as too many people focused narrowly on \n``getting Iraq right'' without realizing that the key to getting Iraq \nright was to place it in the context of a comprehensive, global \nstrategy to defeat al-Qaida. So, too, we cannot simply focus on getting \nAfghanistan right, we need to make sure that our Afghan approach is \npart of, and contributes to, that broader strategy I just mentioned.\n  This administration sees that bigger picture, which is why it has \nbegun to redeploy troops from Iraq, though not as quickly as I would \nprefer. And President Obama has brought needed focus and attention to \nthe Afghanistan-Pakistan region, but I am concerned that our current \nand proposed military strategy Afghanistan may play into al-Qaida's \nhands. Our current approach has mobilized a tribal network in the \nAfghan-Pakistan border region that does not share al-Qaida's \ninternational terrorist agenda but nonetheless opposes our massive \nmilitary presence in the region. It has driven people into the arms of \nthe Taliban even while Taliban and al-Qaida leadership remains out of \nreach in Pakistan. And it risks further destabilizing Pakistan, a \nnuclear-armed country where al-Qaida is now based. Rather than continue \ndown this road, we need a smart, targeted strategy to pursue al-Qaida \nand Taliban leadership without provoking further militancy in both \ncountries.\n  Our enemy is agile. It has a network that spans the globe, receives \nfinancing from individuals around the world and has a presence in even \nthe most developed nations. We have expanded our ability to go after \nthese networks, working with allies and cutting off the flow of funds. \nChasing after elusive Taliban foot soldiers in Afghanistan will not \ndefeat al-Qaida; rather, we must use all elements of our national power \nto target al-Qaida without getting bogged down in massive military \noperations with unrealistic goals and potentially dangerous unintended \nconsequences.\n  Armed nation-building in a country hostile to foreign interventions \nand with a feckless, corrupt central government is at best an \nexperiment and at worst a dangerous distraction. Rather than looking \ndesperately for a quick fix to the problems that plague that country, \nwe must acknowledge the limits of our ability to radically remake \nAfghan society no matter how many billions of dollars and tens of \nthousands of troops we may commit to the cause. Instead, we should \npursue a sustainable, civilian-focused strategy to support the \nemergence of legitimate governance. This is the surest way to defeat \nthe Taliban in the long term.\n  Unfortunately, while the decision to go to war in Afghanistan was the \nright one, the exigencies of our military operations are now \nundermining our ability to help promote such legitimate governance. We \nhave looked the other way when our supposed allies committed human \nrights abuses, sold drugs or embraced corruption. As General McChrystal \nstated in his assessment, we have embraced \n``problematic'' relationships with ``polarizing and predatory'' power \nbrokers, including in the Afghan National Security Forces, who ``have \nbeen major agents of corruption.'' He reported that ``extortion \nassociated with large-scale development projects undermines the economy \nin Afghanistan.'' Additionally, he notes, the Afghan public ``perceives \nthat ISAF is complicit in'' the abuse of power and corruption.\n\n  Some who want to persist with our current strategy are calling for a \nrapid increase in the size of the Afghan security forces. But without a \nlegitimate, functioning national government, a rapid expansion of these \nforces is likely to provoke further instability.\n  Currently, the only face of the Afghan government in many parts of \nthe country is the Afghan police force which is itself beset by \ncorruption.\n\n[[Page S10024]]\n\n  While our current strategy depends upon our ability to address the \ncorruption that plagues the Afghan government, no one has explained how \nwe can achieve this goal. With the input of millions of dollars, \ninternational pressure and additional U.S. troops, we did not even have \nthe ability to prevent wide-scale fraud in the recent presidential \nelection. In the absence of a legitimate local partner, our \ncounterinsurgency goals, while perhaps laudable, appear unrealistic.\n  Rather than further aligning ourselves with this badly flawed \ngovernment, we should focus on targeting our aid to those actually \nworking to promote good governance and the rule of law. This does not \nrequire a massive military presence. Indeed, attempting to accelerate \nthis process with an increase in U.S. troop levels may well be \ncounterproductive. Countries are typically built by their own people, \nover time, through a process of building a national consensus. This \ncannot be imposed by foreigners, especially when they are active \nparticipants in an ongoing war in a country that is highly resistant to \nforeign occupation. And we cannot afford to link this lengthy and \nunpredictable process to an open-ended and unsustainable military \nescalation.\n  General McChrystal has argued that we should significantly increase \nour military resources in Afghanistan for the purpose of ``protecting'' \nthe Afghan population. However, he acknowledges that, if we endorse his \nproposal, it ``is realistic to expect that Afghan and coalition \ncasualties will increase.'' This does not make sense. Occupying the \npopulation centers of southern Afghanistan is likely to provoke greater \nresentment and increase the danger to our troops and to the Afghan \npublic. The majority of Afghans oppose an increase in foreign troops \nand want to see foreign troops leave the country within 2 years. \nWithout giving the American and Afghan people a sense that our military \noperations will not go on indefinitely, we are unlikely to gain the \nsupport needed to accomplish our goals, particularly if we know going \nin that civilian casualties will only increase in the short term. That \nis why I have called for a flexible timetable to draw down our troop \npresence in Afghanistan.\n  Rather than risking more American lives and spending more American \ndollars in support of an illegitimate partner in Afghanistan, we must \nfind a way to relentlessly pursue al-Qaida without further \ndestabilizing Afghanistan and its nuclear-armed neighbor. Our massive, \nopen-ended military footprint is not only unnecessary and unlikely to \naccomplish this goal, it may well be counterproductive.\n  Now, some will argue that anything short of a troop escalation means \n``abandoning'' Afghanistan. That same argument was made about Iraq, and \nit is just as phony now as it was then. The question is not about \nabandoning Afghanistan, it is about correctly defining and achieving \nour goals there. Unlike Iraq, we also hear arguments pointing out that \nthe 9/11 attacks were launched from Afghanistan, which is absolutely \ntrue.\n  But the leaders of al-Qaida and the leaders of the Taliban are in \nPakistan, they are not in Afghanistan. We should be concerned about al-\nQaida potentially re-establishing a safe haven in Afghanistan, but we \nshould be even more concerned about al-Qaida's current a safe haven in \nPakistan. Pakistan is home to a witches' brew of militancy, radicalism, \nterrorism, nuclear weapons and weak civilian leadership, and getting \nthis country right will be even more challenging, and more important, \nthan Afghanistan.\n  Our primary goal should be to help support the emergence of a \ncivilian government in Pakistan that is effective, democratic and a \nreliable partner. It has been widely reported that elements of the \nPakistani security services continue to provide support to militants. \nOur ability to pressure the Pakistani security forces to hold those \nelements accountable is undermined by our focus on military operations \nin Afghanistan, specifically our dependence upon our supply line \nrunning through Pakistan. Some have suggested that if we redeploy \ntroops from Afghanistan, the Pakistanis will decide we are not \ncommitted to the region, and we will lose what leverage we have over \nthem. In fact, we should consider whether drawing down our troops in \nAfghanistan would help enable us to deal with Pakistan from a position \nof strength.\n  The Director of National Intelligence summarized the depth of the \nproblem earlier this year during his testimony before the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. He stated that:\n\n       No improvement in the security in Afghanistan is possible \n     without . . . Pakistan taking control of its border areas and \n     improving governance, creating economic and educational \n     opportunities throughout the country. . . . [M]ounting \n     economic hardships and frustration over poor governance have \n     given rise to greater radicalization. . . . Islamabad needs \n     to make painful reforms to improve overall macroeconomic \n     stability. . . .\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nbe given 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.\n\n       Among the needed reforms are measures to improve the \n     transparency of government expenditures and impose taxes on \n     wealthy landowners. Such reforms would reduce the \n     opportunities for corruption among Pakistani political \n     leaders, help to establish a more level political playing \n     field, and help build the confidence of average Pakistanis in \n     their government.\n\n  As Admiral Blair's testimony illustrates, militancy in the region \nstems from an incredibly complicated set of problems, few of which are \namenable to a military solution. Now that the United States is focused \non its relationship with the civilian government in Pakistan after too \nmany years in which we placed all our chips on an unreliable, unpopular \nand undemocratic strongman, we are finally on the right track, trying \nto support the emergence of a legitimate government that, in the long \nrun, is more likely to support our counterterrorism goals and provide \nthe stability that country needs.\n  Progress on this front, however, may well be compromised by our \nmassive presence in Afghanistan. During a recent Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee hearing, former British foreign service officer, \nRory Stewart testified that ``U.S. operations in Afghanistan may, in \nfact, contribute to the destabilization of Pakistan.'' Special Envoy \nHolbrooke and Admiral Mullen have also acknowledged to me in \nappearances before the Foreign Relations Committee that there is a \ndanger that our operations in Afghanistan will further destabilize \nPakistan by pushing militants into that country. We must carefully \nconsider the alternatives before we pursue a significant escalation in \nAfghanistan that is not likely to fix the governance problems in that \ncountry or to address the al-Qaida presence in Pakistan, and that could \nfurther destabilize the entire region.\n  Over the last 8 years, we have committed tremendous resources in an \neffort to dramatically rework Afghan society. We have doubled our troop \nlevels over the past year and, this year alone, we will spend over $50 \nbillion in that country. This has already become the deadliest year for \nU.S. troops in Afghanistan. Rather than doubling down on a strategy \nwith objectives that may well be unachievable, we should focus on \nrelentlessly pursuing al-Qaida's network in Pakistan and around the \nworld, and set realistic goals for providing civilian assistance to \nlegitimate actors within the Afghan and Pakistani governments. My \namendment asks tough questions about any potential military escalation \nto ensure that we carefully consider the costs of the proposed \nstrategy, its likelihood of achieving our counterterrorism goals, the \npotential pitfalls and the alternatives. I hope my colleagues will ask \nthemselves these questions as they consider whether to support the \nunderlying bill, which funds a military approach in Afghanistan that is \nbadly in need of rethinking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up my amendment at the desk, No. 2588.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, I have no objection to the \nSenator from Minnesota offering his amendment. I wanted to get two \nother amendments pending. I ask that I be included in the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modifying the request?\n\n[[Page S10025]]\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I would like to get my amendment in.\n  Mr. COBURN. If the Senator objects for me, then I will object to him \ngetting his.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2593\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment 2593 offered \nby the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are two amendments that we will be \nvoting on next to each other, side by side, relating to the appearance \nof not only General McChrystal but, if my amendment is passed, the \nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nCommander in CENTCOM and General McChrystal, both. That was the \napproach we used when President Bush, for 3 months, had under \nconsideration an Iraqi surge. Nobody tried to have a hearing at that \ntime to bring in his commander while the President was deliberating to \ngive us the commander's views that he was sharing with his Commander in \nChief. As a matter of fact, that commander, General Casey, had views \nwhich ran very contrary to his Commander in Chief. But we should follow \nthat same pattern here. We should allow this deliberative process to \ntake place. We should not try to intrude upon it or to put the \ncommander in the field in a position where he is testifying in public \nrelative to what he is advising his Commander in Chief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I hope everybody had a chance to read the wording of this \namendment that says ``appropriate committees of Congress shall hold \nhearings,'' et cetera, ``promptly after the decision by the President \non those matters is announced.'' In other words, we don't have any \ninput into the decisionmaking process. We don't get to hear from the \nSecretary of Defense on down while the decision is being made by the \nPresident as a coequal branch of government. This is bizarre. I have \nnever seen a requirement that we can't call witnesses and won't call \nwitnesses on an issue about sending young Americans into harm's way. \nThis is a remarkable statement that we are not going to be in on the \ntakeoff and so therefore we will not be in on the landing. We aren't \ngoing to have a hearing on one of the most pressing and incredible \nemergencies of our time? We aren't going to have any witnesses before \nthe appropriate committees until after the decision is made? I am not \nready to abrogate those responsibilities that I have to the citizens of \nArizona who are in harm's way. I urgently ask colleagues to vote \nagainst this bizarre amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 2593.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 304 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n      \n     Dodd\n      \n  The amendment (No. 2593) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                  Senator Orrin Hatch's 12,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to honor our colleague and good \nfriend, the senior Senator from Utah, who is about to cast his 12,000th \nvote. Today, Senator Hatch becomes part of a small group. He is now one \nof fewer than 15 Senators in history, and the only Senator in the \nhistory of Utah, to have cast 12,000 votes in the well of the Senate.\n  The people of Utah have elected Orrin Hatch to this body six times, \nand I am sure they couldn't be more proud to see him reach this \nmilestone. For more than 32 years, he has been a phenomenal \nrepresentative of the Beehive State. He has made sure no one in \nWashington, as he likes to put it, has been able to push Utah around. \nHe has also made a lot of sacrifices in the process. A few years ago, \nwhen Senator Hatch was deciding whether to run for reelection, his wife \nElaine asked him if maybe it was time to leave Washington so they could \nhave a life. Orrin responded with the words of a public servant: ``This \nis our life,'' he said. ``My life is a life of service.''\n  It actually started out early. As a young man growing up in \nPittsburg, Orrin was elected to the student Senate and then as student \nbody president at Baldwin High School. Later, at Brigham Young \nUniversity, thanks to an alphabetical seating chart, he met Elaine \nHansen. It was probably the only thing he ever got in his life simply \nby way of good luck.\n  Orrin was always a hard worker. As a boy, he sold eggs from his \nfamily's chickens. He worked as a janitor in college. He left Brigham \nYoung with a degree in history and went on to make some history \nhimself, becoming the longest serving Senator in the history of Utah \nand one of the most influential and well-known Senators of our time.\n  Politics came naturally and quickly. Before winning a Senate seat, he \nhad never held elected office. A tireless campaigner, Orrin set out \nacross his State to meet the people of Utah and to tell them how he \ncould help them in Washington. His message and his work ethic earned \nhim their respect and it earned him 54 percent of the vote.\n  From the moment he was sworn in, Orrin kept his early pledge. He has \nhelped the people of Utah and all Americans keep more of their hard-\nearned money by sponsoring tax relief legislation. He has been a \nchampion of health care reform, particularly children's health, through \nhis work on the Finance and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittees.\n  Senator Hatch is also known to millions of Americans as a veteran \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. He has been involved in the debate \nover eight--eight--sitting Supreme Court Justices.\n  He has been a major player in recent debates over national security, \nenergy, labor, the second amendment, and the current debate over health \ncare, and he has done it all in the spirit of bipartisanship, earning \nthe friendship and respect of every Senator in this Chamber. No one who \nhas ever met Orrin Hatch isn't struck by his courtesy and the dignity \nwith which he carries out his duties. For Republicans, he is a good \nfriend, a constant ally, and one of the best advocates we have. To \nAmericans, he is the very picture of a Senator.\n  Incidentally, he is also one of the most prolific songwriters ever to \nserve in Congress. He wrote all 13 songs from one of his albums over \nthe course of one weekend, and well-known musicians such as Gladys \nKnight have sung his songs. But he will never be accused of false \nmodesty when it comes to his\n\n[[Page S10026]]\n\ntalents as a songwriter. Orrin once told a reporter: Everybody loves my \nmusic.\n  In everything else, though, Orrin is happy to share the credit. He \nwill be the first to tell you that his success wouldn't be possible \nwithout his family. So today we also honor Elaine, their 6 children, \nand their 23 grandchildren on this very historic occasion.\n  These milestones are important because they testify to hard work and \ncommitment. But they also give us an opportunity to recognize \ncolleagues whom we admire and respect, colleagues such as the senior \nSenator from Utah.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have looked forward for the last half-hour \nor so to this occasion, recognizing that Orrin was going to be making \nhis 12,000th vote the next vote.\n  The people of Utah are proud of Senator Hatch for a lot of reasons. \nHis name is synonymous with Utah. Even though he spent a lot of his \ngrowing up in Pennsylvania, the name ``Hatch'' is a prominent name \nthroughout Utah. They even have a town named Hatch. His great-\ngrandfather, Jeremiah Hatch, helped found the town of Vernal. Orrin, I \nhave to say this: My staff preparing this said the beautiful town of \nVernal. I had to change it to say the interesting town of Vernal. But \nit is an indication of the roots of the Hatch family in Utah. That town \nof Vernal, UT, was founded more than 130 years ago by Jeremiah, and the \nheart of every Hatch since then was been part of the State of Utah.\n  Senator Hatch has chaired the Judiciary Committee on more than one \noccasion. He spent 7 years at the helm of that panel during some of the \nmost difficult times we have had in the Senate dealing with judicial \nappointments. He served as chairman of the HELP Committee. In that \npost, he sat alongside his friend, Ted Kennedy, for almost two decades. \nSenator Hatch has a lot to be proud of in his legislative record. One \nof the things that is a hallmark of Senator Hatch: He is the reason we \nhave a Surgeon General's warning on cigarette packages and \nadvertisements. That is because of Senator Hatch.\n  He has not only been a good Senator, he is also a terrific lawyer. He \nexcelled in his younger days as a basketball player, has fought in the \nring, and as we have heard from the Republican leader, he is an \naccomplished musician, and he really is. He recently wrote a song in \nhonor of Senator Kennedy. It is not the first song he has written about \nhis friend.\n  Orrin Hatch has dedicated his life to people, period. As a young man, \nhe took 2 years out of his life to serve as a Mormon missionary in the \nStates of Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. That is, as some say, similar to \ngoing into the Army and not having a gun to carry. It is a very strict \n2 years. They have very strict assignments and a routine they go \nthrough, and it prepared him well for what we do in the Senate. But \nduring his heavy load in the Senate, he has rarely not been a Sunday \nschool teacher or doing other things with the church.\n  I think we on this side would agree that Orrin Hatch on occasion can \nbe fairly partisan, but I would also say that is not always the case. \nHe has almost, nearly alone on a number of occasions, broken away and \nbeen responsible for important legislation in recent years, including \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. Many educational issues, \nincluding Leave No Child Behind, have been as a result of his stepping \nout.\n  Orrin and I are not political soulmates, but we are soulmates. He is \na wonderful man and a good friend. As we have heard, he is the father \nof 6, the grandfather of 23, and a great-grandfather. He is one of the \nmost senior Members of this body and one of the most respected.\n  I think truly the reason that Orrin is the person he is is because of \nElaine. He has an angelic wife, a woman who is at his side, supportive \nof him through good times and bad. She is a wonderful woman.\n  I am happy to have as one of my neighbors from the State above ours, \nUtah, Orrin Hatch, who will truly go down as one of Utah's outstanding, \ngreat Senators, and that is the way it should be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will not prolong this a great deal, but \nI need to stand as Orrin's junior colleague and acknowledge not only \nall the things the two leaders have acknowledged, but the great \nfriendship I have experienced coming here as a Senator.\n  Orrin, we shall now reveal, was somewhat enamored of my opponent when \nI ran the first time. He, at the same time, in great fairness, reached \nout to me to become acquainted with me, and after we had a particular \nproblem arise in that campaign, Orrin reached out to my opponent and \nsettled that problem with the kind of diplomacy and capacity he always \nhas. From that time forward, I could not have had and could not have \nwished for a more reliable or more supportive senior colleague than \nOrrin Hatch.\n  I am senior to him when it comes to age. You wouldn't think that, but \nit happens to be true. But never at any time has he treated me as \nanything but a complete equal. He has acted as a mentor.\n  I am grateful to the two leaders for their setting aside this time. I \nwish to join with them in congratulating Orrin on his 12,000th vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, thank you so much to the two leaders. This is \nembarrassing, but it is very moving to have all my friends and \ncolleagues here. This means so much to me. I didn't realize it was such \na big deal, to cast 12,000 votes, but I am grateful the people of Utah \nhave given me this privilege and this opportunity to serve in the \ngreatest legislative body on Earth today, with the most wonderful \npeople I know on both sides of the floor. I appreciate each and every \none of you, and as long as I am here, I am going to try to do the very \nbest job I can.\n  I am very grateful to Bob Bennett as well. He is a wonderful \ncolleague and a wonderful companion here in the Senate. He has been a \nwonderful guide, and he has helped me as well.\n  This body means a great deal to me. We all saw what it meant to Ted \nKennedy and the great accolades he received throughout his lifetime. It \nwas a real privilege to be close to him, as I am to almost all of you \nand will be to all of you. This is a tremendous body. I just wish we \ncould get rid of some of the partisanship as well as work together a \nlittle bit better than we have. To the extent that I can, I will \ncertainly try to do that.\n  I wish to thank my friends on the Democratic side for their patience \nand their tolerance and kindness and my friends on the Republican side \nfor putting up with me all these years. I am very grateful to you.\n  By the way, I have three great-grandchildren as well, so I have 26 \ngrandchildren, and I think probably more on the way by now.\n  When I was a missionary in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, they once \ncalled me to start the congregation in Sandusky, OH.\n  We had four members there who hadn't been to church in less than 10 \nyears. Within a month we had 30, all women, of course, and children. I \nbecame the first branch president, pastor of that congregation. We have \nthe longest serving woman's organization in the world in the Mormon \nchurch, and it is called the Relief Society, which is presided over by \nwomen. I don't want you to misconstrue this, but I was also a part of \nand the president of the Relief Society as well in that small branch of \nthe church.\n  From those humble beginnings, I have to say I received some of the \ngreatest experiences of my life. That mission was important to me. This \nis important to me. I love each and every one of you. I think I have \nexpressed that to you in various ways, even at times when I am sure you \nwondered about it. I am sorry I took so long, but I am moved by this \nnice care that you have all shown to me. Thank you so much.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2575\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2575, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n\n[[Page S10027]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment says within 45 days that we \nshould have testimony from our military leaders, whom we have given the \nresponsibility for combat operations in Afghanistan.\n  We have just abrogated the Senate's obligations and constitutional \nauthority for advice and consent, because now, thanks to the passage of \nthe Levin amendment, we will not have testimony from those commanders \nin the field. I take special exception to it, and so should most people \nwho have their young citizens over there in harm's way today fighting \nand dying.\n  What we are going to do is say we cannot have any hearing as regards \nto strategy concerning how we are going to succeed in Afghanistan. So \nwe are not in on the takeoff, and a lot of us may have trouble being in \non the landing. This is an issue regarding which the Senate should have \na role--at least of being informed.\n  I guess maybe we will be restricted to interviews with General \nMcChrystal on ``60 Minutes.'' I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I very much oppose the amendment. Secretary \nGates opposes it. It would be totally inappropriate, in the middle of a \ndeliberative process, to pit a commander of our troops in the field \nagainst the Commander in Chief. We did not do this when President Bush \nwas President and General Casey was the commander. Apparently, he had \nvery different views about the surge. Three months went by while \nPresident Bush deliberated on whether to surge troops. We never put \nGeneral Casey at a hearing to tell us what he was advising President \nBush, asking why we heard he might be advising a very different course \nof action. We never did that to President Bush. We should extend the \nsame courtesy to President Obama during this deliberative process.\n  There are good reasons why Secretary Gates opposes bringing his \ncommander in front of a public hearing at this time. We should show the \nsame respect for the President of the United States now as we did when \nPresident Bush was President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2588\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, the amendment I offer today is inspired \nby the courageous story of a young woman who has dedicated 4 years of \nher life to making sure no other woman lives through her nightmare.\n  Four years ago at the age of 19, Ms. Jamie Leigh Jones signed a \ncontract to become an employee of KBR, then a Halliburton subsidiary. \nThat contract contained a clause which required her to arbitrate any \nfuture dispute against her employer--this means to force her to give up \nher right to seek redress in court if she was wronged. At the time, Ms. \nJones had no idea what implications this seemingly innocuous fine-print \nclause would have.\n  Ms. Jones arrived in Iraq in July of 2005. Immediately, she \ncomplained to supervisors about the hostile conditions imposed by KBR. \nShe was constantly being harassed by her male colleagues and was housed \nin barracks with 400 men and only a few women. Her pleas for safer \nhousing were ignored.\n  Four days after her arrival, Ms. Jones was drugged and gang-raped. \nShe requested medical attention, and a doctor administered a rape kit. \nParts of that rape kit have since mysteriously disappeared.\n  After Ms. Jones reported the rape to her supervisors, she was locked \nin a shipping container with an armed guard and prohibited any contact \nwith the outside world. They locked her in a container. It was only \nafter she convinced one of the guards to lend her a cell phone that she \nwas able to talk to her father, who enlisted the help of Representative \nTed Poe, a Republican Congressman from Texas, to arrange for her safe \nreturn to the United States.\n  But Ms. Jones' horrific plight did not end there. Having survived \nthis ordeal, most of us would expect that she would have had her day in \ncourt to seek justice for the actions and inactions of her employer. \nInstead, KBR sought to enforce the arbitration clause in Ms. Jones' \ncontract and tried to force her into arbitration. So over the past 3 \nyears, Ms. Jones has been fighting for her right to bring a lawsuit, \nand KBR has been fighting her every step along the way. This is simply \ntoo long for a rape victim to wait, just to have her day in court.\n\n  The only thing more outrageous than KBR's actions is that Ms. Jones' \nstory is not an isolated one. Since Ms. Jones courageously shared her \nstory, many more women have come out of the shadows saying the same \nthing happened to them. And, yes, some of these women are still waiting \nfor their day in court too. Others were forced into arbitration, and \ntheir outcome remains secret due to the nondisclosure clauses in the \narbitration agreement.\n  Arbitration has its place in our justice system. For two companies \nhaggling over the price of goods, arbitration is an efficient forum, \nand the arbitrator will undoubtedly have the appropriate expertise. The \nprivacy that arbitration offers can protect their proprietary business \ninformation. But arbitration has its limits. Arbitration is conducted \nbehind closed doors and doesn't bring persistent, recurring, and \negregious problems to the attention of the public. Arbitration doesn't \never allow a jury of your peers. Arbitration doesn't establish \nimportant precedent that can be used in later cases.\n  Many of our Nation's most cherished civil rights were established by \nindividuals bringing claims in court, the court ruling in their favor, \nand then extending the protection of those rights to anyone in a \nsimilar situation. Arbitration does have a place in our system, but \nhandling claims of sexual assault and egregious violations of civil \nrights is not its place.\n  Ms. Jones won a small but important victory just a few weeks ago. The \nconservative Fifth Circuit Court, encompassing Texas, Louisiana, and \nMississippi, ruled that most of Ms. Jones' claims do not belong in \narbitration, and she is entitled to her day in court. The Fifth Circuit \nruled that even when you sign an employment contract requiring \narbitration, there are some rights to sue your employer that can't be \nsigned away. These include assault and battery, infliction of emotional \ndistress, false imprisonment, and negligent hiring, retention, and \nsupervision. But the Fifth Circuit's ruling only applies to the Fifth \nCircuit's jurisdiction, so it is not settled law throughout the United \nStates. Who can say what might happen to claims filed in other \ncircuits?\n  My amendment seeks to extend much of the Fifth Circuit's reasoning to \ngovernment contractors who continually subject workers to these so-\ncalled mandatory arbitration clauses. The government shouldn't be doing \nbusiness with defense contractors such as KBR as long as they continue \nthis practice.\n  The amendment I am offering today seeks to narrowly target the most \negregious violations. The amendment applies to defense contracts, many \nof which are administered abroad, where women are the most vulnerable \nand least likely to have support resources. The amendment will apply to \nmany contractors that have already demonstrated their incompetence in \nefficiently carrying out defense contracts and have further \ndemonstrated their unwillingness and their inability to protect women \nfrom sexual assault.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nLouisiana is going to be the next speaker, but I ask unanimous consent \nat the conclusion of her remarks that the Senator from Georgia be \nrecognized, and that I be recognized after him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I understand there are several \ncolleagues wishing to speak on the underlying bill. I am going to speak \nfor a minute on an event that happened last night to honor many of our \nconstituents who were here in Washington for a special event. But \nbefore I do, and before the Senator from Minnesota leaves the floor, I \nwant to thank him for bringing the amendment he just brought to the \nbill and to ask that my name be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I sincerely appreciate the work that \nhas gone into that amendment and hope it will see a significant vote on \nthe Senate floor and that it will help not only the individual he spoke \nof but perhaps hundreds, if not thousands, of other people who might \nfind themselves in similar situations.\n\n\n                  Congressional Coalition on Adoption\n\n  Madam President, I see my good friend, Senator Inhofe, on the Senate \nfloor today. He and I have the privilege and honor of cochairing the \nadoption caucus, and I wanted to speak briefly and to thank the 43 \nSenators who participated in this annual event by honoring individuals \nin their States--and, Madam President, you participated as well--for \nsomething special they had done on behalf of adoption or foster care in \nthe United States or abroad.\n  This event is in its eleventh year. Collectively, the Members of \nCongress--Democrats and Republicans--have honored over 1,500 \nAmericans--\n\n[[Page S10029]]\n\nsome judges, some social workers, parents, advocates, lawyers in the \nsystem--who are helping to find permanent homes for orphans in America \nand around the world. We have approximately 500,000 children in foster \ncare. That is a large number, but actually a small percentage if you \nthink about all the children in our country--about 100 million. This \nrepresents less than one-half of 1 percent. But these children are in \nthe custody of the government. Governments don't, by their nature, love \nchildren, human beings do, and parents particularly. So our job as \nSenators and Congressmen is to try to break down barriers, legal and \notherwise, so we can find these orphans permanent homes.\n  In the last 20 seconds that I have, I want to submit for the Record \nthe names of the 43 Senators and their angels from a variety of States \nin the Union. I want to acknowledge the three national angels: Judge \nMichael Nash of California, nominated by the Senators from that State \nand from all of us who started National Adoption Day, where judges such \nas Judge Nash took the liberty to hold adoptions on Saturdays so we \ncould move a backlog of children. Because of his action, 350 \ncommunities now hold adoptions on Saturday.\n  Al Roker, who greets most Americans in the morning, an adoptive \nfather, is now using his position of power to advocate on behalf of \norphans.\n  And Sean and Leanne Toohey, who adopted a young man at 16 years old, \nare a couple who had raised two biological children, then adopted a \nyoung man who was going nowhere, on a dead-end street. Because of their \nlove and because of their mutual support, he now is the No. 1 draft \nchoice and is going to play for the Baltimore Ravens--a young man with \na great deal of potential who just simply didn't have any parents who \nbelieved in him. Now he does.\n  That is the work we do. We honor all of our angels who were here for \nmany days, understanding they are not alone in this fight to find homes \nfor orphans.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the 2009 Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute Angels in \nAdoption.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n 2009 Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute Angels in Adoption\n\n\n                                Alabama\n\n       Linnie and Debbie Dickson; AGAPE of North Alabama, Inc.\n\n\n                                 Alaska\n\n       Elaine Cordova; Mechele and Ricky Adams.\n\n\n                                Arizona\n\n       James and Virginia Avelar.\n\n\n                                Arkansas\n\n       Christie Erwin; Keith Morrison.\n\n\n                               California\n\n       Dan and Brook Meehan; Wanda Bonnell; Christine Devine; Mark \n     D.

Madam President, I thank my colleagues for the \nopportunity to speak briefly and to take the time from this important \nbill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I would first like to commend the \nSenator from Louisiana for her great work on this issue of adoption. \nShe has been very diligent over the years in promoting the issue of \nadoption of needy children across America, and I am very pleased to be \na part of that caucus and commend her and thank her for her great work \nthere.\n  Madam President, what is the status of the business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The last offered amendment is the Coburn \namendment, No. 2566.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2608\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside and that I be allowed to call up \namendment No. 2608.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S10030]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss], for Mr. Kyl, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2608.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To appropriate an additional $900,000,000 for the Afghanistan \n                         Security Forces Fund)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  The amount appropriated by title IX under the \n     heading ``Afghanistan Security Forces Fund'' is hereby \n     increased by $900,000,000.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, very quickly, this amendment restores \nthe amount of money for the training of the Afghan security police and \nmilitary back to the level that was requested both by the President in \nhis budget submitted to this body, as well as restores the number that \nwas approved in the Defense authorization bill that has previously been \nvoted on by this body and is now in conference with the House.\n  The fiscal year 2010 Defense appropriations bill takes $900 million \nfrom the President's request for Afghan security forces at a point in \ntime when our troops are in the trenches fighting and defending us, \ndefending the Afghan people from both the Taliban and al-Qaida, and \nthere is no more critical issue out there right now than training both \nthe Afghan military as well as the Afghan security police.\n  We have just received General McChrystal's assessment, and let me \nquote a portion of that assessment where he states as follows:\n\n       Failure to provide adequate resources also risks a longer \n     conflict, greater casualties, higher overall cost, and \n     ultimately a critical loss of political support. Any of these \n     risks, in turn, are likely to result in mission failure.\n\n  General McChrystal's No. 1 issue is the training of the Afghan \nmilitary and the Afghan security police because of the fact, if we are \never going to achieve success over there, we have to know that once we \nroot out the bad guys, once we take out the Taliban and al-Qaida, that \nwe can turn that country over to the Afghans, as we are doing in Iraq \ntoday, and we can remove our troops with the confidence that the Afghan \nmilitary and the Afghan security police will be able to maintain \nsecurity within that country as well as to protect the Afghan people \nfrom external sources. But the only way we will be able to do that is \nto train the military as well as to train the security police.\n  The President's budget that came over for this particular issue \nrequested $7.5 billion. That is a lot of money--a lot of money for any \nissue--but certainly a lot of money for training. But it is obviously \nabsolutely necessary if we are going to complete the job.\n  We are at a very critical crossroads in Afghanistan right now. The \nPresident has under consideration the issue of whether to call for \nadditional troops to be sent into Afghanistan. He is obviously weighing \nthat very heavily. While he should, I would hope he is going to make a \nvery quick decision on that particular issue. But whatever the decision \nis, and whenever he makes it, we know for a fact that the Afghan \nmilitary and the Afghan security police have to continue to receive the \ntraining our troops are providing for them today.\n  Let me just quote a couple of other statements from other very high-\nprofile individuals who are very knowledgeable and very thorough in \ntheir assessment of the situation with respect to the Afghan military \nand the Afghan security police. First of all, Admiral Mullen, during \ntestimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on September 15, \nsaid the following in response to Chairman Levin:\n\n       I share your view that larger and more capable Afghan \n     national security forces remain vital to that nation's \n     viability. We must rapidly build the Afghan army and police.\n\n  Senator Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, at \nthat same hearing stated:\n\n       We basically need a much larger Afghan army, much quicker. \n     That is the bottom line. That is the winning strategy.\n\n  Senator Lieberman said in July that the commitment to the expansion \nof Afghan forces ``is a decision that we have avoided making for far \ntoo long. Every day we continue to drag our feet and fail to commit to \nthe indigenous security forces hinders the fight against the extremists \nand delays the pullout of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.''\n  Lastly, the outgoing Supreme Allied Commander for Europe--the \nSACEUR--GEN John Craddock, said during his testimony this summer:\n\n       I don't think the intent there is to ever occupy and stay. \n     The key, as has been pointed out, is the enabling of \n     development of the Afghan national security forces. As the \n     SACEUR for the last 2\\1/2\\ years, I repeatedly told NATO \n     nations the very first thing we need are more trainers for \n     the army and the police, particularly the police.\n\n  Madam President, what this amendment does is add $900 million \nbasically back to the top line. The reason we can do that is that under \nthe appropriations bill, as has been passed, and as compared to the \nPresident's budget and the budget passed here, this bill is about $3.5 \nbillion under the budget. So there is room to add this $900 million \nback in to make sure we are giving the Afghan people the ability to \nprotect themselves from external forces as well as the ability to \nprotect themselves from dangers within their own country.\n  Last, let me say the President has been very critical of the \nreduction of this $900 million. In the statement of administration \npolicy, or the SAP that was put out on the 25th of September, here is \nwhat the President said:\n\n       The administration opposes the reduction of $900 million \n     for ANSF sustainment. Accelerating the growth in size and \n     capability of the Afghanistan National Security Forces is a \n     key component of the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. The \n     President's full request reflects his commanders' plan for \n     Afghan forces to assume a greater share of responsibility for \n     security as quickly as possible.\n\n  Simply stated, it is critically important that this training proceed \nat a very rapid pace. In order to do that, we have to resource the \ntraining that our troops are doing today and we will need to continue \nto do over the next fiscal year.\n  I ask this amendment be called up at the appropriate time for a vote \nby this body and that our colleagues will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me first comment on the comments \nmade by the Senator from Georgia, because I was privileged to be in \nAfghanistan several years ago with the Oklahoma 45th, which actually \ntook a great responsibility in the training over there and also turning \nover some of the training to the Afghans. They have done a good job, \nbut as the Senator pointed out, this takes resources and it takes \nequipment and it takes money. I applaud him and join him in this effort \nto provide the resources necessary to make that happen.\n  Let me make a couple of comments. We will have some amendments coming \nup concerning the C-17. I wish to share maybe an opposing view to some \nof the things we have heard. I was deeply distressed, I guess it was in \nApril, when we got the defense portion of the President's budget and \nthe termination of such programs as the F-22, next generation bombers, \nthe Future Combat System, and particularly doing away with our \ncommitment to Poland and the Czech Republic to have an opportunity \nthere to knock down a missile, an ICBM coming to the United States from \nIran, when we know they should be having that capability by around \n2015.\n  Today I want to mention a couple of things about the C-17. The Air \nForce budget justification documents state:\n\n       The C-17 can perform the entire spectrum of airlift \n     missions and is specifically designed to operate effectively \n     and efficiently in both strategic and theater environments.\n\n  I can remember when the first C-17 came in. The training takes place \nactually in my State of Oklahoma at Altus Air Force Base, and in 1995, \nit was the spring of 1995, the first C-17 swept into Altus Air Force \nBase. At that time the chief was General Fogleman, and I was honored to \naccompany him and actually sit in the right seat and see what this new \nspectacular airplane was.\n  We never dreamed at that time we would have the use of the C-17 to \nthe extent we did in Bosnia and Kosovo, missions we did not dream at \nthat time we would have to be confronted with.\n  Every time you watch the news or see a disaster or emergency of some \ntype anywhere in this Earth where our military is involved, you are \ngoing to see the C-17. The country and its military must be able to \nengage globally, and the C-17 enables that engagement.\n  In my 22 years on the Hill, I have seen our airlift requirements \nincrease, not decrease. I have had experience. Sometimes you talk about \na system, a platform such as the C-17. Our dealing\n\n[[Page S10031]]\n\nwith that doesn't happen in a vacuum. Right now we have other lift \nvehicles. We have the C-130s, better ones, the C-130Js and the C-130Es, \nwhich are getting old and outdated. I actually had two experiences on \ntwo of my trips coming into and out of Baghdad. One experience was when \nwe actually lost not one engine but two engines. We are talking about \nsome pretty old, beat-up E models that should not be flying right now.\n  The very next trip, I remember, was the first trip of our recently \nretired Senator from Florida when we actually received some SAM \nactivity. We had to fire the flares. The reason we did, it was 8 \nminutes after taking off from Baghdad and the engines should have had \nus out of SAM's range. However, the E models are getting old and tired. \nSo it is life threatening. I say that even though I am here to talk \nabout C-17s.\n  We can absorb a lot of deficiencies we have in other areas by \nincreasing our number of C-17s. Currently it is the only aircraft \ncapable of performing every airlift mission, whether ferrying troops \nand supplies to remote airfields overseas or returning wounded \nservicemembers back home.\n  The Congressional Research Service has indicated that the C-17 was \ndesigned to fly 1,000 hours a year over 30 years. However, as our \noverseas commitments have grown since 2001, the fleet has averaged \n1,250 hours per year instead of 1,000 hours a year. Some aircraft have \neven reached as high as 2,400 hours in a single year.\n  A November 2008 GAO study stated the C-17:\n\n       --production line is currently scheduled to close in \n     September 2010 with the supplier base and portions of the \n     line closing sooner.\n\n  The study concludes that:\n\n       Analysis indicates that once closed it would not be \n     feasible or cost effective to restart the production due to \n     the costs for hiring and training a new workforce, \n     reinstalling tooling, and reestablishing the supply base.\n\n  That is what the study concluded. The GAO estimates that restarting \nthe line could cost up to $1 billion.\n  This is something we are always concerned with when you talk about \naltering the life of a particular platform, but this is one I don't see \nhow we can get along without. I know we have the C-5. I remember the \nold C-141--a lot of lift capacity--a lot of tired C-130s, but the prize \nof all these capabilities is the C-17. While the administration objects \nto funding 10 additional C-17s based on 205 C-17s and the existing \nfleet of C-5 aircraft, the Air Force has cut the number of C-5s it \nplans to fully modernize by more than half because of substantial cost \nincreases in the modernization efforts. In testimony to the House Armed \nServices Committee in May of 2009, the Air Force said it will fully \nmodernize only 52 of the 40-year-old C-5s.\n  While we are upgrading some of these aircraft, some of these, \nspecifically the C-5A, had to be retired. However, this Congress, by \nbill language, is preventing the Air Force from retiring any of the C-\n5s. In terms of cost, the GAO calculated ``the DOE would need to fully \nmodernize 7 C-5s to obtain the equivalent capability achieved from \nacquiring 1 C-17 and the costs would be 3 times more.''\n  It found the unit cost of modernizing one C-5 is $132 million, while \nthe unit cost of one new C-17 is $267 million.\n  To put it another way, it would take seven modernized C-5s to provide \nthe capability equivalent to one new C-17, or $924 million worth of \nwork on modernizing the C-5 to provide the capability equivalent to \nprocuring one additional new C-17 at $276 million. I am hoping when \nthis issue does come up we will have a chance to think that through.\n  I would say this: Even if we were inclined to do that, to go along \nwith the smaller number, it would seem to me that we should not be \ndoing that until we have the Quadrennial Defense Review and the \nupcoming Mobility Capability and Requirements Study. It is my \nunderstanding these would come sometime early in 2010. I suggest we at \nleast wait until we have the benefit of that report before taking such \ndrastic action.\n\n  Let me mention one other thing that happened last night, for \nclarification. At midnight last night the highway program of the \nAmerican people suffered a major loss because of a calculated decision \nthat politics should trump common sense.\n  I have often thought that congressional inaction is a good thing \nsometimes, but in this case we failed miserably to do our job. As a \nresult, we are unable to pass the 3-month extension of the highway \nprogram that Senator Boxer and I were pushing. It is very interesting \nwhen you have a combination such as that. Senator Boxer is a very proud \nliberal Democrat, I am a very proud conservative Republican, and we \nboth agree one of the major functions of government is infrastructure, \nand right now we have a crumbling infrastructure. So our failure to \nwork together to fix the rescission, which was $8.7 billion of highway \nmoney, before midnight yesterday has resulted in the following: Up to \n17,000 jobs could be lost because States may be forced to cancel $500 \nmillion worth of projects. We are now stuck with a 30-day extension \nthat cuts highway spending by 25 percent compared to 2009. The 3-month \nextension would have funded the 2010 equal to 2009.\n  The short length of this extension is now going to create uncertainty \nand erratic funding for States that are going to delay projects and \ngear down the letting of contracts.\n  I have to say this, too. There will be contracts, due to this 25-\npercent reduction, that are going to have to be defaulted. There are \ngoing to be lawsuits. There will be all kinds of problems that will \nresult from this. It is not just my State of Oklahoma. I am sure the \nState of Alabama and other States have a crumbling infrastructure that \nneeds to be addressed.\n  I was on the phone with Gary Ridley, who was our highway director for \nmany years, and I always said he was the best highway director in the \ncountry. He is now Oklahoma's transportation secretary. He gave me the \nimpact of our failure to act, just on my State of Oklahoma. He said we \nwould normally receive $53.6 million of Federal money but instead are \nlikely only to receive $36 million. That is the 25-percent reduction. \nThey have a $28 million bond obligation which leaves them only about $8 \nmillion for letting projects, instead of $26 million. This means that \nthey will likely only be able to let three or four projects in \nNovember, the first letting of the year, and probably none in December. \nThat is my guess. That was his guess.\n  Here is the real-world impact of what we do here. This will be \ndevastating for construction workers in Oklahoma and will be repeated \nin every State. This may come as a surprise to those in the other body \nwho have said that this will have no effect on States. They are the \nones over there in the House who have made it impossible for us to send \nsomething over there and get it complied with. I have been trying to \npass a long-term extension with rescission fix since July. At that time \nopposition from Congressmen and Senators from both sides of the aisle \nprevented taking care of the problem.\n  Our attempts to set a prudent length for highway extension has been \nplagued by some people's unrealistic expectation that we can complete a \n6-year transformational highway bill and plug a $150 billion shortfall \nin the next 3 months if we ``keep the pressure'' on. We do not even \nhave the 3 months now, as of midnight last night. We are looking at 30 \ndays, so it obviously cannot be done. We may have to repeat what we did \na few years ago. Between the years of 2003 and 2005 we had a series of \nshort-term extensions where you can't do any funding, planning in \nadvance. That is kind of where we are today.\n  I was proud to be the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee in 2005 when we had a very robust transportation \nreauthorization bill.\n  Taking up an extension is always problematic. Unfortunately, some \nview this as an opportunity to make a point. There are those on my side \nof the aisle who will not hesitate to hold the entire highway program \nhostage in order to enumerate yet again their distaste for \ncongressionally directed spending on highway projects. At the same \ntime, the majority leadership has known for months this was coming but \nwas unable to force the issue and take the time to have votes on this \nimportant issue. This could have been resolved weeks ago if they had \nbeen invested in it.\n  Fixing the rescission would increase the deficit by just under $500 \nmillion.\n\n[[Page S10032]]\n\nThis is very significant. The other body wanted an offset for this, and \nthey were right. So did I. I wanted an offset. I think the most \nreasonable offset is the unused stimulus funds. I have stated all along \nthat there was not enough there in the stimulus bill to actually \nstimulate the economy. In fact, I had amendments during the debate on \nthe stimulus bill that would almost triple the amount of money that \nwould go into highway construction. Those are real jobs. That would be \nvery meaningful. But according to CBO's most recent analysis that was \ndone a month ago, only $85 billion of stimulus funds has actually been \nspent. Furthermore, less than 60 percent of the stimulus funds has even \nbeen obligated, leaving $150 billion in unobligated balances.\n  Money being unobligated means they do not have a plan for how they \nare going to spend it and are now nowhere near doing so.\n  This is clearly not stimulating the economy. It makes sense to move a \nfraction of this money to something that will actually save jobs--in \nthis case, 17,000 jobs we can identify. It is something that would \nstimulate the economy and give us something at the end of the day for \nour money. It is a perfect source to pay for fixing the rescission.\n  In fact, Senator Vitter's approach from last July was to actually \ngive President Obama's OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, the \ndiscretion to pick which stimulus funds would be cut. So he did not \ncare which ones were cut; just we need to put these stimulus funds to \nwork to create jobs. So they couldn't cut the things that were not \nworking or were just congressional pet programs. This is simply cutting \nthe worst 1 percent of the stimulus--something everybody should be able \nto agree to whether or not you voted for the stimulus, which I did not. \nBut the other side blocked this approach in a show of partisanship. So \nSenator Boxer and I brokered a bipartisan agreement to use TARP funds, \nthe Troubled Asset Relief Program. To me, this made sense because this \nwould have offset the amount of money that would be lost in the \nrescission fix, as a way of doing it, and it would have actually taken \ncare of the problem.\n  Some people thought this would have somehow affected the deficit, but \nit would not. It meant we would reduce TARP authority by $8.7 billion, \nwhich would reduce the deficit by $4.35 billion, according to CBO. \nPutting aside politics, penciling this out shows that $4.35 billion in \ndeficit reduction, minus the cost of the rescission--$500 million--\nmeans a deficit savings of just under $4 billion. I thought this was a \ngood thing. We would preserve up to 17,000 jobs and reduce the \ndeficit--clearly a win-win solution, I thought. I thought this up until \nlate last night because I thought we were going to be able to do it. \nBut there were objections.\n  We reduced funding for a program that was a bad idea from the \ninception. I opposed it initially. We are talking about TARP. I voted \nagainst it. A lot of those people who are complaining about the amount \nof money being spent voted for a $700 billion bailout, as it has been \nreferred to. But I did not. I opposed it. Some people supported it, \nthinking the government buying so-called toxic assets was necessary. \nBut then, when this money was given to unaccountable bureaucrats, it \nwas used for buying insurance companies, car companies, and bailing out \nbanks.\n  But some of my conservative colleagues opposed this approach because \nthey want to use TARP money for debt reduction. I agree with that. As I \npointed out, the compromise Senator Boxer and I were pushing would have \nresulted in a net reduction of the deficit of about $4 billion.\n  Even as I say this, I honestly don't understand their opposition. \nThose who talk about using TARP funds were willing to stimulate the \nfunds, but the Democrats refused to do that. So we came up with another \nidea: Let's go ahead and use stimulus funds. If we used stimulus funds, \nI tought that would have overcome the objections that were on the floor \nlast night, and I thought that was a good idea. Unfortunately, the \nDemocrats did not want to do that.\n  So I think we have tried. I think it kind of demonstrates that it is \na serious problem. We had a fix, and the Republicans and the Democrats \nwere equally responsible for not getting it. Now we are going to pay \nthe price. I don't know that the problem is worse in Oklahoma. It is \nprobably not. It is about the same throughout the Nation. But speaking \nnow as a conservative, one who is always ranked in the top two or three \nconservatives, I have always felt conservatives can be big spenders in \nsome areas. One is defending America, as I talked about a few minutes \nago, and the other is in our infrastructure. That is a function our \ngovernment is supposed to perform.\n  So I think we failed last night. Hopefully, we will find some way to \novercome this problem and get back on track.\n  I thank Senator Boxer and Secretary LaHood. They both tried very \nhard. We talked and worked for many hours. There are countless others \non both sides of the aisle who worked together and tried to fix this \nproblem. We didn't do it. Let's hope we can do it shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Iran and North Korea continue to pose a threat to our \nNation and our allies because of their intense efforts at ballistic and \nnuclear development. My amendment before the Senate now supplements the \ncommittee's additional $50 million for ground-based midcourse defense.\n  The amendment before the Senate is simple. It requires the Missile \nDefense Agency to conduct two reports related to the ground-based \nmidcourse defense. We need to know the agency's plan for the ground-\nbased interceptor funds in this bill before us. This report would \nprovide further details into exactly what that plan is. I believe this \nis imperative. Congress and our Nation must fully understand how the \nMissile Defense Agency will utilize this critical capability for our \nNation. The second report asks the Missile Defense Agency to outline \nthe acquisition strategy for the ground-based midcourse defense system \nover the next 6 years from fiscal year 2011 to 2017.\n\n[[Page S10033]]\n\n  North Korea and Iran will continue their ballistic efforts, and I \nbelieve we must be able to counter those threats.\n  In its budget request for the year 2010, the administration proposed \nseveral funding cuts and eliminations impacting our national missile \ndefense, including a $700 million reduction to GMD. I appreciate \nChairman Inouye and Ranking Member Cochran including an additional $50 \nmillion in the bill before the Senate for GMD, which will hopefully \nkeep our GBI production line from going cold.\n  Yet the threat is not diminishing. We must have a plan for countering \nnations that threaten our security. We need to know the Missile Defense \nAgency's plan for this fiscal year as well as the next years. Our \nenemies are still our enemies, and now so more than ever we should be \ncognizant of the fact that Iran and North Korea are working hard at \ntechnological advancement designed to destroy us and our allies.\n  Despite nearly unanimous opposition in the international community, \nIran has pressed on with nuclear ambitions and has shown no intention \nthat I have known of abandoning this reckless path. Every day, Iran \ncontinues to add to the thousands of centrifuges it already has to \nenrich its uranium. It continues to test its ballistic missiles. In \nfact, the International Atomic Energy Association recently released a \nreport stating that Iran is now working to conjoin ballistic and \nnuclear capabilities. I believe we need an integrated, layered national \nmissile defense to deter this threat, and we need it now.\n  Moving forward, I hope that the Missile Defense Agency will ensure \nour Nation's production line for ground-based interceptors and that \ntheir subsystems and components will not die on the vine if we ever \nhave to meet this threat.\n  The ground-based midcourse defense system and the interceptors in \nparticular are valuable national assets. And I will continue to work \nwith Chairman Inouye, Senator Cochran, and others on the Appropriations \nDefense Subcommittee to ensure that we have here in the United States a \nrobust national missile defense system.\n  It is my understanding in talking to the chairman that this amendment \nhas been agreed to by Senator Inouye and Senator Cochran. I hope they \nwill adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in recent weeks there has been some \ndiscussion about what types of organizations might or might not receive \nFederal funding. I think that is a very appropriate discussion for this \nlegislation which obviously expends many hundreds of billions of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  One of the concerns I have is that a number of the largest defense \ncontractors in this country, it turns out, over a period of years, \nhave, time after time, been involved in illegal behavior. I think the \nAmerican people and the taxpayers of this country want to know how it \nhappened that year after year we continued to do business, to the tune \nof tens and tens of billions of dollars, with large corporate \ninterests--in this case, defense contractors--that were then found \nguilty of defrauding the American people. How many times do you have to \nbe found guilty before we say enough is enough? Let me give you a few \nexamples--really, quite a few--of what I am talking about.\n  According to the Project on Government Oversight, the three largest \ngovernment contractors--Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman--\nhave a history riddled with fraud and other illegal behavior. Combined, \nthese companies, these three companies, have engaged in 109 instances \nof misconduct since 1995 and have paid fees and settlements totaling \nover $2.9 billion. Despite this history, these organization received \nover $77 billion in government contracts in 2007 alone.\n  Let me repeat. Three major defense contractors--Lockheed Martin, \nBoeing, and Northrop Grumman--have engaged, combined, in 109 instances \nof misconduct since 1995 and have paid fees and settlements totaling \n$2.9 billion. This is not a videotape on a TV show having some people \nsay stupid things. These are people who have been found guilty of \ndefrauding the taxpayers of this country and have paid fees and \nsettlements totaling $2.9 billion.\n  Let me give you some specificity here.\n  The largest contractor, Lockheed Martin, has engaged in 50 instances \nof misconduct since 1995, paying fines and settlements totaling $577 \nmillion. Yet in 2007 it still received $34 billion of government \ncontracts.\n  According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, in 2008 Lockheed Martin \nSpace Systems Company paid $10.5 million to settle charges that it \ndefrauded the government by submitting false invoices for payment on a \nmultibillion-dollar contract connected to the Titan IV space launch \nvehicle program.\n  According to the Department of Justice, in 2003 Lockheed Martin paid \n$38 million to resolve allegations that it fraudulently inflated the \ncosts of performing several Air Force contracts for the purchase and \nnavigation and targeting pods for military jets.\n  In 2001, Lockheed Martin paid $8.5 million to settle criminal charges \nthat it lied about its costs when negotiating contracts for the repair \nand restoration of radar pedestals installed in U.S. warships, costing \nthe Navy millions of dollars, also according to the Department of \nJustice.\n  But this behavior is not unique to Lockheed Martin. Boeing, the \nworld's leading aerospace company and the largest manufacturer of \ncommercial jetliners and military aircraft, has engaged in 31 instances \nof misconduct since 1995 and paid $1.5 billion in fines and \nsettlements.\n  I know people here have expressed concerns about what one group did \nin, clearly, stupid behavior. But what about a company such as Lockheed \nMartin which has paid $8.5 million to settle criminal charges? What \nabout companies such as Boeing which has engaged in 31 instances of \nmisconduct since 1995 and paid $1.5 billion in fines and settlements? \nIn 2000, for example, according to the Department of Justice, Boeing \nagreed to pay $54 million to settle charges that it defrauded the Army \nby selling it more than 140 helicopters containing defective gears, \nputting the lives of the men and women in the Air Force in danger. \nThese defective gears resulted in the deaths of at least five \nservicemen. We are not talking ACORN here. We are talking about $54 \nmillion to settle charges and actions that may have resulted in the \ndeath of at least five servicemen. How many years does this have to go \non before we begin to deal with it? In 2007, Boeing received $24 \nbillion in Federal contracts.\n  Finally, Northrop Grumman, the third largest contractor, has a \nsimilar history, with 27 instances of fraud totaling $790 million over \nthe past 15\n\n[[Page S10034]]\n\nyears. In 2003, according to the Project on Government Oversight, \nNorthrop Grumman paid $111.2 million to settle charges that a \nsubsidiary overcharged the United States on government contracts; i.e, \nripping off the taxpayers. According to the Department of Justice, the \nNorthrop Grumman subsidiary engaged in five separate schemes that \nincreased the cost the Government paid for space projects.\n  Also in 2003, according to the Department of Justice, Northrop \nGrumman paid the United States $80 million to settle charges that it \novercharged the government and knowingly installed substandard parts in \ntarget drones designed for the Navy.\n  Over and over and over again, year after year after year, the largest \ndefense contractors engage in illegal activity to rip off the taxpayers \nand, in some instances, put in danger the lives of the men and women in \nthe Armed Forces.\n  These are only a few snapshots of what appears to be a culture of \nfraud and entitlement within the military contracting community. We owe \nit to taxpayers to begin to get to the bottom of the situation. To \nreform the culture of greed, of illegal behavior, we have to expose it \nfirst. For that reason, I am offering an amendment under which the \nSecretary of Defense would calculate the total amount of money that \ngoes to companies that have engaged in fraud against the United States \nand then make recommendations about how to penalize repeat offenders. \nWe have an expression when we deal with criminal justice. We say: Three \nstrikes, you are out.\n  A lot of these guys are getting a lot more than three strikes. They \nkeep striking out and they come back and get lucrative defense \ncontracts. How many times do they have to strike out?\n  I hope very much this study will be a first step in the process of \ncleaning up the world of defense contracting. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work to make absolutely sure the money we have set aside \nfor our national defense is, in fact, spent on national defense, on \nprotecting the men and women who bravely serve us in the Armed Forces \nand is not frittered away on fraudulent bids, illegal behavior, and \nwasteful projects.\n  I hope very much that when the amendment comes up, we will have \nbipartisan support. I cannot understand why anybody would be opposed to \nhaving us finally address this outrage. I hope the Senate will pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I support the Sanders amendment and thank \nhim for his good work on these issues.\n  I come to the floor pretty often to share letters from people in my \nState. As the Presiding Officer receives letters from New Hampshire, I \nget letters from people in Ohio who are increasingly dissatisfied not \nwith their health care from the doctor and hospital but with the \ninsurance system and what has happened to so many people who were \ngenerally satisfied with their insurance until they got sick and their \ninsurance wasn't as good as the insurance company had promised. I would \nlike to share four letters I have received today from people in my \nState.\n  Alan from Logan County in northwest Ohio, northwest Columbus, writes:\n\n       A few years ago, my 57-year-old diabetic sister was found \n     in a diabetic coma by co-workers. She had ``good'' insurance \n     and spent two weeks in the ICU and, thereafter, spent weeks \n     in the regular hospital unit for care and [rehabilitation]. \n     Her doctors indicated that she needed to remain in the \n     hospital for another month and then be transferred to a \n     nursing home for further rehab, even while she was unable to \n     walk. A few days after receiving her doctor's care plan, I \n     was notified by the hospital that my sister was being \n     released the next day because the insurance company denied \n     further payments to the hospital. I drove to the hospital, \n     wheeled her to my car, brought her home where she was \n     bedridden for the next several months. She eventually \n     recovered, but suffered nerve damage and is permanently \n     disabled and unable to walk again.\n\n  Alan's sister is another victim of a health care system where someone \nthought she had good insurance and got a very expensive illness and, as \na result, her insurance was taken away. What that did was cost her her \nhealth because she didn't get the rehabilitation her doctor knew she \nneeded. That kind of tragedy should not happen in the richest country \nin the world. It should not happen when somebody such as Alan's sister \nplays by the rules, works hard, and has decent insurance but not as \ngood insurance as she thought she had.\n  One of the most important things our bill will do is enact insurance \nreform. No more denial of care for preexisting conditions, no more \ndenial of care because it got too expensive when someone got sick and \ntheir policy was rescinded. ``Rescission'' is the technical term the \ninsurance company uses. No more will someone be discriminated against \nbecause of gender or geography or disability. At the same time, we are \nintroducing the public option in our legislation that will keep the \ninsurance companies more honest, that will inject competition so people \ncan choose the public option or they can choose CIGNA or Aetna or, in \nOhio, Medical Mutual, any one of these, but the public option will keep \nthe insurance companies a bit more honest.\n  Becky from Cincinnati on the Ohio River writes:\n\n       As a veteran, I get great health care through the VA \n     system. But my story is about my daughter. She works for a \n     small company who pays for her family's insurance. But their \n     plan doesn't cover emergency care and the yearly deductible \n     is so high they might as well not have health insurance at \n     all. They would like to have another child, but they don't \n     think they can afford the cost of pregnancy alone [because of \n     inadequate insurance]. I'm glad health care reform won't take \n     away my benefits [with the VA], but what about my daughter \n     and her family?\n\n  Becky is exactly right. The VA system has the lowest rate of medical \nerrors in the country of any major health care system. The VA buys its \nprescription drugs at a third or half the cost most of us have to pay \nbecause they use the size of the purchasing pool of government to get \nmuch better deals from the drug companies. We have VA clinics in Ohio--\nin Zanesville and Mansfield and Parma and Lima and Findlay, all over \nthe State--community-based outreach clinics that matter for people's \ncare. At the same time, what our legislation will do is help small \nbusiness. Becky's daughter's employer probably wants to cover her and \ngive her better coverage: emergency care, maternity care, pregnancy \ncare. It doesn't because it is a small business and can't afford it. \nOur bill will give a tax credit to small businesses and will allow \nsmall businesses to pool with other employers so one particularly sick \npatient or sick employee doesn't shoot up prices so much that the \ninsurance company with the small business can't afford to provide \ninsurance for their employees. That is why this legislation makes so \nmuch sense for small business.\n  Kristin from Cuyahoga County writes:\n\n       My mother has stage 4 cancer and my father is a diabetic. \n     They have a $6,000 deductible; co-pays are $30-$50 a visit. \n     Last December, my mother was pushing for more chemo before \n     the first of the year. They met their deductible and she \n     wanted to get any treatment she could get prior to the end of \n     the year. Instead of her enjoying her limited time with us, \n     she is constantly worrying about the high deductible and \n     funeral costs. I am a nurse and [I] see the stress of the \n     health care costs and the impact it makes in a family's \n     financial situation is astounding. We need reform, reform, \n     reform.\n\n  Think about that. Kristin is a nurse. Kristin knows health care from \nthe inside out. Kristin's mother has cancer. Her father is diabetic. A \n$6,000 deductible hardly counts as insurance. The mother wants to get \nall the expensive care in December before the end of the year because \nshe has already paid the deductible, the $6,000 that year, but not have \nto get it at the beginning of the year because she can't afford another \n$6,000, not to mention the $30 to $50 out of pocket every visit.\n  My mother recently died in February. She had good health insurance. \nShe had a family who loved her and was with her during hospice home \ncare. I am sure Kristin's family is the same, but I also know it was \ntraumatic enough as a family for my 88-year-old mother who was sick to \nnot have to worry about the funeral costs and a high deductible. It is \noutrageous that this health care system doesn't take care of people \nbetter than that.\n\n[[Page S10035]]\n\n  Denise from Ashland, a town not far from my hometown of Mansfield in \nnorth-central Ohio, writes:\n\n       This past February, my husband was laid off from his job. \n     At the end of March our insurance through his employer was \n     canceled. In April we were forced to go onto COBRA which cost \n     us $800 a month. Thankfully, President Obama's plan helped \n     reduce that amount by nearly $300, but that won't last much \n     longer. It's been difficult to save money because since \n     April, I've had two major surgeries and now face higher co-\n     pays and medications. My husband is a diabetic and his \n     medicines are very costly. We are fighting foreclosure, our \n     budget is stretched, and we are considering dropping coverage \n     in October. What happens then?\n\n  Denise is in a situation that so many are in right now. Ohio's \nunemployment rate is over 10 percent. Denise's situation is similar to \nmany. Her husband lost his job and his insurance was dropped, although \nhe was able to keep the insurance through COBRA. But when you have \nCOBRA, it is very expensive because you are paying your own part of the \ninsurance that you paid as an employee and you are also paying the \nemployer's part of the insurance. It is a good program, but not many \npeople can afford it. President Obama and all of us together in the \nstimulus bill passed earlier in the year provided some subsidies for \npeople who use COBRA, but that will not last forever, as Denise pointed \nout. Under our legislation, people would not see their insurance run \nout. People, depending on their income, at a certain price will be able \nto buy insurance and keep that insurance regardless of whether they \nlose their job. Life is traumatic enough for people when the major \nbreadwinner loses his or her job. Losing your insurance at the same \ntime, with all the other problems that come--potential foreclosure, the \nstretching of the budget, generally--is so unfair for those who have \nworked so hard, paid taxes, been good citizens, and lived by the rules.\n  That is why I think our legislation is so important. I expect the \nbill will be voted out of the Finance Committee in the next week or \nso--maybe even this week. We will continue to fight for the public \noption, which certainly a majority of the Senate supports. A strong \nmajority of the House of Representatives supports the public option. A \nsurvey of doctors recently showed 70 percent of them in the country \nsupport a public option. Two-thirds of the voters consistently all year \nhave supported a public option.\n  A public option will make the insurance companies more honest. It \nwill inject competition into the system so people will have more \nchoices, not fewer choices such as the Republican opponents of the \npublic option want. They only want the insurance companies to be \nplayers in this, not any public agency that can compete in a Medicare-\nlike program that can compete with the private insurance companies. It \nwill help keep costs down so the insurance companies do not continue to \ncause the problems they do.\n  In addition, you are not going to see anybody denied who has a \npreexisting condition in the public option anymore than you are going \nto see somebody denied care because of a preexisting condition in \nMedicare. That is why this legislation is so important. That is why the \nversion of this bill that passed out of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee will serve the public. It will mean that people \nwho are happy with their insurance can keep it. It will mean if you are \nuninsured, you will get some assistance. It will mean consumer \nprotections so people will not be thrown off their insurance because of \nan expensive illness or because of discrimination. It will mean \nassistance for small business so employers can insure their employees, \nlike most employers want to do.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Commending the Lake Erie Crushers\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I rise to honor the Lake Erie Crushers, \nthe 2009 Frontier League Champions. While it looks like the Cleveland \nIndians will not be playing in October, the Lake Erie Crushers of Avon, \nOH, in which I live, will spend the month relishing their improbable \nrun to the championship in just their first year in the Frontier \nLeague.\n  The Crushers clinched the championship with a come-from-behind, 13-\nto-10 victory over the home team River City Rascals of O'Fallon, MO.\n  Despite being down two games to none in the best-of-five series, the \nCrushers demonstrated their resilience and composure to win three \nstraight games.\n  With clutch hitting from series MVP Andrew Davis, Arden McWilliams, \nTyler Johnson, Todd Balduf, and Eddie Tisdale, the Crushers put \ntogether a seven-run fifth inning outburst to help pitchers Paul Fagan \nand Cardoza Tucker clinch the championship.\n  During the celebration after the game, manager John Massareilli said \nthat ``doing this in year one, building a championship [team] from \nscratch, that's what made this so special.''\n  The Frontier League is made up of teams from across the heartland--in \nKalamazoo, Waterford, and Traverse City, MI; Washington, PA; \nEvansville, IN, Florence, KY; and the team I mentioned in Missouri.\n  Players in their early to mid twenties travel from town to town, \nchasing the dream of one day playing in the Major Leagues.\n  My wife and I are season ticket holders of the Crushers, and we have \nenjoyed cheering on our hometown team during their inaugural season. We \nare proud our community is home to the Crushers, where fans from across \nnortheast Ohio can travel down I-90 and Route 611 to root for a \nchampionship team.\n  I commend the dedicated fans, the outstanding players and coaches, \nand owner Steve Edelson for their commitment to our city--both on and \noff the field.\n\n[[Page S10036]]\n\n  I am pleased to honor the 2009 Frontier League Champions, the Lake \nErie Crushers from Avon, OH.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2598\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, it is tough to follow that act, but I \nask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and call \nup amendment No. 2598 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2598.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To acknowledge a long history of official depredations and \n all ill-conceived policies by the Federal Government regarding Indian \n  tribes and offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the \n                             United States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. APOLOGY TO NATIVE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Acknowledgment and Apology.--The United States, acting \n     through Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the special legal and political relationship \n     Indian tribes have with the United States and the solemn \n     covenant with the land we share;\n       (2) commends and honors Native Peoples for the thousands of \n     years that they have stewarded and protected this land;\n       (3) recognizes that there have been years of official \n     depredations, ill-conceived policies, and the breaking of \n     covenants by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes;\n       (4) apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States \n     to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, \n     maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by \n     citizens of the United States;\n       (5) expresses its regret for the ramifications of former \n     wrongs and its commitment to build on the positive \n     relationships of the past and present to move toward a \n     brighter future where all the people of this land live \n     reconciled as brothers and sisters, and harmoniously steward \n     and protect this land together;\n       (6) urges the President to acknowledge the wrongs of the \n     United States against Indian tribes in the history of the \n     United States in order to bring healing to this land; and\n       (7) commends the State governments that have begun \n     reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian tribes located \n     in their boundaries and encourages all State governments \n     similarly to work toward reconciling relationships with \n     Indian tribes within their boundaries.\n       (b) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this section--\n       (1) authorizes or supports any claim against the United \n     States; or\n       (2) serves as a settlement of any claim against the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, this is an amendment for which the \ncosponsors include the chairman of the committee and the chairman of \nthe Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Dorgan, as well. It is an \namendment that has been cleared through the authorizing committee a \nmultiple of times and it has been cleared through this body previously \nand we have cleared it on both sides of the aisle.\n  With the passage of this amendment, we officially apologize for the \npast ill-conceived policies by the U.S. Government toward the Native \nPeoples of this land and reaffirm our commitment toward healing our \nNation's wounds and working toward establishing better relationships \nrooted in reconciliation.\n  Apologies are often times difficult, but like treaties, go beyond \nmere words and usher in a true spirit of reconciling past difficulties \nand help to pave the way toward a united future. Perhaps Dr. King said \nit best when he stated, ``The end is reconciliation, the end is \nredemption, the end is the creation of the beloved community.'' This is \nour goal, with this resolution today.\n  Native Americans have a vast and proud legacy on this continent. Long \nbefore 1776 and the establishment of the United States of America, \nNative peoples inhabited this land and maintained a powerful physical \nand spiritual connection to it. In service to the Creator, Native \npeoples sowed the land, journeyed it, and protected it. The people from \nmy State of Kansas have a similar strong attachment to the land.\n  Like many in my State, I was raised on the land. I grew up farming \nand caring for the land. I and many in my State established a \nconnection to this land as well. We care for our Nation and the land of \nour forefathers so greatly that we too are willing to serve and protect \nit, as faithful stewards of the creation with which God has blessed us. \nI believe without a doubt citizens across this great Nation share this \nsentiment and know its unifying power. Americans have stood side by \nside for centuries to defend this land we love.\n  Both the Founding Fathers of the United States and the indigenous \ntribes that lived here were attached to this land. Both sought to \nsteward and protect it. There were several instances of collegiality \nand cooperation between our forbears--for example, in Jamestown, VA, \nPlymouth, MA, and in aid to explorers Lewis and Clark. Yet, sadly, \nsince the formation of the American Republic, numerous conflicts have \nensued between our Government, the Federal Government, and many of \nthese tribes, conflicts in which warriors on all sides fought \ncourageously and which all sides suffered. Even from the earliest days \nof our Republic there existed a sentiment that honorable dealings and a \npeaceful coexistence were clearly preferable to bloodshed. Indeed, our \npredecessors in Congress in 1787 stated in the Northwest Ordinance:\n\n       ``The utmost good faith shall always be observed toward the \n     Indians.''\n\n  Today we live up to this goal, today we right a wrong that has been \ncommitted in this nation.\n  Many treaties were made between the U.S. Government and Native \npeoples, but treaties are far more than just words on a page. Treaties \nrepresent our word, and they represent our bond. Unfortunately, again, \ntoo often the United States did not uphold its responsibilities as \nstated in its covenants with Native tribes.\n  I have read all of the treaties in my State between the tribes and \nthe Federal Government that apply to Kansas. They generally came in \ntranches of three. First, there would be a big land grant to the tribe. \nThen there would be a much smaller one associated with some equipment \nand livestock, and then a much smaller one after that.\n  Too often, our Government broke its solemn oath to Native Americans. \nFor too long, relations between the United States and Native people of \nthis land have been in disrepair. For too much of our history, Federal \ntribal relations have been marked by broken treaties, mistreatment, and \ndishonorable dealings.\n  This amendment extends a formal apology from the United States to \nTribal Governments and Native peoples nationwide--something we have \nnever done; something we should have done years and years ago.\n  Further, this resolution will not resolve the many challenges still \nfacing Native Americans, nor will it authorize, support or settle any \nclaims against the United States. It doesn't have anything to do with \nany property claims against the United States. That is specifically set \naside and not in this bill. What this amendment does do is recognize \nand honor the importance of Native Americans to this land and to the \nUnited States in the past and today and offers an official apology for \nthe poor and painful path the U.S. Government sometimes made in \nrelation to our Native brothers and sisters by disregarding our solemn \nword to Native peoples. It recognizes the negative impact of numerous \ndestructive Federal acts and policies on Native Americans and their \nculture, and it begins--begins--the effort of reconciliation.\n  President Ronald Reagan spoke of the importance of reconciliation \nmany times throughout his Presidency. In a 1984 speech to mark the 40th \nanniversary of the day when the Allied armies joined in battle to free \nthe European Continent from the grip of the Axis powers, Reagan \nimplored the United States and Europe to ``prepare to reach out in the \nspirit of reconciliation.''\n  I do not pretend that this apology is a panacea, but perhaps it \nsignals the beginning of the end of division and a faint first light \nand first fruits of reconciliation and the creation of beloved \ncommunity Dr. King so eloquently described.\n  This is an apology and a resolution of reconciliation. It is a step \ntoward healing the wounds that have divided our country for so long--a \npotential foundation for a new era of positive relations between tribal \ngovernments and the Federal Government.\n  It is time, as I have stated, for us to heal our land of division, \nall divisions,\n\n[[Page S10037]]\n\nand bring us together and I am proud that today we are closer to that \ngoal.\n  Madam President, I understand the amendment has been cleared, and I \nask unanimous consent for its immediate adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. INOUYE. We support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2598) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for being willing to consider this \namendment in an expedited fashion, but it is actually an issue for \nwhich there have been hearings held, research done, and has been voted \non by this body over 5 years. So I am delighted we could move it on \nthrough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2571\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Byrd, I call up \namendment No. 2571 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Mr. Byrd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2571.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on the use by the Department of Defense \n    of live primates in training programs relating to chemical and \n                           biological agents)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Report on Use of Live Primates in Training \n     Relating to Chemical and Biological Agents.--Not later than \n     90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report setting forth a detailed \n     description of the requirements for the use by the Department \n     of Defense of live primates at the United States Army Medical \n     Research Institute of Chemical Defense, and elsewhere, to \n     demonstrate the effects of chemical or biological agents or \n     chemical (such as physostigmine) or biological agent \n     simulants in training programs.\n       (b) Elements.--The report required by subsection (a) shall \n     include, at a minimum, the following:\n       (1) The number of live primates used in the training \n     described in subsection (a).\n       (2) The average lifespan of primates from the point of \n     introduction into such training programs.\n       (3) An explanation why the use of primates in such training \n     is more advantageous and realistic than the use of human \n     simulators or other alternatives.\n       (4) An estimate of the cost of converting from the use of \n     primates to human simulators in such training.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, this amendment has been cleared by both \nsides, both leaders. It is a good amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthe amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2571) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2567\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to oppose the Barrasso \namendment No. 2567, which would ban funding to the CIA's new Center on \nClimate Change and National Security. I make these remarks as chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee and one who strongly supports the new \nClimate Change center at the CIA.\n  The Center on Climate Change and National Security that the CIA \nrecently established is fully consistent with the intelligence \ncommunity's mission of protecting the United States.\n  It is important to note what the Center will not do. It will not do \nthe science of climate change. It will not make judgments about how or \nwhether the climate is changing. It will not make judgments about why \nthe climate is changing. That work will be done where it belongs, with \nthe scientific community.\n  The Center will have three tasks. One, it will continue the decade-\nlong program of declassifying imagery for passage to climate change \nscientists.\n  Let me give you an example of some of that imagery. It is here on my \nright, as shown in these photographs. This is Barrow, AK. This is \nBarrow. This is the Chukchi Sea. As shown here, this is July of 2006. \nIn this picture, this is that same area in July of 2007. You see the \ndecomposition of the ice. They point out its variation by time and, \ntherefore, you can track the impact of the change brought about by \nglobal warming from our satellites. So our satellites are used to \nmeasure and predict change.\n  Here is another one. This is the Beaufort Sea in August of 2001. You \nsee the melt ponds in the center, and you see the ice. You see it \nhere--winter in August of 2007. This is from a satellite.\n  The third one is much more difficult to see, but it is the Bering \nGlacier in Alaska. Here it is in May of 2005. Here are the big chunks \nthat have broken off. Here they are there. As shown here, this is \nanother satellite photo of the Bering Glacier in Alaska.\n  The second task of the CIA Center on Climate Change and National \nSecurity will be to assess the plans and intentions of other countries, \nand it will help the administration design verification regimes for any \nclimate change treaties so policymakers can negotiate from a position \nof strength. This is, in fact, a traditional role for the intelligence \ncommunity on a wide range of foreign policy issues.\n  Thirdly, the Center on Climate Change and National Security will \nassess the national security implications of climate change, which many \nexperts believe will be significant. This will include assessing the \nnational security implications of increased competition for resources, \npopulation shifts, water shortages, changes in crop yields, and the \nspread of climate-sensitive diseases such as malaria.\n  This is the work that the IC is better positioned than anyone else in \nthe government to do and where CIA's contacts in the academic and think \ntank communities will pay big dividends.\n  On September 25, the CIA announced it was going to launch this new \ncenter and tackle the devastating long-term challenges that climate \nchange might present to our Nation's security. In other words, this \nwill give the intelligence community the opportunity to collect \ninformation and predict how change is going to affect certain \ncountries--the movement of populations, the devastation of crops, the \ndisappearance of water supplies--to be able to anticipate what impact \nthat will have on the Nation's policy and on our national security.\n  I have no doubt climate changes are going to have an impact on our \nNation's security. I also have no doubt our satellites can give us a \nvery positive--meaning in the sense of crisp and delineated--view of \nthese changes as our satellites track climate change across the years.\n  I believe very strongly the Center on Climate Change is warranted. I \nbelieve it will produce intelligence dividends for the Nation, and I \nbelieve it is entirely appropriate. Therefore, I would oppose the \nBarrasso amendment, which would effectively eliminate this new center.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I join the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia in opposing the Barrasso amendment.\n  The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency recently created the \nCenter for Climate Change and National Security. The mission of this \ncenter is fully consistent with the mission of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  The center has three main tasks. As pointed out by the Senator from \nCalifornia, the first is to continue the decades-long program of \ndeclassifying imagery for use by the scientific community. Second, the \ncenter will assess the plans and intentions of other countries and \nassist the administration to design verification regimes for any \nclimate change treaties so that policymakers can negotiate from a \nposition of strength. Third, as noted by the Senator from California, \nthis center will assess the national security implications of climate \nchange, which many\n\n[[Page S10038]]\n\nbelieve will be very significant. This will include assessing the \nnational security implications of increased competition for resources, \npopulation shifts, water shortages, changes in crop yields, and the \nspread of climate-sensitive diseases such as malaria.\n  This center will not work on the science of climate change. That work \nwill be done where it belongs--with the scientific community. This \ncenter will continue in the traditional role of the intelligence \ncommunity to support policymakers on a wide range of foreign policy \nissues.\n  Therefore, I join my colleague from California in urging my \ncolleagues to oppose the Barrasso amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I would like to say a few words on a few \nof the contentious issues before us.\n  The administration requested $7.4 billion for the Afghanistan \nsecurity forces fund in fiscal year 2010. This is an increase of $1.8 \nbillion over fiscal year 2009 levels. This is to continue to train and \nequip the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police.\n  The committee was informed by officials of the Department of Defense \nthat $1.8 billion of this request would not be spent until fiscal year \n2011. I would like to repeat that. This amount will not be spent until \n2011. And there was $1.9 billion remaining from the fiscal year 2009 \nappropriations.\n  At the same time, the committee was also aware of a validated urgent \nbut unfunded requirement from the Department of Defense for additional \nall-terrain MRAP vehicles for our troops in Afghanistan, something that \nthe military has been asking for with great urgency.\n  Recognizing that these funds would not be obligated until fiscal year \n2011--the funds I mentioned earlier--and were not required for long \nlead equipment of infrastructure projects, the committee transferred \n$900 million from the Afghan security forces fund to the MRAP fund to \npay for this urgent requirement.\n  The redirecting of funds was not an attempt to curtail our efforts to \ntrain and equip the Afghan security forces. It was solely based on the \nDepartment's ability to execute the required resources during fiscal \nyear 2010 and the urgent unfunded and validated requirement to procure \nadditional all-terrain MRAPs for our troops in Afghanistan.\n  There is a tremendous amount of debate in both the Halls of Congress \nand the Pentagon over the size of the Afghan security forces--how fast \nthey can be trained, equipped, and executing missions independent of \ncoalition forces.\n  While many would like to grow the Afghan security forces beyond the \ncurrent plan, the Department of Defense has not been able to say that \nthey can absorb additional resources in fiscal year 2010 or that they \ncan source additional trainers to reach these new levels. This is a \nsituation where, yes, we need the money, but we cannot spend it. We \nwant you to appropriate it so we can leave it in the bank. That is a \nhell of a way to run the government.\n  Since 2005, Congress has appropriated nearly $19 billion for the \ntraining and equipping of the Afghan security forces. These funds have \ngreatly increased over the years, starting from $1.3 billion in fiscal \nyear 2005 to $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2009 to $7.4 billion in fiscal \nyear 2010.\n  Of the $5.6 billion appropriated in the last fiscal year, nearly $1.9 \nbillion remains unobligated, and the Department of Defense does not \nanticipate obligating these funds until July of 2010.\n  The $7.4 billion fiscal year 2010 request for the Afghan security \nforces fund is projected to obligate $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2010 \nand $1.8 billion in the next fiscal year, 2011.\n  The Afghan security forces fund is a 2-year funding account to enable \nlong lead equipment procurement and infrastructure projects that \nobligate over a 2-year period. The funds transferred from the Afghan \nsecurity forces trust fund to meet the urgent operational requirement \nof additional all-terrain MRAPs for Afghanistan were taken from \nsustainment requirements of the Afghan National Army and the Afghan \nNational Police which would have been obligated in fiscal year 2011 and \ndo not require long lead appropriations. We took money they did not \nneed or can use.\n  Areas funded through the sustainment program include fuels, salary, \nincentive pay, clothing, individual equipment, rental equipment--all of \nwhich do not require long lead time. Therefore, the fiscal year 2010 \nsustainment request for the Afghan National Army is a 45-percent \nincrease over 2009 and a 108-percent increase over fiscal year 2009 for \nthe Afghan National Police.\n  Even with the decrease in this fund, there is substantial flexibility \nand resources in the Afghan security forces fund to meet unanticipated \nrequirements of the security forces and to expedite the growth of the \nAfghan National Army and Afghan National Police.\n  Madam President, I decided to share these numbers with my colleagues \nto make certain they know the committee has acted on this very \ncarefully. When we were convinced that the Department of Defense could \nnot use that money, we decided to use it for some other more urgent \npurpose.\n  I should point out once again this bill was passed by the committee, \nmade up of Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals, by a \nvote of 30 to 0. Unanimous.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nMcCaskill and DeMint be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 2560 to \nH.R. 3326, the 2010 Department of Defense Appropriations Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Youth Violence Pandemic\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, last Thursday, just outside of a Chicago \ncommunity center, a 16-year-old honor student was beaten to death. His \nname was Derrion Albert. There had been a shooting at the school \nearlier in the day. Afterwards, two rival groups of teens confronted \neach other in the street. Derrion was not a part of either group. He \njust happened to be passing in the area on his way home from school.\n  In the violent chaos of that confrontation, as other teenagers \npunched and kicked each other, young Derrion got caught in the middle. \nHe was beaten to death with railroad ties.\n  The shocking murder was caught on video. It is extremely difficult, \nMadam President, if you have watched that film clip. But when you see \nthis terrible scene unfold, you are struck by several things. No. 1, \nthis did not happen in some distant country; it happened in our \nbackyard, right outside of a community center on a populated street. It \ndid not even happen at night. Derrion was murdered in broad daylight \nwith people all around to witness the scene. And it did not happen to \nthem. It did not happen to people unlike ourselves. It happened to us. \nDerrion Albert could have been anybody's son, grandson, nephew, \nbrother, or friend.\n  Just the other night, in a different Chicago neighborhood, another \nyoung boy was beaten within inches of his life. This violence is not \nconfined to a single area or group of people. The problem is pervasive \nand it touches all of us.\n\n  It is tearing apart families, communities, and our own sense of \nsecurity. These acts are committed against our community by our \ncommunity. In the last school year alone, 36 Chicago students were shot \nto death. This number does not include those who survived shootings in \nother violence. That statistic would be far higher.\n  In the wake of last year's murders, the local government and Chicago \npolice tried to put a stop to the terrible cycle of violence. But now, \nonly a few weeks into the new school year, another young boy has been \ntaken from us.\n\n[[Page S10039]]\n\n  I am thankful the suspects in Derrion's murder have already been \narrested and charged with the crime. I am proud of the job our local \nlaw enforcement officers have done to make sure justice is served. But \nthat is not enough. That is just not enough. It will never be enough.\n  This problem is not unique to Chicago or Illinois. A national \npandemic of violence has taken hold in every major city across the \ncountry. We can no longer stand by as an entire generation of young men \nand women fall victim to these senseless crimes.\n  Government cannot do it all. Law enforcement can only do so much. \nThat is why it is time for us to stand together as a community and as a \nnation to end youth violence.\n  The old saying, ``It takes a village to raise a child,'' is very \ntrue. It takes a community to protect them. Our communities must take \nresponsibility for our youngsters. We cannot tolerate violence any \nlonger. Our parents must take ownership of their children and shoulder \nthe responsibility of steering them away from gangs and violence. We \ncannot stand by and hope this problem resolves itself. We cannot expect \nsomeone else to find a solution. It is time to join with one voice and \nsay: Enough is enough. This cannot stand. This cannot continue.\n  It is time to take back our streets, our schools, our community \ncenters, and our children. It is time for parents, teachers, neighbors, \nand friends to join with community leaders to put an end to the \nviolence. It means afterschool programs to keep kids involved and off \nthe streets. It means seeking opportunities for youth who are at risk. \nIt means being present in young peoples' lives. Ask if your son's \nhomework is done. See which school subject your daughter enjoys the \nmost. Encourage kids to continue their education, to play a sport, or \nto go out and get a part-time job if they can find it. Be a good role \nmodel for your children and your neighbor's children. Be involved, but \ndo not settle for the status quo. Do not let the young people of \nAmerica continue to cut each other down in the streets.\n  This will not go away on its own, and it is not someone else's \nproblem. This youth violence that has gone on in our country is our \nproblem, our future, and we must work together to solve it. The only \nway we are going to solve it is working together and recognizing that \nacross this country there is a problem with our young people, and we \ncan no longer tolerate that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, at this moment--and I repeat, at this \nmoment--there are 10 amendments ready for voting--10. I have been \nadvised that most of them will require rollcall votes. So may I advise \nmy colleagues to prepare themselves for a long evening.\n\n  In addition to that, there are 10 other amendments that we are in the \nprocess of discussing and negotiating which may require rollcall votes. \nSo this may be a long night.\n  The leadership has advised me that voting should begin in about 15 \nminutes, at 5:30. Since we have some time, and in anticipation that one \nof the amendments would be the one from the Senator from Oklahoma, I \nwish to say a few words about that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2569\n\n  Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma which seeks to increase the operation and maintenance funding \nby $294 million in the Department of Defense bill by reducing the funds \navailable for research and development activities by that same amount. \nI understand the Senator incorrectly assumes that the operation and \nmaintenance account is underfunded due to a change in current year \ninflation.\n  Economic recovery means that projected inflation is now higher than \nanticipated a few months ago. My colleague is correct that inflation \nassumptions have changed. However, the budget adjustment the Senator \nfinds objectionable does not only correct for the current year \ninflation; in fact, the committee reviews the historical price growth \nembedded in the budget baseline. Due to the recession, inflation in \nfiscal years 2008 and 2009 was below the levels built into the budget. \nTherefore, the fiscal year 2010 budget base was inflated over actual \nexperience. The bill before us adjusts for that baseline error.\n  The operation and maintenance title is fully funded to meet the \nDepartment's needs. There is no shortage. Let me repeat that: The O \naccount--or the operation and maintenance account--is fully funded. The \ncommittee is deeply concerned that the critical operational needs of \nour soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are financed. We want to be \ncertain that every member has the equipment, gear, training and support \nthey need. The bill meets these needs. And we fully fund family support \nprograms, base operations, and major equipment maintenance.\n  The proposed amendment would add $294 million in unneeded funds, an \naction that could promote waste and expenditures on low priority \nprograms. I note the amendment does not specify what program is \nunderfunded or would benefit from this transfer. This amendment would \nmove funds for unidentified purposes, which undermines the careful \nprogram-by-program review which the committee accomplished.\n  On the other hand, it unduly penalizes the resource and development \nactivities of the Department. The R title is already below the \nPresident's requested funding level. Research and development is the \nseed corn for the future. It is the basis of all the technological \nimprovements that have proved invaluable in making our fighting forces \nthe most capable in the world. This blunt axe approach to cut funds and \nundermine the future is uninformed, unexplained, and untargeted. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I have been advised that the statement I made that \nwe may begin voting at 5:30 has slightly changed. We will now begin \nvoting about 6 o'clock.\n  So may I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I think the leadership has been working \non some amendments and agreements. I don't think any of our amendments \nare going to come up for votes tonight, but I did want to take a couple \nof moments talking about several of them.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2560\n\n  One is a McCain amendment I am a cosponsor on, amendment No. 2560, on \ncompetitive bidding.\n  Every time we bring this amendment to the floor we get a side-by-side \namendment so everybody on the other side who does not want us to \ncompetitively bid earmarks can have cover to say they voted for \ncompetitive bidding. The fact is, in this bill are directed earmarks \nthat are not competitively bid to individuals and companies out there, \nfor specialization of what one Senator may want in their home State.\n  There is nothing wrong with wanting to help your home State. What is \nwrong is to not competitively bid. If it is something we need, why \nshouldn't we use a competitive bidding process to get the best quality \nand the best value for all this money we are going to spend?\n  We are going to see again on the McCain amendment the competitive \nbidding amendment--I have offered this on many of the appropriations \nbills we have--a side by side. America should not be fooled. If you do \nnot vote for the McCain amendment and you vote for the side by side, \nwhat you are saying is you still want your earmarks protected and not \ncompetitively bid. That is what it says.\n  I have another amendment that addresses earmarks. The problem with \nearmarks is it takes our eye off the ball. It is not they are not good \nideas, but we vote on bills on the basis of having an earmark in the \nbill rather than on the total bill and what is in the best interest of \nthe country, not our particular parochial State.\n  The competitive bidding amendment, when it has the side by side, what \nyou are going to see is you are going to see the true competitive \nbidding amendment defeated and the false competitive bidding amendment \nwin. That is\n\n[[Page S10040]]\n\nbecause if you count the number of Senators who actually have earmarks \nthat are not competitively bid, you get the majority of the Chamber. \nThat is true on every appropriations bill. So we will not ever pass it \nuntil the Members start thinking about the long term and what is best \nfor the country, rather than what is best for them. I thought that \nexplanation needed to be made.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2565\n\n  I also want to discuss for a moment an amendment, Amendment No. 2565, \na very simple amendment. We know the National Guard has gotten \nshortchanged a lot of times in terms of equipment. I don't think there \nis anything wrong with setting aside money for the National Guard. But \nthe way the bill is written is the chain of command in the U.S. \nGovernment, in terms of our military, will be excluded from the \ndecisions made on how to spend this $1.5 billion.\n  The Secretary of Defense, who is ultimately responsible for the \ndefense of the Nation--even though we use National Guard, and part of \nthis money is going to be used for our Army Reserve, a very small \namount--is not going to be able to have any input. The only people who \nare going to have input is the Appropriations Committee.\n  What that says is the American people are not going to get to know, \nwe are not going to have the judgment of the people with the best \nexperience to comment on it. I am not even saying they have to veto it. \nWhat we are saying is they have to be aware of it, they have to be part \nof the process. Yet they are not. So the more concern I have with our \namendment the more concern I have about what is happening with this \n$1.5 billion. My hope is we will eventually find out. We may not find \nout until after the $1.5 billion will have been spent. But the problem \nis will it be spent efficiently and properly for the National Guard and \nthe Reserve? The secrecy that shrouds this process is somewhat \nconcerning, and also the reaction that we would offer an amendment that \nsays we want somebody in the chain of command to be involved in this, \noutside just the Appropriations Committee and the individual guard \nunits.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2562\n\n  On another amendment, amendment No. 2562, other than national \nsecurity issues, why should not every report in this bill be made \navailable to every American? It is a real straightforward amendment. If \nwe want transparency in our Government, then the reports that do not \nhave anything to do with anything that would be a national security \nrisk, for example, ought to be made available to the other Senators in \nthe Chamber and the body as well as the American people. That is a \npretty hard amendment to say ``No, you don't,'' because there is not a \ngood defense to that if it is not related to a national security \nconcern, and, Americans--43 cents out of every dollar we are spending \nwe are borrowing from our grandkids. We ought to be proud to let them \nsee what we are doing with the money.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2569\n\n  Finally, I have an amendment that is a prohibition. We have this \noperation and maintenance account that has been robbed heartily for \nearmarks. I know I will never win the battle on earmarks. But should \nnot we say it comes from somewhere else, other than to fund the actual \nday-to-day operation and maintenance of our military? We have already \ncut into the amount of money that is in the O account because we are \nusing a false inflation number, to the tune of about $300 some odd \nmillion--$294 million. Shouldn't we say, if we are going to take that, \nlet's take it from somewhere else in the military rather than \noperations and maintenance? What is a greater priority than making sure \nthe troops on the ground have what they need on a timely basis?\n  It was just last year that the Navy ran out of O money. They \nrestricted flight training. They restricted training on the ships. We \nhad to pass an emergency supplemental because we did not authorize them \nenough, we didn't appropriate them enough money to adequately operate \nand maintain their force structure. Yet we have all this money, \nincluding other money that is related to other amendments, that comes \nout of their operation and maintenance account. If we want to do \nsomething that is outside the scope and outside what the military wants \nto have done, let's not make two wrongs. Let's not take the money from \nO What this amendment would do is simply prohibit any directed \nearmark from coming from O funds.\n  Our military needs us to be efficient. I think overall on this bill \nthe appropriators have done a good job. I think there is tons of waste \nwe could get out of the Defense Department. I think it is about $50 \nbillion a year that we could actually squeeze, which would make plenty \nof money for earmarks, it wouldn't hurt operation and maintenance, yet \nwe will not have the oversight, we will not do the things that are \nnecessary to lessen the waste that is in the military. My hope is, as \nwe come back next week--I notice we are going to have a couple of votes \nhere in a little while; not on these amendments. No. 1, my hope is the \nAmerican people will let us know about priorities and what we ought to \nbe doing. I think these are straightforward amendments.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2621, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask the pending amendment be set \naside and that my amendment No. 2621, as modified, at the desk, be \ncalled up, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2621, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate on Joint STARS re-\n                               engining)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  (A) FINDINGS.--THE SENATE MAKES THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS.\n\n       (1) Real time intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance (ISR) is critical to our warfighters in \n     fighting the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       (2) Secretary of Defense Gates and the military leadership \n     of the United States have highlighted the importance of \n     collecting and disseminating critical intelligence and \n     battlefield information to our troops on the ground in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan.\n       (3) The Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Norton \n     Schwartz, has stated that the Air Force is ``all-in'' for the \n     joint fight.\n       (4) One of the most effective and heavily tasked \n     intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets \n     operating today is the Air Force's E-8C Joint Surveillance \n     Target Attack Radar System, also known as Joint STARS.\n       (5) Commanders in the field rely on Joint STARS to give \n     them a long range view of the battlefield and detect moving \n     targets in all weather conditions as well as tactical support \n     to Brigade Combat Teams, Joint Tactical Air Controllers and \n     Special Operations Forces convoy overwatch.\n       (6) Joint STARS is a joint platform, flown by a mix of \n     active duty Air Force and Air National Guard personnel and \n     operated by a joint Army, Air Force, and Marine crew, \n     supporting missions for all the Armed Forces.\n       (7) With a limited number of airframes, Joint STARS has \n     flown over 55,000 combat hours and 900 sorties over Iraq and \n     Afghanistan and directly contributed to the discovery of \n     hundreds of Improvised Explosive Devices.\n       (8) The current engines greatly limit the performance of \n     Joint STARS aircraft and are the highest cause of maintenance \n     problems and mission aborts.\n       (9) There is no other current or programmed aircraft or \n     weapon system that can provide the detailed, broad-area \n     ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and airborne battle \n     management support for the warfighter that Joint STARS \n     provides.\n       (10) With the significant operational savings that new \n     engines will bring to the Joint STARS, re-engining Joint \n     STARS will pay for itself by 2017 due to reduced operations, \n     sustainment, and fuel costs.\n       (11) In December 2002, a JSTARS re-engining study \n     determined that re-engining provided significant benefits and \n     cost savings. However, delays in executing the re-engining \n     program continue to result in increased costs for the re-\n     engining effort.\n       (12) The budget request for the Department of Defense for \n     fiscal year 2010 included $205,000,000 in Aircraft \n     Procurement, Air Force, and $16,000,000 in Research, \n     Development, Test, and Evaluation, Air Force for Joint STARS \n     re-engining.\n\n[[Page S10041]]\n\n       (13) On September 22, 2009, the Department of Defense \n     reaffirmed their support for the President's Budget request \n     for Joint STARS re-engining.\n       (14) On September 30, 2009, The Undersecretary of Defense \n     (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) signed an \n     Acquisition Decision Memorandum directing that the Air Force \n     proceed with the Joint STARS re-engining effort, to include \n     expenditure of procurement and research, development, test, \n     and evaluation funds.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n     --\n       (1) Funds for re-engining of the E-8C Joint Surveillance \n     Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) should be \n     appropriated in the correct appropriations accounts and in \n     the amounts required in fiscal year 2010 to execute the Joint \n     STARS re-engining system design and development program; and\n       (2) the Air Force should proceed with currently planned \n     efforts to re-engine Joint STARS aircraft, to include \n     expending both procurement and research, development, test, \n     and evaluation funds.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nBill Nelson, Inhofe, Dodd, Isakson, and Lieberman be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment on a weapons system that is critical to the U.S. Air \nForce from an intelligence gathering standpoint. It has to do with the \nre-engining of the Joint STARS weapons system. Real-time intelligence \nis critical to our warfighters in fighting the ongoing wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, just as in all other military conflicts. Secretary Gates \nand our military leadership have consistently highlighted to us the \nimportance of collecting and disseminating critical intelligence and \nbattlefield information to our troops on the ground and theaters of \nconflict, such as Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  One of the most effective ISR assets operating today is the Air \nForce's E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, also known \nas Joint STARS, or more succinctly, JSTARS.\n  I ask unanimous consent a memorandum signed yesterday from Ashton \nCarter, Under Secretary of Defense, addressing JSTARS be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING officer. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. JSTARS has proven itself to be a critical asset to our \nmilitary since deploying to Iraq in 1991. It is one of the most highly \ntasked systems in our fleet today. Our commanders in the field are \nconstantly asking for JSTARS so they can access its tremendous ISR \ncapability to give them a long-range view of the battlefield and detect \nmoving targets in all weather conditions. There is no other current or \nprogrammed aircraft or weapons system that can provide the detailed, \nbroad-area ground-moving target indicator and airborne battle \nmanagement support for the warfighter than JSTARS provides.\n  The Chief of Staff of the Air Force, GEN Norton Schwartz, has stated \nthat the Air Force is ``all-in'' for the joint fight. JSTARS is truly a \njoint platform. Flown by a mixed active-duty Air Force/Air Guard unit, \nit operates with an Army and Air Force mission crew and, in \nAfghanistan, also with a Marine. It also supports missions of all the \nmilitary services.\n  With over 55,000 combat hours and 900 sorties flown by only a handful \nof airplanes over Iraq and Afghanistan, JSTARS has directly contributed \nto the discovery of hundreds of IEDs.\n  Having flown with the 116th Air Control Wing out of Robins Air Force \nBase in Warner Robins, GA, I have seen firsthand the remarkable \ncapability that JSTARS can bring to the battlefield in support of our \nwarfighters. Although developed and built to fight the Cold War for \ntracking Soviet troop movements, JSTARS is an integral part of today's \nbattlefield and will be even more relevant in the near future.\n  JSTARS needs to be modified with new engines to keep this critical \nasset available to better support our soldiers. Air Force studies show \nthe airframe is sound and will be useful well beyond 2050. JSTARS faces \nlimitations in operational restrictions because the engines are the \noriginal 1960s-era engines. They have never been replaced. They are old \nand expensive to operate and maintain. Replacing them is a safety issue \nas well as an operational necessity.\n  What this sense-of-the-Senate resolution does is to emphasize the \nimportance of funding the re-engining of the JSTARS weapons system.\n  And it is my hope that in conference, the chairman and the ranking \nmember will do what they can to make sure this funding is available. I \nhave talked with Senator Inouye as well as Senator Cochran about this. \nThey are well aware of the value of this weapons system. It has been \nfunded in the House appropriations bill. By adopting this sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment, it sends a strong message for the conferees to do \neverything possible to make sure the appropriate funding will be \navailable when this conference report returns to the Senate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, \n           Technology and Logistics,\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2009.\n\n\n               MEMORANDUM FOR SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE\n\n     SUBJECT: E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System \n         (JSTARS) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM)\n       I designate JSTARS as a special interest program.\n       I direct the Air Force to continue the JSTARS re-engining \n     System Design and Development phase, including the \n     development, flight testing, and production of the initial \n     increment of re-engine shipsets. The Air Force should \n     immediately identify and obligate RDT and procurement \n     funding necessary to execute this direction. Report back to \n     me when this is accomplished with the amounts and timing of \n     RDT and procurement funding obligations.\n       My point of contact for this ADM is Mr. David Ahern, \n     Director, Portfolio Systems Acquisition (OUSD (AT)).\n                                                 Ashton B. Carter.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia for presenting his amendment. I am pleased to advise him that \nSenator Cochran and I have discussed this matter. We would like to see \nthis passed. We agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. At the appropriate time, I will ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2621), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2592, as modified\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 2592, which is at the desk and has modifications at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Casey], for himself and \n     Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Nelson of Florida, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2592, as modified.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2592, as modified\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that work under contracts under the Logistics Civil \n         Augmentation Program complies with certain standards)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Limitation on Availability of Funds for \n     Execution of Contracts Under LOGCAP.--No later than 90 days \n     after enactment of this Act none of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act may be obligated or \n     expended for the execution of a contract under the Logistics \n     Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) unless the Secretary of \n     the Army determines that the contract explicitly requires the \n     contractor--\n       (1) to inspect and immediately correct deficiencies that \n     present an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury \n     so as to ensure compliance with generally accepted electrical \n     standards as determined by the Secretary of Defense in work \n     under the contract;\n\n[[Page S10042]]\n\n       (2) monitor and immediately correct deficiencies in the \n     quality of any potable or non-potable water provided under \n     the contract to ensure that safe and sanitary water is \n     provided; and\n       (3) establish and enforce strict standards for preventing, \n     and immediately addressing and cooperating with the \n     prosecution of, any instances of sexual assault in all of its \n     operations and the operations of its subcontractors.\n       (b) Waiver.--The Secretary of the Army may waive the \n     applicability of the limitation in subsection (a) to any \n     contract if the Secretary certifies in writing to Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the waiver is necessary for the provision of essential \n     services or critical operating facilities for operational \n     missions; or\n       (2) the work under such contract does not present an \n     imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I rise to speak about an amendment Senator Durbin, the \nassistant majority leader, and I have worked on, as well as getting \nsupport and cosponsorship by the majority leader, Senator Reid, and by \nSenator Kerry and Senator Nelson of Florida. It has three fundamental \ngoals. The first is to deal with the horrific situation our troops have \nfaced where we have a number of troops who have died in Iraq, not as a \nresult of enemy fire or in combat but in a circumstance in which they \nshould have a reasonable expectation of safety. In the case of one of \nmy constituents, SSG Ryan Maseth, Ryan was from the city of Shaler, PA, \nout in western Pennsylvania. He was taking a shower in Iraq, in his \nbarracks, and was killed, was electrocuted because of shoddy electrical \nwork. So the first part of this amendment speaks to that fundamental \nproblem we still have today. The second part of the amendment ensures \nthat our brave fighting men and women serving in war zones have clean \nwater. Thirdly, this amendment would establish strict standards for \npreventing and prosecuting sexual assaults on Army bases.\n  These are all commonsense reforms. I will focus principally in my \nremarks--I know we have limited time--on the issue of electrocution.\n  As I mentioned, SSG Ryan Maseth died on January 2, 2008. He was \nelectrocuted in his barracks in Iraq. Unfortunately for his family, who \nhave been seeking answers to why he was killed in that way, the \nnightmare has not ended, nor for a lot of other families. Families from \nGeorgia, Texas, California, Nevada, Oregon, Hawaii, Minnesota, and \nPennsylvania, all of those States, have been affected by these deaths.\n  It continues into last month. On September 1 of this year, Adam \nHermanson, who grew up in San Diego and Las Vegas, served three tours \nof duty in Iraq with the Air Force and then went back to work for a \ncontractor. He, too, lost his life in a horrific way, by electrocution. \nHis wife Janine is waiting for answers. I spoke to her earlier today.\n  Fundamentally, what this amendment does as it relates to the \nelectrocution problem is attempt to right a wrong by ensuring that the \nArmy reviews the language of the contract at the time of formation to \nensure it includes explicit language that clearly requires contractors \nto immediately correct deficiencies such as improperly grounded \nequipment or facilities. We are talking about basic electrical work \nhere being done in a way that would protect anyone's safety in a way \nthat they should have a right to expect.\n  So when I think of Ryan and his family and his mother Cheryl Harris \nand I think of Mr. Hermanson and his family, his wife Janine, we are \nnot just thinking about some far-off concept here, we are talking about \na real problem that is not yet corrected and still threatens our \nfighting men and women.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by saying, in addition to urging my \ncolleagues to support this amendment, which I think is so fundamental \nit does not require a lot of explanation, our troops ought to be able \nto take a shower or engage in other activities of daily life in Iraq or \nAfghanistan or anywhere around the world with that reasonable \nexpectation of safety. We can't guarantee that right now, \nunfortunately. This amendment will take a step in that direction.\n  Obviously, the other parts, the other two elements in the amendment \nare that our troops should have the ability to drink clean water and, \nfinally, that no women serving in the military should ever fear the \npotential or the threat of sexual assault.\n  All of these parts of this amendment are vitally important. I don't \nunderstand why anyone would not support it.\n  I have already submitted for the Record earlier the Associated Press \nstory about the death by electrocution of Adam Hermanson. I wanted to \ncite two statements, two reflections by Adam's wife and his mother. His \nwife said, when talking about their plans to move back to Pennsylvania:\n\n       He was supposed to come back and we had a lot of plans.\n\n  After three tours of duty in Iraq as a soldier and then another tour \nas a contractor, they were looking forward to his coming back to the \nUnited States and, in this case, coming back to Pennsylvania. They had \na lot of plans. Those plans were completely destroyed. His life was \nended because of a fundamental problem in our system of how we ground \nelectrical outlets, how we install showers in Iraq and threaten troops \nin the process. We have to correct it for Adam in his memory and for \nRyan and so many others, as well as for those they left behind; in this \ncase, Adam's wife Janine.\n  I will conclude with what his mother Patricia said, as she was \nreflecting on what happened to Adam. She said everyone in their family \nwas struggling to understand how he could survive four war tours--three \nas a soldier, one as a contractor--and then die suddenly in a seemingly \nsafe place.\n  We should make sure, by way of this amendment and anything else we \ncan do, that our troops are at least safe when taking a shower or in a \nbarracks or living in a situation where they are away from the \nbattlefield, away from a fire fight, away from the threat of enemy \nfire. That is the least we can do as legislators. I urge my colleagues \nto support the amendment, hoping we can deal with this amendment in the \nnext hour or so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is time to address some serious \nproblems that have plagued the LOGCAP contract that the Army uses to \nsupply our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  For years, this work has been managed by the former subsidiary of \nHalliburton, KBR.\n  The controversies surrounding these two companies are many. Senator \nCasey and I have offered an amendment to help deal with some of the \nworst failures and protect the safety of our troops and others.\n  The amendment would prevent the Army from spending funds on a LOGCAP \ncontract unless the Army Secretary determines that the contract \nexplicitly requires the contractor to ensure safe electrical work, \nensure safe and sanitary water, and establish and enforce strict sexual \nassault prevention policies.\n  It also allows the Secretary an opportunity to waive the restriction, \nif that is necessary to the provision of essential services.\n  In 2001, the Army awarded a sole-source contract to Halliburton-KBR \nto provide housing, meals, water, trash collection, and other support \nservices for American troops abroad.\n  By the start of this year, the Army had paid KBR more than $31 \nbillion under the contract, known as LOGCAP.\n  KBR has had tremendous difficulty executing government contracts \nproperly. One of the many failures of this company has led to the death \nof U.S. troops.\n  With our constituents' taxes, our Nation has paid billions of dollars \nto KBR to provide support to our troops deployed in harm's way. Some of \nthe funds were designated to provide a safe place for our troops as \nthey go about their daily business--to provide them the safe food and \nshelter they need as they put their lives on the line for us.\n  We, and all taxpayers, have a right to expect that this company would \nuse those hard-earned tax dollars for the safest and best support we \ncan provide.\n  What we didn't expect is for KBR, through its negligence, to provide \nconditions that would injure or kill our troops in their showers. But \nthat is what has happened.\n  Since March 2003, at least 16 service members and 3 contractors have \nbeen killed by electrocution in our own facilities in Iraq.\n  It wasn't a problem that was hidden for years and then suddenly \nemerged as a surprise. As early as 2004, Army experts warned that \nnegligent electrical work created potentially hazardous conditions for \nAmerican personnel.\n\n[[Page S10043]]\n\n  While we don't whether every single one of those deaths was the fault \nof KBR, we do know that KBR has been given major contracts involving \nwiring facilities for our troops in Iraq.\n  We know that in 2008, 94 troops stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan or \nother Central Command countries sought medical treatment for electric \nshock, according to Defense Department health data.\n  And we know from military records that KBR's database lists 231 \nelectric shock incidents in the facilities the company runs in Iraq.\n  So we know that our soldiers are being injured and sometimes killed \nas a direct result of KBR's shoddy electrical work in our facilities.\n  This is clearly a problem that needs some tough questions answered. \nHow does it come to pass that we put our personnel in unnecessary \nharm's way so often?\n  The DOD inspector general sought to answer this question and looked \nat a particular case I would like to share with my colleagues. The case \nis that of SSG Ryan Maseth, and it demonstrates the level of KBR's \nnegligence.\n  In January 2008, Sergeant Maseth was killed in Iraq. This decorated \nservice member was not killed by the bullets or bombs of Iraqi \ninsurgents. He became another victim of contractor negligence when he \nwas electrocuted in a shower at a U.S. base in Baghdad that once was \none of Saddam Hussein's palaces.\n  On July 24 of this year, the DOD inspector general released a \nscathing report describing the negligence of KBR that contributed to \nSergeant Maseth's senseless death. The IG catalogued a distressing \nlitany of KBR negligence and malfeasance. It found that ``KBR did not \nground equipment during installation or report improperly grounded \nequipment identified during routine maintenance''; ``KBR did not have \nstandard operating procedures for the technical inspection of \nfacilities''; KBR personnel ``had inadequate electrical training and \nexpertise''; and ``Operations and maintenance contractor facility \nmaintenance records were incomplete and lacked specificity, precluding \nthe identification and correction of systemic maintenance problems.''\n  We have paid KBR billions and billions of dollars, and this is what \nthey have given us in return.\n  It is tragic. It is wrong. And it has to stop.\n  In March of this year, DOD launched an emergency effort to examine \nevery facility in Iraq to determine the scope of the problem.\n  The results of those inspections are disturbing. According to Task \nForce Safety Actions for Fire and Electricity, SAFE, of the 20,340 \nfacilities maintained by KBR and inspected immediately, 6,935 failed \nthe government inspection and required major electrical repairs.\n  Think about that for a moment. For years, KBR has been making money \nhand over fist in Iraq, providing maintenance and support for what grew \nto a portfolio of almost 90,000 facilities. Yet nearly one-third of the \nfacilities included in this emergency inspection failed the inspection.\n  So for years our brave service members have used these facilities, \nexpecting that they were safe, expecting that the billions of dollars \nwe were spending on war support was devoted to their safety. Little did \nthey know that--thanks to KBR's callous carelessness--what they were \nreally doing was playing ``Russian roulette'' every time they stepped \ninto a shower.\n  You don't have to take my word for the level of incompetence \ndemonstrated by KBR. Listen to the experts.\n  Listen to Jim Childs, a master electrician hired by the Army to \nreview KBR's electrical work with Task Force SAFE. He called KBR's work \n``the most hazardous, worst quality work'' he'd ever seen.\n  Mr. Childs found that even when KBR tried to fix problems, they \ncouldn't--that the rewiring work done in buildings that were previously \nsafe resulted in the electrical system becoming unsafe.\n  Or listen to Eric Peters, a master electrician who worked for KBR in \nIraq as recently as this year. Mr. Peters testified that 50 percent of \nthe KBR-managed buildings he saw were not properly wired. Mr. Peters \nestimated that at least half the electricians hired by KBR would not \nhave been hired to work in the United States because they were not \ntrained to meet U.S. or U.K. electrical standards.\n  He characterized KBR managers as ``completely unqualified.''\n  American soldiers--and their loved ones back home--placed \nthemselves--placed their loved ones--in the hands of what was then a \nsubsidiary of Halliburton known by the acronym KBR, and this is what \nthey received.\n  Shock. Electrocution. And in some cases death.\n  Why? Because of a careless disregard for the safety of our troops.\n  We must stop the negligence and ensure that U.S. contracts keep our \nsoldiers safe.\n  The story is not much better when it comes to the water KBR has \nprovided to our troops.\n  Here in America, we tend to take clean water for granted. We turn on \nthe tap and, with rare exceptions, clean water flows out.\n  It is not that simple in a war zone.\n  The Federal Government entrusted to Halliburton subsidiary KBR the \njob of providing our troops with clean, safe drinking water.\n  What the company supplied to our troops, instead, was unsafe, \nunhealthy, and potentially dangerous water.\n  A basic necessity of life, a critical commodity in the desert heat of \nthe Middle East, and KBR failed to get it right, even though we were \npaying them top dollar for the privilege of serving our troops in \nharm's way.\n  According to a Department of Defense inspector general report, dozens \nof soldiers fell sick between January 2004 and February 2006 due to \n``unmonitored and potentially unsafe'' water supplied by Halliburton-\nKBR to fulfill its contract with the Department of Defense.\n  Water used for washing, bathing, shaving, and cleaning did not meet \nminimum safety standards set forth in military regulations.\n  KBR reportedly failed to perform quality control tests, resulting in \nthe use of unsafe water by our troops.\n  DOD noted that KBR's failure to do its job may have resulted in \nsoldiers suffering skin abscesses, cellulitis, skin infections, \ndiarrhea, and other illnesses.\n  I do not understand how a company could demonstrate such a callous \ndisregard for the health and welfare of our troops in Iraq. But that is \nwhat they did, time and time again.\n  If it weren't for a whistleblower, we might not know about \nHalliburton-KBR's mishandling of the water contract. But Ben Carter, a \nformer Halliburton employee and water purification specialist, blew the \nwhistle on KBR's malfeasance.\n  In January 2006, Mr. Carter testified about his experiences working \nat Camp Ar Ramdi, home to 5,000 to 7,000 U.S. troops.\n  Mr. Carter was appalled by what he found there. According to Mr. \nCarter's testimony:\n\n       KBR [had] exposed the entire camp to water twice as \n     contaminated as raw water from the Euphrates River. KBR was \n     apparently taking the waste water . . . which should have \n     been dumped back in to the river, and using that as the non-\n     potable water supply. Such problems had been happening for \n     more than a year . . . No trained specialist could claim that \n     the water was fit for human consumption.\n\n  KBR's response to Mr. Carter's discovery of this substandard, \npotentially life-threatening situation? Employees of KBR instructed Mr. \nCarter to keep it quiet. Thank goodness he didn't.\n  This dirty water problem was not limited to Camp Ar Ramdi. Another \nwhistleblower, Wil Granger, KBR's overall water quality manager for \nIraq, reported that there were deficiencies in providing safe water in \ncamps across Iraq.\n  For example, Granger reported that water used for showering was not \nbeing disinfected. According to Mr. Granger, ``This caused an unknown \npopulation to be exposed to potentially harmful water for an \nundetermined amount of time.''\n  Mr. Carter says it best:\n\n       Our men and women overseas deserve the best our taxpayer \n     dollars can buy, and it saddens me to report that we're \n     falling short on something as simple and essential as \n     providing them with clean, safe water.\n\n  If only KBR had seen it that way. But our troops did not receive the \nclean water supplies they deserved, even though KBR made its profits.\n  Rape has long been outlawed as an instrument of warfare. But for \nHalliburton subsidiary KBR, it has become\n\n[[Page S10044]]\n\nan all too common occurrence. Too often, KBR employees have been the \naccused perpetrators, while the victims have been pressured to keep \nsilent.\n  Dawn Leamon is one of my constituents. She is a 42-year-old paramedic \nwho hails from Lena, IL. She has two sons who have served as soldiers \nin war zones.\n  On February 3, 2008, she was working for Service Employees \nInternational, Inc., a foreign subsidiary of KBR. She was assigned to \nCamp Harper, a remote military base near Basra, Iraq. That night she \nwas brutally raped and sodomized by a U.S. soldier and a KBR colleague.\n  After she reported the attack to KBR employees, she was discouraged \nfrom reporting it to the authorities. She was told to keep quiet.\n  Later, when she spoke out, KBR asked her to sign a nondisclosure \nagreement.\n  She bravely testified at a Senate hearing in April of last year, \ntelling the story of this awful incident and the terrible treatment she \nsuffered at the hands of KBR after the attack.\n  Dawn testified at the hearing:\n\n       I hope that by telling my story here today, I can keep what \n     happened to me from happening to anyone else.\n\n  Mary Beth Keniston testified at that same hearing in April 2008. Ms. \nKeniston worked as a truck driver for KBR, also in Iraq. She testified \nabout being raped in the cab of her truck by a coworker who was the \ndriver of a vehicle that was parked behind her tanker as they waited \none night to fill up with water from the Tigris River.\n  Ms. Keniston reported the attack immediately. But no one at KBR \nsuggested an investigation, referred her for medical treatment, or even \noffered to escort her back through the dark to her quarters that night.\n  As Ms. Keniston testified at the hearing:\n\n       I am in a war zone--and, I have to worry about being \n     attacked by my coworkers.\n\n  When Jamie Leigh Jones went to Iraq in 2005, she surely did not \nexpect that the most serious threat she would face would come from \nHalliburton-KBR coworkers. But that is exactly the threat she faced in \nIraq in July 2005.\n  This young woman from Texas was drugged and then brutally gang raped \nby KBR employees while she was unconscious.\n  Rather than support her after she reported the attack, KBR put her \nunder guard in a shipping container with a bed, and warned her that if \nshe left Iraq for medical treatment, she would be out of a job.\n  Ms. Jones has formed a nonprofit organization to support the many \nother women with similar stories. She reports that she has spoken to \nmore than 40 women like herself, like Mary Beth Keniston, like Dawn \nLeamon. She says:\n\n       Part of the reason I am going forward with this case is to \n     change the system. Who knows how many of us rape victims are \n     out there?\n\n  Certainly the perpetrators of these violent crimes should be held \naccountable for their criminal actions. These women deserve justice.\n  But KBR should not escape accountability for its actions. These women \nwere brutally violated by KBR employees--by people whom KBR placed in \ntheir orbit.\n  Rather than taking some measure of responsibility to help prosecute \nthe crimes and comfort the women who had been attacked, it looks like \nKBR attempted to hide the offenses and punish the women for wanting to \nreport them. Instead of being a champion for its employees, KBR \nperpetuated the nightmare for each one of these women.\n  It is time to hold this contractor accountable and demand reforms to \nensure employees are protected.\n  That is why Senator Casey and I offered this amendment. I urge the \nSenate to adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2617\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me congratulate Senator Casey for that very good \namendment. I look forward to supporting it.\n  Mr. President, I wish to say a few words on amendment No. 2617, which \nis pending, and talk about why I offered it.\n  This is a very important amendment. Everybody in the country is \nconcerned that we have today a $12 trillion national debt. Everybody is \nconcerned that this year we will run up the largest deficit in the \nhistory of the country. What that means is the taxpayers rightfully and \nabsolutely want to know that the money we expend, whether it is for \ndefense, which is what we are discussing this evening, whether it is \nfor housing, education, any other purpose, they want to know that every \nnickel of Federal dollars spent is expended as wisely and as cost-\neffectively as possible. They also want to know that the corporations \nand the institutions and the individuals who receive that Federal \nfunding are honest and trustworthy in terms of how they can expend \nthose Federal dollars. That is what the people want, and they certainly \nhave every right to those expectations.\n  Several weeks ago, the Senate voted to prohibit any funding going to \nan organization called ACORN. That decision was largely motivated by a \nvideotape which showed employees of ACORN involved in an outrageous and \nabsurd discussion with actors who were posing as a prostitute and a \npimp. Those employees, appropriately enough, were fired for their \noutrageous behavior. My understanding is that over a period of 15 \nyears, ACORN received about $53 million to promote affordable housing, \nencourage voter registration, and other things. I voted against the \nACORN resolution, not because I condoned the behavior of these \nemployees or other problems associated with the organization over the \nyears. I don't. I opposed it because we need a process to determine \nwhat the criteria are in terms of defunding an organization engaged in \nimproper or illegal behavior.\n  Frankly, I don't think a videotape on TV is good enough \njustification. We need a process, and that is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  The sad truth is, virtually every major defense contractor has, for \nmany years, been engaged in systemic illegal and fraudulent behavior \nwhile receiving hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of \ntaxpayer money. We are not talking here about the $53 million that \nACORN received over 15 years. We are talking about defense contractors \nthat have received many billions of dollars in defense contracts and, \nyear after year, time after time, have violated the law, ripping off \nthe taxpayers big time.\n  In some instances, these contractors have done more than steal money \nfrom taxpayers. In some instances, they have actually endangered the \nlives and well-being of the men and women who serve our country in the \nArmed Forces.\n  Let me cite a few examples. According to the Project on Government \nOversight, a nonpartisan, widely respected organization focusing on \ngovernment waste, the three largest government defense contractors, \nLockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman, all have a history \nriddled with fraud and other illegal behavior. Combined, these \ncompanies have engaged in 109 instances of misconduct since 1995. This \nis going back to 1995, 109 instances of misconduct, and have paid fees \nand settlements for this misconduct totaling $2.9 billion.\n  Let me repeat that. These three companies--Lockheed Martin, Boeing, \nand Northrop Grumman--have engaged in 109 instances of misconduct since \n1995 and have paid fees and settlements for this misconduct totaling \n$2.9 billion. Here is the kicker: Despite violating the law time after \ntime after time, despite being fined time after time after time, guess \nwhat the penalty has been.\n  Here is what the penalty is. It is a pretty harsh penalty. In 2007, \ntheir punishment was $77 billion in government contracts. That is a \npretty steep penalty, I have to admit, $77 billion. This is not ACORN. \nThey were defunded immediately because of a 2-minute videotape. These \nare guys who time after time violated the law, ripped off the \ntaxpayers, and their punishment was in 2007, 1 year alone, not $53 \nmillion over 15 years but $77 billion in 1 year.\n  Based on a video on TV, we took away funding for ACORN. What are we \ngoing to do with the major defense contractors who have been found \nguilty in courts of law, not on a videotape, time after time?\n  Let me give a few specifics so we know what we are talking about. \nLockheed Martin, the largest defense contractor in the country, has \nengaged in\n\n[[Page S10045]]\n\n50 instances of misconduct since 1995, paying fines and settlements \ntotaling $577 million. Yet it received $34 billion in government \ncontracts in 2007. That is telling them who is boss. That is sticking \nit to them for violating the law.\n  Here is the type of behavior we are talking about. According to the \nU.S. Attorney's Office, in 2008, Lockheed Martin's Space Systems \nCompany paid $10.5 million to settle charges that it defrauded the \ngovernment by submitting false invoices for payment on a multibillion-\ndollar contract connected to the Titan IV space launch vehicle program. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, in 2003, Lockheed Martin paid \n$38 million to resolve allegations that it fraudulently inflated the \ncost of performing several Air Force contracts for the purchase of \nnavigation and targeting pads for military jets.\n  In 2001, Lockheed Martin paid $8.5 million to settle criminal charges \nthat it lied about its costs when negotiating contracts for the repair \nand restoration of radar pedestals installed in U.S. warships.\n  But in fairness to Lockheed Martin, we should be clear that they are \nnot the only defense contractors involved in fraud. Frankly, it is \nendemic in the industry. Boeing is the world's largest aerospace \ncompany and the largest manufacturer of commercial jet liners and \nmilitary aircraft. Since 1995, Boeing has either been found guilty, \nliable, or reached settlements in 31 instances of misconduct and, as a \nresult, paid $1.5 billion in fines, judgments, and settlements. I am \ntalking about real money.\n  In 2000, according to the Department of Justice, Boeing agreed to pay \n$54 million to settle charges that it placed defective gears in more \nthan 140 CH-47D Chinook helicopters and then sold the defective \nhelicopters to the U.S. Army. When one of the gears failed in flight, \nit caused an Army Chinook helicopter to crash and burn while on a \nmission in Honduras, and five servicemen aboard were killed. We are not \njust talking about fraud; we are talking about activities which \nresulted in the death of U.S. servicemen.\n  In a report made public this past Tuesday, the DOD inspector reported \nthat Boeing may have recovered $271 million in ``unallowable costs'' \nfrom the government. That is this last Tuesday. Still, Boeing received \n$24 billion in Federal contracts in 2007.\n  Finally, Northrop Grumman, the third largest contractor, has a \nsimilar history, with 27 instances of misconduct totaling $790 million \nover the past 15 years. It is not just the big three. On June 9, 2004, \nKBR overbilled for dining facilities by at least 19 percent, according \nto KBR's own studies, and it could be as high as 36 percent. As \nreported in its 2005 10-K, the government eventually agreed to withhold \n$55 million from KBR.\n  United Technologies reached a settlement amounting to over $50 \nmillion.\n  A few weeks ago the Senate voted to strip funding from an \norganization called ACORN which received $53 million in Federal funds \nfor a period of 15 years. What do we do with some of the largest \ndefense contractors that have time after time after time been involved \nwith fraud?\n  I think one has to be pretty obtuse not to perceive that this type of \nbehavior, this recurrent behavior, is systemic in the industry and it \nis part of the overall business model. Let me add, what I describe now \nis what these companies have been caught doing. We do not know what \nthey have done in which they have not been caught.\n  The time is long overdue for us to get to the bottom of this \nsituation. We owe that not only to the taxpayers of the country but to \nthe men and women in our Armed Forces.\n  For that reason, I am proposing an amendment today under which the \nSecretary of Defense would calculate the total amount of money that \ngoes to companies that have engaged in fraud against the United States, \nand then make recommendations about how to penalize repeat offenders. \nIn other words, they have to be held accountable. It is absurd that \nyear after year these companies continue doing the same things--illegal \nbehavior, fraudulent activities--and year after year they keep getting \naway with it, and year after year they come back and they get hundreds \nof billions of dollars in Federal funds.\n  I hope very much this study will receive strong bipartisan support \nand will be a first step in moving us forward to cleaning up the world \nof defense contracting.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Honduras\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments in the middle \nof the debate on the Defense appropriations bill to talk about a \nsituation in Honduras and, maybe equally important, a situation here in \nthe Senate.\n  Honduras has come to the attention of many Americans because of the \nchange in government there and the questions about whether this was \ndone constitutionally. I had arranged a trip, along with a few House \nMembers, to go to Honduras and meet with officials and find out more \nabout the situation. Unfortunately, I found out this afternoon that the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee was blocking my trip, along \nwith the State Department.\n  It is very concerning since no Member of the Senate has taken the \ntime to go to Honduras, which is a very close ally to this country, \nwhere we have a military base. And they certainly depend on our \nsupport. I have a growing concern of what appears to be intimidation \nand bullying from our administration, and I wanted to have a fact-\nfinding trip. This body normally accords fellow Members the courtesy, \nand this was very disturbing that we would use politics to block a trip \nsuch as this.\n  But I wish to give a little bit of background on Honduras. Since so \nmany other things are going on, not many people here in the Senate seem \nto even be aware of the situation.\n  On June 28, then-President Manuel Zelaya was removed from office and \narrested by the Honduran military, on orders from the Honduran Supreme \nCourt, and in accordance with the Honduran Constitution.\n  Charged with crimes of both public corruption and abuse of power, \nPresident Zelaya was attempting to subvert the Honduran Constitution \nand install himself as a dictator in the mold of his close friend Hugo \nChavez.\n  Within hours, the Obama administration made an uninformed decision to \ncall this constitutional process a ``coup,'' despite no one at the \nState Department or the White House having made a thorough review of \nthe facts and the law.\n  Instead, we simply follow the lead of the Western Hemisphere's most \ncorrupt and anti-American tyrants: Fidel Castro of Cuba, Daniel Ortega \nof Nicaragua, and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. The President sided with \nthese thugs and against Honduras--a poor, loyal, and democratic friend \nof the United States.\n  To date, I am unaware of any provision in the Honduran Constitution \nthat was violated in Zelaya's removal from office, except perhaps \nremoving him from the country instead of putting him in jail.\n  The Congress, of Zelaya's party, the Supreme Court, the Attorney \nGeneral, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, and the vast majority of the \nHonduran people support Zelaya's removal.\n  The Honduran military has remained at all times under civilian \ncontrol. The November 29 elections remain on schedule. Interim \nPresident Roberto Micheletti is not on the ballot. The nominees for the \nmajor political parties are campaigning, and the country's citizens are \npreparing for a free, fair, and transparent election.\n  If that does not sound like a coup to you, you are not alone. Last \nmonth, a thorough report--and I have it here--by the Congressional \nResearch Service found that the removal of Zelaya and the actions of \nthe Congress and Supreme Court were both legal and constitutional--a \nvery detailed evaluation which apparently the administration has not \ntaken the time to see. There was no coup. But the Obama administration, \nnevertheless, has cut off Honduras from millions of dollars of badly \nneeded United States aid.\n  The trip I planned--which is tomorrow--along with three Members of \nthe House of Representatives was to get to the bottom of this so we \ncould report back to the Senate and the House as to what was going on.\n\n[[Page S10046]]\n\n  Our trip met every necessary criteria. I have scheduled meetings with \nPresident Micheletti, the Supreme Court, and the leading candidates in \nnext month's Presidential election. I was going to meet with the \nbusiness and civic leaders.\n  This afternoon, I was informed that the Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kerry, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was \nblocking the trip. No reason was given, except that there were concerns \nat the State Department. If I were the Obama State Department, I would \nhave concerns too, concerns the American people might find out the \ntruth about what we are doing to the Honduran people.\n  To date, not a single Member of the Senate has assessed the situation \nin Honduras firsthand, and the Obama administration refuses to allow \nHonduran leaders and even private citizens to come here to talk to us. \nWhat are they afraid of? Are they afraid of the world discovering that \ntheir policy is based on a lie concocted by Hugo Chavez and the Castro \nbrothers? That we are backing a corrupt would-be tyrant?\n  This administration is only too eager--or at least seems to be too \neager--to talk to any anti-American tyrant on Earth, but not even \nMembers of Congress may visit a loyal ally 3 hours away.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank the Republican leader, \nSenator Mitch McConnell, for stepping in and authorizing the trip. He \nwould like to get to the bottom of this as well.\n  The trip is back on, and I look forward to reporting back to the \nSenate next week after my return. But this is an outrage, if not a \nsurprise. For 8 months, President Obama has circled the globe, \napologizing for America, appeasing our enemies, and insulting our \nfriends. Meanwhile, the President has spent more time lobbying for the \nOlympics and appearing on late-night comedy shows than meeting with his \nadvisers about the troop surge in Afghanistan.\n  Apparently, the administration is upset with me because I am asking \nfor a debate and vote on two nominations they want for the State \nDepartment. Indeed, I was told today if I lifted my holds, the trip \nwould be authorized by the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  The two nominees are Thomas Shannon, currently Assistant Secretary of \nState for Latin America, President Obama's nominee to be Ambassador to \nBrazil, and Arturo Valenzuela, currently an academic nominated to \nreplace Shannon at the Latin American desk.\n  I am asking for debate and a vote on Mr. Shannon's nomination because \nhe has supposedly been behind our policy in Latin America in recent \nyears. Our mistakes in Honduras occurred on his watch, and with his \nadvice. He was a Bush appointee, but I have a lot of questions about \nwhat is going on in Honduras. He supports the Obama aid cutoff and the \n``coup'' classification. He hardly deserves now to represent America in \nthe largest country in Latin America, at least without a debate and a \nvote.\n  Mr. Valenzuela shares these positions, even though he admitted at his \nconfirmation hearing he was not up to date on the facts.\n  Unless and until the Obama administration reverses its ill-informed \nand baseless claim that Zelaya's removal was a coup and also restores \nAmerican aid, I will continue to ask for a debate and vote on these \nnominees so we can discuss the issue openly on the floor of the Senate.\n  This country also needs to recognize the upcoming election, which has \nbeen going on. The campaign is open and transparent, but the Obama \nadministration is threatening not to recognize the election, which is \ndestabilizing the country and threatening to do more harm not only in \nHonduras but throughout Latin America. This policy is confirming Hugo \nChavez. It certainly is not confirming a constitutional form of \ngovernment.\n  I look forward to reporting back to my fellow Members what I find in \nHonduras. I again thank Mitch McConnell for taking the initiative to \nmake sure the trip is authorized.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was concerned to learn on September 17 \nof the President's decision to forgo the deployment of 10 long-range, \nground-based interceptors in Poland and a radar site in the Czech \nRepublic which was designed for the defense of Europe and the United \nStates against long-range Iranian ballistic missiles.\n  Just a few days ago, the Iranians demonstrated their determination, \neven after they agreed to meet with the United States, to deploy such a \nsystem by launching their top mid-range missile. That is not long from, \nof course, a long-range missile.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee held a full committee hearing on \nthe subject last week, and it did little to quell my initial concerns \nand has, in fact, added apprehension about the lack of specifics in the \nplan we are hearing will now be employed. More important, the \ngeopolitical implications of reneging on prior U.S. commitments to key \nallies should not be underestimated.\n  With respect to the so-called ``Phased Adaptive'' approach, President \nObama would have us believe that ``this new approach will provide \ncapabilities sooner, build on proven systems, and offer greater \ndefenses against the threat of missile attack than the 2007 European \nMissile Defense Program.''\n  I will add, parenthetically that the Europeans did agree and NATO did \nagree to the deployment of ground-based interceptors in Poland and the \nradar in the Czech Republic.\n  The reality is more complicated than the President indicates. I have \nto say, frankly, first, it is not clear this new approach will provide \ncapabilities sooner. In fact, it does not appear to.\n  Under the first phase of this new plan, which is essentially \nunderway, the United States would defend our allies against short-range \nthreats by providing ``SM-3 Block 1A capable warships when necessary \nfor the protection of parts of Southern Europe.'' That would mean we \nwould deploy an Aegis cruiser armed with SM-3 missiles. But this is no \ndifferent from what the previous plan called for. To suggest that is \nsome new plan is inaccurate. To be sure, even today, we have AEGIS \nships with SM-3 missiles plying the waters of the Mediterranean, and \nPatriot units deployed in and around Europe for our defense against \nshort-range missiles.\n\n  In phase 2 of this new plan, which is, we are told, going to be \ncompleted by 2015, a more advanced version of the theater SM-3, the IB, \nwould be deployed at sea and on land. Likewise, under the old plan, the \nIB missile would be deployed and fielded by 2015, though perhaps not on \nland. But it had been discussed. In fact, the last budget prepared by \nthe previous administration called for an increase in the inventory of \nTHAAD and SM-3 missiles to over 440 missiles in the European area by \n2015, 2016.\n  I have not seen any inventory projection for this new plan, but I \nwould be surprised to learn their numbers are significantly greater \nthan what was previously planned. In fact, the administration has not \ngotten off to a good start in this respect, as the fiscal year 2010 \nbudget request includes no funding for a new SM-3 or THAAD purchases. \nThis is the only budget year request we have been presented by the \nadministration, and they are not requesting any new THAAD and any new \nSM-3 missiles.\n  The administration's request funds previous purchases of missiles but \nrequests not a single new interceptor that would be deployed. By 2018, \nin the third phase of the new plan--2018, over 8 years from now--a \nnewly developed SM-3 block IIA missile would be added to the inventory \nto protect all of Europe against intermediate-range Iranian missiles--\nthe kind of intermediate range the Iranians just tested Monday. This is \nby 2018.\n  Under the old plan, the plan we have been working on for quite a \nnumber of years, this SM-3 IIA capability was meant to complement the \ndeployment of 10 ground-based interceptors in Poland, which would have \nprovided protection for most of Europe and the United States against \nlong-range Iranian missiles in the 2015 timeframe. In\n\n[[Page S10047]]\n\nother words, these 10 interceptors would have been capable of \nprotecting all of Europe and the United States. If a missile were \nlaunched from Iran aimed at hitting the United States, it would fly \nbasically over Poland and Central Europe. As a result, this would be a \nprime place to deploy a defensive missile system. The ground-based \ninterceptor that would have been used would have essentially been the \nsame missile we currently have deployed in Alaska. Our Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Begich, has been very engaged in that, and I know we \nboth are concerned to see the number of interceptors planned for that \nsite being reduced. The key difference in the missiles is that our \ninterceptors in Alaska and California are three-stage missiles, while \ntwo-stage missiles would be used to fit our needs in Europe.\n  Finally, the new plan would call for the development of IIB missiles \nby 2020, which would ``further augment the defense of the U.S. homeland \nfrom potential ICBM threats.'' That is what they are telling us would \nhappen. But I have been around here a while, and we don't have this SM-\n3 IIB missile even on the drawing board. They just conjured up this \nidea a few days ago--at least that is the first I have heard about it. \nSo we have to build this new missile--not build on the one we have \nalready emplaced in Alaska and are building now, but build a whole new \nmissile. That will take 10 years. And who is to say the Congress will \nbe faithful to this 10-year plan? I will tell you one thing: President \nObama will not spend a dime of his money on it. This is in the distant \nfuture. That worries me because my experience is that plans like this \ndon't always come to fruition. When you abandon a proven technology, \nthat we are almost ready to deploy now, after some hope in the future, \nthis makes me nervous.\n  The two-stage GBI intended for Poland in the old plan would have been \nfielded by 2015, 5 years earlier than this vision of a IIB, if the \nratification of all the agreements had occurred and we pushed for that. \nThe 2015 date is important because Iran may have, by then, long-range \nmissiles capable of reaching all of Europe and the United States.\n  In March of this year, General Craddock, then-commander of U.S. \nEuropean Command, testified before Congress,\n\n       By 2015, Iran may also deploy an intercontinental ballistic \n     missile capable of reaching all of Europe and parts of the \n     United States.\n\n  That was his testimony, given under oath.\n  In May of this year, 2009, an unclassified intelligence report issued \nby the National Air and Space Intelligence Center stated:\n\n       With sufficient foreign assistance, Iran could develop and \n     test an ICBM capable of reaching the United States by 2015.\n\n  In the final analysis, it is not clear that the new plan will field \ncapabilities any sooner--and indeed it appears later than the previous \nplan--which may leave us with a gap in coverage in Europe for at least \n5 years if we were to move forward with the plan to develop this \nmissile. So forgive me if I am not buying into this. This plan sounds \nlike an excuse for giving up on the European site for the GBI.\n  The President also claims that his approach is based on proven \ntechnology--the assumption being, perhaps, that the previous plan was \nfraught with technological risk. Again, that claim is not correct.\n  The administration argues that its approach to providing defense of \nEurope with SM-3 block IIA, and ultimately augmented with this IIB \nsystem in 2020, is based on proven technology of the currently deployed \nSM-3 IA missile. Well, that is just not accurate. The SM-3 that would \nbe effective against an ICBM is much larger in diameter. It is an \nentirely new missile. Just because the SM-3 is performing very well for \ntheater defense doesn't mean they can build an entirely new SM-3 and it \nis going to be as effective. I assume they could, and move forward with \nit, but it is not a sure thing.\n  While I have confidence in the ability of the SM-3 missile to \neventually evolve into an ICBM interceptor, I would note that the two-\nstage GBI intended for Poland is also based on proven technology of the \nthree-stage GBI now deployed in Alaska and California, which, according \nto General Cartwright, has a 90-percent probability of intercepting a \nrogue missile--presumably coming in from North Korea.\n  This is a great system. We have invested decades of effort in it, \nover 20 years. Thirty-plus years have gone into developing an \nantimissile system. We have finally got it so that we have a 90-percent \nchance of having one of these interceptors--knockdown, hit-to-kill \ntechnology--in space over the Pacific Ocean to obliterate an incoming \nmissile. We have the radar system designed to pick up these missiles on \nlaunch, to track them, and to guide the missile into that kill system.\n  It is certainly questionable to me whether the SM-3 block II variant, \nwhich requires new boosters and a new kill vehicle, is less \ntechnologically risky than a two-stage GBI, which is scheduled for \nflight testing in the coming years.\n  Finally, the President contends that his approach would offer greater \ndefense than the previous approach. Here he assumed the old approach \nincluded only 10 ground-based interceptors in Poland and that his new \napproach would provide more theater defense on land and on sea.\n  I would just say that this bothers me because that has never been our \nplan. Our plan always has been to emplace ICBMs or theater missiles in \nEurope, as well as the 10 interceptors in Poland that would protect us \nfrom a rogue attack from a country like Iran, which seems determined to \ndo this.\n  So this is where we have been. And I am pleased to see my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, who throughout his time in the Senate has maintained \na superb understanding of national missile defense as part of his \nduties on the Senate Armed Services Committee. He is probably the most \nknowledgeable person in the Senate on that issue, and I think he shares \nsome of my concerns.\n  I thank the Senator for coming, and I would be pleased to join with \nhim in an amendment that could improve our situation today. I will be \nglad to yield to my colleague. The only thing I see new in this plan is \nthe abandonment of the Polish site, the ground-based interceptor, which \nindeed is capable of knocking down a missile from Iran.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I would be pleased to hear \nSenator Lieberman share some of his thoughts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Sessions, my \ncolleague from Alabama, for the statement he made and for his \nleadership on this issue. I am proud to join with him and a number of \nSenators--Senators Bayh, McCain, Inhofe, Vitter, Kyl, and Bennett--to \nintroduce this amendment.\n  Mr. President, has the amendment actually been called up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2616\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up amendment No. 2616.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself, \n     and Mr. Sessions, proposes an amendment numbered 2616.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: Relating to the two-stage ground-based interceptor missile)\n\n     At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Funding for Two-Stage Ground-Based Interceptor \n     Missile.--Of the amounts appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act for a long-range missile defense system \n     in Europe, or appropriated or otherwise made available for \n     the Department of Defense for a long-range missile defense \n     system in Europe from the Consolidated Security Disaster \n     Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009 (Public \n     Law 110-329) and available for obligation, $151,000,000 shall \n     be available for research, development, test, and evaluation \n     of the two-stage ground-based interceptor missile.\n       (b) Prohibition on Diversion of Funds.--Funds appropriated \n     or otherwise made available by this Act for the Missile \n     Defense Agency for the purpose of research, development, and \n     testing of the two-stage ground based interceptor missile \n     shall be utilized solely for that purpose, and may not be \n     reprogrammed or otherwise utilized for any other purpose.\n\n[[Page S10048]]\n\n       (c) Report.--Not later than February 1, 2010, the Director \n     of the Missile Defense Agency shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report setting forth the \n     following:\n       (1) A comprehensive plan for the continued development and \n     testing of the two-stage ground-based interceptor missile, \n     including a description how the Missile Defense Agency will \n     leverage the development and testing of such missile to \n     modernize the Ground-based Midcourse Defense component of the \n     ballistic missile defense system.\n       (2) Options for deploying an additional Ground-based \n     Midcourse Defense site in Europe or the United States to \n     provide enhanced defense in response to future long-range \n     missile threats from Iran, and a description of how such a \n     site may be made interoperable with the planned missile \n     defense architecture for Europe and the United States.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this bipartisan amendment is both a \nresponse to the administration's decision to cancel the ground-based \nmidcourse missile defense system that was going to be in Poland and the \nCzech Republic and the subsequent decision of our friends and \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee to withdraw a \nsignificant amount of money that the administration has said it still \nwanted to be preserved for the ground-based interceptors; that is, the \ninterceptors that would have been launched from Poland at a missile \npresumably from Iran headed toward Europe, the Middle East, or \nparticularly toward the United States.\n  Let me explain some background here as quickly as I can.\n  I was disappointed by the administrations's decision to cancel the \nplanned deployment of this missile defense system to Poland and the \nCzech Republic. This system would have provided our European allies and \nothers with a first line of defense against short- and medium-range \nballistic missiles that Iran already possesses and could fire at our \nallies in the region and in Europe. But the point I want to focus in on \nhere is that the--I am going to call it the GMD--it is the ground-based \nmidcourse missile defense system, the GMD for Poland and the Czech \nRepublic would also have provided a layer of what the military missile \nexperts call redundancy for the defense of the United States against an \nintercontinental ballistic missile fired from Iran at us. This is not \njust sort of pie-in-the-sky kind of hyperanxiety, imagination. We know \nthat Iranians are developing long-range ballistic missiles and, as I \nwill mention in a moment, experts predict they will have that capacity \nby the middle of the next decade, 2015.\n  The Polish-Czech system would have provided, in addition to a defense \nof Europe, a redundant defense of the United States. What does \nredundancy mean in this case? It means we have more than one line of \ndefense to protect us. Those of us who are privileged to serve on the \nArmed Services Committee or Appropriations Committee and others know \nour military tries to build redundancy into equipment, for instance. I \nwas up at the Sikorsky helicopter manufacturing facility in Stratford, \nCT, a little while ago. They are building a new model of helicopter. \nThere are three or four levels of redundancy in that system, in that \nsingle helicopter. Why? So if one element breaks down, there are two or \nthree other elements that will keep it going for the protection of our \nAmerican military inside that helicopter.\n  In the same way, if an intercontinental ballistic missile is fired in \n2015 toward the United States of America, we have one line of defense.\n  My friend from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, is here. I remember so \nwell when he and I in the decade of the 1990s were trying to convince \nour colleagues to invest some money in developing a ballistic missile \ndefense system. People said two things: No. 1, we were getting carried \naway with our fears and, No. 2, even if it was something to be \nconcerned about, it was impossible to develop a ballistic missile \ndefense system. I remember people said we are talking about trying to \nhit a bullet with a bullet.\n  Well, by God, American military, American innovation, American \nenterprise, American manufacturing have done it. We now have two \nground-based missile defense systems, one in Alaska, one in California, \nto protect the American homeland from ballistic missile attack.\n  But we need redundancy. Just like the pilot and the crew in that \nSikorsky helicopter need redundancy in that helicopter in case one of \nthe lead systems goes, we want to know they have backup. If a missile \nis headed--well, probably with a nuclear weapon on it--toward the \nUnited States of America, I think we want some redundancy. We want more \nthan one line of defense to protect our people and our country. Right \nnow we just have that system in California and Alaska.\n  The ideal here, according to the people who think about this, is to \nhave what they call a ``shoot look and shoot'' defense. A missile is \nfired from Iran. We gauge that it is heading toward the United States. \nThe plan for the ground-based system in Poland and Czechoslovakia is we \nhave our first shot at that missile heading toward us from Poland. Then \nwe look. If we missed it, we have a second opportunity to knock it down \nfrom California or Alaska.\n  Unfortunately, the alternative system the administration has chosen, \nwhich has many positive aspects to it for the defense of Europe and the \nMiddle East from Iranian short- and medium-range missiles, leaves most \nof the United States without that second shot at that incoming missile.\n  I do not have pictures with me from a report that the Congressional \nBudget Office did, a diagram, but the eastern part of the United States \nwould have a redundant defense but everything pretty much west of the \nMississippi would not. That is serious stuff. That is why I am \ndisappointed by the decision that was made.\n  I want to explain a little more about how the administration has \ndealt with that concern about America's homeland and what I think we \ncan do about it. They have proposed--there is a lot of technical \nlanguage here; let's see if I can do it without confusing everybody--\nthat they would eventually develop--they have this SM-3 missile defense \nsystem that will be the basis of the alternative to the Polish-Czech \ndefense, and that will be good for Europe and the Middle East. But the \nadministration knows it leaves America without that second line of \ndefense to a missile attack. So they are proposing to build block IIA \nand Block IIB interceptors as part of this so-called SM-3, advanced \ndevelopments of that system which, they argue, could protect the United \nStates of America from a long-range missile fired from Iran.\n  The problem is the Block IIA and IIB of this SM-3 missile do not \nexist. They are on paper. General Cartwright acknowledged so much in \ntestimony to us. The ground-based interceptor that was going to go into \nPoland exists. It has been manufactured. It was scheduled to go into \ntesting this year. In the proposal the administration has made, they \nsay the SM-3 Block IIA, the first one that could possibly defend the \nUnited States, will not be available until 2018, at the earliest. The \nBlock IIB, even more sophisticated, will be available in 2020 at the \nearliest.\n  Let me try to explain through a quote what worries me about that. \nEarlier this year, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee, \nthe then-commander of our European Command, the Supreme Allied \nCommander in Europe, Bantz Craddock, stated this:\n\n       By 2015 Iran may also deploy an intercontinental ballistic \n     missile capable of reaching all of Europe and parts of the \n     United States.\n\n  I know that is not a hard prediction, but that is the range that most \npeople in the intelligence community, the military community, give, \nthat sometime in the middle of the next decade, maybe a little later, \nthe Iranians will have a long-range ballistic missile that can hit the \nUnited States of America.\n  Look, they can do better than that and may surprise us. We have been \nsurprised before by the ballistic missile capabilities of our \nadversaries. The North Korean Taepodong test of 1998 comes to mind, of \ncourse, an unfortunate instance in which the North Korean Government \ntested a long-range missile 7 days after our intelligence community \nconcluded that North Korea was another 3 years away from having that \ncapability.\n  One of the reasons the administration has given for this change to \nthe SM-3 defense is that it provides a quicker, better defense for \nEurope and the Middle East to short- and medium-range missiles, and the \nadministration concludes the Iranians are making more progress more \nquickly on those\n\n[[Page S10049]]\n\ntwo, short- and medium-range missiles, than we thought they would. If \nthey are making progress on the short- and medium-range missiles more \nquickly than we thought they would, they might also make progress more \nquickly on the long-range missile that could hit the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Here is what I am worried about. I understand these are not exact \nnumbers. By 2015, according to General Craddock, Iran may have a long-\nrange ballistic missile that could hit the United States of America. At \nthe earliest the SM-3 Block IIA missile, to give some protection, \nsecond line of defense to that missile, will not be available until \n2018 at the earliest. Remember, this is now a paper missile. It has not \nbeen built, let alone tested. You have 3 years there, and probably \nmore, where there will be a ballistic missile defense gap in which Iran \ncould fire at us and only have to get by the ground-based missile \ndefense systems in Alaska and California.\n  I think the administration, as testimony went on, understood our \nconcern about that. In fact, when the Secretary of Defense Gates and \nGeneral Cartwright rolled out the administration's new architecture for \nmissile defense, canceling the Polish-Czech program and going to the \nnew system, one of the points General Cartwright emphasized was that \nthe administration would continue to develop the two-stage ground-based \ninterceptor, the one that was supposed to go in Poland. He continued:\n\n       Those tests are funded, and will continue, so we will have \n     two ways to address this threat.\n\n  The following week Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michele \nFlournoy testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee and she \nalso expressed a commitment to continue to develop this two-stage \nground-based interceptor. Presumably the thought is it could be located \nat another site in Europe or perhaps somewhere on the east coast of the \nUnited States of America, to give that second line of defense to our \nentire country.\n  Secretary Flournoy said when they were discussing the canceling of \nthe European missile defense program, Secretary Gates ``had to be \nconvinced of a couple of things.'' Those are her words, namely that \n``we could still''--I am quoting Secretary Flournoy--Secretary Gates \nwanted to know that:\n\n     we could still defend the United States homeland should an \n     Iranian ICBM threat develop earlier than what was predicted \n     [and] that we should have technical options should the \n     development of later Blocks . . . of SM-3 missile, either \n     fail or be delayed.\n\n  That is exactly what we have been talking about.\n  In response to these requirements, Secretary Gates told his staff--\nagain I quote Secretary Flournoy:\n\n     we are going to continue the development of the 2-stage \n     ground-based interceptor as a technological hedge--\n\n  against the failure to adequately develop these alternative long-\nrange systems, the missile defense systems against an Iranian threat.\n  Here is the problem. Despite this administration's statements of \nsupport for continued development and testing of the two-stage ground-\nbased interceptor, the Defense appropriations bill before us has \nreduced funding for that program by $151 million.\n  I gather the Department of Defense has already appealed this \nreduction, arguing that it would force the cancellation or postponement \nof a pair of two-stage GBI tests soon, and that losing this funding \ncould render the entire ground-based mid-course defense system less \neffective.\n  Now comes the amendment Senator Sessions and I and our cosponsors \nhave offered, which would restore the funding by allowing the Missile \nDefense Agency to access no less than $50 million and up to the \noriginal $151 million of funds provided in fiscal year 2009-2010 \nDefense Appropriations Act for a long-range missile defense system and \nuse those funds to support the continued development and testing of the \ntwo-stage ground-based interceptor. The amendment would also fence \nfunding for the two-stage program to protect it from being reprogrammed \nand require a report detailing specific options for how the two-stage \nGBI can be used to enhance the defense of the United States against the \nemerging threat of Iranian long-range missiles.\n  Bottom line, this acknowledges on my part the disappointment at the \ndecision the administration has made. It doesn't try to turn it around, \nbut says OK, under the new administration program we are going to do at \nleast as good, maybe a little better, at protecting Europe and the \nMiddle East, but we are going to do worse at protecting the United \nStates of America from a long-range missile, which the Iranians \nparticularly are working so hard to develop. So let's at least keep \ntesting this missile we have got, the ground-based interceptor, as a \nhedge so we are ready in case these other alternatives don't work, to \nput it in the ground in Europe or perhaps in the east coast of the \nUnited States to give the American people the two lines of defense they \ndeserve against an Iranian long-range missile, and thereby to close \nwhat will now be a ballistic missile defense gap for the United States \nof America that will otherwise develop in the middle of the next decade \nand go on, in my opinion, for at least 3 years.\n\n  Again, I thank Senator Sessions. It is always a pleasure to work with \nhim. This is complicated stuff. But it is the heart of our national \nsecurity in the next decade. I hope my colleagues will support our \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to say how much I have \nenjoyed the clarity and integrity with which Senator Lieberman has \nstated the situation in which we find ourselves. It comes from great \nexperience over a number of years, both on the technical matters of \nmissile defense and on the geopolitical threats this Nation faces. I \ncertainly value his opinion.\n  I would share one thought with my colleagues. I hope my colleagues \nwill understand this. What happened in this year's budget request was a \nmajor shift from a very long lead plan to develop a very robust missile \ndefense system.\n  We can disagree about some of the details of this or that. But let me \ngive some examples of what has occurred: In this year's budget request, \nthe President canceled the Kinetic Energy Interceptor, the KEI. It was \na high-speed missile that would be less expensive and have great \ncapability, particularly in the ascent-phase of an attack against the \nUnited States. The president's budget zeroed that out. We have been \nworking on that for quite a number of years.\n  They also are working toward and doing research on an MKV, a Multi \nKill Vehicle, in which you can put on a single ground-based interceptor \nbooster three or more kill vehicles, that could knock down multiple \nmissiles or decoys. The budget zeroed that out.\n  We had a plan we have been developing for a number of years to \ndevelop an airborne laser, have a laser on an airplane that can fly in \nan area where you may expect a launch to occur. It does not have to be \nvery close but in the region. They catch a missile in the boost phase. \nThe laser can hit it and knock it out of the sky. It is a remarkable \ncapability. That has been debated, I will admit, but it has been funded \nfor a number of years. It will be tested this year.\n  The Defense Department expects that test to be successful. We did \nhave enough money, or there was enough money in the bill to at least \ntest it. But after that, zeroed out. No funding for ABL.\n  So what about our ground-based interceptors and GMD system that we \nhave been working on for 30-plus years, spent over $20 billion on, that \nwas planned to implant 44 interceptors in Alaska--most of them in \nAlaska and some in California? That has been cut from 44 to 30.\n  What about the plan to deploy 10 in Poland and Europe to give us \nredundancy and protect Europe? Zeroed out.\n  So this is not just a little nibbling away in missile defense. This \nis an erroneous policy that makes me nervous. Because we have a system \nthat is ready to go forward. We stop it. We promise we are going to \nhave a new system out here 10 years from now. There's many a slip twixt \nthe cup and the lip. I am not sure whether we will ever get that done \nwaiting on some new system to come along.\n  As Senator Lieberman noted, the administration requested $151 million \nto be obligated for a long-range missile\n\n[[Page S10050]]\n\ndefense system in Europe. They requested that that money be used for \nresearch and development and testing of this two-stage system.\n  This amendment that Senator Lieberman and I have proposed would \nprohibit the diversion of that away from what the Obama administration \ninitially requested and to require it to be spent on the two-stage GBI, \nincluding options for deployment in Europe and elsewhere. So why is it \nnecessary? Well, the mark we are dealing with on the floor today cuts \nthe $151 billion from the BMD test and targets program element, and, \nthough the language itself does not expressly target this cut against \ntesting for the two-stage GBI, the Missile Defense Agency understands \nthis is what the Senate Appropriations Committee intends. Hence, they \nhave submitted to us an appeal letter and asked us not to do it.\n  MDA argues this cut will require cancellation of fiscal year 2010 \ntesting activities related to two planned two-stage GBI flight and \nintercept tests. We have proven the technology of the three-stage \ninterceptor. Therefore, it is simpler to have a two-stage one. We have \nto test it and develop it.\n  Such a cancellation, as occurs in this bill, will also impact data \ncollection applicable to the three-stage GBI requiring further testing \nin the future at additional costs.\n  Reduced funding would increase, risk, and delay the proving out of \nthe two-stage GBI avionics capabilities required for the European \ncomponent and future three-stage avionics capabilities. Slowing the \ndevelopment and testing of the two-stage GBI is inconsistent with the \nadministration's intent to continue such development as a hedge against \ndevelopmental problems for the SM3 Block IIa and IIB, the ones that are \nintended in the distant future for Europe.\n  So General Cartwright, our commander in Europe, has indicated, by \n2015, this would be a potential threat against the United States. That \nis why we have offered this language. I believe it is the right thing \nto do, to keep this program at least ongoing and not to waste the \neffort we have expended so far and complete the testing of the GBI, \nwhich can also be used in the United States as part of a layered \ndefense against incoming missiles also.\n  In the appeal submitted to the committee from the Department of \nDefense, they note this language:\n\n       Cancelling fiscal year 2010 activities for these tests \n     would have a major impact on the test program and on data \n     collection applicable to two-stage and three-stage ground-\n     based interceptors and associated M\n\n  So they say it would have a major impact on the program and the \nadministration has asked us to keep it. That is the purpose of this \namendment. I was hoping we could reach some sort of accord that we \ncould work on with the committee. I am not sure we have been able to do \nthat at this stage. But the matter is important. I hate to have to come \nto the floor and offer this amendment. I like to respect our \ncommittees. It is important. However, the concerns Senator Lieberman \nand I have explained today are why we felt it necessary to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to say to my friend from \nAlabama that the leadership, the manager of the bill, Senator Inouye, \nhas agreed, if we modify the amendment as we had agreed to modify it to \nsay: Not less than $50 million, and up to the $151 million could be \navailable for research, development, test, and evaluation of the two-\nstage ground-based interceptor missile, that the committee would accept \nour amendment by voice vote--if that is OK with my friend from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Lieberman. I have confidence in the \nchairman and the ranking member on that committee. Of course, it is not \nmuch different than what the mark is today. It is below what President \nObama requested. I think he has unwisely cut too much already from \nDefense. So I am uneasy about it.\n  But I am being a practical person, and knowing my colleagues would \nlike to go home, Senator Lieberman, I think that is maybe something I \nwould agree to. Perhaps you and I could talk briefly if we have a \nquorum call.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am glad to do that. But at the moment, I ask \nunanimous consent that we modify our amendment with the changes that I \nbelieve are at the desk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2616), as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2616, as modified\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Funding for Two-Stage Ground-Based Interceptor \n     Missile.--Of the amounts appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act for a long-range missile defense system \n     in Europe, or appropriated or otherwise made available for \n     the Department of Defense for a long-range missile defense \n     system in Europe from the Consolidated Security Disaster \n     Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009 (Public \n     Law 110-329) and available for obligation, $151,000,000 shall \n     be available for research, development, test, and evaluation \n     of the two-stage ground-based interceptor missile.\n       (b) Prohibition on Diversion of Funds.--Funds appropriated \n     or otherwise made available by this Act for the Missile \n     Defense Agency for the purpose of research, development, and \n     testing of the two-stage ground based interceptor missile \n     shall be utilized solely for that purpose, and may not be \n     reprogrammed or otherwise utilized for any other purpose.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than February 1, 2010, the Director \n     of the Missile Defense Agency shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report setting forth the \n     following:\n       (1) A comprehensive plan for the continued development and \n     testing of the two-stage ground-based interceptor missile, \n     including a description how the Missile Defense Agency will \n     leverage the development and testing of such missile to \n     modernize the Ground-based Midcourse Defense component of the \n     ballistic missile defense system.\n       (2) Options for deploying an additional Ground-based \n     Midcourse Defense site in Europe or the United States to \n     provide enhanced defense in response to future long-range \n     missile threats from Iran, and a description of how such a \n     site may be made interoperable with the planned missile \n     defense architecture for Europe and the United States.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Afghanistan and Pakistan\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I rise tonight, as we continue work on this Defense \nappropriations bill, to talk about the challenges we face in \nAfghanistan and Pakistan and will be sharing some thoughts tonight \nwhich I know are consistent with a lot of the concerns that have been \nexpressed over the last couple days and weeks and months about the \npolicy going forward and what we confront as a country when it comes to \nboth the strategy going forward with Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n  As we do in any conflict, with any threat, we face the grave question \nof war and what will happen to our military strategy, what we will ask \nof our troops, what we will ask of the American people, both in terms \nof our blood and treasure, as well as what is the strategy going \nforward.\n  I think when we confront the grave question of war, we have to get it \nright. I believe the stakes are higher with regard to Afghanistan and \nPakistan than they were even in the conflict we waged in Iraq. I \nbelieve the stakes are higher for our national security. So we have no \nchoice but to get it right. And when I say ``we,'' I think there is a \nlot of discussion, debate, and focus on President Obama and his \nadministration. That is appropriate because he is the Commander in \nChief.\n  But there is probably not enough discussion about what the Congress \nis going to do, what this Congress should do or not do and, in this \ncase, what the Senate should do or should not do. I think we would be \nbetter off spending our time focusing on a substantive and thorough \ndebate in the Senate rather than just pointing a finger at the \nPresident, the administration, and saying: They have to do this or the \nPresident must do this.\n\n[[Page S10051]]\n\n  It is important, when we talk about getting this policy right, that \nthe Senate gets it right. If the Senate puts the time in to debate and \ndiscuss these critical issues--and there is a lot to do in a rather \nshort amount of time. I believe the President should be given a \nreasonable amount of time to review this policy.\n  As we know, he set forward a strategy this past spring, in March, our \npolicy with regard to both Afghanistan and Pakistan. If you remember \nhow he articulated the mission, he talked about defeating al-Qaida, \ndisabling and dismantling al-Qaida, and he talked a lot in his remarks \nabout Pakistan, about what would happen with regard to our strategy in \nPakistan.\n  But I believe there has not been today in the Senate anything \napproaching a full and robust and thorough and substantive debate about \nwhat we are going to do going forward in Afghanistan or Pakistan. I \nhope people on both sides of the aisle, when we begin this debate--we \nhave done some of it; we need to do a lot more--that we don't just dust \noff talking points from the war in Iraq, that we don't just dust off or \nemploy sound bites. There is a time and place to use sound bites and \ndiscussions and debates. But if we are going to get this policy right, \nit is not going to be a Democratic solution or strategy only, and it \nwill not be a Republican solution or strategy only. We have to get it \nright. That means we have to do a lot better than we did when it came \nto the debate before and during the war in Iraq, which is still a \nconflict that is ongoing, even as we draw down troops. We have to have \na much better debate in the Senate on Afghanistan and Pakistan than \ntook place here with regard to Iraq. That is an understatement. Sound \nbites will not do it. Political rhetoric and positioning will not do it \nbecause that is not a full debate.\n\n  In short, what we have to do--the administration has to do it, but we \nhave to do it as well--in the Senate is get the strategy right and \ndebate the strategy before we have a long debate about resources. That \nis critically important. I know there are a lot of people in Washington \nwho want to focus on one or two issues and make it simple--you are \neither for or against this or that. We have a long way to go. We have \nnot had a debate about strategy. We have had a lot of discussion and \ncoverage of resources, be they troops or other resources, military or \nnonmilitary. We have not had a discussion about the strategy. We have \nto do that first--strategy before resources.\n  I had the opportunity, as many of our colleagues did in the summer, \nin August, to go to both Afghanistan and Pakistan for a limited period. \nBut even in a short amount of time, one can learn a lot--2 days in \nAfghanistan, 1 day in Pakistan. One of the highlights of my visit to \nAfghanistan, after having been there in May of 2008, was the briefing \nfrom General McChrystal, a tremendous and thorough overview of what is \nhappening on the ground, the threat to our national security as he sees \nit, also a review not only of the military strategy and the military \nchallenges but the nonmilitary as well.\n  Sitting at the same table with General McChrystal were distinguished \nAmericans who are serving us in nonmilitary capacities--the Department \nof State, the USAID, the Department of Agriculture, all kinds of help \nfrom various Federal Government agencies that involve the other part of \ncounterinsurgency, not only the military campaign.\n  Obviously, we have to do more than that. General McChrystal, like \nmany of his predecessors, is doing everything he can to get this right.\n  I, like others, have reviewed his classified report. We have heard \nhim give a summary of the strategy. It is very important that we weigh \nthose considerations and weigh that assessment seriously going forward. \nGeneral McChrystal's report is one of the things we have to weigh. We \nhave to weigh a lot of other things as well. We have to listen to \nexperts within our government and outside, experts within the \nadministration, experts in the Congress. The Senate is made up of so \nmany Senators who have long records on foreign policy as well as \nnational security and making sure we get this right. Some are \nDemocrats, some are Republicans, and some are Independents. I will draw \nupon, as we all should, that experience. I will talk more about that in \na moment.\n  One thing stressed by General McChrystal--and it has been stressed by \nPresident Obama and the administration and should be stressed by us--is \nthis policy, this strategy going forward in Afghanistan has to involve \na couple of basic elements. It obviously has to involve and be focused \non security. That is essential, obviously. But in addition to security \nand the military challenge, we also have to be concerned about \ngovernance. And we are concerned about the results of the election. We \nare concerned about whether President Karzai is doing what he needs to \ndo to govern his country, to have a strong judiciary, to deliver \nservices to his people, to make sure the people of Afghanistan have \nconfidence in his leadership.\n  So we have to be concerned about security and governance but also, \nthirdly, development, what is going to happen on the ground. A lot of \npeople working as part of provisional reconstruction terms, so-called \nPRTs, are doing great work on the ground. It is not in the newspaper \nvery often. It is not heralded like a battle is or like a controversy \nmight be, but that is part of building up communities throughout the \ncountry in Afghanistan so people can take control of their own lives, \ntake control of their own communities, and take control of their own \nsecurity and their own future.\n  We also had a chance to talk at length about what is happening in \nPakistan and the threats that come across the border from Pakistan into \nAfghanistan, threats that involve al-Qaida or other extremist or \ninsurgent groups that have some loose confederation with or connection \nto al-Qaida and threaten our national security, threaten the security \nof the Afghan people, and even threaten the security of the Pakistani \nGovernment. These are very difficult challenges we face. They do \ninvolve our national security. We have to get it right with regard to \nwhat we do in Afghanistan as well as in Pakistan.\n  I mentioned before there were a number of Senators in both parties \nwho have been trying to begin and amplify the debate. I happen to be a \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee. Our chairman, Senator Kerry, \nhas had a number of hearings on various aspects of this policy, not \nonly going back the last 2 or 3 weeks but going back months. That \ninforms this debate. Chairman Kerry has shown great leadership on these \nissues as well as broader national security issues.\n  Chairman Levin gave a speech recently that laid out a thoughtful \napproach. He talked about building up the Afghan Army and the National \nPolice prior to a serious consideration of additional troops. He wants \nto accelerate, as we all do, the building up of the Army and Police in \nAfghanistan and maybe in a much shorter timeframe. That is critically \nimportant. We have to spend a lot more time talking about and debating \nand informing ourselves about how best to accelerate the training of \nthe Afghan Army and Police. Chairman Levin, as well, has shown, through \nhis leadership of the Armed Services Committee, how important these \nissues are.\n  On the other side of the aisle, I read a Wall Street Journal piece \nrecently by John McCain, ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Lindsey Graham, and Senator Lieberman. We have to \nconsider those points of view, not just in that op-ed but in other \ndiscussions and debates on the Senate floor.\n  As I said before, there will not be one party that is going to solve \nthis. There is not going to be one party to implement a \ncounterinsurgency strategy because when it comes to war and when it \ncomes to the nonmilitary challenges we have that are connected to a war \nor a campaign, there is not a Democratic or Republican way to fight a \nwar. There is only an American way. We need an American solution. We \nneed a kind of consensus that we may not need on some other issues, but \non this one, to get it right, we are going to need both parties. And we \nwill need the support of the American people to get it right.\n  Finally, let me say one more word about why we are doing this, why we \nshould have a thorough debate going forward, why it is important we \nspend a lot of hours here, not just on the floor of the Senate but in \nhearings and\n\n[[Page S10052]]\n\ndiscussions and briefings with various experts who come before us, and \nto thoroughly question and ask the tough questions of the \nadministration.\n  I was glad we voted today on a list of administration officials we \nwant to come before the Senate after the President makes fundamental \ndeterminations about this policy. Once he has made a decision, then we \nshould have a series of hearings where we can cross-examine not only \nGeneral McChrystal and the underpinnings of his policy but so many \nothers in the administration, a very strong administration, I would \nargue, on foreign policy and national security. I will not go through \nall the names tonight that would give evidence to that.\n  Finally, if we are going to get this right for the fighting men and \nwomen we send out on the battlefield, if we are going to get this right \nfor taxpayers who will be financing this effort, whether it is military \nor nonmilitary, we do have to get it right. One thing we have to bear \nin mind is, when we send troops out to fight a battle, we have to make \nsure the policy that undergirds their fight, that the strategy that \nleads to a discussion about what the resources are to give them all the \nresources they need to fight a battle, whether it is very wide or very \nnarrow in focus, whatever it is, we have to make sure what we do here \nis worthy of their sacrifice; that what we do in the Senate on strategy \nor policy is worthy of what we are asking them to do on the \nbattlefield. We haven't done that yet. We are a long way from doing it.\n  I hope in the next couple of weeks, even as the President is asking \ntough questions and making determinations about policy, that we do our \njob in the Senate to ask those tough questions, to have that important \ndebate, and make sure it is substantive and not political; make sure it \nis about strategy and not just the politics or the sound bites of the \nmoment. To be worthy of their valor, those fighting men and women, and \nto be worthy of their sacrifice, we have to do our job in the Senate. \nThat has not happened yet. We have to make sure we do that in short \norder.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 2563; 2585; 2617; 2559; 2562, as Modified; 2568; 2614; \n                                and 2615\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to consider the following list of amendments that I will \nidentify, if not pending, then once this agreement is entered, the \namendment be considered called up for consideration; and that the \namendments be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table en bloc; that no amendments be in order to \nthe amendments included in this agreement; further, that if there are \nmodifications to any of the listed amendments, then the amendment be \nmodified and agreed to, as modified: Nos. 2563, 2585, 2617, 2559, 2562, \n2568, 2614, and 2615; and further that amendment No. 2569 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith\n\n[[Page S10053]]\n\nthe esteemed Senator from Hawaii, the chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Inouye.\n  The bill before us includes a significant cut of $9 million from U.S. \nSOCOM's SCAR Program--special operations combat assault rifle. The SCAR \nwas selected in a fair and open competition and has undergone some of \nthe most rigorous testing of any small arms program in U.S. history. It \nis widely regarded as one of the best and most versatile weapons in the \nworld. While this weapon has passed all tests, the only issue now is \nwhat mix of versatility--7.62mm models or 5.56mm models--they want to \nhave at the ODA level operational detachment alpha--that is the Special \nForces A team level which is as close to the ground level fight as you \ncan get.\n  I understand there are recent concerns regarding contracting delays \nand the ability to obligate these funds. I have been assured by SOCOM \nthat they will be able to spend all funds requested within the \nappropriate timeframe. The Special Forces is intensely engaged in \ncombat operations all over the world including Afghanistan and they \nneed the versatility and capability offered by this unique weapon \nsystem. The President's Budget included $9.746 million for this \nprogram. The House-passed version of this bill fully funds the \nPresident's request. I would encourage the chairman to ensure this \nprogram is fully funded in the Senate as requested in the President's \nbudget.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his comments. \nI assure him that the reductions to the program were taken without \nprejudice, and the committee supports providing this capable series of \nrifles to Special Operations Command. His points on the importance of \nthis program will be fully and carefully considered when this issue is \naddressed in conference on this bill.\n\n\n                    tactical wheeled vehicle funding\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. Chairman, I request to enter into a colloquy \nconcerning appropriations for the Army's medium tactical vehicle fleet.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am pleased to engage the senior Senator from Texas in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. Chairman, the Army has recently announced its \ndecision on the future contract for the family of medium tactical \nvehicles, a major acquisition program in the Army's tactical wheeled \nvehicle fleet. Several Senators--some who may join us in this \ncolloquy--are deeply concerned about the Army's decision. However, \nsince the Army's announcement came after the committee finished its \nwork on this bill, Members of the committee had no opportunity to \nexpress their concern or to question the decision. Consequently, I have \nasked the Government Accountability Office to conduct a review of the \nArmy's tactical wheeled vehicle strategy. I would therefore like the \nchairman's commitment to having the Defense Subcommittee focus on this \nissue at the earliest possible opportunity.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would say to the Senator from Texas that I know she is \ngreatly interested in how the Army's tactical wheeled vehicle budget is \nspent. I hope that we will be informed by the GAO review that she has \nrequested, and I can pledge that the subcommittee will review this \nissue thoroughly as we go forward.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chairman for his leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the comments of the chairman and respect the \nwork of the Senator from Texas on this issue. The Army's decision \nimpacts both of our States, but it is imperative that GAO is allowed to \nconduct its investigation free of individual prejudices. The taxpayers \nand men and women of the Armed Forces deserve an objective review. I \nlook forward to working with the Chairman and all my colleagues on this \nissue.\n\n\n                    IN SUPPORT OF THE NCADE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \nchairman and with my colleague Senator Baucus about funding in this \nbill for missile defense. It is my understanding that in testimony \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year, \nLieutenant General O'Reilly told the committee that the Missile Defense \nAgency requested $3.5 million in fiscal year 2010 for the missile \ndefense program known as Net Centric Airborne Defense Element, NCADE. \nIt is my further understanding that the committee does not, at this \npoint, have concerns with the allocation of funds to the NCADE program. \nIs that correct?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The gentleman is correct. The bill before the Senate \nprovides $104.8 million for research, development, testing and \nevaluation of ballistic missile defense technology, which is the \nappropriate account for NCADE funding.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, NCADE is a missile defense concept that \nuses a modified AIM-9X seeker launched from an aircraft to intercept a \nboosting missile target. I am aware that the Missile Defense Agency has \nconducted several tests of this system and it continues to show \nprogress. I believe it is important that the Missile Defense Agency \ncontinue to develop this technology. Short- and medium-range ballistic \nmissiles pose a significant threat to the United States, our Armed \nForces, and our allies around the world. Could the chairman clarify \nthat the Missile Defense Agency could use funds provided in this bill \nfor the continued development of NCADE, consistent with the budget \nrequest?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Under the Senate bill, the MDA could continue to work on \nthis interesting technology.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the chairman. This is very important work for our \nnational security and we are pleased that some of it is being done in \nMontana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I want to echo the observations of my colleague. Work on \nthe NCADE project is done in part in Montana and that work provides \nvaluable employment opportunities in a part of the State where the \nunemployment rate is in double digits.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Fiscal \nYear 2010 National Defense Appropriations Act. Let me begin by thanking \nthe committee's distinguished chairman, Senator Inouye, and ranking \nmember, Senator Cochran, for their leadership in crafting this bill and \nfor their strong commitment to our Nation's Armed Forces.\n  This legislation will provide funding for essential training, \nequipment, and support to our troops as they bravely and skillfully \nengage in national security efforts at home and abroad. This is a \ncritical time in our Nation's history and the committee has, once \nagain, demonstrated its strong support of our soldiers, airmen, \nsailors, and marines.\n  This legislation also will fund critical force protection and health \ncare initiatives for our troops, while continuing development of \nimportant technologies and acquisition programs to counter existing and \nemerging threats.\n  The legislation before us includes a strong commitment to \nstrengthening Navy shipbuilding. Our Nation needs a strong and modern \nnaval fleet allowing us to project power globally and to respond to \nthreats. This bill authorizes $1 billion in funding for construction of \nthe third DDG-1000, a priority of mine. The Pentagon's decision to have \nBath Iron Works, BIW, build all three of the DDG-1000s demonstrates \nwell-deserved confidence in BIW and will help ensure a stable work load \nfor the shipyard and more stable production costs for the Navy.\n  In addition, this legislation authorizes $2.2 billion for continued \nDDG-51 procurement and nearly $150 million for the DDG-51 modernization \nprogram. The lessons and technology developed in the design of the DDG-\n1000 can be incorporated into the DDG-51 program to reduce crew size \nand to improve capabilities.\n  The legislation fully funds the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter request for \nboth the Navy and the Air Force. This aircraft, powered by the superb \nengines made by Pratt & Whitney, will enable our service men and women \nto continue to maintain our air superiority.\n  An additional $1.5 billion is included for the National Guard and \nReserve equipment account, which should help sustain critical equipment \nsuch as combat vehicles, aircraft, and weapons. This funding should \ndirectly benefit the Maine National Guard's readiness posture as \nadditional units prepare to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan in the \nupcoming year.\n  At the request of Senator Snowe and myself, the committee provides \n$20 million for humvee maintenance to be performed at Maine Military\n\n[[Page S10054]]\n\nAuthority's, MMA, Army National Guard Readiness Sustainment Site, RSMS, \nlocated in Limestone, ME. For nearly 13 years, the Army National Guard \nhas relied on Maine Military Authority to provide a dependable service \nto our Nation's warfighters. The dedicated and talented professionals \nat MMA have demonstrated their value to the Army and to the Nation and \nconsistently have performed humvee refurbishment at a lower cost than \nthe Army's own depots. This funding would help to ensure that MMA's \nvalued workforce and high quality product remain a national asset \nsupporting the defense of our country.\n  The bill also provides $240 million for cancer research through the \nDefense Health Programs with $150 for the Breast Cancer Research \nProgram, $80 million for Prostate Cancer Research Program, and $10 \nmillion for the Ovarian Cancer Research Program. I believe that there \nis simply no investment that promises greater returns for America than \nits investment in biomedical research. These research programs at the \nDepartment of Defense are important to our Nation's efforts to treat \nand prevent these devastating diseases that also affect our veterans \nand service members.\n  The bill provides $307 million to address the Tricare private sector \nshortfall in fiscal year 2010 as identified by the Department of \nDefense. I know Tricare funding is vital to so many Maine veterans. We \nmust continue to support robust funding for this important program and \nlimit increases in Tricare premiums and copayments.\n  I strongly support the additional $15.6 million to strengthen the \nOffice of the Inspector General in order to keep pace with the growth \nin the size of the defense budget and the number of defense \ncontractors. More vigorous oversight of defense contracts to prevent \nwaste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars will complement the \nprocurement reforms we approved earlier this year.\n  The Senate's fiscal 2010 Defense appropriations bill also includes \nfunding for other defense-related projects that would benefit Maine and \nour national security. Funding is provided, for example, to Saco \nDefense in Saco, ME, to enable the company to continue manufacturing \nweapons that are vital to the Armed Forces.\n  In addition, at my urging, the legislation appropriates $3.6 million \nfor the University of Maine. This funding would support the development \nof LGX high temperature acoustic wave sensors and allow the University \nof Maine to continue to investigate fundamental sensor materials and \ndesign concepts as well as demonstrate functional prototypes of \nacoustic wave sensors that will be tested under extreme temperature \nenvironments. The funding for the university will also provide for \nwoody biomass conversion to JP-8 fuel, which will provide affordable \nalternative sources for military aviation fuel.\n  The appropriations bill provides the vital resources that our troops \nneed and recognizes the enormous contributions made by the State of \nMaine to our national security. From the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in \nKittery to the Pratt and Whitney engine plant in North Berwick to BIW's \nshipbuilders to the University of Maine's engineers to the Maine \nMilitary Authority in Aroostook, Mainers all over our State are leading \nthe way to a stronger national defense.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there has been a tremendous amount of work \ngoing into getting us to where we are now. It is long and tedious and \none of the most complicated bills we do. It is the most complicated \nappropriations bill we do. So I very much appreciate the work done by \nSenators Cochran and Inouye. They are both experienced and terrific \nindividuals and great Senators, their staffs, and all the floor staff.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of H.R. 3326 on Tuesday, October 6, the following list of \nfirst-degree amendments be the only amendments remaining in order to \nH.R. 3326, other than any other pending amendments, if not listed, and \nthe committee substitute amendment; that no second-degree amendment or \nside-by-side amendment be in order to any of the listed amendments, \nexcept as provided below:\n  Franken amendment No. 2588; Barrasso amendment No. 2567; Bond \namendment No. 2596; Coburn amendment No. 2565; Coburn amendment No. \n2566; Kyl amendment No. 2608; that once agreement is entered into, it \nwill be withdrawn; Sanders amendment No. 2601; Inhofe amendment No. \n2618; McCain amendment No. 2580; McCain amendment No. 2584; McCain \namendment 2560, with an Inouye side-by-side amendment in order and \nwould be voted prior to the vote in relation to amendment No. 2560; \nMcCain amendment No. 2583; Lieberman-Sessions amendment No. 2616, as \nmodified; that it be in order for the managers to offer managers' \namendments, which have been cleared by managers and leaders, and that \nif offered, the amendments be considered and agreed to and the motion \nto reconsider laid on the table; that in the case in which the managers \nare agreeable with a modification of a listed amendment, then the \namendment be so modified with the changes agreed upon; that upon \ndisposition of the listed amendments, the committee-reported \nsubstitute, as amended, be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid on the table; that the bill, as amended, be read the third time, \nand the Senate then proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended; \nthat upon passage, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate, with the subcommittee appointed as conferees; provided further \nthat if a point of order is raised and sustained against the substitute \namendment, then it be in order for a new substitute to be offered, \nminus the offending provision; that the new substitute be considered \nand agreed to, no further amendments be in order, with provisions in \nthis agreement listed after adoption of the original substitute \namendment remaining in effect; that the vote sequence with respect to \nthe listed amendments be entered later and that the only debate time \nremaining be 2 minutes, equally divided in the usual form, prior to \neach vote; and that on any sequenced votes, the vote time be limited to \n10 minutes each after the first vote; further, that the cloture motions \nbe withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nDisability Employment Awareness Month. This annual observance is an \nopportunity for us to celebrate the achievements of people with \ndisabilities, whose contributions to the workforce have strengthened \nour Nation. During the month of October, we pay tribute to these men \nand women while renewing our commitment to ensuring opportunity and \ninclusion for all Americans--regardless of their ability or disability.\n  National Disability Employment Awareness Month originated in 1945 \nwhen Congress designated a week in October as a time to educate the \npublic about the employment issues facing people with disabilities. \nEventually expanded to the entire month of October, the observance has \nbecome a valuable tool to enhance the American people's understanding \nof these issues. It is also\n\n[[Page S10055]]\n\nan important opportunity to mark the progress we have made and the \nsteps forward yet to be taken.\n  Today, more people with disabilities than ever are graduating from \nschool, participating in their communities, and succeeding in the labor \nmarket. For the tens of millions living in the United States with a \ndisability, realizing the American dream is a real possibility that \noften did not exist a generation ago. I am especially heartened by the \ngrowing recognition that tapping these individuals' talent, character, \nand hard work is as important to the Nation's future as it is to \ntheirs.\n  At the same time, we must acknowledge the sobering reality that faces \ntoo many people with disabilities, including our brave servicemembers \nand veterans returning from war with severe injuries and conditions. \nWhile people with disabilities have long experienced far higher \nunemployment rates, they are also particularly hard hit by the current \neconomic downturn. Physical, financial, and social barriers to \nemployment remain, as well as the discrimination and prejudice that \nkeep some from competing in the American economy on equal footing as \neveryone else. Moreover, many individuals with disabilities struggle to \nafford good, continuous health coverage, a hardship given their \nintensive health care needs.\n  Clearly, we have much work ahead of us in order to fulfill the \npromise of National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I am pleased \nthat Congress is continuing to work toward this priority, most recently \nwith the enactment of the ADA Amendments Act and the Higher Education \nOpportunity Act. On behalf of all Nevadans, I look forward to building \non these successes in the 111th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S10055-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN C. HOUBOLT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Presdient, on July 20, 2009, we celebrated the 40th \nanniversary of the first time man set foot on the Moon. On that day 40 \nyears ago, an estimated 500 million people around the world watched as \nthe crew of Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin \n``Buzz'' Aldrin, made history. It was a remarkable accomplishment, the \nmagnitude of which has not diminished over the years.\n  As part of the anniversary festivities, Congress awarded John Glenn, \nthe first American to orbit the Earth, and the crew of Apollo 11 the \nCongressional Gold Medal. I cosponsored the legislation and am pleased \nthat they were recognized with it.\n  Most recently I had the chance to meet two Illinois astronauts, Scott \nAltman and John Grunsfeld, whom earlier this year successfully \ncompleted the last service mission of the Hubble Telescope. We will be \nable to explore even deeper into the mysteries of our universe for many \nyears to come because of their incredible work.\n  Today, I wish to recognize Dr. John C. Houbolt, a scientist born and \nraised in Joliet, IL, who has received far less acclaim, but who \ndeserves our Nation's gratitude for making the Moon landing possible.\n  One of the most important and hotly debated technical decisions \nduring the Apollo Program was how to land on the Moon and return safely \nto Earth. Amid many ideas and obstacles, Dr. Houbolt recognized that \nthe most efficient way to execute the Moon landing was with a lunar-\norbit rendezvous plan.\n  His concept involved a mother craft that would orbit the Moon while a \nlighter craft descended from it to the surface of the Moon carrying \nsome of the astronauts. Eventually, the smaller aircraft would lift off \nand rendezvous with the mother ship.\n  For many years NASA's leadership favored other concepts to reach the \nlunar surface. But, Dr. Houbolt's determination, persistence, and \nperseverance moved this innovative concept forward. As former NASA \nDeputy Director George Low noted, without Dr. Houbolt's efforts, NASA \n``might not have chosen the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous Mode'' and ``had the \nLunar Orbit Rendezvous Mode not been chosen, Apollo would not have \nsucceeded.''\n  On the 40th anniversary of the lunar landing, as we celebrated with \nthe crew of Apollo 11 in Washington, DC, a new exhibit aptly named \n``The Soaring Achievements of John C. Houbolt'' opened at the Joliet \nArea Historical Museum. I encourage my fellow Illinoisans, especially \nstudents, to visit this exhibit.\n  Dr. Houbolt's inspiring story, like the stories of Neil Armstrong, \nMichael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, and John Glenn, is a testament to what we \ncan achieve with persistence and the passion to reach for new heights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S10055-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING JAMES D. RANGE\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, earlier this year, we lost a \ngreat Tennessean and champion of the great American outdoors. James D. \nRange was a lifelong outdoorsman who loved America's wild spaces. He \ngrew up in Johnson City, TN, hunting and fishing in the backwoods of \nthe Appalachian Mountains. It was in his those early years that Jim--\nwho was also an Eagle Scout--became passionate about preserving our \noutdoors for future generations.\n  He became a passionate advocate for the country's fish and wildlife \nand their habitat and a true champion of natural resource conservation.\n  Jim was a trusted advisor and counsel to Senate majority leader \nHoward Baker and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, \nwhere he served with integrity and distinction. As a Senate staffer, \nJim was instrumental in the crafting and passage of a string of \nlandmark laws, including the Clean Water Act.\n  After Jim left the Senate, he continued to pursue his love for the \noutdoors by cofounding and serving as chairman of the Theodore \nRoosevelt Conservation Partnership, an organization that is dedicated \nto the stewardship of America's natural landscape, helping to expand \nfish and wildlife habitat and increasing public access to quality \nhunting and fishing.\n  Jim didn't stop there. He furthered his commitment to the cause of \nconservation through service on the boards of directors for Trout \nUnlimited, Ducks Unlimited, the Wetlands America Trust, the \nRecreational Boating and Fishing Foundation, the American Sportfishing \nAssociation, the American Bird Conservancy, the Pacific Forest Trust, \nthe Yellowstone Park Foundation, the Bonefish and Tarpon Trust, the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Interstate Commission on the \nPotomac River Basin, the Sportfishing and Boating Partnership Council, \nand the Valles Caldera Trust.\n  Jim was so instrumental in the conservation movement in this country \nthat he was awarded the U.S. Department of the Interior's Great Blue \nHeron Award, was named Conservationist of the Year in 2003 by Outdoor \nLife magazine and received the Norville Prosser Lifetime Achievement \nAward from the American Sportfishing Association.\n  Both our natural and political environments are better because of Jim \nRange. Tennesseans, and all Americans, owe Jim a great debt of \ngratitude. His leadership serves as a great example to all of \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S10055-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10055-S10056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CECIL EYESTONE\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I recognize a great Kansan \nfor his long service to the youth of the State of Kansas.\n  ``Teaching by example,'' was Cecil Eyestone's philosophy in his 31-\nyear Kansas 4-H career. He served 12 years as a Montgomery County club \nagent and 19 years as a State 4-H specialist. He was a pioneer for \nleadership opportunities for teens. Cecil initiated the first junior \nleaders club for the teens in Montgomery County. His determined \nattitude for developing teen leaders through hands-on experiences \nresulted in 80 percent of Kansas counties adopting the concept. A State \nJunior Leadership Camp was held in 1959 at Rock Springs 4-H Center that \ncontinued for 15 years with annual participation of 200-300 youth. \nCecil and his brother Merle have sponsored a 4-H leadership scholarship \nfor 24 years.\n  Cecil was Collegiate 4-H Club adviser for 16 years, reaching over \n4,000 students. He organized eight collegiate clubs at other Kansas \nuniversities and colleges. Cecil guided the animal science 4-H program \nand helped develop horse, dog and rabbit projects. He created the Horse \nPanorama to teach horse care and judging.\n\n[[Page S10056]]\n\n  Retired in 1977, Cecil volunteers for the Governor's Mental Health \nAdvisory, National Active and Retired Federal Employees, Sertoma, Riley \nCounty Flint Hills AMI, Methodist's Men and First United Methodist \nChurch, Flint Hills Veterans Coalition and KSU WWII Veterans Memorial. \nHe stays busy with his family, but finds time to judge 4 to 10 county \nfairs annually.\n  Last year, Cecil was inducted into the National 4-H Hall of Fame. \nThis Sunday, October 4, 2009, Cecil will be honored at a special \nreunion of the 4-Hers he mentored during his time as the Montgomery \nCounty 4-H agent. During this reunion, the first two recipients of a \nscholarship named in Cecil's honor will be announced. These \nscholarships were made possible by donations from the 1946-1957 \nMontgomery County 4-H alumni.\n  As a former 4-H member myself during Cecil's tenure as the State 4-H \nspecialist, it is an honor for me to speak on behalf of the thousands \nof Kansas 4-Hers who were touched by Cecil's commitment to the Kansas \n4-H program. It is a privilege for me to honor this fine Kansan for his \nleadership and service and to join in congratulating him on his \ninduction into the National 4-H Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S10056-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING HARVEY STOWER\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I \npay tribute to a dear friend and a great Wisconsinite who passed away \nearlier this week. Harvey Stower was an extraordinary man; he was a \ndeeply principled legislator, a dedicated mayor, and a beloved friend \nto those of us lucky enough to know him.\n  I was honored to serve with Harvey in the Wisconsin Legislature, \nwhere he worked tirelessly for the progressive values he held dear. His \ncommitment to representing family farmers and protecting the \nenvironment were an inspiration to countless Wisconsinites.\n  He then served as the mayor of Amery, where he and his wife Marilyn, \nwho sadly passed away in 2008, were pillars of the community. Harvey \nwas such a wonderful mayor because he understood the strength of our \nsmall towns, and cherished the sense of community they create.\n  Harvey was also an ordained United Methodist minister, and an active \nmember of his community in countless ways, both through his work as \nmayor and through many community organizations.\n  He also remained active on issues on a statewide level, through his \nservice on the Wisconsin Land & Water Conservation Board and the boards \nof the Wisconsin Federation of Cooperatives, the Western Wisconsin \nIntergovernmental Collaborative, Wisconsin Church and Society--the \nUnited Methodist Church, and Inter-County Cooperative Publishing \nAssociation.\n  Harvey's passing is an immeasurable loss for his family, for the \npeople of Amery, and for our State. He was truly one of the nicest \npeople I have come across in many years in public life. I respected \nHarvey so much, and I will always think of him as someone who \nrepresented the very best of Wisconsin. I join people across our State \nin remembering him today and honoring the many contributions he made to \nhis State and his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S10056-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10056-S10057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARY PAPPEY\n\n Mr. KERRY.

It is often said that when \nGod closes one door, He opens another. And that is how Mary came to us. \nShe was a homemaker whose happy life was upended when her husband \nNicholas passed away in 1988. To help fill the void, she asked if she \ncould volunteer in our office a couple of days a week. And she has been \nthere ever since.\n  It is hard to remember a time that Mary hasn't been there in my \nBoston office, whether answering phones, handling mail, or just making \nsure everyone is OK doing whatever had to be done. She is an incredible \nmother to her children; in so many ways she has also been a mother to \nour Boston office family. And always, she has been a calming presence \nin what can be a hectic environment. It helps, too, that she bakes a \nmean baklava that can bring some needed sweetness to the most frenetic \nof work days.\n  But that isn't all. Far from it. Mary has had a very special job in \nmy Boston office. Since joining my staff, she has advanced all the \napplications we have received from students seeking appointments to the \nmilitary service academies. She has made sure the applications are \ncomplete, all deadlines are met and, when necessary, held the hands of \nanxious applicants and even more anxious parents of applicants. For 21 \nyears, Mary has handled this job with special skills and sensitivities. \nAnd, in fact, she has shepherded through an entire generation of \nservice academy appointees from Massachusetts.\n  Mary's grandchildren, the joys of her life, call her ``Yaya,'' which \nis Greek for grandmother. I think we could all call her that, because \nshe has been a kind of grandmother to all of us--someone who offers \nreassurance when it is needed, someone who puts her heart and soul into \neverything she does, someone to watch over all of us, with kindness and \naffection. I can't recall a time I didn't get a huge hug from Mary \nwhenever I came by the office.\n  I should also mention that Mary has a special way with words, or \nrather, with one word in particular the word ``dear.'' At some point, \nshe has referred to everyone in the office as ``dear,'' especially when \nthey are having a rough day. That is not surprising. But what is \nsurprising is how, when she is helping with the phones, Mary often \naddresses the caller as ``dear.'' Again, that is not surprising, except \nwhen you consider that sometimes it is an anonymous caller, someone so \nfrustrated by what they just saw on television or by the run around \nthey are getting from Federal bureaucracies that can at times seem \nunreasonably cold, that they don't want to identify themselves. But it \nis hard for them to stay mad with Mary calling them ``dear.'' She \nbrings out the very best in all of us.\n  So, I want to thank ``dear'' Mary for her devotion to the people of \nMassachusetts, for all her years of service on my staff and for being \nsuch a wonderful, generous friend. And I especially want to wish \n``dear'' Mary all of my best and hope that this will be a very happy \nbirthday.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord a poem written by Mr. Albert Carey Caswell.

HOVNANIAN\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the \nmemory of Kevork S. Hovnanian, a friend and New Jersey businessman and \ncommunity leader. A hard working Armenian immigrant, Mr. Hovnanian \nembodied the American dream. Already the owner of a successful \nconstruction company in Iraq in 1959, Mr. Hovnanian was forced to flee \nIraq and arrived in New Jersey to rebuild his life, and rebuild it he \ndid.\n  He started another construction company and, along with his brothers, \ncommitted himself to making affordable housing available to young \nfamilies and first-time home buyers--first in New Jersey, then \nnationwide. He built a successful business and, at the same time, gave \nsomething back to the community, to New Jersey, and to the Nation. \nThrough his chosen profession, he shared his realization of the \nAmerican dream by helping others establish themselves in their own \nhomes and took pride in having helped. As his business grew, Mr. \nHovnanian never forgot his adopted community and generously supported \nnumerous charities and organizations. His philanthropy touched the \nlives of all of us in New Jersey. Every child who enters the K. \nHovnanian Children's Hospital at Jersey Shore University Medical Center \nbenefits from his generosity. Every worshiper who enters St. Stepanos \nArmenian Church in Elberon, New Jersey knows Kevork Hovnanian \ngenerously supported its construction in memory of his mother. He \nremained committed to bringing the Armenian genocide to light and \nsupporting Armenian autonomy. He was a man who worked hard, achieved \nhis dreams, but always believed in the concept of community, each of us \nworking together for the betterment of all.\n  As we celebrate Kevork Hovnanian's life and memory, our heartfelt \nthoughts and prayers are with his family and friends, his beloved wife \nSirwart, and his sons, daughters, and grandchildren who will miss his \nlove and laughter. May he rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S10057-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RECOGNIZING SMRT\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, on Thursday, October 8, citizens of \nthe city of Portland will gather at the steps of City Hall to witness \nthe proclamation of John Calvin Stevens Day on the 154th anniversary of \nhis birth. The most renowned architect in Maine's history, Mr. Stevens' \ndistinctive style is recognizable in numerous structures throughout the \nregion. Today, I rise to acknowledge the company he founded, now known \nas SMRT, as we celebrate the 125th anniversary of its founding.\n  SMRT's founder, John Calvin Stevens, was born in Boston in 1855, and \nmoved with his family to Portland 2 years later. On July 4, 1866, Mr. \nStevens witnessed the devastating Great Fire of Portland, which was \nresponsible for 1,800 buildings burning to the ground, as well as the \nsubsequent reconstruction of the city. After completing high school, he \njoined Francis H. Fassett's architectural firm, which did much of the \nwork to rebuild the city in the fire's aftermath.\n  Following a decade at the Fassett firm, Mr. Stevens founded his own \none-man architectural firm, John Calvin Stevens Architects, in 1884 in \nPortland. Mr. Stevens ran this business until his death in 1940, during \nwhich time he received over 300 commissions to design or update a \nvariety of structures on the Portland peninsula alone, from government \nbuildings to churches to residential houses. The Stevens family remains \ninvolved in the company's day-to-day operations, as Mr. Stevens' great-\ngrandson, Paul Stratton Stevens, is one of the company's principals.\n  Above all other techniques, John Calvin Stevens is known as a pioneer \nand promoter of the quintessentially New England ``shingle'' style. \nMost often associated with the Maine coast and the Boston area, the \npractice is essentially an adaptation of the Victorian-era Queen Anne \narchitectural style with the additional of shingles. The cottage-like \nhouses built in the style frequently feature wide porches, broad \ngables, graceful and distinct profiles, and, of course, wooden shingles \nlining the roofs and sides. Because of Mr. Stevens' diligent efforts, \nthis style became a mainstay of seaside and residential homes across \nthe region.\n  As the continuation of Mr. Stevens' multidisciplinary brainchild, \nSMRT--previously known as Stevens Morton Rose & Thompson to represent \nthe last names of the company's partners--is a widely recognized expert \nin the areas of architecture, engineering, planning, and interior \ndesign. SMRT designs and constructs functional spaces and aesthetically \npleasing edifices for its plentiful clientele. The company now has \nadditional offices in Manchester, NH; North Andover, MA; and Albany, \nNY.\n  Throughout its lengthy history, SMRT has been responsible for \ndesigning, building, altering, or restoring countless landmark \nbuildings across the State of Maine. SMRT lent its architectural \ntalents to the new Dorothy Walker Bush Pavilion at Southern Maine \nMedical Center in Biddeford, as well as the Eastern Maine Medical \nCenter pediatrics wing in Bangor. The company has also had a hand in a \ndiverse range of interior design projects at Bowdoin College in \nBrunswick, Fairchild Semiconductor in Portland, and the Burton M. Cross \nState Office Building in the State capital of Augusta. Additionally, \nthe firm has completed projects for other companies in a variety of \nindustries, including: bioscience and healthcare, food and beverage, as \nwell as clean manufacturing and electronics.\n  One area where SMRT has distinguished itself is in green design, \nparticularly as a member of the U.S. Green Building Council, which \noversees the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, LEED, \naccreditation process. The LEED, green building certification system \naims to provide energy savings through building design that reduces \ncarbon dioxide emissions and improves overall indoor environmental \nquality. SMRT offers its clients the opportunity to engage in the LEED \ncertification process, and consistently keeps energy concerns at the \nforefront when planning new buildings by utilizing natural daylight and \nemploying cutting-edge technologies. In fact, the Maine General Medical \nCenter's Harold Alfond Center for Cancer Care in Augusta, which was \ndesigned by SMRT, recently received a LEED silver certification, and is \nthe first health care facility in Maine to achieve the status.\n  In short, John Calvin Stevens is responsible for much of the way \nPortland looks today--from the Old Port to the houses of the Western \nPromenade--and his legacy is carried on today in the company he \nfounded, SMRT, and the intricate and stunning work they do. I am proud \nthat John Calvin Stevens saw it fitting to choose Portland for his \ncompany's home 125 years ago, and I am delighted that it has remained a \nbedrock of our State's architectural heritage through all of these \nyears. Congratulations to everyone at SMRT on this monumental \nanniversary, and best wishes for continued success. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S10057-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10057-S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S10058]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S10058-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S10058-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:56 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1289.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Tennessee urging the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) to accept Rhea County's proposed donation of its \n     old hospital building, facilities, and campus to the VA and \n     to utilize such building, facilities, and campus to locate a \n     VA medical facility at such site; to the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 546\n\n       A Resolution relative to the location of a U.S. Department \n     of Veterans Affairs medical facility in Rhea County.\n       Whereas, East Tennessee is in great need of a medical \n     facility to serve its brave veterans; and\n       Whereas, because of Rhea County's central location, the \n     location of a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \n     hospital there would serve approximately 30,000 veterans from \n     East Tennessee, North Georgia, and Northern Alabama; and\n       Whereas, presently, veterans living in East Tennessee must \n     travel 150 miles to the Alvin C. York VA facility in \n     Murfeesboro for medical treatment; this extensive travel \n     creates a hardship for most of these veterans; and\n       Whereas, Rhea County has recently opened a new hospital and \n     has generously offered to donate its old hospital building, \n     facilities, and campus to the VA for the express purpose of \n     locating a much needed medical facility there to serve the \n     veterans of East Tennessee; and\n       Whereas, the Old Rhea County Medical Center building could \n     be easily modified to house 150 beds, and the building is \n     still equipped with modern technology and modern operational \n     systems; and\n       Whereas, easily accessible from U.S. Highway 27, the old \n     Rhea County hospital property includes 132 vacant acres that \n     could be utilized for expansion in the future; and\n       Whereas, in addition to serving the medical needs of our \n     East Tennessee veterans, the location of a VA medical \n     facility in Rhea County would create new jobs in the area; \n     and\n       Whereas, our veterans have sacrificed a great deal in \n     defending and protecting our Nation, and the State of \n     Tennessee and the Federal Government should work together to \n     adequately provide for the medical needs of these valiant \n     citizens; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the one hundred \n     sixth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the Senate \n     concurring, That this General Assembly strongly urges and \n     encourages the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to accept \n     Rhea County's proposed donation of its old hospital building, \n     facilities, and campus to the VA and to utilize such \n     building, facilities, and campus to locate a VA medical \n     facility at such site.

A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to increase the number of \nchildren eligible for free school meals, with a phased-in transition \nperiod; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, in a country as wealthy as ours, it is \nshameful to let any child go hungry. That is why today, Senator \nMurkowski and I are introducing the Expand School Meals Act. By \neliminating the reduced price meals category and replacing it with the \nfree meal program, this legislation will ensure that low-income \nchildren are not denied nutritious food during the school day if their \nfamily can't afford to pay for it.\n  It is important to remember that this will improve student readiness \nfor school. Parents have long known, and recent studies confirm, that \nchildren cannot learn on empty stomachs. Hungry children perform worse \non achievement tests, have trouble concentrating, and are more likely \nto act out in school. Securing access to healthy foods for low-income \nchildren is therefore not only a means of reducing child hunger, but \nalso an important strategy for narrowing the achievement gap.\n  There are 3.1 million low-income children across the Nation, and \n54,000 children in Minnesota are eligible for reduced-price school \nmeals. This means that the families of these children pay for part of \ntheir children's school meals. Currently, these families must pay 40 \ncents for each lunch and 30 cents for each breakfast their children eat \nat school. While this may not sound like a lot of money to members of \nCongress, to a family that is barely scraping by, especially in today's \neconomy, the cost can be prohibitive.\n  In this tough economy, a growing number of these families simply can \nno longer afford to pay. Low-income children in Minnesota and across \nthe country are increasingly being turned away from school lunch \ncounters because they don't have enough money in their meal accounts. \nIn some districts, children in the reduced price meal program are \nhumiliated when they are forced to pay small fees in front of their \npeers, or when they are handed cheese sandwiches instead of regular \nmeals on the days they cannot afford to pay. It then becomes abundantly \nclear to all of their peers in the lunchroom that they are in the \nreduced price program. Teachers in Minnesota and elsewhere have \nreported that many children choose to avoid this stigma by just \nskipping meals.\n  The indecency of turning away children from the school lunch counter \nbecomes all too evident when one hears the stories of the food service \nworkers and teachers who have to confront these children directly. In \nthe Roseville, Minnesota, school district, for example, schools \nrecently reported that parents with health problems showed up at the \ndistrict office unable to pay for reduced-price lunch. The families,\n\n[[Page S10063]]\n\nhowever, had too much income to qualify for the free lunch program. The \ndistrict policy is that children who cannot pay for school lunches can \nreceive cheese sandwiches for three days, and then must be turned away. \nRoseville cashiers and food service managers have been using their own \nmoney to cover children who they know cannot pay.\n  This situation is entirely unacceptable. It is unacceptable not only \nbecause we are allowing children to go hungry today, but also because \nwe know the impact of this hunger on their future. We know that \ninsufficient access to food will negatively affect their development, \nas well as their educational outcomes, which together will have a \nlasting impact on their ability to reach their potential.\n  Recent studies show just how devastating the impact of food \ninsecurity is on the academic and social outcomes of school children. \nFor example, researchers at Cornell and the University of Michigan \nfound that children ages 6 to 11 who lacked sufficient food had \nsignificantly lower arithmetic scores, and were more likely to have \nrepeated a grade than their peers. Furthermore, they found that \nteenagers who lacked sufficient food were almost three times as likely \nto have been suspended from school. Similarly, researchers at Harvard \nMedical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital found that children \nwho, according to their parents, were experiencing hunger, were two to \nfour times more likely than other children to repeat a grade, access \nspecial education services, or receive mental health counseling.\n  Based on this research, it is clear that child hunger must be one of \nthe factors that we address if we are serious about closing the \nachievement gap and giving every child in America a genuine opportunity \nto succeed.\n  I would like to conclude by commending my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle for their leadership in advocating for the extension of free \nschool meals to children of the working poor. These efforts began with \nSenator Elizabeth Dole, who in 2003 introduced a bill that would have \nalso phased out the reduced price meals category. And in 2004, Senator \nDole advocated for a provision to be included in the Child Nutrition \nand WIC Reauthorization Act that authorized a 5 State pilot project to \ntest the feasibility of eliminating the reduced price category. Funding \nfor this project, unfortunately, was never appropriated.\n  Some States and districts therefore decided to take matters into \ntheir own hands. I am proud to represent a State that decided to \neliminate the reduced price category for school breakfasts. Based on \nthe experience of these localities, we have learned that expanding \neligibility for free meals to children in the reduced price category \nsignificantly increases their participation in school breakfast and \nlunch programs.\n  In light of the experiences of these localities, and the difficult \neconomic times, I am hopeful that this will be the year that we expand \neligibility for free school meals. I urge all of my colleagues to join \nus in this endeavor and do right by our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1747. A bill for the relief of Javier Lopez-Urenda and Maria \nLeticia Arenas; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Javier Lopez-Urenda and his wife, Maria \nLeticia Arenas. Mr. Lopez-Urenda and his wife are Mexican nationals \nliving in Fremont, California, and the loving parents of three U.S. \ncitizen children, Bryan, age 16, Ashley, age 12, and Nancy, age 6.\n  I have decided to introduce this private bill to ensure that this \nfamily stays together because they have demonstrated an extraordinary \ncommitment to each other and the greater community in the Bay area. I \nbelieve Mr. Lopez-Urenda and Ms. Arenas merit Congress' special \nconsideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private \nbill.\n  Javier Lopez-Urenda was born in Michoacan, Mexico. When he was 19 \nyears old, his father was stabbed and murdered while working as a cab \ndriver. In 1990, at the age of 23, Mr. Lopez-Urenda came to the United \nStates to find a higher paying job to support his extended family. \nLeticia Arenas came to the U.S. at the age of 17 after her mother died \nof cancer. Mr. Lopez-Urenda and Ms. Arenas have now been living in the \nU.S.for almost 20 years.\n  Mr. Lopez-Urenda is the sole financial provider for his wife and \nthree U.S. citizen children and owns his own home. For over 17 years, \nMr. Lopez-Urenda has worked at Full Bloom Baking Company, a commercial \nbakery in San Mateo, California, and was the second employee that they \nhired. With Mr. Lopez-Urenda's help, the company grew to one of the \nlargest commercial bakeries in the Bay Area, which currently employs \napproximately 385 people in the bay area.\n  Full Bloom Baking Company has stated:\n\n       Javier is critical to the operation of our business. . . . \n     He holds a tremendous amount of `institutional knowledge' \n     that can never be replaced. He mentors and develops Team \n     members, conducts training classes, and has deep \n     understanding of complex industrial baking equipment and is \n     an expert on how to produce wonderful artisan quality \n     products from the intricate interactions of formula, people \n     and equipment.\n\n  Mr. Lopez-Urenda's coworkers have also written to me about his value \nto the company. Coleen Donnelly writes:\n\n       I am lucky enough to have worked with Javier briefly at the \n     bakery he helped build from the ground up. I always knew he \n     was in the room before I saw him. His presence is such a \n     positive force. He has the natural ability to manage and lead \n     people and make it all seem like play, not work. Without \n     Javier at the bakery, the lives of hundreds of people will \n     change.\n\n  With the encouragement of his employer, Mr. Lopez-Urenda sought legal \nadvice in 1996 in an attempt to legalize his status. However, the \nenactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration \nResponsibility Act, IIRIRA, eliminated his ability to apply for \nsuspension of deportation.\n  Mr. Lopez-Urenda also attempted to legalize through his employer, but \nthe labor certification remained unadjudicated for nearly three years. \nOnce the Department of Labor granted his labor certification, Mr. \nLopez-Urenda could have legalized his status but for the fact that his \nremoval case had already been resolved against him due to the change in \nlaw.\n  When the Ninth Circuit Court denied his appeal, the Court \nacknowledged the compelling circumstances of Mr. Lopez-Urenda's case. \nThe court stated:\n\n       We are not unmindful of the unique and extremely \n     sympathetic circumstances of this case. By all accounts, \n     Petitioner has been an exemplary father, employee, and member \n     of his local community. If he were to be deported, he would \n     be separated from his wife, three U.S. citizen children, and \n     the life he has worked so hard to build over the past \n     seventeen years. In light of the unfortunate sequence of \n     events leading up this juncture and Petitioner's positive \n     contributions to society, Petition may very well be deserving \n     of prosecutorial grace.\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Lopez-Urenda faces deportation today despite his \nsympathetic circumstances and the significant positive contributions \nthat he and his family have made to society.\n  These contributions to the San Mateo and Fremont communities have \ntruly been exceptional. He is an active volunteer for the Women's \nFoundation of California, Lance Armstrong's Livestrong Foundation, the \nSaint Patrick Proto Cathedral Parish, the American Red Cross, and just \nlast year he was one of the key organizers of the California AIDS Ride.\n  Ms. Arenas has also volunteered in the community as a religious \nschool teacher at Our Lady of the Rosary Church, a health promoter at \nthe Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center, and a sexual assault counselor at \nBay Area Woman Against Rape.\n  My office has received 46 letters of support on behalf of this family \nstaying together in the community that they have helped build. Below \nare a few notable excerpts from the letters I have received reflecting \nthe impact of this family on the community:\n  Patricia W. Change, CEO of Feed the Hunger Foundation, former \nPresident/CEO of the Women's Foundation of California, and a prior San \nFrancisco Commissioner and U.S. Commissioner writes:\n\n       Mr. Urenda has always operated with the highest integrity. \n     Asking Mr. Urenda to leave the United States would deprive \n     his children of their father, an upstanding resident of the \n     country. It would deprive the community of an active \n     participant, leader, and volunteer.\n\n  The Bay Area Women Against Rape indicates that Leticia has been \n``successful, available, [and] committed to the cause of breaking the \nsilence of sexual abuse in our community.''\n\n[[Page S10064]]\n\n  Judy Patrick, President/CEO of the Women's Foundation of California, \nwrites:\n\n       Javier Urenda is fulfilling tremendous needs within his \n     community. He is a model participant in this society.\n\n  Christine Bozzini, a friend and former coworker of Mr. Lopez-Urenda, \nwrites:\n\n       Javier strives to create a meaningful and rewarding life \n     with his children, focusing on supporting them in their \n     studies, as well as a variety of athletic pursuits and \n     personal interests. For example, over the last few years he \n     has taken great pride in traveling to various U.S. monuments \n     in order to teach his children about the birth of their \n     country.\n\n  One of the other compelling reasons for permitting these parents to \nremain in the United States is the impact that deportation would have \non their three U.S. citizen minor children, Bryan, Ashley, and Nancy.\n  All too often, U.S. citizen children face the loss of a parent \nthrough deportation. A January 2009 report by the Department of \nHomeland Security Office of Inspector General found that, over the last \n10 years, 108,434 immigrant parents of U.S. citizen children were \nremoved from this country.\n  A separate report completed this year by Dorsey & Whitney LLP for the \nUrban Institute affirms what many of us know--the deportation of a \nparent is deeply traumatic and causes long-lasting harm to U.S. citizen \nchildren.\n  Mr. John Arthur Balano, Head Coach and Faculty Instructor at the City \nCollege of San Francisco, has known Mr. Lopez-Urenda through his \nvolunteer work at Washington High School in Fremont, California. He has \nstated that Mr. Lopez-Urenda ``actively participates in the daily life \nof his children. Be it school, domestic, or extra-curricular \nactivities, socialization and citizenship, Javier is always furthering \ntheir growth.''\n  In addition, Ms. Marlene Davis, the Principal of Patterson Elementary \nSchool, where two of the Lopez-Urenda children currently attend, has \nwritten me, stating that:\n\n       Mr. Lopez-Urenda and his wife are very involved in their \n     children's lives and school work. If they were not, the \n     children would not be doing as well as they are. I think \n     without his presence, the children would definitely fare very \n     poorly indeed both because of the psychological shock of \n     having their father taken away but also academically because \n     their mother would not be as available and one half of their \n     scholastic support would be missing. . . . This would be a \n     terrible strategy which could be avoided if the children are \n     able to remain in the same stable environment with two loving \n     and supportive parents who are committed to their children's \n     success.\n\n  Enactment of the legislation I am introducing today on behalf of Mr. \nLopea-Urenda and Maria Leticia Arenas will enable this family to \ncontinue to remain in the U.S. and make positive contributions to each \nother and their extensive community in Fremont, California.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1747\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR JAVIER LOPEZ-URENDA \n                   AND MARIA LETICIA ARENAS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Javier Lopez-Urenda and Maria Leticia Arenas shall \n     each be eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa or for \n     adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence upon filing an application for \n     issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of status to lawful \n     permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Javier Lopez-Urenda or Maria \n     Leticia Arenas enter the United States before the filing \n     deadline specified in subsection (c), that alien shall be \n     considered to have entered and remained lawfully and shall, \n     if otherwise eligible, be eligible for adjustment of status \n     under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only to an application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or an application for \n     adjustment of status that is filed, with appropriate fees, \n     within 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Javier Lopez-\n     Urenda or Maria Leticia Arenas, the Secretary of State shall \n     instruct the proper officer to reduce by one, during the \n     current or next following fiscal year, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of that alien's birth under section 203(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if \n     applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that are made \n     available to natives of the country of that alien's birth \n     under section 202(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     FullBloom Baking Company,\n\n                                        Newark, CA, July 20, 2009.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing you to ask for your \n     help to support my key employee and friend, Javier Lopez-\n     Urenda, and his family in their efforts to lawfully remain in \n     the United States. Mr. Lopez-Urenda's case is extremely \n     sympathetic. He had the misfortune of beginning the process \n     of legalizing his status in the summer of 1996. It was prior \n     to the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). As you know, IIRIRA \n     brought a sea of change to our immigration laws, which has \n     now left Javier, his wife and their three U.S. citizen \n     children facing the imminent prospect of being forced to \n     leave the U.S., essentially forever.\n       Mr. Lopez-Urenda challenged the retroactive application of \n     IIRIRA to his case, but the Ninth Circuit Court has recently \n     ruled against him. While the Ninth Circuit case was pending, \n     based on humanitarian concerns and his extensive community \n     involvement, he sought deferred action of his removal from \n     the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (USICE). He \n     requested that the agency exercise its prosecutorial \n     discretion to grant a request for deferred action, \n     considering Javier's immigration history, length of U.S. \n     residence, criminal history, and cooperation with law \n     enforcement, future admissibility, community attention and \n     humanitarian concerns. However, the agency denied his request \n     and has issued a surrender notice for Monday, May 24, 2004.\n       The Labor certification that my company, FullBloom Baking \n     Company filed for Javier on April 26, 2001, after 3 long \n     years, was finally granted on March 19, 2004. We immediately \n     filed a petition to immigrate Javier with the California \n     Service Center. Our lawyers have also filed a motion to \n     reopen and request for stay at the Board of Immigration \n     Appeals (BIA) for Javier, but I am told that it is unlikely \n     the BIA will grant such a motion if the USICE does not join \n     or does not oppose this motion. Therefore, I am requesting \n     that you call officials at USICE and urge them join or to not \n     oppose Javier's motion to reopen now pending before the BIA. \n     (Contact names and numbers attached). We acknowledge that \n     this type of action is only taken in the most extraordinary \n     cases, but as you will see below, Javier is an extraordinary \n     individual and a very well-respected member of his community.\n       Javier, a 42-year-old native of Mexico, first came to the \n     U.S. in March of 1990 and resides in Fremont, CA with his \n     wife and three U.S. citizen children, Bryan who is sixteen, \n     Ashley who is twelve, and Nancy who is six. In 1996, Javier \n     sought the advice of an immigration attorney and started the \n     process to legalize his status. Javier appeared at an \n     immigration hearing on January 29, 1999, where he attempted \n     to file for suspension of deportation but was informed that \n     because his court proceedings did not begin until September \n     7, 1997; he was not eligible for that relief. However, the \n     Immigration Judge remarked that ``[t]he Court believes that . \n     . . he would have been a good candidate for that relief and \n     appears to be a good person who would contribute to this \n     country in a meaningful and positive way.'' Javier appealed \n     the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), but \n     the BIA dismissed the case on February 14, 2002. Javier's \n     employer, FullBloom Baking Company, filed a labor \n     certification for Javier on April 26, 2001 which would make \n     him eligible for permanent residence, but the application has \n     not yet been approved. On March 15, 2002, Javier filed a \n     Petition for Review with the Ninth Circuit, which was \n     dismissed. He subsequently filed a petition for rehearing en \n     banc which was dismissed on January 2, 2004.\n       Javier has been a resident of the U.S. for more than 19 \n     years, and has never departed the U.S. since his first entry. \n     He has worked at FullBloom for the past 17 years where he now \n     is the Production Process Manager, managing the transition of \n     recipes from the R bench top prototypes to fully scaled up \n     production runs. He supervises four line supervisors and up \n     to 210 production employees in the company's daily production \n     of more than 346,000 pieces of artisan organic and natural \n     pastries that are distributed to a wide range of grocery \n     stores & cafes including FullBloom's largest client, \n     Starbucks Coffee Company (Nationally). Javier is critical to \n     the operation of our business which has grown from an idea in \n     1989 to a run rate of over $55MM/year in gross revenue. He \n     holds a tremendous amount of ``institutional memory'' that \n     can never be replaced. He mentors and develops Team members, \n     conducts training classes, has deep understanding of complex \n     industrial baking equipment and is an expert on how to \n     produce wonderful artisan quality products from the intricate \n     interactions of formula, people and equipment.\n       He is an outstanding member of his community; Javier has \n     helped to raise money for\n\n[[Page S10065]]\n\n     numerous local organizations and participates in the annual \n     AIDS Ride. He volunteers regularly with his son's swim team, \n     the local homeless shelters; Lance Armstrong's Livestrong \n     Foundation and is an active member of his local church. He \n     has absolutely no criminal history and has always attended \n     his court hearings and, with the help of his employer, has \n     tried repeatedly to legalize his status, but has been the \n     victim of changes in the law and a slow-moving labor \n     certification system. Moreover, Javier's removal from the \n     U.S. would render him effectively ineligible for future \n     immigration as he has more than one year of unlawful presence \n     and is subject to the ten-year bar to admissibility. Most \n     importantly, Javier's removal from the U.S. would cause \n     emotional and financial hardship to his family, especially \n     his three U.S. Citizen children. If his family remains in the \n     U.S. and he is removed, they would be unable to support \n     themselves, and more importantly, his U.S. citizen children \n     would be separated from their devoted father at a critical \n     point in their lives. On the other hand, if his children \n     accompany him to Mexico, they would suffer extreme hardship \n     in adjusting to life in a completely foreign country at the \n     ages of sixteen, twelve and six.\n       I thank you for your interest in and willingness to review \n     Javier's case. I will contact you to further discuss this \n     case once you have had a chance to review this letter. You \n     may also feel free to contact me at any time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Karen Trilevsky,\n     Founder & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 22, 2009.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: In February of this year, I stood \n     and applauded as you accepted the Anne B. Stanton Award for \n     Extraordinary Leadership and Dedication to Bay Area Youth \n     given to you by Larkin Street Youth Services. It was a great \n     moment, knowing the history of your involvement with the \n     agency and how it has allowed Larkin Street to survive and \n     flourish. As everyone knows, your actions were critical in \n     securing the future of this organization and the futures of \n     the many people it serves.\n       I am asking you now to consider another very important \n     intervention. Javier Urenda is set to be deported from this \n     country next week after 19 years of living here as a \n     responsible citizen. This action defies reason. He has a \n     family, a career, owns his home and gives back to the \n     community through volunteer work. He is exactly the kind of \n     person this country needs more of, not fewer!\n       I am lucky enough to have worked with Javier briefly at the \n     bakery he helped build from the ground up. I always knew he \n     was in the room before I saw him. His presence is such a \n     positive force. He has the natural ability to manage and lead \n     people and make it all seem like play, not work. Without \n     Javier at the bakery, the lives of hundreds of people will \n     change.\n       His family has relied on him to provide for them and he has \n     never let them down. The Urendas are part of their community, \n     part of what makes up this country as it has evolved. To send \n     him away is moving backwards. I urge you to take action to \n     reverse this destructive trend towards tearing apart families \n     that have the same right to be here as you and I do.\n       Senator Feinstein, this is a defining moment. Javier is not \n     the only one unfairly facing deportation. Many before have \n     been forced to leave and if this practice is left unchecked \n     many more will follow.\n       Please help. All of us who care about this issue are \n     grateful for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Coleen Donnelly.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Feed the Hunger Foundation,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, July 22, 2009.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am respectfully writing to you, \n     as a citizen, a prior San Francisco Commissioner and a \n     Commissioner of the United States, a former President & CEO \n     of the Women's Foundation of California, and the current CEO \n     of Feed The Hunger Foundation. I am writing in support of \n     Javier Urenda Lopez and urging you to allow Mr. Urenda to \n     remain in the United States as a lawful permanent resident, \n     eligible for citizenship to the United States of America.\n       Mr. Urenda deserves to be in the United States on both \n     procedural as well as personal grounds.\n       Mr. Urenda recently received an approved labor \n     certification (pending for the last three years), and is \n     finally eligible for adjustment of status. However, the \n     recently issued ``surrender notice'' takes effect on July 29, \n     2009. Had the approved labor certification been approved in a \n     timely manner, this current ordeal would have been \n     unnecessary. If the Board were to reopen his case, he could \n     adjust his status immediately and be a lawful permanent \n     resident.\n       I have had the honor and pleasure of knowing Mr. Urenda \n     over the past ten years as an employee of FullBloom Baking \n     Co., a volunteer of the Women's Foundation of California, an \n     active community member and a friend.\n       Mr. Urenda has, in the time that I have known him, been the \n     Managing Director of FullBloom Baking Co., supervising and \n     mentoring over 190 employees. His intellect, ability and \n     hunger to learn, and perhaps most importantly, his motivation \n     and spirit, has enabled FullBloom Baking Co. to become a \n     multi-million dollar business and a major contributor to \n     communities in California. FullBloom Baking Company is a \n     leader in the field of small businesses both in terms of its \n     treatment and advancement of employees, and in being a model \n     corporate citizen. No other company of which I am aware, \n     provides free bilingual courses in both English and Spanish, \n     computers, dentistry, a matching pension program, and \n     numerous gifts to all of their employees and to their \n     respective family members as FullBloom Baking Co. In \n     addition, this company contributes nearly $1 million per year \n     to the community. Mr. Urenda has made this possible.\n       I first met Mr. Urenda when he personally delivered baked \n     goods to the graduation party of 50 participants of the \n     Women's Foundation of California's welfare to work program. \n     Mr. Urenda could have sent one of his company's drivers to \n     deliver these donated goods. However, he wanted to support \n     those individuals who were struggling to gain skills and \n     become active contributors to the economy of this country--\n     just as he has done. Mr. Urenda has, since that time, become \n     a volunteer to the Women's Foundation of California, serving \n     on a committee determining which non-governmental \n     organizations would receive funding and assistance from the \n     foundation as well as mentoring young adults. Mr. Urenda has \n     always operated with the highest integrity. He is reliable, \n     hard working, and creative.\n       Mr. Urenda is an individual who contributes all of himself \n     to all of his endeavors. He has involved himself in the arena \n     of sports: engaging in five day bike-a-thons to raise money \n     for AIDS; running in races for his community and others; and \n     coaching swimming and soccer meets. He consistently takes \n     classes at night to improve his skills and resources in \n     management, business development, and in the arts.\n       On top of all that I described, Mr. Urenda is a devoted \n     father to three children of the United States who he is \n     teaching to be upstanding citizens of this country. Asking \n     Mr. Urenda to leave the United States would deprive his \n     children of his guidance, love, and mentorship. It would \n     deprive his children of their father, an upstanding resident \n     of this country. It would deprive the community of an active \n     participant, leader, and volunteer. It would deprive \n     FullBloom Baking Co. and its employees of an unparalleled \n     decision maker, manager, and mentor. And it would deprive our \n     country of an individual who lives up to the very values and \n     standards that make the United States a great nation.\n       If Mr. Urenda's family were to leave with him, it would \n     cause an extreme hardship to his wife and three children, \n     aged 6, 12 and 16. His children would leave the only country \n     they have ever known, to go to a country that they have never \n     visited and where they do not speak the language. Bryan, his \n     eldest son, would be unable to receive treatment for a \n     learning disability for which he has been diagnosed.\n       Thank you for your kind attention and assistance to this \n     matter. If you have any questions about Mr. Urenda, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Patricia W. Chang,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 21, 2009.\n     Re request for assistance in the case of Javier Lopez-Urenda \n         and family.\n\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: It is with the utmost faith that I \n     submit this letter to you, with the hope that you will \n     prevent a potentially devastating tragedy with exponential \n     ramifications from occurring by sponsoring a private bill for \n     my former coworker and friend, Javier Lopez-Urenda. It is my \n     understanding that at this time, the only hope for this \n     upstanding family man, leader, and community volunteer to \n     remain in the U.S. is through a private bill. Please sponsor \n     this outstanding person and prevent the senseless tragedy of \n     losing such a valuable contributor to our country.\n       During these past years of a complex legal battle, I have \n     often reflected on the irony that a person who so greatly \n     embodies the ideal citizen could be ejected from our country. \n     Javier is more than a model citizen. He goes beyond what any \n     average person would do to better his community, his \n     workplace, the lives of his family members, and himself. \n     Every year, Javier participates in charity events such as the \n     AIDS ride and the Providian Relay supporting organ donation, \n     as well as being an active member in his church and a \n     frequent contributor to many local food banks. At FullBloom \n     Baking Company, where we worked together for eight years, \n     Javier's leadership helped to launch the company and to \n     propel it into its newest phase of growth and success in a \n     new cutting edge facility, where staff and production levels \n     have recently doubled.\n       I've literally never known a more dedicated and loving \n     father. Javier strives to create a meaningful and rewarding \n     life with his children, focusing conscientiously on \n     supporting them in their studies, as well as a variety of \n     athletic pursuits and personal interests. For example, over \n     the last few years he has taken great pride in traveling to \n     various U.S. monuments in order to teach his\n\n[[Page S10066]]\n\n     children about the great country of their birth. I can think \n     of nothing more destructive and unfair to Bryan, 16; Ashley, \n     11; and Nancy, 5; than to either face separation from their \n     father, or to be forced to leave their country of origin, the \n     only country they have ever known.\n       During the years I've know Javier, he has been a great \n     inspiration to me and many others, sharing his captivating \n     warmth, his compassionate support for those who need help, \n     and his passion for learning (English, French, neuroscience, \n     politics--you name it!). To this day, I attribute my fluency \n     in Spanish to him, telling people, ``Everything I know, I \n     learned from Javier''. The thought that he, a person who \n     exemplifies the spirit and the triumph of America, is \n     threatened with deportation brings tears to my eyes and keeps \n     me up at night. It is utterly unfathomable the extent to \n     which our legal system has failed Javier and his family, \n     leading to this urgent plea for your support to quite \n     literally ``save'' them.\n       Please help to prevent this potentially disgraceful tragedy \n     through your crucial sponsorship.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Christina Bozzini,\n     Psychotherapist.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Physical\n\n\n                               Education, Athletics and Dance,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, July 22, 2009.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n     U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Sansome Street, San \n         Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am exceedingly humbled by \n     opportunity to write this letter on behalf of Javier Urenda. \n     It has been my good fortune to know Javier the past 18 years. \n     During this time I have been continually astounded at his \n     remarkable embrace of the very values we all share as \n     citizens of our great land.\n       As a person commitment to his family. their wellbeing, and \n     Javier actively participates in the daily life of his \n     children. Be it school, domestic, or extra-curricular \n     activities, socialization and citizenship, Javier is always \n     furthering their growth. His belief in family as a solid \n     foundation, where meals and private time is shared. Javier \n     fundamentally understands that these critical, formative \n     years are critical to his children's future so that they may \n     fully embrace the untold opportunities our great country \n     affords our citizens. Javier's belief is that when children \n     feel truly loved in the home, with a solid foundation of \n     right and wrong therefore, creating an intrinsic obstacle to \n     the many pestiferous temptations that the youths of today \n     encounter.\n       As well, Javier is a good husband, who works hard to \n     provide not only the material but, assuring that there is \n     always calm, reason, and attentiveness. Javier affection can \n     be found in simply hand picking flower rather than the \n     ostentatious. I have witnessed thoughtful his response in \n     uncomfortable situations rather than pugnacious. Always \n     respecting and embracing the other point of view, nurturing \n     too, the love of his wife. It's that constant striving for \n     synergy that constantly amazes me.\n       As a member of academia, I am proud that Javier continually \n     seeks knowledge and makes time to further his education. He \n     fundamentally understands that knowledge is power and with \n     that, his affect and direct contribution to society \n     magnified. I subscribe to the notion that each and every \n     single citizen contributes to our society; and the more \n     knowledgeable the individual, society's enrichment as a whole \n     is not insignificant. In my lifetime, with extreme \n     confidence, Javier is a shining example to that end.\n       The strong sense of community in Javier is expressed by his \n     deeds. He was volunteer coach for me when I was the Head \n     Track and Field Coach at Washington High School in Fremont, \n     California. There, Javier assisted with the distance runners \n     who had many levels of athleticism and talent, His grassroots \n     approach and caring for each student/athlete as an individual \n     and maximizing their own individual potential made that \n     diverse group flourish. Beyond the track, they had the \n     highest GPA on the team. To this day, I firmly believe that \n     Javier's influence in embracing challenge and to look at it \n     not as an obstacle but, as an opportunity, played a \n     significant role in their academic success,\n       Holding dear the notion of our country's diversity, Javier \n     has participated in several AIDS Rides, personally raising \n     thousands of dollars to contribute to fighting that virulent \n     disease. Annually, he volunteered for a transition station \n     with the Providian Relay which supports organ donation. At \n     present he continues to support a myriad of other events and \n     community fund-raisers through his running and cycling \n     efforts. He lends time too, to the less fortunate in feeding \n     the homeless within the community. All the while, Javier \n     shuns kudos for his efforts and is embarrassed by any \n     attention as he believes that is what a neighbor typically \n     does for his fellow human being.\n       Penning this letter to you gives me great pride. In our \n     United States, during these very trying times, Javier Lopez-\n     Urenda is a beacon for responsibility, accountability, \n     compassion, and active citizenship.\n       I hope that I have conveyed to you my thoughts on Javier \n     and why he should remain a part of our country. He has \n     contributed to our society immensely thus far by being who he \n     is; a person with strong family values understands the \n     significance of education, volunteerism, and hard work in \n     making the United States the leader of the free world it is \n     today. It is those very tenets that many of us hold dear; yet \n     Javier embodies them. He has been encouraging to each person \n     he meets, be it in passing or those in need and a trusted and \n     loyal friend.\n       There are citizens in our land from all walks of life, from \n     every possible background and social status that comprise the \n     bedrock in continuing to make our country strong. Javier is \n     the type of person that makes us a better land and continues \n     to remain a shining light of limitless opportunity.\n       I pray that the good Lord will allow for the rendering of a \n     favorable decision to allow Javier to remain in the country \n     that I love.\n       Thank you so very much in allowing me to be a voice for my \n     dear friend.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               John Arthur Balano,\n     City College of San Francisco.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Patterson School,\n\n                                     Fremont, CA, August 25, 2009.\n     Re Javier Lopez-Urenda.\n\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein, I am writing on behalf of Javier \n     Lopez-Urenda's United States citizen children. They have all \n     attended Patterson Elementary School. Nancy, the youngest, is \n     currently in first grade this year. Ashley graduated from \n     sixth grade last year. Bryan graduated about five years ago.\n       The Lopez-Urenda children have sometimes struggled \n     academically, particularly Bryan. However, as a result of \n     keen parental involvement, they are doing well. Mr. Lopez-\n     Urenda has volunteered his time as a coach for after-school \n     sports that Bryan was involved in. Teachers have reported \n     that he and his wife are actively involved in their \n     children's school activities and meet with teachers in order \n     to support their children's schoolwork and try to help them \n     address areas of concern.\n       All the children have been a pleasure to have in school. As \n     an educator, I can tell you that I have witnessed the \n     spectrum of parental involvement from parents who are \n     actively involved in their children's lives to those who are \n     at best minimally engaged in their children's activities. \n     Javier Lopez-Urenda and his wife are very involved in their \n     children's lives and schoolwork. If they were not, the \n     children would not be doing as well as they are. I think \n     without his presence, the children would definitely fare very \n     poorly indeed both because of the psychological shock of \n     having their father taken away but also academically because \n     their mother would not be as available and one half of their \n     scholastic support would be missing. In my experience, that \n     void is generally filled with bad behavior, bad influences, \n     poor decisions and academic deterioration. With three \n     children who struggle in school already, I honestly cannot \n     foresee anything positive for the children in the future if \n     their father is no longer living with them and supporting \n     their academic milestones. Rather, I imagine it would be \n     quite possible that they would drop out or flunk out. This \n     would be a terrible tragedy which could be avoided if the \n     children are able to remain in the same stable environment \n     with two loving and supportive parents who are committed to \n     their children's success.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Marlene C. Davis,\n     Principal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Bay Area Women Against Rape,\n\n                                       Oakland, CA, July 21, 2009.\n     U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service,\n     St. Albans, VT.\n       To Whom It May Concern: This letter pertains to Javier L \n     Urenda and it gives me great pleasure to furnish you with \n     pertinent facts and information about this extraordinary \n     supporter of the oldest rape crisis center in the nation, Bay \n     Area Women Against Rape (BAWAR).\n       I have known Mr. Urenda for nearly a year. I had the \n     privilege of meeting Mr. Urenda through his wife Leticia \n     Arena at that time when she was taking our intensive state \n     certified rape crisis training. One of the things that is \n     crucial towards the successful completion of our training is \n     the support that trainees receive from their family members. \n     Not only are participants trained for three months, but they \n     are also in commitment to volunteer 36 hours per month for 9 \n     consecutive months after their certification. I believe that \n     without the support that Mr. Urenda gave to Leticia during \n     her training and during her volunteer activities at our \n     agency she would not had been as successful, available or \n     committed to the cause of breaking the silence of sexual \n     abuse in our community.\n       In addition, Mr. Urenda not only gives constant support to \n     his wife's social responsibility, but he also is an active \n     participant in our fundraising events. Mr. Urenda has shown \n     to be a strong supporter for our walkathon in benefit of \n     sexually assaulted youth. Just last month, Mr. Urenda went to \n     his employer at Full Moon and bravely asked for an in-kind \n     donation of 500 delicacies to be given away to walkers the \n     day of the event. This came to BAWAR's great surprise since \n     we did not expect this massive contribution. Mr. Urenda has \n     far exceeded our expectations and by far surpassed the in-\n     kind donations that other advocates have tried to acquire \n     from local donors. It was for this reason that Mr. Urenda \n     holds a very special place in our agency.\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\n       To this end and without reservation, I strongly believe \n     that Mr. Urenda will be a wonderful and positive addition to \n     our community. If you have further questions or concerns, \n     please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kristina Molina,\n     Latina Outreach Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                         The Women's Foundation of California,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, July 22, 2009.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Women's Foundation \n     of California, we are writing to convey our support for \n     Javier Urenda to remain in the United States and become a \n     lawful permanent resident.\n       Javier is a vital member of his community who participates \n     at all levels: he is a hardworking and dedicated employee of \n     FullBloom Baking Company, a Newark, California based company \n     which did $58 million in business last year; he is a devoted \n     husband and father to three US citizen children; and he is an \n     important role model to community members and co-workers. \n     Javier was the second person hired by FullBloom and has \n     helped grow FullBloom to a company which now has 388 \n     employees. Javier's dedication, technical know-how and \n     effective management abilities have been critical to \n     FullBloom's success. The local community has been well served \n     by FullBloom, which provides employment, health benefits and \n     educational opportunities to its employees and their \n     children. Javier's community would also be severely impacted \n     if it were to lose his volunteer efforts in his children's \n     schools and his tireless fundraising for charity.\n       The Women's Foundation of California has a long history of \n     supporting immigrants and immigrant communities throughout \n     the state. Through our research, grantmaking, and other \n     programs, we have seen many of the benefits that new \n     Americans give to our economy, society, and our overall \n     infrastructure. The state's economy would suffer tremendously \n     without the incredible achievements of immigrants.\n       Javier has recently received an approved labor \n     certification (which had been pending for nearly three years) \n     and is now eligible for adjustment of status. However, he has \n     been issued a ``surrender notice'' which takes effect on July \n     29, 2009. If he is forced to leave the country, he would be \n     barred from returning for 10 years causing his children and \n     his employer enormous hardship. If Javier were granted a stay \n     of his deportation order, he could adjust status immediately \n     and be a lawful permanent resident.\n       We understand that the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service has established immigration policy to meet the needs \n     of this country and others. Javier Urenda is fulfilling \n     tremendous needs within his community. He is a model \n     participant in this society and deserves to remain here \n     legally.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Judy Patrick,\n                                                President and CEO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1748. A bill to establish a program of research, recovery, and \nother activities to provide for the recovery of the southern sea otter; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the introduction of the \nSouthern Sea Otter Recovery and Research Act.\n  The southern sea otter is a keystone species that plays a critical \nrole in central California's kelp forest ecosystem. By maintaining a \nhealthy and productive ecosystem capable of supporting many other \nmarine species, they also contribute to California's $22 billion ocean \ntourism, recreation, and fishing industries.\n  Already listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, \nsouthern sea otters recently experienced their largest population \ndecline in over a decade. They face a variety of threats, including \nfood limitation, disease, and habitat degradation--but the exact causes \nof their decline are unknown.\n  Sea otters are a sentinel species that serve as an indicator of \necosystem health, so this population decline is extremely alarming. \nUnderstanding and addressing the causes of this decline would help us \nprotect the health of our kelp ecosystems as a whole.\n  My legislation would require the Department of the Interior to \nmonitor the population of southern sea otters and assess the major \nfactors limiting their recovery. It would also establish a competitive \ngrant program for research and recovery projects.\n  The language has been drafted in consultation with numerous \nscientists, agency officials, conservation groups, and fishermen. \nCompanion legislation was reported by the House Natural Resources \nCommittee by voice vote in May, and passed the full House of \nRepresentatives in July. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto achieve a successful outcome in the Senate.\n  With this legislation, we can finally put the southern sea otter on a \npath to recovery--and restore central California's magnificent kelp \nforests to a healthy, thriving condition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/01/senate-section/article/S10067-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 297--TO RECOGNIZE THE DYKE MARSH WILDLIFE PRESERVE AS \n                    A UNIQUE AND PRECIOUS ECOSYSTEM\n\n  Mr. WEBB submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 300, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 300) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of Fire Prevention Week and the work of firefighters in \n     educating and protecting the communities of this Nation.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 300, \nsupporting the work of firefighters to educate and protect the Nation's \ncommunities, and the goals and ideals of Fire Prevention Week. Senators \nCarper, Dodd, and McCain join me in sponsoring this resolution to honor \nand promote the life-saving work of the National Fire Protection \nAssociation.\n  Fire prevention is an ancient concern. Two thousand years ago, the \ncity of Rome not only had had thousands of paid firefighters, but also \nwardens who would patrol the streets and enforce fire-prevention laws.\n  Thousands of American cities and towns such as San Francisco, \nChicago, and Portland, ME, have suffered disastrous fires in the past. \nEven in our agrarian, Colonial era, cities such as Boston and \nPhiladelphia were organizing paid and volunteer fire companies to fight \nthe hazards of fire.\n  Today, flames continue to exact a deadly toll on citizens and \nfirefighters every year. The National Fire Protection Association \nreports that in 2008, an estimated 1.45 million fires in this country \nkilled nearly 3,320 civilians and injured another 16,705, while also \nkilling 103 firefighters.\n  When President Harding designated the first Fire Prevention Week in \n1922, fires were killing about 15,000 Americans every year. Advances in \nsafety technology, education, fire prevention, and firefighting have \nbrought great progress in reducing the number of fatalities, especially \nconsidering the great increase in population. But fire still poses an \nenormous threat to life, health, and property of all Americans.\n  As a cochair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I have \nproudly joined in bipartisan efforts to honor the heroic service of our \nfirefighters and to support legislation to assist them in securing the \npersonnel, equipment, training, and benefits they need. Today, I am \nproud to submit this resolution to support their work in educating the \npublic on the vital concern of fire prevention.\n  The more people understand the importance of avoiding fire hazards \nand dangerous practices, of installing and maintaining smoke alarms, \nand of planning escape routes, the fewer lives will be lost among our \ncitizens and our firefighters.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me in support of this resolution in \nsupport of our firefighters' work and of the Fire Prevention Week of \nOctober 4 through 10, 2009.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 300) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 300\n\n       Whereas since the organization of the first fire \n     departments during the colonial era of this Nation, \n     firefighters have maintained their dedication to protecting \n     the health and safety of the American public;\n       Whereas firefighters presently provide a multitude of \n     services to our communities, including emergency medical \n     services, special rescue response, hazardous material and \n     terrorism response, and public safety education;\n       Whereas 103 firefighters lost their lives in the line of \n     duty in 2008;\n       Whereas the Nation's fire departments respond to emergency \n     calls nearly once per second and are dispatched to fire \n     emergencies every 22 seconds;\n       Whereas approximately 1,145,000 fires were reported in \n     2008;\n       Whereas firefighters always respond with courage, whether \n     they are confronted with\n\n[[Page S10078]]\n\n     acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or other emergencies;\n       Whereas Fire Prevention Week is the longest running public \n     health and safety observance on record, as firefighters have \n     been honored for their role in educating the American public \n     since the first Fire Prevention Week was declared by \n     President Warren G. Harding in 1922;\n       Whereas the National Fire Protection Association has \n     designated the week of October 4 through October 10, 2009, as \n     Fire Prevention Week; and\n       Whereas educating all Americans to ``Stay Fire Smart'' \n     continues to be a priority for all firefighters: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the work of firefighters in educating and \n     protecting the communities of this Nation; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Fire Prevention Week.\n\n  Mr. REID.
