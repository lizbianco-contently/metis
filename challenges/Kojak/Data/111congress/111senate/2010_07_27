Madam President, I come to the floor to say thank you to \nsomeone who has, for more than 20 years, been my right hand on Capitol \nHill. Tom Faletti is one of the most decent, honest, and caring persons \nI have ever known. Tom came to work for me 24 years ago, when I was an \nunknown second-term Congressman from downstate Illinois and he was a \n20-something idealist with a master's degree in public policy and a \ndetermination to change the world. We have been a team for 24 years.\n  Now Tom is preparing to leave Capitol Hill for a new career--not to \ncash in as a K Street lobbyist but to work at an inner-city high school \nas a teacher. I know he is going to be an excellent teacher because I \nknow how much he has taught me about how to turn noble ideas into good \nlaws. Among the legislative accomplishments of which I am most proud, \nalmost all of them bear Tom's fingerprints.\n  Tom Faletti is a quiet, effective person, who has achieved more than \nmany of the most celebrated on Capitol Hill. He is a profoundly good \nperson, too--deeply spiritual, with a deep devotion to his faith, and \nhe is a remarkably patient man. How else could he have survived 24 \nyears with me? One of his greatest personal qualities is his \npersistence. He has great staying power, and when you consider that \nmany of the historic bills he has worked on require that kind of \npatience, you understand that is the key to his success.\n  Tom Faletti grew up in Antioch, CA, about an hour east of San \nFrancisco. He was one of six kids, all boys. His father worked in the \naccounting department of a steel mill. His mom was mostly a stay-at-\nhome mom who sometimes did child care to help make ends meet. He grew \nup in a neighborhood surrounded by aunts, uncles, cousins, and \ngrandparents, all living within blocks of each other. It was the \nFaletti equivalent to Hyannis Port. He met his wife Sonia in the \nfreshman dorm at Stanford University and they have been inseparable \never since. In fact, July 26 was their 30th wedding anniversary.\n  After earning his master's degree from Berkeley, Tom turned down some \ngood job offers in California because the issues he cared most about, \nsuch as ending poverty and hunger, were national issues. He asked his \nCongressman and my good friend George Miller for advice on how to get a \njob in Washington. George Miller replied: You have to be there. So, in \n1986, Tom and Sonia packed their belongings and drove across America in \ntheir 1978 blue Ford Fairmont. On the way they stopped in Chicago to \nsee the Cubs beat Tom's favorite San Francisco Giants at Wrigley \nField--the only time, until then, Tom had ever set foot in my State of \nIllinois.\n  Both Sonia and Tom arrived in DC without a job. Within a week, \nSonia--who Tom will concede is the much more talented of the two--\nlanded a job as a teacher. Tom had two interviews with both the U.S. \nCatholic Conference and Bread for the World. Both of them liked his \nresume but told him: Tom, you need some Hill experience.\n  Fortunately for me and the people of my State, Tom heard through a \nfriend of a friend that this fledgling Congressman was looking for a \npart-time legislative correspondent. Well, my office offered him a job, \ntrying to get rid of the growing backlog of mail in my congressional \noffice. We told him we just had enough money to pay him for 3 months, \nand we weren't sure what would happen after that. But 3 months later, \nTom Faletti turned a routine legislative correspondence assignment into \nproof positive of his potential. We promoted him to a legislative \nassistant position handling agricultural issues--not necessarily his \nforte, but I learned then and have learned ever since you can hand Tom \nFaletti any assignment and, in a short period of time, he will become a \nresident expert.\n  Two years later, the position of health care adviser opened on my \nstaff. Tom jumped at the chance and a real legislative partnership \nbegan. Tom's tireless and meticulous work on health care reform and \ntobacco control has literally saved lives in America. Tom helped to \ndraft the bill which I am so proud of, in which we banned smoking on \nall domestic airline flights more than 25 years ago.\n  Neither Tom nor I realized at that moment that that bill was a \ntipping point. The American people finally opened their eyes and said: \nIf it is unsafe to smoke on an airplane, then why is it safe to smoke \non a bus, on a train, in an office, in a hospital? Twenty-five years \nlater, we live in a different nation because that bill came at the \nright moment. That bill would not have happened were it not for Tom \nFaletti's good work.\n  He also drafted a bill that banned smoking in Head Start and other \nFederal children's programs--unthinkable, but it was considered pretty \nbold at the time. In 1998, he helped me organize the first \nInternational Conference on Tobacco Control that brought together \ncancer researchers and advocates from nearly 30 nations to help advance \nthe cause of tobacco control around the world.\n  He also worked to help preserve the historic settlement between \ntobacco companies and States when it appeared the Justice Department, \nunder President George W. Bush, might gut the settlement.\n  In the early 1990s, Tom Faletti helped draft what may have been the \nfirst meaningful regulation of tobacco.\n  It was the simple statement that captured where we ended up so many \nyears later, and it said:\n\n       The Food and Drug Administration shall regulate tobacco but \n     shall not ban it.\n\n  That was the political sweet spot, the middle ground where we \neventually ended up many years later.\n  At the time it seemed impossible, but FDA regulation passed last year \nand is now the law of the land.\n  In 1992, Tom helped draft a bill called health status rating in the \nsmall business health insurance market. That bill said simply that \ninsurers can't charge more because of a preexisting condition. Have you \nheard that phrase before? Do you remember that cause? It was the \npropelling force behind our health care reform that we just completed. \nPeople suggested then we could not prevail.\n  Tom knew where we needed to be as a nation, and today that bill--with \nminor changes--is the law of the land. It was included in the historic \nhealth care reform that President Obama signed into law.\n  Tom has helped achieve lifesaving change for America in so many other \nways, including increasing organ donations and improving health care \nfor veterans and their family caregivers.\n  In the early 1990s, he drafted a bill to create a pilot program of \nlong-term substance abuse treatment centers for women where they could \nbring their children with them, thus removing one of the main \nimpediments to women receiving lifesaving treatment.\n  The list of accomplishments bearing Tom Faletti's imprint goes on and \non.\n  When President Obama invited me to the White House a little over a \nyear ago to see him sign the Family Smoking Prevention and Control Act, \ngranting FDA the very power to regulate tobacco, which Tom Faletti \ncalled for so many years ago, I invited Tom to be by my side. I can \nrecall a dinner a few months ago when I was given recognition for all \nthe work I have done in the field of tobacco and looking out over the \naudience and all the people who have been helpful and spotting Tom. I \ntold the people there--and I say it today--that none of this would have \nhappened without Tom Faletti.\n  When President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act last March, I again asked Tom Faletti to join me at the White \nHouse and witness that historic event and see the new law, including \nthe preexisting conditions.\n  No member of my staff--or any other Senate staff--worked harder, over \nmore years, to make those two great achievements a reality.\n  There is one downside to finally winning so many long-fought battles; \nthat is, Tom has decided to retire--well, to retire from the Senate. He \nhas decided it is time to try a profession that he told me he always \nwanted to try, to become a high school teacher. He is going to teach at \nArchbishop Carroll, an inner-city Catholic high school in Washington, \nDC. I was not surprised because Tom has been a teacher for as long as I \nhave known him. He taught hundreds of my staff everything from spelling \nand grammar to the inside information on moving a bill and changing a \nnation.\n  I know Tom and Sonia decided long ago that life on Earth is about \nmore\n\n[[Page S6265]]\n\nthan material wealth. The lure of K Street never touched Tom Faletti. \nInstead of cashing in on his time in the Senate and his amazing \nexperience on Capitol Hill, Tom is actually leaving the Senate to take \na pay cut and teach in an inner-city high school. Those of us who know \nand love him are not surprised.\n  He will be teaching government and political science to 11th graders \nand a religion class on social justice--his great passion.\n  Tom said above the chalkboard in his classroom he will hang a sign \nthat reads: ``You can change your world.'' Tom has proven he can change \nthe world because he has changed America. He wants to show his students \nhow they, too, can reach that goal in their lives.\n  Tom will not need a textbook for that lesson. He can teach from his \nown experience because that is what Tom has done for 24 years as a \ndedicated staff member in the House of Representatives and the Senate. \nI was always proud to be Tom's friend and to learn so much from this \ngood man.\n  I thank Tom for his service, and I thank his wife Sonia and their \nchildren, Timothy, Joanna, and Luke, for sharing him with us for all \nthese years. I wish him the best of luck, and I say to the students at \nArchbishop Carroll: Listen carefully to Tom. I have for 24 years, and \nit has worked out pretty well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I will speak about a topic that is \ncentral to our national security and economic prosperity and which gets \nfar too little notice and attention; that is, the vulnerability of \nAmerica's network information systems, and the economic danger and \nnational security risks we face from cyber-theft, cyber-piracy, and \ncyber-attack.\n  We live in a wired society. If we sever those wires and the social, \neconomic, and communications linkages that make our way of life \npossible, we will cease to function. I am gravely concerned that we are \nnot taking the necessary steps to guard against this threat, which I \nbelieve is the greatest unmet national security need facing the United \nStates.\n  Earlier this month, the Intelligence Committee Cyber Task Force \nsubmitted a classified final report to the chair and vice chair of the \nIntelligence Committee. It was an honor to chair this bipartisan \ninitiative and to serve with my distinguished colleagues, Senator \nMikulski and Senator Snowe. I thank them for their diligence, their \nleadership, and their important contributions to this effort. They were \nexcellent and we made a good team.\n  We spent 6 months investigating cybersecurity threats and our current \nposture for countering those threats, with a particular focus on the \nintelligence community. It was a very sobering experience.\n  There is a concerted and systematic effort underway by nation states \nto steal our cutting edge technologies. At the same time, criminal \nhacker communities are conspiring to penetrate financial industry \nnetworks, rob consumers of their personal data, and transform our \npersonal computers into botnet zombies that can spread malware and \nchaos.\n  It is difficult to put a precise dollar figure on the damage and loss \nthese malicious activities are causing, but it is safe to say it \nnumbers in the many tens of billions of dollars--perhaps as high as $1 \ntrillion.\n  I believe we are suffering what is probably the biggest transfer of \nwealth through theft and piracy in the history of mankind.\n  In addition, we face the risk of attacks--attacks designed to disable \ncritical infrastructure, with grave potential harm to our national \nsecurity and to our financial, communications, utility, and \ntransportation sectors.\n  The intelligence community is keenly aware of the threat and is doing \nall it can within existing laws and authorities to counter it. The bad \nnews is the rest of our country--including the rest of the Federal \nGovernment--is not keeping pace with the threat.\n  I am encouraged by the growing interest in Congress, where there are \nnow more than 40 bills pertaining to cyber. I want to commend Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Snowe, in particular, for being at the leading \nedge of the Senate's efforts. They have spent more than a year fine-\ntuning their legislation, which speaks of their commitment to \nprotecting the country and their recognition that we cannot reduce our \nvulnerabilities without careful study and thoughtful engagement.\n\n  Much of the current debate on cybersecurity in the Congress focuses \non executive branch organization dealing with this threat. This is \nobviously an important issue, and it is one that we must resolve sooner \nrather than later. But the question of how this all gets organized \nwithin the executive branch is merely one of the many problem areas we \nsaw during the course of the work of the task force.\n  What are these other areas? Well, first of all, an overarching issue, \nwe must raise the public's awareness about cyber-threats; otherwise, we \nface an uphill battle trying to legislate in this challenging and \nsensitive policy sphere.\n  What is the problem? Well, threat information affecting the dot.gov \nand dot.mil domains is largely classified--often very highly \nclassified--and entities in the dot.com, dot.net, and dot.org domains \noften consider threat information to be proprietary and disclosing it \ncould be a risk to their business. So the result overall is that the \npublic knows very little about the size and scope of the threat their \nNation faces.\n  If the public knew the stakes--knew the cyber-criminals, for example, \nhave pulled off bank heists that would make Willie Sutton, Bonnie and \nClyde, and the James Gang look like a bunch of petty thieves, they \nwould demand swift action. If they knew the extent of the cyber-piracy \nagainst our intellectual property, and the economic loss that has \nresulted, the public would demand swift action. If they knew how \nvulnerable America's critical infrastructure is and the national \nsecurity risk that has resulted, they would demand action. It is hard \nto legislate in a democracy when the public has been denied so much of \nthe relevant information.\n  The first key point is public awareness. We have to share more \ninformation with the public about what is going on out there.\n  Second, we need to establish basic rules of the road. One of the \nsignal features of our cybersecurity risk profile is that the \noverwhelming majority of malicious cyber-activity could be prevented if \nsome computer users installed simple antivirus protections and allowed \nautomatic updates of their software.\n  If we followed basic rules of the road, there would be a national \nsecurity advantage: The Federal Government could focus its \ncybersecurity efforts on that narrower subset of threats that can evade \ncommercial, off-the-shelf technology. There would be economic advantage \nfrom the potentially massive reduction in cyber-crimes, such as \nidentity theft and credit card fraud.\n  Third, we need to empower the private sector to adopt a more \nproactive stance against cyber-threats. I am from Rhode Island. My \nState was founded as a sea trading State. When our traders were \nattacked by pirates, they got out their guns and fought back. Under \ncurrent law, companies under cyber-attack can do little more than \nbatten down the hatches. We need to look for more ways to help American \ncompanies better defend themselves.\n  Our courts provide one option. Creative technical experts and smart \nlawyers at Microsoft were able to mount a very impressive counterattack \nagainst the Waledac botnet by obtaining a Federal court order requiring \nthat VeriSign, the domain name registrar, cut off domains associated \nwith the botnet. This disrupted the botnet's command-and-control \nfunction, and it highlights an important possible role for our judicial \nbranch.\n  Additionally, we need to establish lawful and effective means for \nindustry sectors to band together with one another and engage with each \nother in\n\n[[Page S6266]]\n\ncommon defense strategies and information sharing where appropriate \nwith the government. There are some early examples, such as the defense \nindustrial base, that merit commendation, which we should encourage. \nBut it is still pretty primitive.\n  Fourth, we must ensure that the Federal Government has the \nauthorities and capabilities necessary to protect our American critical \ninfrastructure against cyber-attack. If a bank, for instance, runs into \na solvency problem, there is an established and widely accepted \nprocedure for Federal intervention to protect the bank depositors, \nstand the bank back up, get it back on its feet, and move back out \nagain.\n  There is no similar procedure if that bank or American critical \ninfrastructure, such as an electric utility, is failing due to an \nongoing cyber-attack. There needs to be clear, lawful processes for the \nprivate sector to request technical assistance and clear authority for \nthe government to act when a cyber-incident raises significant risk to \nAmerican lives and property.\n  It gets a little bit more complicated than that because you cannot \njust call 911, such as when there is a fire, and have the government \ncome and put out the fire when it is a cyber-attack. Cyber-attacks \nhappen literally at the speed of light.\n  The best defense against cyber-threats, particularly the most \ndangerous cyber-threats, requires speed-of-light awareness and \nresponse. For this reason, it is worth considering whether some \ndefensive capabilities should be prepositioned in order to better \nprotect the Nation's most critical private infrastructure.\n  During medieval times, critical infrastructure, such as water wells \nand graineries, were inside the castle walls, protected as a precaution \nagainst enemy raiders. Can certain critical private infrastructure \nnetworks be protected now within virtual castle walls in secure domains \nwhere those prepositioned offenses could be both lawful and effective?\n  This would, obviously, have to be done in a transparent manner, \nsubject to very strict oversight. But with the risks as grave as they \nare, this question cannot be overlooked.\n  Fifth, we need to put more cyber-criminals behind bars. Law \nenforcement engagement against cyber-crime needs to be considerably \nenhanced at multiple levels, reporting, resources, prosecution \nstrategies, and priority. A lot more folks need to go to jail.\n  Finally, we must more clearly define the rules of engagement for \ncovert action by our country against cyber-threats. This is an \nespecially sensitive subject and highly classified. But for here, let \nme simply say that the intelligence community and the Department of \nDefense must be in a position to provide the President with as many \nlawful options as possible to counter cyber-threats, and the executive \nbranch must have the appropriate authorities, policies, and procedures \nfor covert cyber-activities, including how to react in real time when \nthe attack comes at the speed of light. This all, of course, must be \nsubject to very vigilant congressional oversight.\n  Uniquely in the world and uniquely in our own history, America's \neconomy and government now depend on networked information technologies \nfor Americans to communicate with each other, keep the trains running \non time and the planes flying safely, keep our lights on, and power our \ndaily lives.\n  The expansion of this powerful new technology across our great \ncountry also makes us uniquely vulnerable to cyber-threats. We have to \ndo a lot better as a nation on cybersecurity. I believe we can do \nbetter. I know we must do better. Frankly, we cannot afford not to do \nbetter.\n  I hope these remarks and the structure they have provided helps \nprovide assistance to my colleagues as we begin debating and resolving \nthese important issues.\n  I yield the floor. I see my distinguished colleague from Minnesota \nprepared to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6266-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6266-S6267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DISCLOSE ACT\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nallow debate on the DISCLOSE Act, a commonsense measure to fix just \nsome of the problems created by the Citizens United decision.\n  For a century, Congress has done everything it could to make sure the \nAmerican public has as much information as possible about the money \nbeing spent in our elections. The first Federal campaign finance \ndisclosure law was passed in 1910, which scientists tell us was 100 \nyears ago. It was strengthened in 1925. In the 1970s, it was replaced \nwith an even stronger system as part of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct. Eight years ago, with McCain-Feingold, it was strengthened yet \nagain. So the Congress has been in the disclosure business for 100 \nyears. And, in fact, at every major step, the Supreme Court has \nactually affirmed Congress's power to pass these laws.\n  In 1934, the Court unanimously upheld the disclosure laws that \nCongress passed a decade earlier. In 1975, they upheld the disclosure \nprovisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act. In 2003, they upheld \nthe disclosure and disclaimer provisions of McCain-Feingold. Just this \nJanuary in Citizens United--yes, in Citizens United--they voted 8 to 1 \nto uphold those same disclosure provisions again.\n  The disclosure provisions of the DISCLOSE Act are well in line with a \ncentury's worth of Federal statutes and precedent, at least according \nto the Burger Court, the Rehnquist Court, the Roberts Court, and the \nHughes Court. I bet some of you have not heard of the Hughes Court. \nThat was from 1934. So we can pass this law. We can do it. There should \nbe a will to do it.\n  Here are some excerpts from a few Members' floor statements from the \n107th Congress, the Congress that passed McCain-Feingold:\n\n       Clearly the American public has a right to know who is \n     paying for ads and who is attempting to influence elections. \n     Sunshine is what the political system needs.\n\n  Another Member said:\n\n       We can try to regulate ethical behavior by politicians, but \n     the surest way to cleanse the system is to let the Sun shine \n     in.\n\n  Here is yet another:\n\n       Disclosure helps everyone equally to know how their money \n     is spent. [ . . . ] Disclosure is what honesty and fairness \n     in politics is all about. Why would anyone fight against \n     disclosure?\n\n  These are actually the statements of friends of mine across the aisle \nwho are still in this body who opposed McCain-Feingold and who opposed \nit in large part because they said it did not do enough on disclosure. \nIn fact, a lot of them opposed it precisely because it did not do \nenough to promote disclosure of the independent expenditures of \ncorporations and unions.\n  As my good friend Senator Hatch said in March of 2001:\n\n       The issue is expenditures, expenditures, expenditures; and \n     [ . . . ] the real issue, if we really want to do something \n     about campaign finance reform, is disclosure, disclosure, \n     disclosure.\n\n  I think he repeated it three times for emphasis.\n  This is what the minority leader said when he voted against the \nMcCain-Feingold bill, as amended by the House, in March of 2002. This \nis the minority leader, Senator McConnell from Kentucky:\n\n       Reformers claim this bill will increase disclosure and \n     shine the light on big money and politics. This is, of \n     course, not true. Unions will continue to funnel hundreds of \n     millions of dollars of hard-working union member dues into \n     the political process without ever disclosing one red cent.\n\n  The protections my friends were waiting for are in the DISCLOSE Act, \nand they boil down to this: If someone is spending a lot of money in \nour elections, American voters will have a right to know whether that \nperson is a corporation, a nonprofit, a union, or a 527.\n  Before I close, I want to discuss a part of this bill that does not \nhave to do with disclosure, section 102.\n  Section 102 incorporates critical provisions of a bill I introduced, \nthe American Elections Act. It will make sure that foreign interests--\nforeign governments, foreign corporations, and individuals--cannot use \nAmerican subsidiaries that they own or control to influence our \nelections.\n  The fact is, after Citizens United, the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign \ncompanies will be able to spend as much as they want in our elections, \neven if they are under foreign control.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S6267]]\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask for another couple minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, I ask that another couple \nminutes be added to our time. If that is OK with the Senator from \nMinnesota, I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Senator from Texas. The fact is, after \nCitizens United, the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies will be \nable to spend as much as they want in our elections, even if they are \nunder foreign control. President Obama alluded to this in his State of \nthe Union Address, and Justice Stevens said it explicitly in his \ndissent.\n  More and more American companies are coming under foreign ownership \nand control. According to the Congressional Research Service, between \n1998 and 2007, there was a 50-percent increase in the number of mergers \nand acquisitions where a foreign firm acquired a U.S. firm. But our \nlaws are out of date. They do not protect against election spending \nfrom those foreign-controlled companies.\n  There are basically only three restrictions on election spending by \nforeign companies: One, you cannot be headquartered or incorporated \nabroad. The subsidiary has to be headquartered here, such as BP \nAmerica.\n  You cannot use money you have earned abroad in our elections. You can \nuse money earned here.\n  You cannot let foreign citizens decide how to spend that money. But \nthe boards of these companies kind of know how, Citgo, say, might want \nto spend its money. One company that could pass the test and spend \nunlimited amounts of their money in our elections is Citgo, 100-percent \nowned by Hugo Chavez and the Venezuela Government. Here is another \ncompany that can pass the test: British Petroleum or, rather, its \nsubsidiary, British Petroleum America. This is unacceptable.\n  The DISCLOSE Act updates our laws and says that if a foreign entity \nhas a controlling stake in a company, as defined by most States' \ncorporate control standards--or if a foreign entity controls the board \nof directors of a company, that company should not spend one dime in \nour elections.\n  Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I yield back my \ntime. I have no time to yield back. I am done.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 32 minutes 23 seconds \nremaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6267-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6267-S6268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DISCLOSE ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am going to talk about the so-called \nDISCLOSE Act that we will vote on this afternoon at 2:45. Of course, \nthis is a cloture vote which will require 60 votes to proceed to the \nbill.\n  At the time the cloture motion was filed, the bill was so new that it \nwas not even available on the Senate's Web site. Unfortunately, this \nrepresents a trend where we have seen legislation come to the floor \nthat is so new and unavailable to the American people to read that they \nare left to wonder what actually is in the bill.\n  This particular version of the bill was introduced less than a week \nago. Sadly, I have concluded that this bill represents another attempt \nby my colleagues to push through legislation without adequate time for \ndeliberation and review. In this case, it has pretty dramatic and dire \nconsequences.\n  It will reduce freedom of speech in a way that is inconsistent with \nthe first amendment of the U.S. Constitution, it creates more Federal \nregulation, and it does not give the American people the opportunity to \nreview the legislation and to weigh in because they cannot understand \nwhat are the ramifications. So in the short time we have between now \nand 2:45, I would like to weigh in a little bit to hopefully inform \nanyone who is listening what this particular piece of legislation will \ndo.\n\n  I fear that what this legislation does, in sum, is to protect \nincumbents--protect incumbents--which is not the type of legislation \nthat I think most of our constituents would want to see us pass. I \nbelieve they would prefer legislation, if any legislation would be \nnecessary, that would not restrict freedom of speech but would \nencourage freedom of speech and more political participation in our \nelections and the process. But this bill doesn't do that. This bill \nprotects incumbents by suppressing the speech of some while letting \nother speakers speak without any limitation whatsoever. In other words, \nwhat this bill does is it picks winners and losers in the political \nspeech contest--something the first amendment does not allow us to do.\n  I would also say that in the rushing to judgment on the part of the \nproponents of this bill, we are left to speculate as to what impact the \nCitizens United decision by the U.S. Supreme Court will really have and \nwhether for-profit corporations will actually use this decision to \nspend money in elections. I happen to believe there is very little \nchance most corporations' shareholders will allow their money to be \nspent for the purpose of advertising on issues in upcoming political \nelections because they are going to either want the money returned in a \ndividend to the shareholders or they are going to want money invested \nto create a growing business and to create a better return on their \ninvestment. They are not going to want their money used for the \npurposes for which the proponents of this legislation fear, in my view.\n  The fact is, this bill will fundamentally remake the rules and \nregulations governing the exercise of free speech in American \nelections. We should be extra cautious in legislating in this area for \nthree reasons:\n  First, regulation of speech always raises significant first amendment \nconsiderations. The first amendment is the cornerstone of our \ndemocracy. Political speech about candidates for elected office is at \nthe core of the values protected by the first amendment.\n  Second, regulation of campaign speech often comes with unintended \nconsequences. Back in 2002--I wasn't here at the time--the Bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act was passed. It was also known as the BCRA or \nMcCain-Feingold. I believe it was passed with the very best of \nintentions, but it has not prevented the exponential increase in the \namount of money spent in elections in America since that time. In the \n2008 election cycle, President Obama and Senator McCain raised and \nspent nearly twice as much money as President Bush and Senator Kerry \ndid in 2004--almost twice as much in 4 years. In fact, together, the \ntwo Presidential candidates in 2008 spent more money for the general \nelection than did all the Presidential candidates between 1976 and 2000 \ncombined. The so-called Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 has also \nled to another unintended consequence: it has led to a proliferation of \ninterest groups using section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code or some \nother provision of the law to pour massive amounts of money into \ncampaigns with even less transparency than has existed before.\n  The third reason we should be especially careful when regulating \npolitical speech is that Senators have an inherent conflict of \ninterest. Our jobs depend on the rules surrounding campaigns and \nelections, so there is a natural temptation by the Senate majority to \nchange the rules in a way that helps its own chances of reelection. The \nquestion is, Does this bill resist that temptation to rewrite the rules \nto benefit the majority party, to protect incumbents, or does this bill \nsuccumb to that temptation? I submit that this bill succumbs to that \ntemptation in the haste to push through rules that will protect, in the \nview of the proponents of this legislation, incumbents in the election \nthat will be held almost 100 days from now.\n  This bill would silence critics of the majority party--it is that \nsimple--and it would protect the closest allies and special interests \naligned with the majority party.\n  This bill treats similarly situated parties differently. That is what \nI mean by picking winners and losers. It would silence businesses with \nsome foreign shareholders, but it would protect unions with significant \nforeign membership. It would silence businesses with government \ncontracts, but it would protect unions of government employees and \nunions that work on those same government contracts. It would silence \ncompanies that have received TARP funds but protect the\n\n[[Page S6268]]\n\nunions that represent those same companies' employees.\n  Labor unions aren't the only allies of the majority party to receive \nspecial treatment in this bill. The bill protects limited liability \npartnerships and other business models favored by the legal profession. \nIt creates carve-outs reminiscent of what we saw happen in the health \ncare bill with the ``Louisiana purchase'' and the ``Cornhusker \nkickback.'' It creates a carve-out for the largest, wealthiest, and \nmost powerful Washington-based special interest groups, such as the \nNational Rifle Association and the American Association of Retired \nPersons, AARP.\n  The bill also tends to favor large businesses over small businesses \nand Washington-based interest groups over grassroots interests. How \ndoes this bill do that? Well, simply because it creates such a \nByzantine labyrinth of regulations and disclosure requirements that \nonly large organizations with the money to hire the very best lawyers \nwill be able to figure out how they can exercise their first amendment \nrights. There are enough loopholes that a corporation or a union large \nand sophisticated enough to set up the right legal structure can \ncontinue to speak and spend money to exercise their first amendment \nrights, but a small business or a grassroots group of citizens is \nunlikely to have either those sorts of political connections or the \nmoney to be able to hire the specialized expertise to allow them to \nnavigate this labyrinth. And if you can't afford to comply with the \nbill's onerous regulations, then you are not allowed to speak at all.\n  Why are some of my colleagues supporting the bill? I can think of two \nreasons:\n  First, some of my colleagues fear the righteous judgment of the \nAmerican people in this coming election on November 2. They are trying \nto change the rules in the middle of the game to suppress the speech of \nthose who might disagree with these incumbent Senators who are standing \nfor reelection so that the American people won't have all sides of the \nstory when they go to vote on November 2. Bradley Smith, a former \nChairman of the Federal Election Commission, put it this way. He said \nthe so-called DISCLOSE Act should stand for the ``Democrat Incumbents \nSeeking to Contain Losses by Outlawing Speech in Elections''--the \nDISCLOSE Act.\n  Second, it is clear that some folks in Washington just like \nsuppressing speech they do not agree with. Other attempts have included \nasking citizens to forward their neighbors' criticisms about the \nadministration to the White House e-mail account--remember when that \nhappened--and sending cease-and-desist letters--this is something the \nadministration did during the health care debate--to companies that \ncriticized their health care bill. And of course there have been well-\ndocumented efforts to bring back the so-called Fairness Act, which is \nanything but.\n  I don't know, though, whether my colleagues who are pushing this bill \nare doing so in order to protect their political power or, frankly, in \nan arrogant display of disdain for the views and opinions of the \nAmerican people--the kinds of views we have seen displayed at townhall \nmeetings, at tea party rallies, and other spontaneous movements around \nthis country. It is absolutely the fact that the first amendment was \nwritten to protect freedom of speech, even the speech we don't like and \ndon't agree with. I believe the first amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution and freedom of speech have made us stronger and freer and \nhas helped inform policymakers so that we can make better decisions \nbecause we have considered all points of view.\n  But whatever the reason the proponents of this bill have for offering \nthis bill, I would point out--and I don't think it is a coincidence--\nthat the chief House proponent is the current chairman of the \nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the chief proponent in \nthe Senate is the former chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee. I don't think that is coincidental.\n  Whatever the reason, I oppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to \noppose this afternoon's cloture motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, will you let me know when 9 minutes \nhas expired?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nTexas for his lucid explanation of this DISCLOSE Act, and I like the \nname he used for it. As the Republican leader has said, this is a piece \nof legislation that is primarily about saving the jobs of Democratic \nMembers of Congress. I think the American people would rather we spend \nour time saving their jobs during a time of 10 percent unemployment.\n  I would like to talk about that for a minute because one way to save \nAmerican jobs is to stop sending jobs overseas looking for cheap \nenergy, which is what the Democratic proposals have been about this \nyear.\n  We hear that maybe this afternoon the majority leader will propose an \nenergy bill. It is being proposed in a way that has become all too \nfamiliar here. It is being written in secret, offered at the last \nminute, and there will be time for little debate. We have 1 or 2 days \nat most to work on this bill, given the need to consider the \nPresident's nomination of Ms. Kagan for the U.S. Supreme Court, and \nthere apparently will be no amendments. So last minute, written in \nsecret, little debate, no amendments, big issue--that sounds a lot like \nwhat happened at Christmas with the health care bill. But the question \nto ask is why have we waited so long on an energy bill?\n  In defense of the majority leader, he has a lot on his plate, and he \nhas a tough job in trying to figure out what comes first, and it takes \na while to get anything done in the Senate. The last time we had a \ngreat success with energy bills--2005-2007--they were offered in a \nbipartisan way. I remember working with Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman on those bills. We did a lot of good and changed the direction \nof the country on clean energy in 2005 in the Energy bill. But it took \na number of weeks on the floor of the Senate to do that, and any \nserious effort on energy would take that amount of time here as well.\n  So why have we not had an energy bill? We have had a clear consensus \non how to have cheap energy. For years, Republicans have said: Why \ndon't we build 100 new nuclear plants? That is 70 percent of our \ncarbon-free electricity. Why don't we set as a goal electrifying half \nour cars and trucks? That is the single best way to reduce our use of \noil, including oil from foreign countries. Why don't we support \ndoubling energy research and development? That is the best way to get a \n500-mile battery for electric cars and reduce the price of solar power \nby a factor of 4, which is what we need to do in order to be able to \nput solar on our rooftops and supplement the energy we need. But we \nhaven't had bills like that. There are even 16 Senators--6 Republican, \n9 Democrats, 1 independent--who are cosponsors of the Carper-Alexander \nbill on clean air. We know what to do about sulfur, nitrogen, and \nmercury, so why don't we do it? We have 16 Senators ready to do it.\n  Instead, the other side has been focused on two bad ideas--one has \nbeen a national energy tax in the middle of a recession, and the second \nbad idea has been a so-called national renewable electricity standard, \nwhich basically boils down a requirement to build 50-story wind \nturbines to try to produce electricity in this large country. Let me \ngive one fact on that. Denmark has pushed its wind turbines up to 20 \npercent of its electrical capacity. We often hear on the floor what a \ngreat thing Denmark has done. That is about as many windmills as you \ncan have and still have a viable electricity grid. But Denmark hasn't \nclosed a single coal plant. It is still highly dependent on fossil \nfuels. It has to give away almost half of its wind-generated \nelectricity to Germany and Sweden at bargain prices because it comes at \na time it is not needed. And Denmark has some of the most expensive \nelectricity in Europe. Meanwhile, France has gone 80 percent nuclear. \nIts per capita carbon emissions are 30 percent lower than Denmark, and \nit has so much cheap electricity that France is making $3 billion a \nyear exporting it to other countries.\n\n[[Page S6269]]\n\nSo why are we even thinking about passing a law making Tennesseans \nbuild 50-story wind turbines on our scenic mountains or buy it from \nSouth Dakota, which means running a lot of transmission lines through \nbackyards, when the Tennessee Valley Authority says wind power is \navailable when needed only 12 percent of the time?\n  So these are the two bad ideas that have had our clean energy \nconsensus stuck on the sidelines for the last year.\n  There is another idea we should be focusing on, actually it should be \nour first priority; that is, the oilspill that has caused such \ndestruction in the gulf coast. The bill we understand the majority \nleader may be bringing out this afternoon--of course, we do not know \nwhat is in it; it was written in secret--bringing it out this \nafternoon, may be the bill that came out of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, which would, in effect, end offshore exploration for \nnatural gas and oil.\n  That sounds pretty good, particularly in light of the fact that it \nhas been 99 days since this terrible oilspill began. But what will \nhappen if we were to, in effect, end offshore exploration of natural \ngas and oil? It means we would be depending more on oil from overseas. \nWe use 20 million barrels of petroleum product a day. Unless we get \nbusy with electric cars, we are still going to be using 20 million \nbarrels a day.\n  It will probably mean higher prices, since about one-third of our \nnatural gas and oil that we produce in the United States comes from the \nGulf of Mexico. It would mean lost jobs in large amounts. The number of \nlost jobs is estimated, in a study released by IHS Global Insight on \nJuly 22--if we have a de facto end of independent oil production of \noffshore natural gas and oil in the gulf, the job loss would be 300,000 \njobs by 2020; $147 billion in tax revenues over that time.\n  So, in addition to depending more on foreign oil, higher prices, lost \njobs, it means we would depend on leaky tankers to bring that foreign \noil--some from countries that do not like us--over to the United States \nso we could use it. So that is a bad idea as well--not a very good \nproposal.\n  There is a better way to approach the problem of dealing with an \noilspill that has been offered by Senator McConnell and other \nRepublicans last week. Here is what it would do: Instead of ending \noffshore exploration for natural gas and oil, which is what unlimited \nliability requirements, in effect, would do, it would fashion a \nproposal that is much like the proposal we use for the 104 nuclear \npowerplants we have operating in this country.\n  They operate under a law called Price-Anderson. Price-Anderson is an \nindustry-funded insurance program that spreads the liability for any \nnuclear accident among all the operators of nuclear plants. It is \nimportant to note, we have never had to use it. Even though we have not \nbuilt a nuclear plant in 30 years, there has not been a single death in \nthe United States as a result of a nuclear incident at a commercial \nnuclear plant or as a result of a nuclear accident on one of our Navy \nships, which have been operating with reactors since the 1950s.\n  But the Republican proposal, instead of saying unlimited liability, \nwhich sounds good but has all the problems I just mentioned, would \nemploy a risk-based approach and allow the President to establish \nliability limits for offshore facilities by taking into account risk-\nbased factors. There could be unlimited liability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator has 1 \nminute remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. There could be unlimited liability. But the President, \nin setting those risk-based factors, could take into account that there \nmight be a company with a spotless record operating at drilling 500 \nfeet for oil, but there might be a company with not as good a record \noperating in 5,000 feet deep water.\n  In addition, the proposal would allow for collective responsibility. \nInstead of big oil companies just sitting around watching the one that \nspills clean up, everybody would have a stake in the game. In addition \nto that, it would not drive out of business the smaller oil companies \nand only leave big oil as the only ones that could risk unlimited \nliability and drill in the gulf, such big national oil companies as the \nChinese, Venezuelan, or Saudi Arabians.\n  So I would recommend to my colleagues that the Republican proposal is \nwhere we should begin because a risk-based liability proposal would \nallow independent explorers for oil and gas to continue to operate, \nwould not drive them out of business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute to \nfinish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The 1.6 million of us who fly daily would not stop \nflying after a tragic airplane crash. We would find out what happened \nand do our best to make it safe. We cannot simply stop drilling after a \ntragic oilspill unless we want to rely more on foreign oil, run up our \nprices, turn our oil drilling over to a few big oil companies, and all \nour oil hauling over to more leaky tankers. I hope that instead of the \nproposal we have been hearing about, we can focus on the clean energy, \nlow-cost consensus Republicans have advocated, and that the President \nhas proposed as well, electric cars, nuclear power, energy research and \ndevelopment, and clean air.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about legislation that I \nintend to introduce today, both as an amendment to the small business \nbill and as a stand-alone measure.\n  With the BP oilspill in the headlines, we are rumored to tackle \nenergy legislation later this week. For months, energy legislation has \nbeen held up while the majority attempted to find 60 votes for a very \nunpopular cap-and-trade aspect to this legislation.\n  But just last week, Americans sought to hear great news when they saw \nheadlines such as ``The Climate Bill is Dead,'' ``Democrats Call Off \nClimate Bill Effort.''\n  You have to imagine that around the country, thousands of Americans \nand small businesses breathed a sigh of relief that they would not be \nforced to bear yet another financial burden, a hidden tax increase in \nthese trying times.\n  But, unfortunately, I believe the sigh of relief was premature and \nhere is why. Some in Washington have been keeping a wish list of \npolicies they want to complete after--and I emphasize after--the \nNovember elections. At the very top of that list is the national energy \ntax called cap and trade. So after the elections this November, the \nAmerican people could be in for quite a surprise.\n  After voters have cleared out of the polling places and the yard \nsigns are all taken down, after the voting booths have disappeared from \nthe high school gymnasiums and the church basements, after the American \npeople have exercised their constitutional right and made their claims \nregarding the future direction of this great Nation, well after all \nthat, be warned because the politicians will return to Washington to \nadvance an agenda that they did not have a chance of advancing at all \nprior to the election.\n\n  During this postelection time, we are likely to see what is called a \nlameduck session. You see, the newly elected will not be here on the \nfloor after the election in that interim until they are sworn in, nor \nwill they be on the House floor. Yet we may be conducting business with \nmany who are not returning to office and therefore are no longer \naccountable to their constituents; will not stand for another election.\n  You see, therein lies the danger, a last gasp by this Congress to \npush an agenda that was dead on arrival prior to the election. But, I \nsuggest today, do not take my word for this. Simply listen to the most \nsenior members of the party that controls the White House, the House, \nand the Senate. In an interview on Friday, a senior Democratic Senator \nopenly discussed the plan to have cap and trade in the lameduck \nsession. The headline could not be more clear: ``Democrats May Take Up \nBroad Climate Legislation After Election.''\n  Why is that the plan, you might ask? Why could not the Senate advance \nthis\n\n[[Page S6270]]\n\nmeasure in the more than a year since the House barely passed it? Well, \nI will point back to another surprisingly candid interview. According \nto one Democratic Senator: ``If it is after the election, it may well \nbe that some members feel free and liberated.'' Let me read that again. \n``If it is after the election, it may well be that some members are \nfree and liberated.''\n  Free and liberated, you ask. Well, the answer is as obvious as it is \nchilling. The plan to do cap and trade in a lameduck is premised on \nSenators and House Members being free and liberated from the tethers of \nthe American people. That is extraordinary, and it is deeply troubling. \nBut it gets worse because the plan is not simply to wait until after \nthe election. The plan is to add cap and trade in conference or attach \nit to some other legislation from the House, even though the Senate \nwill not have considered, debated or approved a cap-and-trade bill. \nStunning.\n  Again, do not take my word for it. You can read it in the various \nnews reports. For example, on June 16, Politico reported that the \nSenate legislative plan for passing cap and trade is to: ``. . . \nconference the new Senate (Energy) bill with the already-passed House \nbill in a lame-duck session after the election, so House Members don't \nhave to take another tough vote ahead of midterms.''\n  On June 28, Energy and Environment Daily reported that House \nDemocratic leadership: `` . . . acknowledged that lawmakers on the \nconference committee may wind up merging the House cap-and-trade plan \nwith a Senate bill that does not include it.''\n  On June 30, the Hill newspaper reported: ``House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said he would `absolutely' \nseek to keep greenhouse gas limits alive in a House-Senate conference \nif the Senate approves energy legislation this summer that omits carbon \nprovisions.''\n  So the not-so-secret plan is not secret at all. In fact, it is very \ntransparent and clear: Pass an energy bill, any energy bill, pass it \nout of the Senate so it can be conferenced with the House cap-and-trade \nbill after the election. My legislation directly addresses this plan in \na very concise way. It simply says, if the Senate has not previously \napproved cap-and-trade legislation, and you try to slip it into law \nduring a lameduck session, then a point of order will lie against the \nlegislation. However, if the Senate has already approved a cap-and-\ntrade bill under regular order, then my amendment would not be \ntriggered.\n  My amendment, therefore, preserves the opportunity for the Senate to \ndebate this critically important issue. It takes the debate out of the \nshadows and the back rooms and the conferences onto the Senate floor, \nin full view of the American people, and it permits the American people \nto see what is in this bill.\n  It says, if the Senate has not approved cap and trade, do not slip it \nin an appropriations bill, do not add it to a defense bill, do not \nsneak it into another stimulus, and do not hide it in the heaven knows \nwhat during a conference committee meeting secretly held who knows \nwhere.\n  I urge my colleagues to look ahead down the road a few months. \nMembers will be here. Maybe they will be ``free and liberated'' from \nthe will of the American people as one Democratic colleague describes \nit. The shenanigans are already being forecast. Let's stop it here. I \nask for support on this very important legislation.\n  If debate is intentionally circumvented, our business owners and all \nAmericans will be impacted and hurt. They deserve to know what the \ndebate is going to be about in cap and trade, and my amendment provides \nthis assurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6270-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6270-S6278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DISCLOSE ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to urge my colleagues to \nallow us to proceed to the DISCLOSE Act to deal with campaign finance \nreform. I thank Senator Schumer for his hard work on this issue to \nbring forward a bill that I hope can enjoy sufficient support so we can \ncontinue to advance campaign finance reform. Election campaign finance \nreform is difficult to pass in this body for many reasons. First, it \nrequires bipartisanship. We know that. We know we need to bring \ntogether Democrats and Republicans to say: Our legacy on fair elections \nis more important than our own individual elections, and we have a \nresponsibility to the American public to deal with a growing problem in \nAmerican politics; that is, the influence of money, particularly during \nelection time.\n  That is why we celebrated in 2002 with passage of a bipartisan \ncampaign reform act. Under the leadership of Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold, we were able to come together, Democrats and Republicans, and \nadvance campaign finance reform to reduce somewhat the influence of \nspecial interest corporate money in our political system and to add \nfurther disclosures so the American public could know who is trying to \ninfluence their vote. That is what campaign finance reform is about, to \nlimit corporate money and provide greater disclosure. Democrats and \nRepublicans came together in 2002 to get that done. The protection of \nour fair election process has now met a new opponent. That is the \nSupreme Court or, more specifically, five Justices on the Supreme \nCourt, the so-called conservative Justices. They legislated from the \nbench, reversing precedent, and ruled on the side of corporate \ninterests over the concerns of ordinary Americans. These were the so-\ncalled Justices many of my colleagues look to for judicial restraint. \nIt is not judicial restraint when they legislate from the bench. It is \nnot judicial restraint when they reverse precedent, when they rule on \nthe side of corporate America over ordinary Americans.\n  Let me quote from Justice Stevens in his comments as they reflect on \nthe decision the Court made:\n\n       [E]ssentially, five justices were unhappy with the limited \n     nature of the case before us so they changed the case to give \n     themselves an opportunity to change the law. There were \n     principled, narrow paths that a court that was serious about \n     judicial restraint could have taken.\n\n  Justice Stevens goes on to warn, the majority ``threatens to \nundermine the integrity of the elected institutions across the Nation. \nThe path that is taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to \nthis institution.''\n  Justice Stevens, in his minority opinion, says:\n\n       At bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the \n     common sense of the American people, who have recognized a \n     need to prevent corporations from undermining self government \n     since the founding, and who have fought against the \n     distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering \n     since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to \n     repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is \n     imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have \n     thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in \n     politics.\n\n  We tried to do something about that in 2002. We passed a law that \nsaid corporations cannot directly try to influence elections. Then we \nset up how they can do so through a transparent way, collectively, \nthrough political action committees. But we stopped undisclosed direct \ncorporate influence in American elections. Now the Supreme Court has \nreversed that bipartisan action. So how should we in Congress respond? \nWhat options do we have? We could amend the Constitution, but that is a \nmatter that requires a great deal more deliberation. I am concerned \nabout amending provisions in the Constitution. We need to think long \nand hard before we act. We could do something many of us have talked \nabout for a long time--provide incentives for public financing of \ncampaigns to try to reduce dramatically the amount of private money in \nour campaigns. Senator Durbin has been a leader in this effort. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor. That is a matter that should be given serious \nreview. But we don't have the opportunity to do that today.\n  Today we do have an opportunity to act as Senator Schumer has brought \nforward the DISCLOSE Act which we all profess we support--disclosure. \nAll of us have said we should be serious about giving the public an \nopportunity to know who is trying to influence their vote.\n  The minority leader in the House of Representatives, John Boehner, \nsaid:\n\n       I think what we ought to do is we ought to have full \n     disclosure, full disclosure of all money we raise and how it \n     is spent. And I think that sunlight is the best disinfectant.\n\n\n[[Page S6271]]\n\n\n  He was, of course, quoting from Justice Brandeis's famous comments in \nan opinion when he was a Justice on the Supreme Court, about sunshine \nbeing the best disinfectant.\n  Shortly we will have an opportunity to proceed with the DISCLOSE Act. \nWe will have an opportunity to vote.\n  I understand some of the concerns of my Republican colleagues. They \nsay: Look, corporations generally side with Republicans. Therefore, if \nwe can get corporations to put more money into the election process, \nwon't that be good for Republicans?\n  Let me counter that by saying we all benefit. Each Member of this \nbody benefits by reducing the influence outside interests have in the \nindependence we can exercise in the Senate. Look at what is going to \nhappen if we don't change this. Karl Rove has indicated he intends to \nbring forward $52 million to try to influence the 2010 elections by so-\ncalled anonymous donors, without disclosing the source of the funds. We \nknow there is the potential of hundreds of millions of dollars being \nspent to influence votes without disclosing where that money is coming \nfrom, under the banner of Citizens United and corporate contributions. \nWe can do something about that.\n  Our legacy to protect a free and fair election process from undue \ninfluence of corporate special interests is more important than even \nour own individual elections. We were able to come together in 2002. \nLet's reconfirm what we did. Let's each do what is right for the \nintegrity of the election process. Let's each do what we said we \nbelieve in--full disclosure. We can do that with the motion to proceed.\n  Voting for cloture on this motion does not preclude a Member from \noffering an amendment. If there is something in the proposal one \ndoesn't like--all of us would wish to see it stronger, or maybe there \nare other provisions we wish to take a look at--let's proceed to the \ndebate. Let's not be afraid to have the debate on the floor of the \nSenate, supposedly the greatest debating institution in the world. \nLet's not be afraid to have the debate on how we can make elections \nmore responsive to the needs of the people, ordinary citizens, so they \nhave a right to know who is trying to influence their vote. Let's have \nthat debate on the floor of the Senate. We will have a chance to do \nthat in a few hours by voting for cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  I urge my colleagues, give the American people this debate they so \nrichly deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Could the Chair let us know how much time is left on \neither side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are no longer under controlled time. There \nare 10-minute segments for Senators.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak with regard \nto election reform, democracy, and unfortunately partisanship, and most \nimportantly, the first amendment.\n  There is a threat to the Constitution on the floor of the Senate \ntoday. It is called the DISCLOSE Act. I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis bill.\n  The DISCLOSE Act, an Orwellian oxymoron if there ever was one, \ncontradicts the Supreme Court's January decision in Citizens United. It \nis essential to put the decision in context and shed sunlight on this \ndangerous bill.\n  First, I applaud the Court's ruling. It reaffirms the right to \nfreedom of speech. This is precisely the Court's role in our government \nsystem of checks and balances: to rein in Congress when legislation \ndoes not square with our founding principles. Let us remember the 10 \nwords in the first amendment that are most relevant for this debate:\n\n       Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of \n     speech.\n\n  However, some of my colleagues across the aisle have mischaracterized \nthe Citizens United decision as undoing 100 years of law and precedent. \nThis is a reference to the Tillman Act of 1907 that prohibits \ncorporations from directly financing political campaigns. This was not \naffected by the Court's ruling. The Supreme Court did rule, however, \nagainst provisions of the so-called Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of \n2002 that barred corporations and unions from running political ads 30 \ndays before a primary and 60 days before a general election. \nCorporations and unions cannot donate directly to a Federal candidate \nand, contrary to the claim of DISCLOSE Act supporters, it is already \nillegal for foreign entities to participate in American elections.\n  Unfortunately, the sponsors of the DISCLOSE Act have chosen partisan \nfiction over fact in their effort to override the Court. The DISCLOSE \nAct is anything but full and fair campaign disclosure. It is \npolitically skewed, motivated by a majority desperate to continue to be \na majority.\n  The DISCLOSE Act is loaded with handouts to the most monied of \nWashington special interests, including the National Rifle Association \nand the Sierra Club. They didn't want tape put on their mouths. Others \ndoubtlessly were standing in line saying: Don't muzzle me, you can \nsimply muzzle the other guy behind the tree.\n  I challenge anyone who comes to the floor to preach the virtues of \nthis bill to explain, with a straight face, the carefully tailored \nexemptions from disclosure included in title III. Moreover, despite a \nclever rewording of the House-passed version, the Senate bill retains \ncarve-outs for labor unions by exempting donations under $600 under \ntitle II, section 211. This figure is conveniently below the average \nunion dues. So for 600 bucks you have free speech. If it is over $600, \nyou don't.\n  Supporters of the DISCLOSE Act claim it is necessary to keep a flood \nof money out of politics, but carve-outs for special interests say \notherwise. On June 24, the National Journal's Congress Daily reported \nthat environmental, labor, and other groups--many of which specifically \nbenefit from title II and title III exemptions--announced they would \nspend $11 million to either reward or admonish Senators in both parties \nfor their positions in regard to climate change legislation.\n  Another example is the American Federation of State, County, and \nMunicipal Employees. The Hill newspaper reported on June 21 that this \nunion, exempt under the bill, had ponied up $75,000 for ads in Maine to \npressure Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins to support a \ntaxpayer-funded bailout for unions.\n  These facts present an inconvenient truth for the sponsors of the \nDISCLOSE Act. It flies in the face of our democracy for the majority to \nration the right of free speech to one set of Americans at the expense \nof others.\n  In May, it was reported in the press that sponsors of this bill \nboasted that its deterrent effect should not be underestimated. \nAmericans do not, and never have found it appropriate for government to \nshut down any political dissent.\n  The DISCLOSE Act abandons the longstanding practice of treating \ncorporations and unions equally. But even if title II and title III \nexemptions were removed, the bill is still unworkable. On May 19, \nwriting in the Wall Street Journal, over half a dozen former FEC \nCommissioners noted that the FEC has regulations for 33 types of \ncontributions and speech and 71 different types of speakers. The \nDISCLOSE Act adds to this complexity with another layer of Byzantine \nrequirements that raise serious concerns about whether the law can be \nenforced consistent with the first amendment. We do not need any more \nregulations to the first amendment.\n\n  If anyone doubts this bill is motivated by politics, they need to \nlook no further than a June 22 letter sent by the bill's Senate sponsor \nand the Senate majority leader to Members of the House in which they \npledge to bring the measure to the floor in advance of the fall \nelections. Why the rush? In so doing, the majority has again used rule \nXIV to bypass the Senate Rules Committee--a committee upon which I \nserve--in order to expedite the DISCLOSE Act's passage.\n  Unfortunately, it is becoming all too common for the majority to \ncircumvent regular order, stifle the minority, and force unwanted \nlegislation on the people by filling the amendment tree, misusing rule \nXIV, and ping-ponging legislation between the Houses. I am tired of \nPing-Pong. Give me table tennis. Give me a paddle. Give me five serves, \nand then I will let Senator Schumer have five serves, and we can go \nback and forth as we should in regard to amendments in the Rules \nCommittee, where this debate ought to\n\n[[Page S6272]]\n\nbe held. Senator Cardin said: Let us have a debate. I am for that. And \nlet's put it in the Rules Committee, where it should be debated first.\n  To review, the Citizens United decision does not upend a hundred \nyears of law and precedent. The DISCLOSE Act has intentional loopholes \nin title II and title III to keep special interest dollars on behalf of \nthe majority flowing, and the rest of the bill is a confusing set of \nredundant regulations. The bill's sponsors are rushing this legislation \nto the floor without consideration by the Rules Committee--again, here \nwe go; that is what happened with health care; that is what happened \nwith the Dodd-Frank bill--in order to protect the incumbent majority \nbefore the fall elections.\n  Under the first amendment, the American people have a right to speak \nout against policies and legislators who kill jobs, curb growth, and \nexpand the government at the expense of the private sector--and now a \nproposed tax increase. These policies hurt millions and millions of \nAmericans employed in the private sector and millions more looking for \nwork during a recession. They must be protected under the first \namendment. The people have a right to be heard.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom the State of Washington, who has been a leading advocate for the \nvoice of average Americans in government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in \nstrong support of the DISCLOSE Act, to close the glaring campaign \nfinance loopholes that were opened by the Citizens United ruling.\n  This Supreme Court ruling was a true step backward for this \ndemocracy. It overturned decades of campaign finance law and policy. It \nallowed corporations and special interest groups to spend unlimited \namounts of their money influencing our democracy. And it opens the door \nwide for foreign corporations to spend their money on elections right \nhere in the United States.\n  The Citizens United ruling has given special interest groups a \nmegaphone they can use to drown out the voices of average citizens in \nmy home State of Washington and across the country. The DISCLOSE Act we \nare considering will tear that megaphone away and place it back into \nthe hands of the American people, where it belongs.\n  This is a very personal issue for me. When I first ran for the Senate \nback in 1992, I was a long-shot candidate with some ideas and a group \nof amazing and passionate volunteers by my side. Those volunteers cared \ndeeply about making sure the voices of average Washington State \nfamilies were represented here in the Senate. They made phone calls. \nThey went door to door. They talked to families across our State who \nwanted more from their government.\n  Well, we ended up winning that grassroots campaign because the \npeople's voices were heard loudly and clearly. But to be honest, I do \nnot think it would have been possible if corporations and special \ninterests had been able to drown out their voices with an unlimited \nbarrage of negative ads against candidates who did not support their \ninterests. That is why I so strongly support this DISCLOSE Act. I want \nto make sure no force is greater in our elections than the power of \nvoters across our cities and towns. And no voice is louder than \ncitizens who care about making their State and country a better place \nto live. This DISCLOSE Act helps preserve that American value. It \nshines a bright spotlight on the entire process.\n  What the DISCLOSE Act will do will make corporate CEOs and special \ninterest leaders take responsibility for their ads. When candidates put \ncampaign commercials up on television--you have seen them--we put our \nfaces on the ad and tell every voter we approve the message. We do not \nhide what we are doing. But right now, because of this Supreme Court \ndecision, corporations and special interest groups do not have to do \nthat. They can put up deceptive, untruthful ads with no accountability \nand no ability for people to know who is trying to influence them.\n  The DISCLOSE Act strengthens overall disclosure requirements for \ngroups that are attempting to sway our elections. Too often, \ncorporations and special interest groups are able to hide behind their \nspending because of a mask of front organizations because they know \nvoters would be less likely to believe the ads if they knew what the \nmotives of the sponsors were. The DISCLOSE Act ends that. It shines a \nlight on the spending and makes sure voters have the information they \nneed so they know whom they can trust.\n  This bill also closes a number of other loopholes opened by the \nCitizens United decision. It bans foreign corporations and special \ninterest groups from spending in U.S. elections. It makes sure \ncorporations are not hiding their election spending from their \nshareholders. It limits election spending by government contractors to \nmake sure taxpayer funding is never used to influence an election. And \nit bans coordination between candidates and outside groups on \nadvertising, so corporations and special interest groups can never \n``sponsor'' a candidate.\n  This DISCLOSE Act is a commonsense bill that should not be \ncontroversial. Anyone who thinks voters should have a louder voice than \nspecial interest groups ought to vote for this bill. Anyone who thinks \nforeign entities should have no right to influence U.S. elections \nshould support this bill. Anybody who agrees with Justice Brandeis that \n``sunlight is the best disinfectant'' ought to support this bill. And \nanyone who thinks we should not allow corporations such as BP or \nGoldman Sachs to spend unlimited money influencing our elections ought \nto support this bill.\n  Every 2 years, we have elections across this country to fill our \nfederally elected offices. Every 2 years, voters have the opportunity \nto talk to each other about who they think will represent their \ncommunities best. And every 2 years, it is these voices of America's \ncitizens that decide who gets to stand right here representing them in \nthe Congress. That is the basis of our democracy, and it is exactly \nwhat this DISCLOSE Act aims to protect. So I am proud to support this \nbill, and I urge all of our colleagues to move forward on this bill on \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank the Republican \nleader, Senator McConnell, for his expertise and leadership on this \nissue. Secondly, as several of my colleagues have pointed out, the \nDISCLOSE Act is a direct assault on the first amendment right to free \nspeech. Protecting political speech, guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, \nis one of our most sacred responsibilities.\n  This is a partisan bill drafted behind closed doors by current and \nformer Democratic campaign committee leaders. It is obviously written \nto disadvantage Republicans and favor special interests supportive of \nDemocrats. The closed-door process under which the DISCLOSE Act was \nwritten contradicts its supporters' professed goal of transparency. It \nis a partisan rewrite of campaign finance laws without hearings, \nwithout testimony, without studies, without a markup--again, written \nbehind closed doors with the help of lobbyists and special interests.\n  The problems it purports to address are purely hypothetical since \nthere have been no elections since the Citizens United case. I have \nseen no evidence of any abuse in the current election cycle. This \nlegislation is an attempt to change the rules to protect incumbent \ncandidates from criticism of unpopular decisions and positions. I know \nnone of us like to be criticized, but we must uphold the right of \nothers to criticize us.\n  Even those of us who opposed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act--BCRA \nbut also known by the name McCain-Feingold--recognize that its authors \nsought to avoid any partisan advantage. The new rules then applied to \neveryone, and they only applied after the subsequent election. The same \ncannot be said for the DISCLOSE Act. It is 117 pages in which the \nbill's authors pick winners and losers, either through outright \nprohibitions or restrictions that are so complex they achieve the same \nresult. The effort is too political, benefiting traditional Democratic \nallies,\n\n[[Page S6273]]\n\nsuch as labor unions, while placing burdensome restrictions on for-\nprofit organizations and the associations that represent them.\n  Let me give you one example regarding the union exemptions. The new \nlaw applies to government contractors but not their unions or unions \nwith government contracts or government unions. It is obviously \ndiscriminatory. As Leader McConnell has asked, where in the first \namendment does it say that only large and entrenched special interests \nget the ``freedom of speech''?\n  Here is what the AFL-CIO president, Richard Trumka, said about the \nbill in April:\n\n       Congressional leaders today took a vitally important first \n     step to begin to address the Supreme Court's recent decision \n     in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. The AFL-\n     CIO commends these efforts and supports increasing disclosure \n     and reexamining some current campaign finance rules. . . .It \n     is imperative that legislation counter the excessive and \n     disproportionate influence by business.\n\n  Well, they have made sure it does.\n  Unlike BCRA, the DISCLOSE Act has an effective date of 30 days after \nenactment. In other words, proponents want people to stop political \nspeech now, before the midterm elections in November.\n  Hundreds of diverse organizations oppose this bill, from the ACLU to \nthe chamber of commerce. Let me just quote two.\n  Here is a letter from several hundred of the Nation's leading trade \nassociation and business groups:\n\n       By attempting to silence corporations' voice in the \n     political process while enabling unions to retain their \n     enormous influence, Schumer-Van Hollen is a patently \n     unconstitutional threat to the elections process. Schumer-Van \n     Hollen is a direct attack on the rights of the business \n     community and the role our organizations play in the national \n     political dialogue.\n\n  And a letter from the National Right to Life organization:\n\n       The overriding purpose is . . . to discourage, as much as \n     possible, disfavored groups, such as the [National Right to \n     Life Committee], from communicating about officeholders. . . \n     .This legislation has been carefully crafted to maximize \n     short-term political benefits for the dominant faction of one \n     political party, while running roughshod over the First \n     Amendment protections for political speech that have been \n     clearly and forcefully articulated by the Supreme Court.\n\n  So I hope my colleagues will recognize the damage they are doing to \npolitical discourse in violation of the first amendment that is a \nresult of the legislation that has been drafted here for purely \npolitical advantage and will oppose the DISCLOSE Act.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the Citizens United case has aimed a \ndagger at the heart of American democracy. So I rise today in support \nof the DISCLOSE Act, to stop that dagger aimed at our heart.\n  Our Nation is unique in world history in that it was founded not on \nnationality or royal bloodlines but on an idea--a simple yet \nrevolutionary idea--that the country's people are in charge. As was so \noften the case, Abraham Lincoln said it better than anyone--that the \nUnited States is a ``government of the people, by the people, for the \npeople.'' What that means is we, the elected officials, work for the \npeople. They elect us. They are in charge. But this idea, this vision, \nthis government by and for the people cannot survive if our elections \nare not open, fair, and free. The government is not by or for the \npeople if corporations and even foreign corporations and giant \ngovernment contractors are able to hijack the electoral process to run \nmillions of dollars of attack ads against any candidate or any \nlegislator who dares to put the public interest ahead of a company's \ninterest.\n\n  Our Constitution, through the first amendment, puts the highest \nprotection on political speech, recognizing how important it is that \ncitizens be able to debate the merits of candidates and the merits of \nideas. But if the essence of the first amendment is that competing \nvoices should be heard in the marketplace of ideas, the Citizens United \ndecision just gave the largest corporations a stadium sound system with \nwhich to drown out the voice of American citizens.\n  Think about the scale of the spending this decision allows. My Senate \nrace was far and away the most expensive election in Oregon history. \nThe two candidates together spent around $20 million. ExxonMobil, a \nsingle corporation, made $20 million in profits every 10 hours in 2010, \nand that was during their worst year in a decade. If you like negative \nads, you would love the impact of Citizens United. Imagine what \ncorporations will do to put favorite candidates in office. The sheer \nvolume of money could allow corporations to handpick their candidates, \nproviding unlimited support to their campaigns to take out anyone who \nwould dare to stand up for the public interest.\n  The DISCLOSE Act will help prevent special interests from drowning \nout the voice of American citizens. First, this bill will bring \ntransparency to campaigns now that unlimited money is allowed to be \nspent on negative attack ads. If you are looking to buy a used car and \nsomeone tells you the engine looks great, you would want to know if the \nperson saying that is your trusted mechanic or the used car salesman. \nWho is speaking is critical information in evaluating the message. With \nthat principle in mind, the DISCLOSE Act makes the CEO of a company \nstand by their words. The CEO will have to say at the end of the ad \nthat he or she approves this message, just as political candidates have \nto do today. It is common sense. If a company is willing to spend \nmillions working against a candidate, the voters have a right to know \nabout that company's involvement instead of allowing it to hide behind \nshadowy front groups.\n  The second problem the DISCLOSE Act takes on is the system of ``pay-\nto-play'' where companies campaign on behalf of candidates in order to \nget access to government contracts. This legislation bars that form of \ncorruption. It bars government contractors from running campaign ads \nand paying for other campaign activities on behalf of a Federal \ncandidate.\n  Passing the DISCLOSE Act is key to sustaining the healthy democracy \nthat represents the interests of American citizens. A healthy democracy \nrequires transparency, an equal voice for all its citizens, not an \namplified voice for those who represent very large corporations.\n  So I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation. As President \nLincoln, a great Republican President, reminds us: The essence of the \nNation, the cause that brought a generation of patriots to challenge \nthe greatest military power of the 18th century, the idea that inspired \npeople to leave everything behind to come to our shores is a government \nof the people, by the people, and for the people.\n  We are here because we work for the American people. Let's pass the \nDISCLOSE Act today so our successors can say the same thing tomorrow.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, how much time is available to this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 24 minutes 10 seconds available.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity of \naddressing this issue and of listening to my colleagues as they talk \nabout it. I haven't heard some of this exorbitant language since I left \nthe campaign trail. I left the campaign trail forcibly but, \nnonetheless, I have some memory of it, and I realize that in a period \nof a campaign, people get carried away.\n  ``A dagger at the heart of our democracy'' is a phrase that has been \nused. ``The destruction of government of the people'' is a phrase that \nhas been used. If I can think of someone who uses this kind of language \nquite normally in the political discourse, the name of Michael Moore \ncomes to mind. The reason I raise Michael Moore is because we are \ntalking about a movie. That is the source of this entire decision.\n  There is a group of people who decided they wanted to make a movie \nthat was critical of a candidate for President of the United States. In \nthis case it was former Senator Hillary Clinton. They didn't like her \nand they wanted to make a movie and they did. In the same vein, Michael \nMoore, who didn't like George W. Bush, made a movie entitled \n``Fahrenheit 9/11.'' Nobody got excited about Michael Moore's movie in \nterms of violating the Constitution or a dagger at the heart of our \ndemocracy or destroying the legacy of Abraham Lincoln because\n\n[[Page S6274]]\n\nwe knew Michael Moore. We knew the kinds of things Michael Moore was \nfamous for doing, and overstating a position is Michael Moore's stock \nin trade.\n  So the folks at Citizens United decided they were going to follow the \nMichael Moore precedent and make a movie. I haven't seen either movie, \nso I don't know whether Citizens United's movie about Hillary Clinton \nwent as far over the top as Michael Moore's movie about George W. Bush, \nand I don't care because Michael Moore, regardless of what distortions \nmay have been in his movie, had every right under the Constitution of \nthe United States to make that movie, to make the political speech, and \nto do the very best he could to influence the election.\n  The movie was a financial success, and the movie was a critical \nsuccess, and the movie did not win the election. The movie did not \ndefeat George W. Bush. The American people had other things to do \nbesides watch Michael Moore's movie. He exercised his first amendment \nright to freedom of speech. He got the opportunity to say what he \nwanted to say, he spent a lot of money doing it, and the movie was \nwidely seen. The democracy did not come to an end as a result of the \nmaking of the movie. Now we are told that Citizens United made a movie \nand somehow that is going to have a vastly different effect.\n  I don't believe Senator Clinton's loss to Barack Obama in the \nprimaries had much to do with the movie that Citizens United made. They \nspent a lot of money, but I don't think it was an avalanche of spending \nby a corporation that destroyed American democracy because Hillary \nClinton did not win the nomination. I think it had a great deal more to \ndo with Barack Obama's ability to run a decent campaign rather than \nHillary Clinton's suffering at the hands of Citizens United making this \nmovie.\n  Well, because Citizens United was not one individual in the form of \nMichael Moore, but because it was a group of individuals who got \ntogether and took the opportunity to create a corporate form of \nidentity for the making of their movie, that got them in trouble. An \nindividual could do it, but a group of individuals who organized \nthemselves into a corporation couldn't do it. That went to the Supreme \nCourt, and the Supreme Court said yes; they could. I don't find that to \nbe a great destruction of the first amendment. I find that to be the \nproper statement on the part of the Supreme Court to say: Let's have \nvigorous political speech in this country, and if a group of people \nwant to do that vigorous speech in the form of a corporation, let them \ngo at it. Let them have at it. The Supreme Court was right, in my \nopinion.\n  I hear those people who attack Citizens United say: Yes, the first \namendment protects the right of free speech, but it does so for \nindividuals. Corporations are not individuals, neither are unions. Yet \nthe DISCLOSE Act treats unions differently than it treats corporations. \nThe DISCLOSE Act goes after corporations and their right of free speech \nand does its very best to see to it that the restrictions they put on \ncorporations do not apply to unions.\n  The DISCLOSE Act listens to the outcry of some corporations such as \nthe National Rifle Association and says: Well, we won't make it apply \nto you and, thus, demonstrates that it is responding to political \npressure from people who say we will punish you at the polls if you \ntake away our right of free speech. So the act is written in such a way \nthat some corporations get treated differently than other corporations. \nOf course, unions get treated different from all corporations.\n  Is this the way we want to deal with the first amendment right of \nfree speech where everybody ought to have exactly the same rights? I am \ntold: Oh, no. This bill doesn't prohibit any free speech. All this does \nis disclose. That is why it is called the DISCLOSE Act. You Republicans \nare in favor of transparency. You want to disclose things. Why don't \nyou support the DISCLOSE Act?\n  Well, if it is a bill aimed at disclosure, why does the word \n``prohibit'' and the companion word ``prohibition'' appear all through \nthe bill? I have a copy of the bill right here.\n  On page 4, section 3, listed on page 4, it begins, ``Prohibiting \nindependent expenditures and electioneering communications . . . ''\n  On page 5, section 3: ``Prohibiting independent expenditures'' and so \non.\n  Section 6: ``Prohibiting independent expenditures . . . ''\n  Then, on page 6, in section 7: ``In these ways, prohibiting \nindependent expenditures . . . ''\n  We go to the first title of the bill, and it is titled ``Regulation \nof Certain Political Spending.'' Section 101: ``Prohibiting independent \nexpenditures and electioneering communications . . . ''\n  This is not the DISCLOSE Act. This is an act aimed at prohibiting \nexpenditures by certain people and certain groups. Who are they? Well, \ngovernment contractors. I have been in business. I have solicited \ngovernment business. If I got the government business, was I told in \nadvance: If you get this business, you are giving up your first \namendment rights when it comes to political speech? If you can stay \naway from contracting with the government, you can hang on to your \nfirst amendment rights. But as soon as you become a government \ncontractor your rights are gone.\n  It prohibits free speech from those who received TARP money. There is \nan interesting precedent to set. I know some of the folks who received \nTARP money who didn't want it. They were told in that circumstance: You \nwill accept TARP money. The TARP money, as it was distributed in that \nprogram, was forced upon certain corporations. Were they told at the \ntime, or should they be told under the DISCLOSE Act--let's have full \ndisclosure and transparency--when you accept this money, you cannot \nexercise your freedom of speech rights as a result of accepting this \nmoney?\n  General Motors received TARP money, so General Motors says you cannot \nrun an ad expressing your opinion on any matter of public affairs; \nhowever, the United Auto Workers can. The United Auto Workers received \nthe benefit of TARP money. The United Auto Workers received stock in \nGeneral Motors. They are the shareholders of General Motors, to a large \nextent.\n  So do we say, well, under the DISCLOSE Act the unions can express \ntheir first amendment rights all they want, but General Motors, as a \ncorporation, cannot, even though the TARP money was what allowed the \nunion members to keep their jobs.\n  It has been pointed out here that the groups opposed to this are wide \nand diverse--from the Sierra Club to the ACLU. I turn to the letter the \nACLU wrote with respect to this, and they are not dealing with \nhyperbole. They are dealing with experience in reality. Let me go to \nthe first key issue the ACLU talks about and give an example from real \nlife. They say:\n\n       The DISCLOSE Act fails to preserve the anonymity of small \n     donors, thereby especially chilling the expression rights of \n     those who support controversial causes.\n\n  Then the first sentence in that section of their letter says:\n\n       By compelling politically active organizations to disclose \n     the names of donors giving as little as $600, S. 3628 both \n     violates individual privacy and chills free speech on \n     important issues.\n\n  I take my colleagues back to one of the most controversial issues we \nhave seen in this country for a long time, which was proposition 8 in \nCalifornia in the last election.\n  I am acquainted with an individual who made a contribution in favor \nof those who were trying to support proposition 8. That is all she did. \nShe wrote out a check. Someone came to her and said: We are in favor of \nthe proposition and we are trying to raise some money; will you help \nus?\n  She wrote out a check of less than $1,000 and went about her \nbusiness. Her business was a restaurant in Hollywood--a restaurant that \nwas routinely and significantly supported by people in the \nentertainment industry--actors, directors, and others connected with \nmaking movies. When the contribution list for propositions was made \npublic, and it became known that this woman had made a contribution in \nfavor of proposition 8, patronage at her restaurant dropped off more \nthan half. People opposed to proposition 8 started using hate speech \ntoward this woman: You are a bigot, and we cannot patronize your \nrestaurant.\n  She had no idea that when she wrote that check in support of those \nwho wanted a position that she agreed with--to put it on the ballot to \nbe voted on by Californians--and it was by\n\n[[Page S6275]]\n\na majority of Californians who supported it--when she took the majority \nposition of the voters in her State, she had no idea she was going to \nsee her business ravaged by those discovering her name on that list who \nwould go after her.\n  They have a right not to eat at her restaurant, I understand that. \nBut this is a real-life example of what can happen to people in \ncontroversial situations and the ACLU is appropriately concerned about.\n  The DISCLOSE Act, in the name of transparency, would expose small \ndonors to that kind of retaliation. However, if you belong to a union, \nand you pay union dues, and the union dues are spent to produce a \nmovie, something along the lines of what Michael Moore did with \n``Fahrenheit 9/11,'' no one will ever know your union dues were spent \nfor that purpose, because unions are treated differently than \ncorporations.\n  This is a bad bill. It hasn't been through the committee. I am the \nranking member of the Rules Committee to which the bill normally would \nbe referred. The majority leader, exercising his authority, saw to it \nthat the bill didn't get referred to committee. There have been no \nhearings. There is no opportunity for anybody to come forward and say \nthis will be a problem. We haven't heard from the ACLU and a witness \nthat we could question. We only got a letter, because they were shut \nout from any hearings.\n  For those who are offended by my reference to the ACLU and would \nprefer the National Right to Life Organization, well, we have their \nletter, too, but we didn't have an opportunity to hear any of their \nwitnesses or the legal authorities who believe that the Supreme Court \nruled correctly, who might have come before the committee and given us \nthe benefit of their analysis; we haven't had a chance to hear from \nthem either.\n  The bill has been drafted and redrafted a number of times behind \nclosed doors, but we only see the final draft when it gets here on the \nfloor, with no hearings, no background, no opportunity to question, \ncomment, amend, or improve. I am in favor of transparency as much as \nthe next Senator. I am in favor of free speech as much as anyone. I \nhave stood on this floor and quoted James Madison with respect to free \nspeech on a number of issues and have been dismissed on the grounds \nthat, well, anybody can quote James Madison. I believe in the tenth \nFederalist, where Madison made it very clear that the right of factions \nto express themselves freely and openly, even when they clash bitterly, \nis a very fundamental right in the Constitution itself. ``Factions,'' \nas they used the word in Madison's day, referred to political parties. \nI think the term ``factions'' also refers to those whom we speak of as \nspecial interest groups today. James Madison made it very clear that if \nwe attempt to stifle the ability of a faction to express itself, we \nstrike at the core of liberty itself. I hope that people don't \ninterpret that as over-the-top language, as I have heard some other \nthings that I have interpreted as over-the-top language. I sincerely \nbelieve that and I strongly support it.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would not pass the test of truth in advertising. The \ntitle does not disclose what it does here. It is filled with \nprohibitions and violations of the first amendment, and it is filled \nwith special favors for certain groups and attacks on others. For that \nreason, I will oppose cloture and, if cloture is invoked, I will oppose \nthe bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey, who has been an outstanding leader on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleagues in this \ndebate, and I am reminded of a great Republican, President Reagan, who \nsaid, ``There they go again.'' I always find it incredibly interesting \nwhen some of my most conservative colleagues quote the ACLU. Then I \nknow something is amiss. Let me ask, what is the vote that is going to \ntake place? It is simply to allow us to go forward and have a debate, \noffer amendments, and ultimately vote on the bill. That is what this \nbill is all about. So those who say they are for transparency won't \neven let a process move forward that is transparent, so we can debate \nand so that the American people can decide do we want corporations--\nincluding foreign corporations--to have access to who is elected in \nAmerica, in this body and in the Congress, and ultimately making \ndecisions that affect their lives every day?\n  That is what this vote is all about. You can paint it any way you \nwant, but that is what this vote is about. I am amazed they cannot even \nsay yes to proceeding to a debate and a vote on the merits of the bill \nitself.\n  We all know that the Roberts Supreme Court and its activist \nconservative majority overruled, wrongly in my view, restrictions on \nspending by corporations and unions. My colleagues on the other side \nare well aware that, as a result of a perceived loophole in current \nlaw, foreign corporations--those from other countries--would now be \nallowed to fund American election campaigns, to pick their candidates \nwho would reflect their interests if elected or defeat candidates who \nwould not reflect their interests--all without any meaningful mechanism \nor disclosure. Amazing. It is absurd. Nothing could be more ill advised \nor misguided. But here we are, once again, unable to even proceed to \nconsider a bill that would remedy that situation. Once again, my \nRepublican friends are standing in the way of proceeding to a bill, \nstanding in the way of what I consider to be good governance, all in \nthe name of those in their party who hold to some misguided attempt to \ntwist first amendment rights to suit an ideologically based argument \nthat somehow a requirement to disclose contributions would violate the \nfirst amendment. You still can spend the money; nobody is going to stop \nyou from spending the money. But you have to disclose who is behind \nthat contribution. I don't think transparency is something that \nviolates the first amendment. It is the right of the American people to \nreceive the information required by these proposed disclosure laws.\n  Then they twist it even further, virtually saying that all money \nanywhere--even foreign money--is somehow free speech in American \nelections. I think the American people want to be the ones in control \nof who they elect to Congress to decide the issues of the day in their \nlives, not somebody who is backed by some foreign corporation. Imagine \nif BP could say: I don't like Senator Menendez lifting that liability \ncap; I don't want to be liable for more than $75 million, even though I \nhave created billions of dollars in costs, so let me fund candidates \nwho agree that Senator Menendez's legislation to lift the liability \ncaps on limited liability should be the ones to get elected, because \nthey are going to take care of what? BP, which is a foreign \ncorporation.\n\n  Imagine if the insurance industry said: We don't even have to put our \nface on that announcement, that advertisement. Let's go fund those \ncandidates who will allow us, the insurance industry, to continue to \ndeny people who have a preexisting condition in this country the \nopportunity to get health insurance--where a child at birth has a \ndefect and cannot get health insurance, or a father who had a heart \nattack on the job cannot get health insurance. Let's fund those \ncandidates who will ensure that we as an industry don't have to insure \nthose individuals.\n  Imagine those companies on Wall Street which don't like the new law \nthat we just passed and want to see it rolled back so they can continue \nto have the excesses that almost brought this Nation to economic \ncollapse. They could say: Let's fund those candidates who will allow us \nto have not a free market but a free-for-all market. That is what this \nlaw is all about. That is what this vote is all about. I believe the \npeople of New Jersey, which I represent, and people elsewhere, want \ndisclosure.\n  Finally, disclosure takes place by knowing who is giving this money.\n  The bottom line is I want Americans to decide American elections. I \ndon't want some foreign company funding candidates who ultimately \nenhance their views. I don't want big business deciding elections on \nthe basis of their corporate interests versus the interests of the \npeople. That is what this bill is all about. I can't understand the \nfear my colleagues on the other side of the\n\n[[Page S6276]]\n\naisle have of simply letting us go to a full debate and an up-or-down \nvote.\n  Look, if this law is poorly drafted and the majority of the Senate \nvotes against it, so be it. But not even to allow us to go to that \ndebate, to stop foreign corporations and foreign influence in our \nelections, to allow the BPs of the world to influence the way in which \nwe have the gulf cleanup, or to allow the insurance industry to deny \npeople based on preexisting conditions, or allow Wall Street to run \nwild--on and on--that is fundamentally wrong. That is what this debate \nis about, and that is what the vote will be all about.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island, Senator Reed, who is speaking as in morning business. \nSenator Franken spoke on the bill during morning business, and Senator \nReed was kind enough to give him time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, last Friday, this Chamber played host to \nheroes: seven wounded warriors from the 82nd Airborne Division, who are \ncurrently recuperating at Walter Reed Army Hospital. They came down for \na tour of the Capitol, and for moments here on the floor of the Senate, \nin which they were able to see their government in action.\n  More important, we were able to thank them for their extraordinary \nservice and sacrifice to the Nation. I am particularly proud because \nthey are soldiers from my division--the 82nd Airborne Division.\n  We had among our guests SGT Steven Dandoy, who was wounded last month \nin a mortar attack in Afghanistan, of the third battalion 321st Field \nArtillery, whose hometown is Milwaukee, WI; SGT Allen Thomas, who is \nfrom Adelphi, MD, and serves with the 2-508 Parachute Infantry \nRegiment, who was wounded in Afghanistan this past March during an \nattack from a suicide bomber, and he was joined by his fiancee, Donna; \nSPC Antonio Brown, from Florence, SC.\n  We were honored to have SPC Antonio Brown from Florence, SC. He was \nwounded in Iraq in 2007 when a 50-caliber round detonated in his hand. \nHe was serving with the 2nd Battalion of the 325th Parachute Infantry \nRegiment.\n  SPC John Doherty of Jerome, ID, was wounded when a 50-caliber round \ndetonated in his hand in April while he was serving with the 2nd \nBattalion of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment. Amazingly, he \nrecently passed his flight physical with the goal of qualifying as an \nArmy helicopter pilot despite his wound.\n  SPC Jeffrey McKnight of the 1st Battalion of the 508th Parachute \nInfantry Regiment and hailing from Littleton, CO, was also our guest. \nHe was wounded last month during a vehicle rollover in Afghanistan.\n  SPC William Ross also serves with the 2nd Battalion of the 508th \nParachute Infantry Regiment. He was our guest also. Specialist Ross \nhails from Knoxville, TN. He is recovering from a gunshot wound he \nreceived during a dismounted patrol in March. He was joined by his \nfiancee Tiffany.\n  SPC Nicholas Stone of the 2nd Battalion of the 508th Parachute \nInfantry Regiment was also our guest. He hails from Buffalo, NY. He is \nrecovering from wounds suffered in an IED attack on a dismounted patrol \nin May. He was joined by his wife Kristen.\n  Let me also say it is appropriate to recognize the families of these \nwounded warriors because they, too, serve. They, too, sacrifice. In \nfact, during the long hours of rehabilitation and therapy at Walter \nReed, they are at the bedside literally of their wounded soldiers. I \nthank them.\n  I also thank SFC Albert Comfort and SSG Rodolfo Nunez from the 82nd \nAirborne Division. They are the Division Liaisons for the wounded \nwarriors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\n  These young men left the comfort and safety of their homes all across \nthis country to serve this Nation. Their service, their sacrifice \nsustains us. They are the fabric of our defense. They are those young \nmen and women who serve in great danger but with unfailing fidelity to \nthe Army and to the Nation. Because of them, we are able to oppose \nthose who seek us harm.\n  We can never repay them enough. We can never thank them enough. But \nlast Friday we had seven of these wounded warriors down just to say: \nThank you, well done, and to give them a chance to look at the Senate \nand see the history that was made by their predecessors, and which they \nare sustaining and will make in the future.\n  It was a special moment for me because these soldiers come from the \n82nd Airborne Division. One of the great privileges of my life--in \nfact, I believe this is one of the greatest privileges an American can \nhave--was leading American soldiers in the 82nd Airborne Division as \nthe company commander of Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion of the 504th \nParachute Infantry Regiment. I learned a lot about service, sacrifice, \nand the contribution of Americans from across this globe, as well as \nthe great potential of Americans, not only to defend our Nation but to \ndo great things, furthering the goals and ideals of this country.\n  I conclude by saying to these young soldiers: Thank you very much for \nyour service. Good luck. Godspeed.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island. \nHe looks out, as our only West Point graduate in the Senate, for all \nour troops throughout the Nation. We salute him for it. I was proud he \nmentioned a brave trooper from Buffalo, NY.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is left on our side and \nhow much time on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minute 45 seconds remaining on the \nside of the Senator from New York. On the Republican side, there is 6 \nminutes 52 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I wish to reserve 5 minutes for Senator Brown, who \nwishes to speak. I believe he is on his way. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the last 5 minutes be reserved for Senator Brown, and I will speak \non the remaining time--I know it is the other side's time--until one of \nthem appears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we heard a lot from the other side. I \nwill be speaking in conclusion on this bill, along with Senator Reid, \nafter the lunch break. We have never heard such falsities. The other \nside, first, talks about free speech and talks about how corporations \nhave the right to free speech. The Constitution now guarantees that \nafter Citizens United--and our bill does not get in the way of free \nspeech. It simply requires disclosure, which the Court said was \nimportant.\n  Second, they are talking about how it treats unions and corporations \ndifferently. The bottom line is, the unions are opposed to this bill \nand to simply say that a $600 limit favors unions, no, we are just \nfavoring big, huge givers who give tens of thousands, hundreds of \nthousands of dollars over small, little givers. If there is a union \nperson who gives $10,000, they will be under this law. If there is a \ncorporate person who gives $500, they will not be. It is a misnomer.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Illinois has arrived. Since I will \nbe speaking after the lunch, and I am just waiting for Senator Brown to \narrive, I yield the remaining time, other than the 5 minutes for \nSenator Brown, to my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Illinois \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for his \nleadership on this legislation. We are here because the Supreme Court, \nacross the street, decided, in a case called Citizens United, to change \nthe way we campaign for office in America. They want to change it and \nsay corporations and special interest groups can spend unlimited \namounts of money on political campaigns.\n  Most of the people I talk with in Illinois and across the country \nthink they have enough political advertising when it comes to \ncampaigns. Hold on tight because, for example, the U.S. Chamber \nCommerce announced they may spend as much as $75 million in this \nelection cycle on more television advertising to promote candidates who \nagree with their positions on issues. That is about a five or six times \nincrease in the amount of money they will spend.\n\n[[Page S6277]]\n\n  What it does, of course, is crowd out those of modest means. Any mere \nmortals left on this political scene who have to rely either on their \nown limited savings or raising money from others are going to find \nthemselves overwhelmed and inundated by this Supreme Court decision. \nBut it is a Supreme Court decision. Senator Schumer and the Rules \nCommittee, on which I serve, sat down and said that at least if we are \ngoing to do this, let's have disclosure about the sources of these ads \nby special interest groups. Let's find out who is paying for the ads. \nLet's make them stand and say: This is my ad; I paid for it, rather \nthan sneak around with names that mean little to nothing and inundate \nthe airwaves so voters are confused and overwhelmed and not sure from \nwhere the ads are coming.\n  The act is called the DISCLOSE Act because that is what it is all \nabout. Sadly, it appears there is going to be a straight party vote, \nperhaps with a few exceptions, on this DISCLOSE Act.\n  It is hard to understand how the Republicans can take this position. \nLet me read a quote. ``What we ought to have is disclosure,'' this \nSenator said. ``I think groups should have the right to run those ads, \nbut they ought to be disclosed and they ought to be accurate.'' Who \nsaid that? The Senator from Kentucky, the minority leader, the \nRepublican leader in the context of McCain-Feingold during the debate \non campaign finance reform.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is not the only Senator who seems to \nsupport the concept of disclosure. The Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nSessions, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said earlier \nthis year:\n\n       I don't like it when a large source of money is out there \n     funding ads and is unaccountable. To the extent we can, I \n     tend to favor disclosure.\n\n  Pretty clear, isn't it? That looked like the Republican position \nuntil the Supreme Court decision. Why would they be against disclosure? \nThey are betting that most of these ads are going to be on behalf of \ntheir candidates and against Democrats. That is what it comes down to.\n  I happen to think disclosure is right whether it is a union or \ncorporation. I think voters ought to know from where this information \nis coming. I can talk to you about why I think this is important as a \nvoter, as a Senator, as a taxpayer. But what it boils down to is if we \nare going to have a system electing people to this Chamber who are \naccountable to the people they represent and not to special interest \ngroups, the voters have to understand where candidates are coming from.\n  If my opponent--or even if I decide to be heavily supported by \nspecial interest groups--decides to put money in the race, I think the \nvoters of Illinois are entitled to know that. They should take that \ninto consideration when they decide how they are going to vote come the \nnext election. That is only fair.\n  I support Senator Schumer's effort on the DISCLOSE Act. It is a move \nin the right direction. I hope after we enact this legislation, we will \nconsider something else. I have a bill for the public funding of \ncampaigns. Wouldn't it be great if we got out of the business of \nraising money to create trust funds for television stations across \nAmerica, if instead we basically had a publicly funded campaign? That \nwould be in the best interests of democracy and the best interest of \ngiving the voters the information they need but not overwhelmed by \nspecial interests.\n  The Senator from Texas, the chairman of the Senate Republicans' \ncampaign committee, seems to agree with Senator Sessions. He said \nearlier this year:\n\n       I think the system needs more transparency, so people can \n     more easily reach their own conclusions.\n\n  Amen.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would bring greater transparency to the source of \ncampaign ads flooding the airwaves before an election, so that voters \ncan make good decisions for themselves as to whether the ads are \ntruthful or not.\n  As a voter, I want to know who has paid for a political ad, and I \ndon't want foreign companies trying to buy our elections.\n  As a taxpayer, I don't want big companies with more than $10 million \ndollars in Federal contracts to be able to buy ads so they can curry \nfavor with legislators who they hope could help them receive even \nlarger contracts.\n  As a shareholder of a company, I want to know what political \nactivities the management of the company is spending my company's money \non.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would help with all of these goals.\n  The bill would make CEOs and other leaders take responsibility for \ntheir ads; require companies and groups to disclose to the FEC within \n24 hours of conducting any campaign-related activity or transferring \nmoney to other campaign groups; prevent foreign countries from \ncontributing to the outcome of our elections; mandate that \ncorporations, unions, and other groups disclose their campaign \nactivities to shareholders and members in their annual and periodic \nreports; bar large government contractors from receiving taxpayer funds \nand then using that money to run campaign ads; restrict companies from \n``sponsoring'' a candidate.\n  This is all commonsense stuff.\n  Let me be clear: I think we should go much further to change the way \nwe finance campaigns in this country.\n  I believe very strongly in the Fair Elections Now Act, which would \nallow viable candidates who qualify for the fair elections program to \nraise a maximum of $100 from any donor. These candidates would receive \nmatching funds and grants in order to compete with high roller \ncandidates.\n  That would change the system fundamentally, and put average citizens \nback in control of their elections and their country.\n  But in the wake of the Citizens United decision, which would allow \ncompanies to spend freely and directly on political campaigns, the \nleast we should do is to pass this commonsense transparency bill.\n  Is it asking too much to require a group or company to briefly \nmention that they are behind an ad, so that the American people know \nwho is paying for what? I don't think it is. And once upon a time, many \nRepublicans did not think so either.\n  I will close with one more quote from my friend from Kentucky, the \nminority leader, from an interview years ago on ``Meet the Press'':\n\n       Republicans are in favor of disclosure.\n\n  You can't state a position much more clearly than that. Are they \nstill? Or were Senate Republicans for campaign finance disclosure \nbefore they were against it?\n  We will find out soon enough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nhis, once again, elegant words and yield to my friend from Ohio who has \nbeen a great voice in this body for the average family, the working \nfamily. I yield the remaining time we have left this morning on our \nside to Senator Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from New \nYork. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 32 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, yesterday, in the Rose Garden, \nPresident Obama made clear the choice Members of this body face as they \nvote on the DISCLOSE Act. It is a choice between granting special \ninterests unfettered and secret influence over their elections and the \nchoice of ensuring basic protections to voices of everyday Americans.\n  Again, these will be ads run by interest groups that do not identify \nthemselves--unfettered, secret, unlimited in the amount of money they \ncan spend to elect their friends to Congress.\n  We know what happened in 2009 when corporations spent over $3 billion \nlobbying Congress to influence their agenda. We know with the Wall \nStreet bill and the health care bill, more than $1 million a day was \nspent to weaken those laws. We know what ultimately happens, what \nhappens when this kind of special interest influence descends on this \nbody. First of all, the money they spend in elections to elect their \nfriends and allies--BP, the drug companies, the insurance industries, \nthe big companies that outsource jobs from the United States to China--\nwe know what happens when they spend money to elect their friends, and \nwe know what happens when they lobby in the Halls of Congress.\n  We saw examples of that particularly during the Bush years. I was in \nthe\n\n[[Page S6278]]\n\nHouse of Representatives in those days, as was the Presiding Officer \nrepresenting a district in New Mexico. We saw in those days the drug \ncompanies writing the Medicare legislation. The legislation was a \nbailout for the drug and insurance companies in the name of Medicare \nprivatization. We saw it on trade issues. We saw the big companies that \noutsource jobs write trade agreements, such as NAFTA and CAFTA. On \nhealth care issues, we saw the big insurance companies writing \nlegislation, assisting President Bush in getting his pro-insurance \ncompany legislation through. We know on the energy legislation, \nsomething the Presiding Officer worked to try to fix--unfortunately, we \nwere all unsuccessful in the Bush years--with regard to writing energy \nlegislation, we saw the oil companies do that.\n  If we do not fix this, if we do not pass the Schumer bill, we are \ngoing to see a further betrayal of the middle class, further betrayal \nof democratic ideals--democratic with a small ``d.'' We no longer can \nbrook in this institution, giving the drug companies the authority to \nwrite Medicare legislation, the insurance companies the ability to \nwrite health care legislation, the big companies that outsource the \nability to write trade legislation, the oil industry to write energy \nlegislation. It has happened over and over again. We should have \nlearned this lesson this decade.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are very comfortable \nwith helping their benefactors, with helping the oil industry, the drug \ncompanies, the insurance companies, and those big companies that move \noverseas and outsource our jobs. That is why the DISCLOSE Act is very \nimportant. Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, you do not want \nto see our democratic system become the puppet of corporate America or \nany other special interest. You do not want to give corporations the \nability to drown out the voices of the people--their customers, \nworkers, and, frankly, their shareholders.\n  The least we can do is empower citizens with information to evaluate \nthe motives behind corporate and special interest spending. I do not \nwant to see these huge dollars spent in these races, to be sure. But at \na minimum, we have to make sure the public knows who is spending it, \nwho the executives are who will benefit from these huge expenditures \nfrom the drug and insurance companies, from the oil industry, and those \nbig companies that outsource.\n  It is a pretty clear choice. A vote for the DISCLOSE Act, a vote for \ncloture is a vote for the public interest. A vote against cloture, a \nvote against the DISCLOSE Act is getting right in line with giving \nthose special interests--Wall Street, the drug companies, the insurance \ncompanies, the big companies that outsource jobs, the oil industry--\nwhat they want.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I am going to proceed on my leader \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can proceed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 8 years ago, Congress passed and the \nPresident signed a bill known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act or \nBCRA. This bill was the culmination of a long and protracted battle in \nwhich I played a major part, as many of my friends on both sides of the \naisle will recall. It garnered bipartisan support and bipartisan \nopposition. Many hearings were held, studies were conducted, and a \nlengthy record on both sides of the issue was developed.\n  I strongly opposed that bill. But I commend its authors for one \nthing: In drafting and passing BCRA, they made every effort to ensure \nthat everybody had to play by the same rules--rules, moreover, that \nwould not take effect in the middle of an election year. They wanted to \nmake sure there was no appearance of giving one party a partisan \nadvantage, and in that they succeeded.\n  Fast forward to today. Late last week, Democratic leaders decided to \ntake us off of the small business bill to move to the DISCLOSE Act, a \nbill that is the mirror opposite of BCRA in the partisan way it was \ndrafted and in the partisan way it is being pushed ahead of an \nelection.\n  Let's be perfectly clear here. This bill is not what its supporters \nsay it is. It is not an effort to promote transparency. It is not a \nresponse to the Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United which has now \nbeen the law of the land for 7 months and which, contrary to the \nbreathless warnings of some, has not caused the world to stop turning \non its axis.\n  This bill is a partisan effort, pure and simple, drafted behind \nclosed doors by current and former Democratic campaign committee \nleaders, and it is aimed at one thing and one thing only. This bill is \nabout protecting incumbent Democrats from criticism ahead of this \nNovember's election--a transparent attempt to rig the fall election.\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\n  The supporters of this bill say it is about transparency. To that, I \nsay it is transparent all right. It is a transparent effort, as I said, \nto rig the fall elections. They are so intent on their goal that they \nare willing to launch an all-out assault on the first amendment in \norder to get there. Democrats achieved something truly remarkable in \ndrafting this bill. They united the ACLU and the Chamber of Commerce--\nquite an accomplishment--both, of course, in opposition. Why would they \noppose it? Because it is as obvious to these groups as it is to me that \nthe DISCLOSE Act is a clear violation of the right to free speech--a \nclear violation.\n  As usual with Democrats in this Congress, the process has not been \nany better than the substance. Over in the House, the Democratic \ncampaign committee chairman sprung a rewrite of substantial portions \nthat Republicans and even Democrats had not seen shortly before this \nbill was voted on. Not to be outdone, Democrats here in the Senate \nintroduced a version last week that had been substantially rewritten \nsince it was first introduced in April. In other words, the original \nSenate version was replaced under a veil of secrecy late last week, and \nthat is the one the Democrats wish for us to proceed to today. A \nmassive rewrite of the laws that govern elections, and Democrats want \nto give 6 days between introduction and a vote; a massive rewrite of \nthe Nation's campaign finance laws without hearings, without testimony, \nwithout studies, and without a markup; another bill produced without a \nsingle hearing and placed directly on the calendar to bypass even the \nRules Committee, which is supposed to have jurisdiction over this \nissue; a bill written behind closed doors with the help of lobbyists \nand special interests--all of this, all of this in the name of \ntransparency. Forget the DISCLOSE Act. What we need is a ``Transparency \nin Legislating about Elections Act.''\n  This approach to this bill could not be more different than BCRA. \nHowever much I disagreed with that bill, it treated all groups, \ncorporations, unions, parties, and individuals the same. From the ban \non party non-Federal dollars to advertisement limitations within \nproximity of an election, BCRA's restrictions and prohibitions were \napplied evenly. The DISCLOSE Act is the opposite: 117 pages of stealth \nnegotiations in which Democrats pick winners and losers, either through \noutright prohibitions or restrictions so complex that they end up \nachieving the same result.\n  The unions do not need a carve-out because they got exemptions. The \nnew law applies to government contractors but not to their unions or \nunions with government contracts. Let me run that by you again. The \nunions do not need a carve-out because they got exemptions. The new law \napplies to government contractors, but not their unions or unions with \ngovernment contracts. It does not apply to government unions. It \napplies to domestic subsidiaries but not to their unions or \ninternational unions. Through threshold and transfer exemptions, unions \nare the ultimate victors under this bill. I would note that numerous \nattempts were made to provide parity in the House Administration \nCommittee markup. All were defeated on a partisan basis with no \ncredible explanation. It is hard not to laugh in discussing this \nmonstrosity we will be voting on shortly. And this is what they are \ncalling transparency?\n  In their efforts to pass this partisan bill ahead of the election, \nDemocrats have been forced to do the same kind of horse trading we saw \nin the health care debate. Some of the deals they struck were aimed at \nattracting special interest support, while others were aimed at \nquelling special interest opposition. In the end, they came up with a \nbizarre carve-out construct that grants first amendment freedoms to the \nchosen ones, and the results are not any prettier than the health care \nbill.\n  Follow this logic: The exemption applies to 501(c)(4)s, with 500,000 \nmembers in all 50 States plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, \nin existence for 10 years, who receive less than 15 percent of their \nmoney from corporations or labor unions. In case you do not know who \nthis provision is aimed at, it is a carve-out for the NRA, as well as \nthe AARP and the Humane Society, among unknown others who may be in \nthis category, but not to groups such as AIPAC or groups formed to \nadvocate for victims of the oilspill or Hurricane Katrina.\n  So if you have 400,000 members, sit down and shut up. If you were \nfounded in 2002, nice try, sit down. If you do not have the ability to \nrecruit members in every State, zip it, shut your mouth. These are the \ncontortions--the contortions--the authors of this bill had to go \nthrough to get it this far.\n  Worse still, the DISCLOSE Act mandates that its provisions shall take \neffect without--again, it is hard to go through this bill without \nbreaking into unrestrained laughter--it mandates that its provisions \nshall take effect without regard to whether the Federal Election \nCommission has promulgated regulations to carry out such amendments. \nThis, of course, will have the practical effect of paralyzing those who \nwant to participate in the political process. If they do not know what \nthe rules are, they will take themselves out of the game, which is \nclearly what the authors of this bill had in mind.\n  So let me ask a question. All of these new reporting obligations, \nfiling requirements, certification mandates, and transfer burdens are \nto occur but how? How? Are there magic forms out there we do not know \nabout? Do folks write e-mails to the FEC, the FCC, or the SEC? Maybe we \nbring back telegrams or use a Harry Potter owl or the Pony Express. \nUnder threat of criminal sanctions, this provision is a clear message \nfrom the Justice Department to anyone covered by the new restrictions \nin this bill: Go ahead and speak. Make my day.\n  Lastly, recognizing the important constitutional questions at issue \nwith BCRA--and everybody on both sides of that debate knew there were \nimportant constitutional questions involved--an expedited judicial \nreview provision was included in that bill and subsequently used. But \nnot so in this one. In order to make sure this bill is not held up by \nsomething as inconvenient--as inconvenient--as a challenge on first \namendment grounds, its authors have made sure no court action \ninterferes with their new restrictions this election cycle, and maybe \neven the next one as well. They add multiple layers of review, no \nprovision addressing an appeal to the Supreme Court whatsoever, no time \nlimits for filing, and no congressional direction to the courts to \nexpedite. Again, the goal of the proponents of this speech rights \nreduction act is abundantly clear: Slow the process and secure new \nrules that help incumbent Democrats for the upcoming elections and for \nthe foreseeable future.\n\n  The one goal here is to get people who would criticize them to stop \ntalking about what Democrats have been doing here in Washington over \nthe last year and a half, a need to shut those people up, a need to \nshut them up real fast here before the upcoming election.\n  The authors of the bill labored behind closed doors to decide who \nwould retain the right to speak--in direct defiance of what the Supreme \nCourt made clear this past January, when Justice Kennedy, writing for \nthe majority, said:\n\n       [W]e find no basis--\n\n  ``no basis''--\n\n     for the proposition that, in the context of political speech, \n     the government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored \n     speakers.\n\n  What could be more clear? ``[W]e find no basis for the proposition \nthat, in the context of political speech, the government may impose \nrestrictions on certain disfavored speakers.''\n  Not exactly an ambiguous holding. But that is, of course, precisely--\nprecisely--what the DISCLOSE Act does. It imposes restrictions on \nspeech. And I would note the one category of speakers upon whom the so-\ncalled reformers have bestowed the greatest speech rights in this bill \nare, of course, the corporations that own media outlets. So a company \nthat owns a TV network, a newspaper, or a blog can say what they want, \nwhen they want, as often as they want.\n  BCRA was debated over the course of many years. Its authors also \nrecognized the importance of not changing the rules on the eve of an \nelection, which is why the legislation went into effect the day after \nthe 2002 midterm elections. The DISCLOSE Act is the opposite. Seeking \nto achieve exactly what BCRA avoided, this legislation has an effective \ndate of 30 days after enactment. If it were not already obvious that \nthis bill is a totally partisan\n\n[[Page S6280]]\n\nexercise, the effective date should be proof positive.\n  And those, Mr. President, are the facts.\n  I must admit it has been a few years since I was in law school. So \nafter I learned about all these special deals, I went back to the first \namendment to look for an asterisk or something indicating that only \nlarge, entrenched, and wealthy special interests get the ``freedom of \nspeech.'' I went and looked at the first amendment again to look for an \nasterisk or something indicating that only large, entrenched, and \nwealthy special interests get the ``freedom of speech.''\n  I could not find it. So I pulled out this Analysis and Interpretation \nof the Constitution, thinking maybe it could be found there. I looked \nand looked, again, to no avail. Then it occurred to me, perhaps on that \nwinter day in 1791, when the first amendment became effective, these \nrights were meant to apply to everyone--everyone. Perhaps it is true \nthe first amendment was adopted to protect the people from the \nCongress, to protect them from laws such as this one, to protect them \nfrom a government that picks winners and losers, to protect them from \nan overreaching government that is supposed to derive its powers from \nthe consent of the governed.\n\n  This DISCLOSE Act is not about reform. It is nothing more than \nDemocrats sitting behind closed doors with special interest lobbyists \nchoosing which favored groups they want to speak in the 2010 elections, \nall in an attempt to protect themselves from criticism of their \ngovernment takeovers, record deficits, and massive unpaid-for \nexpansions of the Federal Government into the lives of the American \npeople. In other words, this is a bill to shield themselves from \naverage Americans exercising their first amendment rights of freedom of \nspeech.\n  Americans want us to focus on jobs, but by taking us off the small \nbusiness bill and moving to this one, Democrats are proving the jobs \nthey care about the most are their own. By moving off of the small \nbusiness bill and moving on to this one, our Democratic friends are \nletting us know the jobs they care about the most are their own. Think \nabout it. Here we are in the middle of the worst recession in memory, \nand Democratic leaders decided to pull us off a bill that is meant to \ncreate jobs in an effort to pass this election-year ploy to hold on to \ntheir own jobs. What could be more cynical than that? A ``yes'' vote on \nthis bill will send a clear message to the American people that their \njobs aren't as important as the jobs of embattled Democratic \npoliticians.\n  In closing, let me just note that hundreds of ideologically diverse \norganizations oppose this bill and have provided us with valuable \ninformation on its various absurdities. But I think the ultimate test \nof this bill's legitimacy is pretty simple. If the Founding Fathers \nwere here, they would remind us. They would hold up the Constitution \nand remind us of the oath we took to support and defend it.\n  As Members cast this vote today, they will come to the well and look \nat the desk to see what the well description says--the sheet of paper \nthat sums up what this vote is about. On the Democratic side, I am sure \nit will include words such as ``transparency'' and ``disclosure'' and \ntalk about the threats to democracy if the bill isn't passed. On our \nside, it will be simpler. The copy of the Constitution will serve as \nour well description, and, more importantly, it will remind us of why \nwe are all here. We are here to protect the Constitution, not our own \nhides.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority has 15 minutes, and I yield to \nSenator Schumer whatever time he may use. I would also alert Members \nthat the vote may be more than 15 minutes from now because I may have \nto use some of my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the leader for yielding.\n  First, all votes cast in this body are important, but it is rare that \na single vote can so unmistakably reveal whose side you are on. Make no \nmistake about it, with today's vote, we are picking sides, and no \namount of words, no amount of sophistry in terms of explanations of \ncalling black white and white black can change that around.\n  At a time when the public's fears about influence of special \ninterests are already high, this decision by the Court stacks the deck \neven more against the average American. And my good friend from \nKentucky is defending the average American? The average American who \nsets up a 501(c)(4) and spends tens of millions of dollars to get his \nviews made known or the average American who puts out 3,400 ads, \nwithout his or her name on them, to vilify a candidate for reasons \nunstated? That is not the average American. We know that. It is very \nclear who is defending the average American: those of us who support \nthe DISCLOSE Act.\n  My friend from Kentucky is worried about transparency in this body \nall of a sudden but doesn't speak for a bill that brings transparency \nto our politics. No one can argue that this bill brings less \ntransparency. No one can argue that.\n  We know what is going on here. There are visions--visions in people's \nheads of Karl Rove spending $50 million, funded by people we don't \nknow, to attack candidates for reasons we are not sure of, and never \nputting their name to it.\n  If you believe in transparency, you believe in the DISCLOSE Act. If \nyou believe in transparency, you believe that someone who has the \nability through their wealth, whether they be a corporation or an \nindividual or a candidate, should put their name on the ad they are \nputting forward over and over and over again. Transparency? This bill \nstands for transparency.\n  I would challenge any of my Republican colleagues to come forward \nwith a bill that pierces through the veil of secrecy the Supreme Court \ndecision allows. As for that great Constitution which we revere, eight \nof the nine Justices said disclosure was certainly constitutional, and \nthey even went out of their way to say it is the right thing to do. We \nknow why the other side doesn't want to do it. They are talking about \nDemocrats not wanting to be attacked. No one wants to be attacked. All \nwe are saying is, if you are going to attack us, put your name on the \nad. And the other side is resisting that. We know why. Because with \nsome of the ads that are run--by everybody--if you don't have to put \nyour name on them, there is less of a reason to stick to the truth and \nstick to the facts. That is why for years we have put this burden on \nourselves. We said that we as candidates have to stand by our ad. Why \nshouldn't big corporations have to stand by their ad? I would like \nanyone on the other side to answer that question.\n  This is all about secrecy, not free speech. No one is saying they \ncan't run ads. The Constitution now allows it, even out of corporate \ntreasuries, but the Constitution allows and smiles upon greater free \nspeech disclosure.\n  So you can talk all about the process: ``I was surprised we are going \noff the jobs bill.'' For how many months and weeks and hours through \nprocedural delays has the other side kept us from going to various jobs \nbills? All of a sudden, when it comes time to lift the veil of secrecy \non these ads, all of a sudden they say: Let's get back to a jobs bill. \nOh, no. This fight will continue.\n  I spoke to some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. They \nwere very sincere. Many of them, a good number, said to me: We should \nhave disclosure, but the pressure is too great because this act would \nundo much of the electoral advantage that Citizens United--just due to \nthe way our politics works now--would bring to the other side of the \naisle. One of them said to me: It is skins and shirts. No one can \ndeviate from the party line. So the opposition to this act is defending \nthe Constitution when the Constitution upholds and supports disclosure; \nis defending the average guy when the average guy or gal has no \nopportunity to run these ads; is defending fairness and equality when \nit is only a limited, privileged few who will have the ability to put \nthese ads on over and over and over again. That is not playing straight \nand not playing fair with the American people.\n  We have made this bill a fair bill that treats all sides equally. \nSome say: Well, there is a $600 limitation. Of course, but that has \nnothing to do with unions or corporations. If you spend\n\n[[Page S6281]]\n\n$600 or less--we have always said low amounts of money don't have to be \ndisclosed. If you spend $600,000, it should have to be disclosed, \nwhether you are a corporation or a union, either way. Oh, no.\n  My colleagues, this is a sad day for our democracy. Not only does the \nSupreme Court give those special interests a huge advantage, but this \nbody says they should do it all in secret without any disclosure. That \ntranscends this election, transcends Democrat or Republican. It eats at \nthe very fabric of our democracy. It makes our people feel powerless \nand angry, and the greatness of that Constitution and the greatness of \nthe American people is eroded by decisions like that of the Supreme \nCourt and the decision, unfortunately, we will make today in not \nletting the DISCLOSE Act come to the floor for debate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will oppose cloture on the motion to \nproceed to S. 3628, the DISCLOSE Act. My reasons for opposing this \nmotion are very simple--this is clearly a partisan attempt by the \nmajority to gain an advantage in the upcoming election. There was no \nhearing held in the Rules Committee on this bill and no Republican \nmembers were given the opportunity to consider the bill and offer \namendments in a committee markup.\n  Additionally, this bill is stuffed with onerous new government \nregulations and is loaded with loopholes and carve-outs for special \ninterests. The authors of this bill insist that it is fair and is not \ndesigned to benefit one party over the other. That is simply not the \ncase. One example of this is the ban on campaign-related activities by \nFederal Government contractors. If this legislation were enacted--tens \nof thousands of American businesses--large and small would be \nprohibited from engaging in campaigns while labor unions--which receive \nFederal grants and routinely negotiate collective bargaining agreements \nwith the Federal Government--would be free to operate as they see fit. \nIt is a simple matter of fairness, and this bill as drafted is patently \nunfair.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been involved in the issue of campaign \nfinance reform for most of my career, and I am fully supportive of \nmeasures which call for full and complete disclosure of all spending in \nFederal campaigns.\n  When my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, and I set out to \neliminate the corrupting influence of soft money and to reform how our \ncampaigns are paid for--we vowed to be truly bipartisan and to do \nnothing which would give one party a political advantage over the \nother. As my colleague from Arizona noted earlier--the new rules \ncreated under our legislation applied equally to everyone, and they \nonly applied after the subsequent election. That is not the case with \nthis piece of legislation. The provisions of this bill would become \neffective 30 days after being signed by the President. This bill is \nclearly designed to silence American businesses while allowing labor \nunions to speak and spend freely in the elections this November.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose cloture on the motion to proceed \nto this bill, and I urge my friends in the majority to go back to the \ndrawing board and bring back a bill that is truly fair, truly \nbipartisan, and requires true full disclosure.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly support the DISCLOSE Act and \nI believe the Senate should be allowed to consider it. I am pleased to \nsee this bill get such strong support from my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side, and I urge my Republican colleagues to think long and \nhard before blocking it even from coming to the floor. I have a long \nhistory of bipartisan work on campaign finance issues. I am not \ninterested in campaign finance legislation that has a partisan effect. \nThis bill is fair and evenhanded. It deserves the support of Senators \nfrom both parties.\n  As the name suggests, the central goal of this bill is disclosure. It \naims to make sure that when faced with a barrage of election-related \nadvertising funded by corporations, which the Supreme Court's decision \nin the Citizens United case has made possible, the American people have \nthe information they need to understand who is really behind those ads. \nThat information is essential to being able to thoughtfully exercise \nthe most important right in a democracy--the right to vote.\n  It is no secret that Senator Schumer and I, and all of the original \ncosponsors of the bill, were deeply disappointed by the Citizens United \ndecision. We don't agree with the Court's theory that the first \namendment rights of corporations, which can't vote or hold elected \noffice, are equivalent to those of citizens. And we believe that the \ndecision will harm our democracy. I, for one, very much hope that the \nSupreme Court will one day realize the mistake it made and overturn it.\n  But the Supreme Court made the decision and we in the Senate, along \nwith the country, have to live with it. The intent of the DISCLOSE Act \nis not to try to overturn that decision or challenge it. It is to \naddress the consequences of the decision within the confines of the \nCourt's holdings. Congress has a responsibility to survey the wreckage \nleft or threatened by the Supreme Court's ruling and do whatever it can \nconstitutionally to repair that damage or try to prevent it.\n  In Citizens United, the Court ruled that corporations could not \nconstitutionally be prohibited from engaging in campaign related \nspeech. But, with only one dissenting Justice, the Court also \nspecifically upheld applying disclosure requirements to corporations. \nThe Court stated:\n\n       [P]rompt disclosure of expenditures can provide \n     shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold \n     corporations and elected officials accountable for their \n     positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether \n     their corporation's political speech advances the \n     corporation's interest in making profits, and citizens can \n     see whether elected officials are ``in the pocket'' of so-\n     called moneyed interests.\n\n  The Court also explained that disclosure is very much consistent with \nfree speech:\n\n       The First Amendment protects political speech; and \n     disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the \n     speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This \n     transparency enables the electorate to make informed \n     decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and \n     messages.\n\n  The Court also made clear that corporate advertisers can be required \nto include disclaimers to identify themselves in their ads. It \nspecifically reaffirmed the part of the McConnell v. FEC decision that \nheld that such requirements are constitutional.\n  The DISCLOSE Act simply builds on disclosure and disclaimer \nrequirements that are already in the law and that the Court has said do \nnot violate the first amendment. For years, opponents of campaign \nfinance reform have argued that all that is needed is disclosure. Well, \nin a very short time we will find out whether they were serious, \nbecause that is what this bill is all about.\n  If the Senate is allowed to proceed to the bill, there will be time \nto discuss its provisions in more detail, but let me comment on one \nprovision that has caused controversy, which was added in the House--\nthe exception for large, longstanding groups, including the National \nRifle Association.\n  I am not a fan of exceptions to legislation of this kind. I would \nprefer a bill, like the one we introduced, that does not contain this \nexception. But the fact is that the kinds of groups that are covered by \nthe exception are not the kinds of groups that this bill is mostly \naimed at. Knowing the identity of individual large donors to the NRA \nwhen it runs its ads is not providing much useful information to the \npublic. Everyone knows who the NRA is and what it stands for. You may \nlike or dislike this group's message, but you don't need to know who \nits donors are to evaluate that message.\n  The same cannot be said about new organizations that are forming as \nwe speak to collect corporate donations and run attack ads against \ncandidates. One example is a new group called American Crossroads. It \nhas apparently pledged to raise $50 million to run ads in the upcoming \nelection. Can any of my colleagues tell me what this group is and what \nit stands for? Don't the American people have a right to know that, and \nwouldn't the identity of the funders provide useful information about \nthe group's agenda and what it hopes to accomplish by pumping so much \nmoney into elections? Even Citizens United, the group that brought the \ncase that has led us to this point, is not known to most people. Why \nshouldn't the American people know who has bankrolled that group, if \nit's\n\n[[Page S6282]]\n\ngoing to run ads and try to convince people to vote a certain way?\n  Disclosure is the way we make this crucial information available to \nthe public. But if a group is around for 10 years, has members in all \n50 States, and receives only a small portion of its budget from \ncorporations or unions, there is less reason for the kind of detailed \ninformation that the DISCLOSE Act requires. So while I would prefer \nthat this exception wasn't in the bill, I understand why the House felt \nit was necessary, and I don't think it undermines the bill's purpose or \nmakes it fundamentally unfair.\n  Most of the complaints about the DISCLOSE Act are coming from \ninterests that want to take advantage of one part of the Citizens \nUnited decision--the part that allows corporate spending on elections \nfor the first time in over 100 years--and at the same time pretend that \nthe other part of the decision--the part upholding disclosure \nrequirements--doesn't exist. But the law doesn't work that way. As the \nold saying goes, ``you can't have your cake and eat it too.''\n  Once again, I very much appreciate the leadership of the Senator from \nNew York and look forward to working with him and all my colleagues to \npass this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the motion \nto proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support the motion to proceed to \ndebate on the DISCLOSE Act because I strongly believe that the voice of \nthe people needs to be restored in our elections.\n  In January of this year, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court \nreversed long-standing precedent when it held government restrictions \non corporate independent expenditures in elections to be \nunconstitutional in violation of the first amendment. This decision \nignored precedent in order to reject laws that have limited the role of \ncorporate money in Federal elections for decades. I believe this \ndecision could severely damage public confidence in our campaign \nfinance system.\n  For years I have worked to maintain the integrity of our elections. I \nwas a cosponsor of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, BCRA, which was \na major step toward taking the unseemly race for big bucks out of the \ncampaign system and preserving the American public's right to truth in \nadvertising. However, the decision in Citizens United took us \nbackwards. Before Citizens United, the Federal Election Campaign Act--\nFECA--generally prohibited corporations and unions from using their \ntreasury funds to influence federal elections--including political \nadvertising known as express advocacy, which explicitly calls for \nelection or defeat of Federal candidates. To be clear: Corporations \nwere still able to engage in political activities through political \naction committees, or PACS. This process ensured that shareholders were \npart of the process. After Citizens United, however, corporations can \nuse unlimited amounts of money from their general treasuries for this \npurpose.\n  That is why I am an original cosponsor of the Democracy is \nStrengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections, or the DISCLOSE \nAct. The DISCLOSE Act requires corporations, unions, or advocacy \norganizations to stand by their advertisements and inform their members \nabout their election-related spending. It imposes transparency \nrequirements, requires spending amounts to be posted online, and \nprevents government contractors, corporations controlled by foreigners, \nand corporate beneficiaries of TARP funds from spending money on \nelections.\n  Since the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United, our elections \nare vulnerable to the influence of corporate power, which threatens to \ndrown out the voices of individual Americans. The DISCLOSE Act will \nrestore the public trust in both the election process and government \nitself. In our Federal elections, all voices must be heard, not just \nthose with the deepest pockets. The DISCLOSE Act will help restore the \npeople's voice, and I urge my colleagues to support the motion to \nproceed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is attempting to fix an \nimportant problem created earlier this year by the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. In that \ncase, five Supreme Court Justices cast aside a century of law and \nopened the floodgates for corporations to drown out individual voices \nin our elections. The broad scope of the Citizens United decision was \nunnecessary and improper. At the expense of hardworking Americans, the \nSupreme Court ruled that corporations could become the predominant \ninfluence in our elections for years to come.\n  Citizens United is the latest example in which a thin majority of the \nSupreme Court placed its own preferences over the will of hard working \nAmericans. The landmark McCain-Feingold Act's campaign finance reforms \nwere the product of lengthy debate in Congress as to the proper role of \ncorporate money in the electoral process. Those laws strengthened the \nrights of individual voters, while carefully preserving the integrity \nof the political process. However, with one stroke of the pen, five \nJustices cast aside those years of deliberation, and substituted their \nown preferences over the will of Congress and the American people.\n  The American people have expressed their concerns over this decision, \nand recognize that without congressional action, Citizens United \nthreatens to impact the outcome of our elections. As representatives, \nwe must fulfill our constitutional duty, and work to restore a \nmeaningful role for all Americans in the political process. A vote to \nfilibuster the motion to proceed to this legislation is a vote to \nignore the real world impact this decision will have on our democratic \nprocess.\n  The Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in \nElections--DISCLOSE--Act, is a measure I support to moderate the impact \nof the Citizens United decision. The DISCLOSE Act will add transparency \nto the campaign finance laws to help ensure that corporations cannot \nabuse their newfound constitutional rights. This legislation will \npreserve the voices of hardworking Americans in the political process \nby limiting the ability of foreign corporations to influence American \nelections, prohibiting corporations receiving taxpayer money from \ncontributing to elections, and increasing disclosure requirements on \ncorporate contributors, among other things.\n  It is difficult to overstate the potential for harm embodied in the \nCitizens United decision. The DISCLOSE Act is necessary to prevent \ncorruption in our political system, and to protect the credibility of \nour elections, which is necessary to maintain the trust of the American \npeople. While some on the other side of the aisle have praised the \nCitizens United decision as a victory for the first amendment, what \nthey fail to recognize is that these new rights for corporations come \nat the expense of the free speech rights of hardworking Americans. \nThere is no doubt that the ability of wealthy corporations to dominate \nall mediums of advertising risks drowning out the voices of \nindividuals.\n  The American people expect that there will be bipartisan support for \nany legislation that would prevent corporations from drowning out their \nown voices in our elections. In that vein, I hope that the DISCLOSE Act \nwill receive an up-or-down vote in the Senate, and not be the subject \nof filibusters that have become all too common in this political \nclimate.\n  Vermont is a State with a rich tradition of involvement in the \ndemocratic process. However, it is a small State, and it would not take \nmuch for a few corporations to outspend all of our local candidates \ncombined. It is easy to imagine corporate interests flooding the \nairwaves with election ads and transforming the nature of Vermont \ncampaigning. This is simply not what Vermonters expect of their \npolitics. The DISCLOSE Act is a first step towards ensuring that \nVermonters, and all Americans, can remain confident that they will \nretain a voice in the political process.\n  The Citizens United decision grants corporations the same \nconstitutional free speech rights as individual Americans. This is not \nwhat the Framers intended in drafting the opening words ``We the People \nof the United States.'' In designing the Constitution, the Founders \nspoke of and guaranteed fundamental rights to the American people--not \nto corporations, which are mentioned nowhere in the Constitution. The \ntime is now to ensure that our campaign finance laws reflect this \nimportant distinction.\n\n[[Page S6283]]\n\n  The American people want their voices heard in the upcoming election. \nI urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to allow us to debate and \naddress this important issue. I look forward to working with all \nSenators to pass this important legislation, and to ensure that the \nDISCLOSE Act is enacted into law.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this vote is a true test of political \ncharacter because it goes to the very heart of American democracy. It \nwill determine who will choose our Nation's leaders--faceless \ncorporations or we the people.\n  The Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United v. Federal Election \nCommission case earlier this year dealt a crushing blow to fairness in \nour Federal elections. This decision is why we are here today, taking a \ncloser look at the hard realities of how the political system works \nhere in the United States.\n  For far too long, our Federal election system has been broken and the \nremedies ignored. In 1997, I wrote the Clean Money, Clean Elections Act \nto help tackle some of our most important campaign finance problems. \nThat bill sought to limit the power of special interests in elections \nby offering incentives for ``clean candidates'' who swore off private \ncampaign contributions and ran using only a clean money fund. \nUnfortunately, during the 13 years since that bill's introduction, we \nhave seen an increase in the influence of special interests and now \ncorporations on our Federal elections.\n  Make no mistake about it--the ruling by the Supreme Court has only \nexacerbated the problems of the system. And that makes it all the more \nimportant that we no longer keep our heads buried in the sand.\n  I have always believed that the single biggest flaw in our Federal \nelection system is the disproportionate power and influence of money \nthat drowns out the voice of average Americans. I am concerned that the \nSupreme Court's ruling in Citizens United will produce an even bigger \ntidal wave of special interest advertising funded by large faceless \ncorporations, drowning out the views and opinions of our citizens.\n  The Supreme Court has opened the flood gates for an unlimited amount \nof unchecked political spending by corporations--including the \ndangerous new precedent for unimpeded funding by subsidiaries of \nforeign corporations. Yes, for the first time in our history Federal \nelections in this country can be actively influenced according to the \ndesires of foreign interests.\n  These are dangerous developments that require immediate attention. \nBut the ultimate solution must be equal in scope to the magnitude of \nthe problem we face. We must undertake some remedial actions now, but \nthere is only so much we can do legislatively.\n  In my view, the case of Citizens United requires nothing short of a \nconstitutional amendment that makes it crystal clear--that corporations \ndo not have the same free speech rights as individuals. It is time that \naverage Americans regain their voice in choosing who will represent \nthem in our Nation's Capital.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once \nsaid:\n\n       The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people \n     tolerate growth of private power to a point where it becomes \n     stronger than their democratic state itself.\n\n  This statement is all too true, as we are faced with the Supreme \nCourt's disappointing decision in Citizens United v. Federal Elections \nCommission earlier this year. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the Supreme Court \noverturned years of congressional work to limit corporate spending and \ncorruption in the political arena. As a result, corporations and labor \nunions are now free to spend unlimited dollars from their general funds \nto make independent expenditures at any time during an election cycle, \nincluding directly calling for the election or defeat of a candidate.\n  This ruling will have far-reaching implications for the electoral \nsystem on a Federal, State, and local level. In his well-reasoned \ndissent, Justice Stevens noted:\n\n       Lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis, if not \n     also a democratic duty, to take measures designed to guard \n     against the potentially deleterious effects of corporate \n     spending in local and national races.\n\n  Over the years, Congress and State legislatures have done just that. \nIn 2002, Congress found that without regulation, corporations spend \nmoney on political elections in extremely large amounts. Spending at \nthose levels created a corrupting influence on legislative actions.\n  In response to what Justice Stevens called a ``virtual mountain of \nresearch'' on the potential for corruption within the election process, \nCongress passed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, commonly known as \nMcCain-Feingold. With an eye on prior Supreme Court rulings, Congress \nshaped McCain-Feingold to properly address concerns over evidence of \ncorruption in the electoral system.\n  The Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United is bad for my State of \nMontana, it is bad for America. Montana history shows that corporations \nare eager to influence elections. As Montana attorney general Steve \nBullock previously testified, during the turn of the century, wealthy \ncopper kings of Montana's mining industry leveraged their corporate \npower to effectively buy elections.\n  In 1912, Montana voters spoke out, passing some of the strongest laws \nin the Nation prohibiting corporations from acting to influence Montana \nelections. The law has withstood the test of 98 years without failing. \nYet, because of Citizens United, Montana's strong campaign finance laws \nare now also in jeopardy. In Montana, the ruling is likely to have a \nsignificant impact on State and local elections. The use of corporate \nmoney will drown out the voices of individual Montanans. The cost of \nadvertising in Montana is very low. This, however, will make it easy \nfor large out-of-State corporations to dominate Montana markets in an \neffort to sway Montana races.\n  When it comes to corporate spending, we are talking about a \nsignificant amount of money. Let's look at what corporate America is \nspending on political advertising. In 2008, the automotive industry \nspent over $30 billion in advertising. Just in the first quarter of \nthis year, Wall Street firms spent $2 billion. The tobacco industry \naverages $12 billion in advertising nationwide each year. That is \npolitical advertising. When you start adding up these numbers, you \nstart to get a sense of the magnitude of the impact Citizens United can \nhave on our electoral process. Corporations will now have free rein to \nspend this kind of money to now call for the election or opposition of \nspecific candidates, Federal, State, or local.\n  The impact of Citizens United goes well beyond merely changing \ncampaign finance law. This decision will impact the ability of \nCongress, as well as State and local legislatures, to pass laws \ndesigned to protect its constituents--individual Americans--when such \nlegislation comes under fierce objection by large corporations. \nCorporations are now free to spend millions targeting individual \nlawmakers. Lawmakers' ability to pass laws such as consumer safety or \ninvestor protection now faces even greater challenges when such laws \nmerely threaten the corporate bottom line.\n  Congress and the American people must respond swiftly and firmly. The \nSupreme Court's ruling in Citizens United has severely altered \nCongress's ability to limit corporate spending in our electoral \nprocess.\n  I support legislative efforts such as those to enhance disclosure and \nincrease shareholder say on corporate campaign spending, and I commend \nmy friend from New York, Senator Schumer, for his efforts on this \nfront. However, it is clear that the surest way to address the Supreme \nCourt's disappointing decisions is a constitutional amendment that will \nclarify Congress's authority to regulate corporate political spending.\n  The resolution I am introducing today proposes a constitutional \namendment that will restore Congress's authority to regulate political \nexpenditures by corporations and labor organizations in support or in \nopposition to Federal candidates. It also preserves Congress's ability \nto regulate political contributions to these candidates.\n  Similarly, this amendment provides States with the authority to \nregulate political contributions and expenditures in a way that works \nbest for each State. This amendment does not modify the first amendment \nat all, and the language specifies that this does not affect freedom of \nthe press in any way.\n\n[[Page S6284]]\n\n  The Framers provided a series of steps required to amend the \nConstitution, and this process should not be taken lightly. This \nresolution requires the support of a two-thirds majority of the Senate \nand the House and subsequent ratification by three-quarters of the \nStates. I recognize the challenges of that process, but I believe this \nis a discussion and debate that Congress and the American people should \nhave.\n  We must act. We must act now to restore Americans' faith in our \npolitical electoral process. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Goodwin). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the time is limited to 15 minutes, I will \nuse leader time to complete my statement.\n  Mr. President, my friend the Republican leader talked about a number \nof things in his presentation, all the time making remarks such as \n``reading the bill caused unrestrained laughter.'' Well, 85 percent of \nthe American people support this legislation.\n  Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis offered disclosure and \ntransparency as the antidote to swollen corporate influence. Sunlight, \nhe said, is ``the best of disinfectants.'' The man who would replace \nhim on the Supreme Court shed light on the importance of the \nindividual's vote, the voice that anchors our democracy. William O. \nDouglas, who served on the bench longer than any other Justice, said \nthat the right to vote means more than simply the right to pull a lever \non election day. He said it also means ``the right to have the vote \ncounted at full value, without dilution or discount.'' Both Brandeis \nand Douglas were right. These two Justices' observations should guide \nus as we correct an error made by today's Supreme Court--the Roberts \nCourt--when it wrongly ruled in January that corporations, special \ninterests, and foreign governments can flood America's political system \nwith contributions in unlimited amounts and in secrecy. That decision \nwas wrong.\n  The campaign advertisements at issue in the case, Citizens United v. \nFederal Election Commission, and in the bill before us, the DISCLOSE \nAct, are presumably about giving the electorate the information it \nneeds to make an informed choice. But that information must also \ninclude its source because an open political process demands the \ndisclosure of who is paying the bills. We are all agreed that voters \ncan believe, criticize, or support any ad they wish, but a citizen \ncannot responsibly do any of that if he doesn't know how the ad found \nits way into his living room.\n  Our votes are the most precious part of our democracy. If someone is \ngoing to such great lengths to convince us how to use it, should we not \nat least know their names? Put differently, why would we let those who \ngo to such great lengths to conceal their names--and those who try to \nprotect them by blocking this bill--dilute or manipulate our voices?\n  The principle behind the bill is a simple belief that neither the \nAmerican voter at home nor the democratic process at large benefits \nfrom campaigns funded by secret sponsors who are hidden from public \nview. Quite the opposite, in fact; such secrecy is harmful because it \ndeliberately keeps from voters the identity of those trying to \ninfluence their choices and sway our elections.\n  This is also about trust and confidence in our democracy. Whenever \nthe voice of the corporation is the loudest, the voice of the citizen \nis harder to hear. If citizens don't have reason to trust the electoral \nprocess, voters have little reason to trust the outcome of the \nelection, and constituents ultimately have no reason to trust their \nelected government.\n  This Supreme Court case and this piece of legislation are not only \nabout campaign checks; it is also about checks and balances. The Senate \nis not reversing or circumventing the Court's ruling; we are only \nbringing back transparency, accountability, and fairness to the system \nso it can work best for the people it serves. We are doing that in \nthree ways.\n  First, this bill says that if you are a foreign corporation or a \nforeign Government, you can't spend money in American elections.\n  Second, it says if you are a company that benefited from TARP--the \nemergency program that kept our largest institutions and our economy \nafloat--you can't turn around and give those taxpayer dollars to a \npolitical candidate.\n  Third, to prevent both the possibility and the perception of a pay-\nto-play scheme, it says that if you are a government contractor, you \ncannot contribute to campaigns either.\n  These three elements are written primarily to protect voters, but \nvoters are not the only ones who will benefit. If you are a shareholder \nof a company rich enough to put a campaign ad on television, wouldn't \nyou want to know how it is using your investment and spending your \nmoney? Of course.\n  CEOs and special interests can run all the ads they want today, and \nafter the DISCLOSE Act is law they will still be able to do that. That \nis their right. The difference is that our bill says you just can't pay \nfor an ad; they have to stand by that ad also. This new law will not \nstifle anybody's speech or their ability to advertise; it merely \nrequires them to do so in the open.\n  What could be more patriotic and less partisan than protecting a \nperson's vote and all the information that goes into that decision?\n  The desire for greater real-time disclosure of election spending was \nnot long ago a bipartisan concept. It is incredible that we now have to \nstruggle to find a supermajority--60 Senators--even just to debate a \nbill the principles of which both parties once supported and that 9 in \n10 Americans want us to pass.\n  What else is new?\n  When we fought to protect every American's right to afford good \nhealth, the other side jumped to the defense of corporate America and \nthe special interests in the insurance racket.\n  When we fought to protect Americans from the unchecked greed in the \nfinancial industry--recklessness--that cost 8 million Americans jobs \nand nearly collapsed our economy, the other side jumped to the defense \nof corporate America and special interests--this time, those on Wall \nStreet.\n  When we fought to hold BP accountable for its negligence, the other \nside jumped to the defense of the corporation responsible for the \ngreatest manmade environmental disaster in history, going so far as to \napologize to its now-ousted CEO.\n  When we ran to the side of millions who lost their jobs in the \nrecession and exhausted their unemployment insurance, while they \nsearched for hard-to-find jobs, the other side argued that what our \neconomy needed was more tax breaks for multimillionaires.\n  On the stimulus bill, 93 percent of the Republicans voted against it \nin the Senate. On the unemployment insurance extension, 88 percent of \nthe Republicans voted against that. On Americans' jobs and closing tax \nloopholes, 86 percent of the Republicans voted against that. On the \nhealth care bill, 100 percent of the Republicans voted against it. On \nthe HIRE Act, 68 percent of Republicans voted against. Even on cash for \nclunkers--which was, by all estimates, a great success--82 percent of \nthe Republicans voted against it.\n  This issue is no different than those I went through. The bill asks \nus to put the people before the special interests. It asks us to ensure \nthat an individual's vote speaks louder than the deep pockets of the \npowerful.\n  It asks us this so the next time a health insurance company or a big \nWall Street bank or a major oil company or any other special interest \nputs a campaign ad on the air, everyone will know who did it. It will \nmake sure viewers can consider the source as they consider their vote.\n  Americans have fought so hard and at so great a price to ensure the \nvoting rights of every individual. We have removed obstacles between \npeople and the ballot box, removed corruption from the campaign \nprocess, and gone to great lengths to encourage everyone to participate \non election day.\n  Why would we diminish a right that was so hard won? Why would we go \nbackward?\n  This new law will return our popular elections to the people by \nlimiting anyone's ability to dilute a citizen's power and by letting in \nthe sunlight that disinfects our democracy.\n  Who could oppose that? The only ones fearful of transparency are \nthose with something to hide. That is what this legislation is all \nabout.\n\n[[Page S6285]]\n\n  It is my understanding we are ready for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the information of the Members of the \nSenate, we are going to move to the small business jobs bill. I have \nspoken with the Republican leader, and staff is aware, that we are \ngoing to have the same vote we had on Thursday night--that will be the \namendment--with the exception that we are going to place in that bill \nthe agricultural disaster relief that has been around for a long time. \nThat will be added to this small jobs bill.\n  I have spoken with Senator Landrieu, and she has indicated to me that \nshe has had conversations with Members of the minority, and they would \nlike an amendment or two or three. I think that will be about the limit \nthat we should do. We will be happy to have side-by-sides or have \nsomething that would give us the opportunity to see what those \namendments are going to be.\n  So in short, we are going to work and start legislating as early as \nwe can in the morning. I don't think we will be able to do much \ntonight. We will consider that. But everyone should be ready tomorrow. \nWe are going to do our utmost to finish this bill tomorrow.\n  Everyone should understand that we are going to do our best to get \nout of here a week from Friday, but we will need the cooperation of \nSenators on a number of things. We have a fairly long list of things we \nneed to do before we leave.\n  There will be no further rollcall votes today. The tree we talked \nabout we have to tear down, but it is my understanding that we \nshouldn't have a problem doing that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my friend, the majority \nleader, he knows because I believe he has some of our amendments, what \nwe would like to offer, and I think this is a conversation we can have \noff the floor until we can figure out a way to move forward.\n  Mr. REID. My only purpose here is that we can go through the program \nof tearing the tree down, but those votes are somewhat inconsequential. \nI don't think we need to do that this afternoon. It is my \nunderstanding, after having spoken to Senator McConnell, that everyone \nknows what the amendment is going to be. I have agreed there can be \namendments offered by the Republicans, and it is only a question of \nwhat they are going to be.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think that is a correct understanding.\n  Mr. REID. So I have designated Mary Landrieu.\n  The amendment is just as I have outlined, and we should have it in 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6285-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6285-S6296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SMALL BUSINESS LENDING FUND ACT OF 2010\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate returns once \nagain to the small business jobs bill. This bill would help steer our \neconomy toward recovery. It would create jobs. It would do so by \nfostering creativity and ambition of the American entrepreneur.\n  Some of America's greatest firms were born in the midst of an \neconomic crisis. In 1976, the U.S. economy was reeling from recession. \nAmerica's unemployment hovered around 8 percent. That year, two guys \nnamed Steve started selling computer kits out of a garage in Palo Alto, \nCA. They founded a small business. An angel investor helped them with \n$250,000 in seed money. Today, we know that business as Apple. Last \nmonth, Apple became the largest technology company in the world.\n  It is not an unusual story. It is a story told again and again in \nAmerica. Of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial \nAverage, 16 were started during a recession or depression. Procter & \nGamble, Disney, McDonald's, Microsoft, General Electric, Johnson & \nJohnson, and Costco all first opened their doors during economic \ndownturns.\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\n  To foster entrepreneurship and create this recession's success \nstories we need to create the right conditions. This small business \njobs bill will help do just that. American entrepreneurs of all kinds \nare a key driver of job creation.\n  Take, for example, Tiffany Lach. Eighteen months ago, Tiffany opened \nSola Cafe in downtown Bozeman, MT, with the help of a Small Business \nAdministration loan. When she opened her doors, she had 19 employees. \nToday she has 42 employees and loads of loyal customers. We need to \nsupport entrepreneurs so that small businesses, such as Tiffany's, can \ncontinue to grow and create more jobs.\n  According to a recent report, nearly all net job creation in America \nfrom 1980 to 2005 occurred in firms fewer than 5 years old. In fact, \nwithout startups, net job creation would have been negative almost \nevery year for the past three decades. In 2007, more than two-thirds of \nthe jobs created were firms between 1 and 5 years old.\n  As our economy emerges from the great recession, we need to ensure \nthat American entrepreneurs have the resources, the financing, and the \nopportunities they need to create jobs and realize their dreams. This \nsmall business jobs bill will help American entrepreneurs gain access \nto the capital they need, especially by increasing the incentives for \ninvestors to purchase and hold equity in startups.\n  Under this bill, for the rest of 2010, any investor who invested in a \nsmall business and held that investment for at least 5 years would pay \nno income tax on the gains from the sale of that small business stock. \nThe bill would also reward entrepreneurship by doubling the amount of \nstartup expenses that an entrepreneur could immediately deduct this \nyear. The bill would increase the amount from $5,000 to $10,000. This \nwould free up capital that could be used to invest in other aspects of \nthe business.\n  This bill will devote more than $5 million to the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to expand opportunities for U.S. small businesses in \nforeign markets. This would help American goods and services to reach \nnew customers around the world. This would create jobs right here in \nAmerica. This would help the USTR to enforce our trade agreements to \nensure that American startups can compete on a level playing field.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Let's work hard to work \nout agreements so we can take it up and pass it. Let's do so to help \nAmerica's entrepreneurs. Let's pass this bill to encourage the \ndevelopment of new American small businesses. Let's pass this bill to \ncreate jobs right here in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman.) The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the oilspill \nin the Gulf of Mexico and energy legislation that may be on the floor \nthis week.\n  For more than 3 months, the American people have watched our Nation's \ngreatest environmental disaster unfold. This tragic accident has cost \nlives. It still threatens jobs and communities throughout the region. \nThe shrimpers, fishermen, small business owners, restaurant and hotel \nworkers, rig workers--everyone has been impacted.\n  In the last couple of weeks, we have gotten some rare good news. \nFirst, the new containment cap has temporarily plugged the hole. \nSecond, the new cap survived the recent storm in the gulf. Hopefully, \nnext week BP will finish drilling two relief wells and permanently plug \nthe leak.\n  From this disaster we have learned that our country and the Federal \nGovernment were not prepared to deal with an emergency of this \nmagnitude. Now we have an opportunity to fix the system. We need to \nimplement reforms that prevent these accidents in the future and \nimprove the ability to respond.\n  A tragedy of this magnitude merits a serious, bipartisan response \nfrom this body and from this country. The Congress has two options: No. \n1 is to fix the problem; the second is to score political victories \nthat don't help the gulf. My friends on the other side of the aisle \nappear committed to using this crisis to try to score political points.\n  The majority leader announced that he plans to unveil his energy \nlegislation later today. It reportedly will contain oilspill provisions \nas well as broader energy legislation. The bill is being written behind \nclosed doors--not in a committee, not in front of the American people, \nnot on C-SPAN, but behind closed doors--and it will likely come \ndirectly to the floor later this week without ever going to a Senate \ncommittee. I think a fair question to ask right now is, What is going \nto be in the bill? Why can't we address the oilspill in an open way, in \na transparent way? Are Senators going to be allowed to offer \namendments, amendments that would improve the bill and increase \nbipartisan support?\n  Republicans have introduced an oilspill alternative. The Republican \nbill includes several important provisions:\n  First, the Republican bill reforms the system for managing offshore \noil and gas exploration. It enhances safety requirements, and it \nimproves spill response capacity. The Republican bill requires that our \nnational oilspill contingency plan include a clear, accountable chain \nof command. That way, the American people know who is in charge and who \nis making decisions on the ground and on the water.\n  Next, the Republican bill reforms oilspill liability. The bill \nincreases liability limits based on risk factors such as water depth \nand a company's previous history. It also sets up a system where claims \nbeyond the liability cap are paid for by all of the companies drilling \noffshore. This liability system ensures those impacted are compensated. \nUnlike some other proposals out there, this proposal does not unfairly \ndiscriminate against small and medium-sized companies that are \nexploring for energy in the gulf.\n  The Republican bill also lifts the overly broad drilling moratorium \nthat has been imposed by the Obama administration. Rather than imposing \na blanket moratorium that threatens thousands of jobs in the gulf, the \nRepublican bill would lift the moratorium for companies that have \ncomplied with the new safety and inspection requirements. This \nprovision stops the administration from compounding the economic damage \nthat is currently occurring in the gulf.\n  Importantly, the Republican bill also establishes a truly unbiased, \nbipartisan oilspill commission to investigate the spill. The oilspill \ncommission that was appointed by the President is stacked--stacked with \npeople who philosophically oppose offshore exploration.\n  Ideology aside, the members of the President's oilspill commission \nlack the essential technical expertise on offshore drilling. There is \nno expert on petroleum engineering on his commission. There is no \nexpert on rig safety on the President's commission. Having this sort of \nexpertise will help the factfinding mission. It will also strengthen--\nit will strengthen the quality of the commission's recommendations. It \nis imperative that the oilspill commission has credibility.\n  The Republican bill helps those in the gulf. It will save much needed \njobs, and it will improve our ability to explore for offshore oil and \ngas well into the future.\n  It is unfortunate that the majority is only spending a few days on \nthe situation in the gulf. The text of the bill that this body is \nsupposed to be debating later this week, that the American people \nshould have an ability to see and to comment on, is not yet publicly \navailable. How can this body, how can the American people have a \nserious debate on a bill in less than a week, especially if no one yet \nknows what happens to be in the bill? This is a crisis that has lasted \nfor almost 100 days, the greatest environmental disaster in the history \nof our country. Yet the Senate is rushing to complete a bill that no \none has seen, that continues to be written behind closed doors, and \nexpects to complete it by the end of the week.\n  Sadly, the majority lacks transparency, and this lack of transparency \nby the majority follows months of poor response efforts by BP and by \nthis administration. The companies involved in the spill played the \nblame game. While oil executives pointed fingers at one another, the \nadministration struggled to get a handle on the situation.\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\nThe response was delayed, and the response was disorganized. The \nresponse lacked direction, and the response lacked decisiveness. There \nwas no clear chain of command. State and local officials have \nrepeatedly expressed frustration with the cleanup effort. And it is not \njust a lack of resources; in some cases, Federal approval stands in the \nway of local cleanup efforts.\n  Newsweek magazine had a recent article entitled ``The Mire Next \nTime.'' It says:\n\n       BP and federal officials have conjured parts of their oil \n     spill response plan from scratch and changed them by the day, \n     often failing to act with the speed and decisiveness an \n     emergency demands.\n\n  Over the weekend, Politico reported that ``the White House dispatched \npolitical and communications aides to the Gulf Coast states.''\n  Let me repeat that. Over the weekend, Politico reported that ``the \nWhite House dispatched political and communications aides to the Gulf \nCoast states.''\n  According to Politico:\n\n       The effort came about after the White House grew concerned \n     over political damage--\n\n  Not environmental damage--\n\n     from not having a permanent presence in the Gulf Coast \n     states.\n\n  Campaign staffers might help the White House contain its political \ndisaster, but they are not going to solve the actual environmental and \neconomic disaster.\n  Instead of worrying about political problems, the White House should \nbe encouraging the Senate to work in a bipartisan way on legislation \nthat will help prevent future accidents and to improve our Federal \nresponse capacity. Our top priority should be stopping the leak and \ncontaining the spill.\n  We must also make sure those impacted are compensated, and the claims \nprocess must be fair and fast. The majority should devote more than a \nfew days to fixing the problems in the Gulf of Mexico. I urge \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to work with us. Let us come \ntogether to pass bipartisan oilspill legislation. That is what the \nAmerican people want. That is what the American people deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                            Childhood Hunger\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with a very \nsimple request. I come to ask for my colleagues' attention and perhaps \n8 hours of their time, 8 hours that will change the face of childhood \nhunger and obesity and put us on a path to significantly improving the \nhealth of the next generation of Americans, 8 hours that will make a \nhistoric investment in our most precious gift and the future of this \ncountry, and that is, of course, our children, 8 hours for this body to \npass the bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act that will reauthorize \nour Federal child nutrition programs and address two of the greatest \nthreats to the health and security of America's children--hunger and \nobesity.\n  Earlier this year, working closely with the ranking member of the Ag \nCommittee, Senator Chambliss, other members of the committee as well as \nthe administration, the Committee on Agriculture, which I chair, \nunanimously approved a bill that makes a historic investment in hunger \nrelief and for the first time mandates that meals provided to our \nchildren in schools are healthy. We have since been patiently waiting \nfor this critical legislation to see the light of day on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The days of patiently waiting are coming to an end, as the September \n30 deadline to reauthorize these programs rapidly approaches. That is \nwhy I stand here today asking this body, asking my colleagues to spend \na few moments of time to make an investment in our children and \ndedicate perhaps at the most 8 hours of floor time to take up and pass \nthis legislation.\n  I don't have to look any farther than my home State of Arkansas to \nsee the hunger and obesity crisis at its worst. A recent report by \nFeeding America found that Arkansas has the highest rate of childhood \nhunger in the country at 24.4 percent. That is nearly one out of every \nfour Arkansas children who is unsure when or if their next meal will \ncome. Will it even materialize?\n  Obesity too is extremely high among Arkansas children. Roughly one \nout of five children in Arkansas is considered obese. Research shows \nthat obesity significantly increases the risk of chronic disease such \nas hypertension, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and even some forms of \ncancer. We also know obesity comes at a tremendous cost to our health \ncare system, roughly $147 billion each year. These statistics are \nsimply unacceptable. There are real children behind these numbers, real \nchildren in real families, many of them working American families, real \nchildren who can forever be put on a path toward longer, healthier, \nmore productive lives, if we simply dedicate 8 hours to passing this \nbill.\n  As a mother of twin boys who are teenagers now, having watched them \ngrow up and feeling enormously blessed that through that time I have \nhad the opportunity and the blessing of being able to feed them \nnutritious food and ensure they are growing up healthy, do any of my \ncolleagues think that any mother out there is any different than I am, \nwho wants to see that same blessing in their own home and with their \nown children?\n  The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act takes tremendous steps toward \naddressing the obesity crisis which is necessary if we truly want to \nimprove the health of this next generation of Americans. This \nlegislation increases the reimbursement rate for school meals for the \nfirst time since 1973. Can colleagues think of what it would mean for \nus to be required to purchase items under today's costs with 1973 \npurchasing power? It would be impossible for us to feed our families or \nto take care of them, to assist our seniors and aging parents. Here we \nare asking our schools to try not only to feed the children but to feed \nthem a healthy meal with 1973 dollars. If we want to promote our \nchildren's health, we have to feed them healthier meals. That takes an \ninvestment such as the one we have made in this bill.\n  This bill also for the first time establishes national school \nnutrition standards to ensure our children have healthier options \navailable throughout the entire schoolday. Too often we hear from \nparents their frustrations about how the healthy habits they are trying \nto teach their children at home are constantly being undermined by the \nwidespread availability of unhealthy options in school. For the first \ntime this bill changes that. Parents can take comfort knowing that \nfoods and snacks available at school through vending machines and \nschool stores and a la carte lunch lines will have to meet new \nhealthier standards based on guidelines for healthy diets established \nby USDA in consultation with HHS and the Institute of Medicine. This \nprovision complements the commonsense steps we have already taken in my \nhome State to improve the health of our school environments and, in \ndoing so, brings some Arkansas wisdom to the rest of the country.\n  We have seen the horrors in Arkansas, and we want to do something \nabout it. As a nation, we too must see the challenges we face in \nfeeding the children healthy and nutritious meals, and we must seize \nthis opportunity to do something about it.\n  This bill also makes a significant investment in the fight against \nchildhood hunger. In 1999, I worked hard in the Senate to start the \nSenate Hunger Caucus, to try to bring my colleagues' attention to the \nissue of food insecurity and hunger that existed not only on a global \nsense but also in our own backyards and in our own country. Mr. \nPresident, 500,000 Arkansans live in food insecurity right now. We have \nmuch to do. It is hard to understand, when we have a disease such as \nhunger and we know what the cure is, why don't we cure it? It is so \nsimple.\n  This bill streamlines and takes out duplicative steps in the \npaperwork process to ensure that hundreds of thousands of children \nacross the country who are eligible for national school lunch and \nbreakfast programs actually are able to participate. I am one of the \nfew Senators with schoolage children. I know what comes home in those \nbackpacks at the first of the year. It is a mountain of paperwork that \ngets crumpled down in the bottom of the backpack. I pull it out. \nFortunately for me, I don't have to fill out that paperwork. But there \nare many families who do in order to ensure their child is eligible for \na free or reduced lunch or a breakfast program. They have to fill\n\n[[Page S6288]]\n\nout multiple pages of documentation to be eligible. Yet we know they \nalready meet the criteria because they filled out that same or similar \npaperwork for the WIC program or SNAP or the low-income housing \nprogram, so many other places where they have continually documented \nthe need for help they have in creating a wholesome family.\n  This bill also recognizes that hunger doesn't stop when the school \nbell rings. It improves afterschool and summer feeding programs, \nensuring that children in afterschool programs are receiving full \nnutritious meals instead of the current snack they receive now.\n  This bill is about improving the lives of the next generation--and we \nhave a short period to do so--whether it is in education or nutrition. \nI know for myself, my boys turn 14 this year. It is hard for me to \nbelieve they have grown so quickly. Yet if we think about it, we have a \nsnapshot of time to affect the lives of these children. So if we don't \ndo it this year, if we don't do it next year or the year after that, \nthat child who was in kindergarten is now in third grade. They may have \nincorporated bad eating habits already or they haven't had nutritious \nfood or they haven't received the basic skills they need in terms of \nreading and other things. That time in the life of a child is so \nimportant. We look at ourselves and the time it takes us to pass \nlegislation. We have an enormous opportunity to affect a generation of \nAmericans and make their lives better. This bill means we will ensure \nthey are healthier.\n  It also means not saddling them with a financial burden they cannot \nafford. That is why I am very proud to say this bill is completely paid \nfor and will not add one cent to the national debt that will be \nshouldered by the children. As we work to get this bill signed into \nlaw, I will make certain it is paid for, not only because it is the \nright thing to do for the country, it is the right thing to do for the \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, there is a very real risk we will fail to seize this \nhistoric opportunity. As of today, we have a maximum of 23 legislative \ndays remaining before the current child nutrition program expires on \nSeptember 30. What many colleagues may fail to understand is that a \nsimple extension of these programs will not be enough. Oftentimes we \ndon't get our work done, and we simply say: Well, we will extend the \ncurrent law until we can get it done. I pose to my colleagues: We have \na good bill. We have an opportunity, a historic opportunity to make a \ndifference. If we don't seize the opportunity, we will have to extend \nthe current legislation. If we simply choose to extend the current \nprogram, we are locking in the status quo. We are locking in the rate \nwe pay our school districts for school lunches and meal programs at \n1973 levels.\n\n  What is more, each State will lose critical dollars they would have \notherwise received from this bill. Who will pay the price? Our children \nwill pay the price for our inability to get this done, for our inaction \nand our unwillingness to take a simple few hours and get something \ndone. Yet knowing what we stand to lose, I can't seem to convince \nenough folks around here how critically important it is for us to pass \nthis bill. Again, all I am asking for is several hours, 8 hours, \nperhaps, at the most. I will continue to ask. I will continue to come \ndown to the floor of the Senate until we make this investment in our \nchildren.\n  We have an opportunity to pass something real, something historic, \nsomething that is meaningful, that we have taken the regular order and \ngone through the committee process, that we have done what people want \nus to do. We have been transparent with our actions. We have paid for \nthis legislation. We have done it in a bipartisan way. We have come up \nwith something that is good and real for the children. We simply need \nto dedicate the time, the time out of our schedule to get this bill \ndone.\n  I will relentlessly be pursuing my colleagues. I know they get tired \nof me, and I know I have become a pest. But when the day is done and we \nhave finished our work, it is worthwhile to have been a pest for \nsomething that is such a great treasure to the Nation as our children. \nWe can accomplish this goal on behalf of the children, if we set our \nminds to it.\n  This is a bill of which each and every Member can be proud. It is \nbipartisan, completely paid for and, much more, it provides commonsense \nsolutions to addressing childhood hunger and obesity. In unanimously \npassing this bill, the Ag Committee made a commitment to the children. \nNow I ask this body to help us fulfill this commitment by dedicating \nonly 8 hours to passing this historic legislation.\n  Is that too much to ask? Can we not dedicate those few hours to an \neffort that will change a generation for the better? I know hard-\nworking parents in Arkansas and all across this great Nation do not \nthink it is too much. There are other parents of school-aged children, \nlike me, some of them who do not have the blessings or the means that I \nhave to be able to care for my children or provide a healthy \nafterschool snack or to be able to make sure dinner is there for them \nin the evenings. Those parents love their children as much as I love \nmine, and they want to see us as a nation recognizing the value of \ntheir children to the future of this country.\n  So I will continue to be a pest. I will continue to badger my \ncolleagues. I will continue to fight to see that this body does right \nby our kids and passes this legislation and improves the health of the \nnext generation of great Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thune pertaining to the introduction of S. 3652 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              DISCLOSE Act\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, even before the Supreme Court issued its \ndisastrous opinion in Citizens United, the influence of large \ncorporations and other powerful special interests in our electoral \nprocess was overwhelming. There is a reason why the middle class is \ndisappearing and why poverty is increasing while the people on top are \nmaking out like bandits. One of the reasons is the enormous influence \nbig money interests have over the political process and the way they \nare able to use that influence through campaign contributions and \nthrough lobbying efforts. They are all over the place. Whether it is \nWall Street, the oil companies, the coal companies, the insurance \ncompanies, the drug companies, the military industrial complex, all \nthese very powerful and wealthy special interests contribute huge \namounts of money into the political process, making it harder and \nharder for the significant needs of working families to be heard \noutside the din and the power of big money.\n  So, in other words, before this Supreme Court decision on Citizens \nUnited, we already had a very bad situation. It was a situation in \nwhich it required enormous sums of money on the part of a candidate to \nrun for office, a situation in which it became increasingly common for \nmillionaires and billionaires to be the only candidates able to finance \na Federal campaign without heavy reliance on contributions from \ncorporate interests. It is no secret both political parties look very \nfavorably on so-called self-funded candidates. They don't have to raise \nany money for those candidates because they are multimillionaires and \nthey are billionaires; they can write their own checks--checks which \nare often very large--in order to run for the House of Representatives \nor especially the Senate.\n  So what we had before Citizens United, that disastrous Supreme Court \ndecision, was already a very bad situation. But that decision made a \nhorrendous situation even worse.\n\n[[Page S6289]]\n\n  The Supreme Court decided, at the beginning of this year, that it was \nacceptable and legal for the largest corporations in our country to \nspend unlimited resources supporting candidates who represent their \ninterests, elevating corporations to the status of flesh-and-blood \npersons for constitutional purposes. So let me make a very bold and \nradical statement right now. I know many corporations. I know who they \nare. Let me tell my colleagues: A corporation is not a person. A \ncorporation is not a person. It is totally absurd to suggest that a \ncorporation should have the first amendment rights of individual \nAmericans.\n  What the Supreme Court decision has done is to turn our media during \ncampaigns into even more of a circus and undermines State election laws \nacross the country that provide some small buffer between wealth and \npower. They have unleashed the vast coffers of corporate America by \nallowing them to spend whatever they want--unlimited sums of money--\nfrom their general bank accounts, not just their PACs and not just on \nsham issue ads but on telling people outright which candidate to vote \nfor, something this country has not seen since 1947.\n  Big money corporate interests from Wall Street to oil giants, from \ndrug companies to the military industrial complex, already dominate the \npolitical process in Washington. It is inconceivable to me that not one \nRepublican--not one Republican today--voted to minimize the horrendous \nSupreme Court decision which will allow corporations to put unlimited \nfunds into campaign advertising with no disclosure whatsoever--no \ndisclosure whatsoever.\n  I think the American people must be wondering this afternoon what, to \nour Republican friends, could be wrong with some simple checks on \ncampaign spending such as the following: requiring the CEO of a \ncorporation that spends on campaign-related activity to stand by the ad \nthey have produced and say that he or she ``approves this message.'' If \nthe Presiding Officer was running for office or I am running for office \nand we put an ad on television, that is what we have to say. I think it \nis a good idea. If you put something ugly on television, you say: I \napproved this message. If you put something dishonest on the air, \npeople have a right to know that you are the person responsible for \nthat ad. If you have to be responsible for that ad, if I have to be \nresponsible for that ad, if every other candidate for the Senate has to \nbe responsible for that ad, why should not the CEO of a large \ncorporation that is paying for that ad also have to say that he or she \napproves this message?\n  It is no great secret that a lot of money from abroad is being \ninvested in American corporations. In a situation where a company which \nhas a lot of foreign money in it, why should we allow that company to \nget actively involved in American politics? What the legislation that \nwe voted on today does, which I think makes a lot of sense, is it \nprohibits a corporation that is under the direction or control of a \nforeign entity from spending money on our elections. I don't think that \nis an unreasonable provision. I don't think we want our political \nprocess to be dominated by people who may not have the best interests \nof the people of the United States of America at heart.\n  Another provision requires disclosure of political spending by \ncorporations and other entities to their shareholders and members and \nrequires these groups to make their political spending public on their \nWeb sites within 24 hours after filing with the FEC. Why should the \npeople who actually own the stock in those companies not be able to \nknow in a timely manner what the CEOs of these corporations are doing \nso they can say: Excuse me, you can't do that with my money. I don't \nlike that. I think what you are doing is wrong.\n  Another provision in this legislation would ban coordination between \na candidate and outside groups on ads that reference a candidate from \nthe time period beginning 90 days before a primary and running through \nthe general election.\n  Another provision would avoid the appearance of corruption and \npossible misuse of taxpayer funds by banning government contractors \nwith a contract worth more than $10 million from spending money on \nelections.\n  I think these are simple, straightforward provisions. I think they \nare right. I have a very hard time understanding how we could not get \none Republican vote in support of these provisions.\n  My hope is that the Democratic leadership will not give up on this \nissue. I think the American people, before Citizens United, were \nfrustrated and disgusted with the role big money plays in the political \nprocess, disgusted with the power big money interests have on \ninfluencing legislation, and I think they are now even more disgusted \nas a result of the Citizens United decision. We have brought forth \nlegislation which I think is straightforward, I think it is sensible, I \nthink it needs to be passed, and I hope we will continue that effort to \nget it passed.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      In Praise of Alison McNally\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize another of \nAmerica's great Federal employees. This will be Federal employee No. \n89.\n  In 1829, a British scientist who had never set foot in our country \nbequeathed to the American people his estate in order to create ``an \nestablishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.'' That he \ndid so is a reminder of what this young country represented to those \naround the world who yearned for liberty and an approach to government \nbased on wisdom and science.\n  James Smithson's gift continues to enrich Americans' lives to this \nday in the form of the Smithsonian Institution. The millions of \nAmericans who have visited the 19 Smithsonian museums, the National \nZoo, and the over 150 affiliated institutions can attest to the value \nof the Smithsonian. Since its founding by Congress 163 years ago next \nmonth, the Smithsonian Institution has helped expose the American \npeople to the arts and sciences.\n  Some of its museums have been traditional stops for families to bring \ntheir children when visiting Washington, such as the Air and Space \nMuseum, the National Museum of American History, and the National \nPortrait Gallery. Many of us here can recall exploring them in our \nyouth.\n  I can remember when I lived in Washington for 2 years after the \nSecond World War. We didn't visit anything, and then, in the last 2 \nweeks, my mother took me and my sisters and we went on a tour of all \nthe different museums in town. It was fantastic, and it is even much \nbetter today.\n  Other Smithsonian museums have joined them in recent years or are \nunder construction today. The National Museum of the American Indian--a \nbeautiful new building with wonderful, educational exhibits--is \ncelebrating its 5-year anniversary.\n  The successful operation of this network of museums and galleries and \nthe preservation of its treasures relies on the more than 4,000 \ndedicated Federal employees on its staff. There are dedicated, smart, \nhard-working employees on the Smithsonian staff.\n  Alison McNally is one of them--and a great one at that. As the \nSmithsonian's Under Secretary for Finance and Administration, Alison \nsupervises a number of departments, including: the Office of Facilities \nEngineering and Operations, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, \nthe Smithsonian Archives, the Office of Human Resources, and the Office \nof the Chief Information Officer.\n  In this capacity, she plays an important role in the day-to-day \noperations of the Smithsonian, helping to ensure that it continues to \nprovide the services Americans and foreign visitors have long enjoyed. \nEarlier, Alison served as the Smithsonian's senior executive officer in \nthe office of the Under Secretary for Science. In that position, she \ndirectly oversaw a number of scientific research support programs.\n\n[[Page S6290]]\n\n  Alison has been with the Smithsonian Institution since 2005 and \npreviously spent twenty-four years working at NASA. There, she served \nas Deputy Associate Administrator for the Management of the Science \nMission Directorate. From 2002-2004, Alison was the Associate Director \nof NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.\n  Throughout her career in public service, Alison has consistently \ndemonstrated a keenness for public administration and successful \nmanagement.\n  She holds an undergraduate degree in Human Development from the \nUniversity of Connecticut and a master's of social work from Columbia \nUniversity. She has pursued additional study as well at the Simmons \nCollege Graduate School of Management and Harvard's Kennedy School of \nGovernment.\n  Madam President, I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Alison \nMcNally and all those who work at the Smithsonian Institution for their \nservice to our Nation.\n  They are all truly great Federal employees.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Regulatory Capture\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, the story of regulatory failure \nsurrounding the Deepwater Horizon oilspill by now is all too well \nknown. The Minerals Management Service, called MMS, the now defunct \nagency that had been charged with assuring that drilling off America's \ncoast was safe, environmentally responsible, and a reliable revenue \nsource for the taxpayers, became the single most recognizable example \nof regulatory capture in U.S. history.\n  Regulatory capture is when a regulatory agency permits its judgments \nto be clouded by the narrow economic interests of the industry it is \nsupposed to be regulating. It is the absolute opposite of how \nregulators should work, which is to safeguard the greater and broader \ninterests of public health, safety, and prosperity against often \ncomplex, powerful, and narrowly minded industries.\n  Regulatory capture can happen for a number of reasons. First, \nregulatory capture can happen where the revolving door constantly \nshuttles individuals from the private sector to the regulator and vice \nversa. Regulators may be compromised by the implicit promise of \nlucrative employment should they only look out for the industry during \ntheir watch. It is this indicator of regulatory capture at MMS that the \nWashington Post described in such shocking detail in last week's front-\npage story.\n  Seventy-five percent of oil lobbyists formerly held jobs in the \nFederal Government. Randall Luthi, who directed the MMS from 2007 to \n2009, is now president of the National Ocean Industries Association, \nthe trade association for producers, contractors, engineers, and supply \ncompanies that explore and drill for oil and natural gas in offshore \nwaters.\n  According to the Department of Interior inspector general's report, \none examiner conducted safety checks at four rigs owned by one company, \nwhile at the same time negotiating for a job for himself with the very \nsame company.\n  It also works in both directions. According to an MMS district \nmanager, almost all MMS inspectors had previously worked for oil \ncompanies on the same platforms they were inspecting.\n  As Ken Salazar testified last week before the House, he is aware of \nthe problems caused by the revolving door and is taking steps to \naddress it. And I know he will. Michael Bromwich, who directs the \nBureau of Ocean Energy Management--the successor to the MMS--has also \npledged to beef up cooling-off periods which restrict the ability of \nformer oil regulators to seamlessly flow directly from government into \na high-paying industry job.\n  Poor funding, morale, or training for regulators can also play a role \nin regulatory capture. This, too, may have played a part in the \nineffectiveness of MMS. During the prior administration, the workforce \nat MMS shrank by approximately 8 percent, even as offshore minerals \nexploration leases and acres leased increased by 10 percent over the \nsame period. Leases go up by 10 percent, employees go down by 8 \npercent. That does not seem to make sense, but it fits into the idea of \nregulatory capture.\n  A third factor that may lead to regulatory capture is if a regulator \nis responsible for just one industry, such as MMS was responsible for \nonly regulating the exploration activities of oil companies. Industry \ngroups with a laser-like focus can lobby single-industry regulators, \nwhereas the public's interest is likely to be much more diffuse. In \naddition, the revolving door may be amplified for a single-industry \nregulator because the regulators have relatively few options for \nseeking private sector employment after they leave the single-industry \nregulator.\n  Mr. Bromwich has also been quick to recognize the problems caused by \nhaving such a small and captive pool of inspectors. As he works to make \nthe job of oil rig inspector more attractive, Congress should support \nthese efforts as an effective way to counter regulatory capture.\n  Vague statutory lines drawn by Congress, as well as loose oversight, \nare a fourth contributor to regulator capture because they give captive \nregulators plenty of room to stretch and contort the law without \nnecessarily breaking the law or even having to explain their actions.\n  Finally, complex industries, large masses of proprietary data are \nalso able to control the flow of information to the regulators--\ninformation that will form the basis of regulation and enforcement, \nthereby precluding effective regulation.\n  We have a business that is very complex. There is a lot of \ninformation flowing. It is more and more difficult for the regulator to \nkeep track of the information they need to do their regulation and \nenforcement.\n  While I have heard colleagues and commentators argue that Secretary \nSalazar did not do enough fast enough to reverse the problem of \nregulatory capture in time to avert the BP disaster, these myopic \ncriticisms ignore the deep and lasting damage that Secretary Salazar \nfound when he arrived done by many of our regulators in the previous \nadministration.\n  During the last administration, a deregulatory mindset captured our \nregulatory agencies. They became enamored of the view that self-\nregulation was adequate--that was throughout the government--that \nrational self-interest would motivate counterparties to undertake \nstronger and better forms of due diligence than any regulator could \nperform, and that market fundamentalism would lead to the best outcomes \nfor the most people.\n  When the regulators themselves feel the best regulation is no \nregulation at all, when a laissez faire mindset causes the regulators \nto be deeply distressful of curbs on any industry practice, then \nregulatory capture is all but ensured. During these 8 years, Congress's \nfailure to conduct vigorous oversight was particularly damaging as \nwell.\n  What we had was a situation where we basically pulled the referees \noff the field and did not even watch what was going on and what \nhappened.\n  This deregulatory mindset, more than any other factor, explains why \nwe have suffered so many examples of failed regulation in recent years, \nespecially in our financial sector and oil and mineral industries.\n  It is interesting that I hear colleagues on the other side of the \naisle say: The government didn't do this right; the government didn't \ndo right in the oil thing. How could they when the last administration \ntook us completely out of the oil regulation business? How did \neverything happen on these sites without an inspector there to check \nthat the batteries were working, to see that inspections were carried \nout.\n  The Federal Government was denuded of any ability to do anything once \nthe spill developed, once the leak started because we believed the \nreports that were put out by the companies. No one looked at them and \nsaid: Don't\n\n[[Page S6291]]\n\nworry, this will never happen. And if it does, we have a plan. \nRemember, that was the plan that was talking about how we were going to \nhave to look out for the walruses. Remember?\n  I do not understand how one can be critical of Secretary Salazar when \nwe saw that he came into an office where there was no regulation and \nwhere the regulators were totally, completely captured by the business. \nAs we learned over the last 2 years, when regulators fail, it is the \nAmerican people who pays the price.\n  When President Obama was inaugurated, therefore, he inherited \nexecutive agencies that had been weakened by 8 years of atrophy and \nneglect.\n  Another example is the Office of Thrift Supervision. It is a \nwonderful example of how regulatory neglect in the financial sector led \nus to an economic and financial crisis.\n  Listen to this. During the Bush administration, over 20 percent of \nthe full-time equivalent positions at OTS were eliminated. Why did we \nneed OTS inspectors if we did not believe we needed regulation?\n  This decrease in funding for OTS personnel, while striking, is not \nthe heart of it. It does not reveal the scope of the rot in the agency. \nFor that, one needs to examine how those regulators acted. And I \nsuggest to everyone Senator Levin's Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations hearings that he chaired that went into detail what \nactually happened to the Office of Thrift Supervision.\n\n  As established in those hearings, Washington Mutual, better known as \nWaMu, comprised as much as 25 percent of the assets under OTS \nregulation. Moreover, WaMu contributed between 12 percent and 15 \npercent of OTS's operating revenue through the fees it paid.\n  Think about this. The largest institution you are regulating covers \nover 25 percent. Even though WaMu was the most significant and largest \ninstitution under its regulation, regulators allowed shoddy and even \nfraudulent lending to occur under their noses without taking remedial, \ncorrective action or any significant enforcement measures.\n  Listen to this. The Office of Thrift Supervision sat by as up to 90 \npercent of the home equity loans underwritten by Washington Mutual were \ncomprised of stated income or so-called liar loans. A stated income or \nliar loan is where I come in for a loan, the loan officer says to me: \nSenator Kaufman, what do you make every year? And I say: $1.6 million. \nThey write it down. Nobody asks for a W-2 form. Nobody asks for any \nfurther information on it. They just take my word for it.\n  Can you believe that an institution could make liar loans that were \n90 percent of their home equity loans? Ninety percent of the loans they \ntook, when people came in and said what their income was, they never \nasked for a W-2 form. They never asked for any further information.\n  Still worse, if that is hard to believe, OTS was captured to such a \ngreat degree that it lobbied other regulators to weaken nontraditional \nmortgage regulations. Not only were they not looking at their \nbusinesses, the largest thrift institutions, they were trying to stop \nother regulators from doing it.\n  As if to give further evidence of its capture, OTS even went so far \nas to thwart an investigation into WaMu by the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, a secondary regulator, that could have put a \nstop to some of WaMu's unsustainable business practices before they did \nso much damage.\n  OTS and WaMu are just the beginning of the story, however. The \nproblem of capture spread beyond the thrifts to those responsible for \nregulating Wall Street, where many of the top cops during this time \nwere either former industry insiders or committed to deregulation and \nself-regulation.\n  As MIT economist Simon Johnson has termed it, a ``financial \noligarchy'' has arisen that moved seamlessly between the private and \npublic sectors leaving an indelible mark on the financial industry \nlandscape in a way that tends to enrich those very oligarch and their \nfriends.\n  The negotiation of the 2004 Basel II Capital Accord was emblematic of \nthis cozy relationship. As part of these discussions, the Fed was a \nprincipal architect of a regulatory framework that would allow banks to \ndetermine capital requirements based on the judgment of the ratings \nagencies and their own internal models.\n  By outsourcing their regulatory responsibilities to the banks that \nthey were supposed to regulate, the Fed and other bank supervisors made \nan implicit admission that the size and complexity of megabanks had \nexceeded their comprehension.\n  Although the Basel II Accord was not fully implemented, it \neffectively was applied to large investment banks. While the SEC \nnormally regulated these firms, the Commission had no track record to \nspeak of with respect to ensuring the safety and soundness of financial \ninstitutions. The Securities and Exchange Commission allowed these \ninvestment banks to leverage a small base of capital over 40 times into \nasset holdings that in some cases exceeded $1 trillion.\n  The head of Bear Stearns said his biggest problem was that he was \nallowed to expand his capital base.\n  When the bottom fell out of the market, the funding engine powering \nthe investment bank business model seized up. Lehman Brothers and Bear \nStearns were forced into bankruptcy and the other major investment \nbanks faced an existential crisis.\n  Lehman Brothers was forced into bankruptcy and Bear Stearns was taken \nover by JPMorgan Chase. At the end of the day, as we all know, the \nAmerican taxpayer was left holding the bill for the cost to stabilize \nthe financial system.\n  Basel II's treatment of capital adequacy standards is just one \ntelling example of regulatory capture. Federal regulators also failed \nto strengthen consumer protection regulations in the lead-up to the \ncrisis, despite the explosion of the subprime market and warnings from \nmany quarters on the frequent incidence of predatory lending practices.\n  Hence, just like leverage ratios, regulators allowed underwriting \nstandards to erode precipitously without strengthening mortgage \norigination regulations.\n  Wall Street regulation is compromised by another problem--the utter \ndependence of regulators on the regulated for information. This closed \nloop depends on the unrealistic assumption--listen to this--that \nindustry will provide regulators with an accurate data stream, even \nwhen it is the direct detriment. Too often, however, industry comes up \nshort, and without access to meaningful data, objective analyses cannot \nbe developed by academics, consumer advocates or the media.\n  A good example of this is high-frequency trading, which has grown \nrapidly over the past few years free from regulatory structure. \nBasically, it has gone from 40 percent to 70 percent of all trades that \nare now done by high-frequency trading. Pending finalization of the \nApril 14 large trader rule, the SEC hasn't been collecting meaningful \ndata about high-frequency trading--listen to this--including \ninformation on the identities of individual traders.\n  Even when implemented, the data will remain between the SEC, the \ntrading firm, and the firm's broker-dealer, thereby eliminating the \nability of any objective party to check the Commission's work to make \nsure it is doing its job of ensuring market credibility.\n  The recent SEC roundtable discussion on market structure issues is a \nperfect case in point of regulatory capture. Roundtables are designed \nto publicly air a diversity of views pertaining to potential \nregulations. These roundtables are supposed to be where a bunch of \npeople get together with different views that represent all the views \nand talk about potential regulation. However, the panel that was set up \non high-frequency trading, as I said in a speech on May 27, promised to \nbe so completely one-sided and ``in favor of the entrenched money that \nhas caused the very problems we seek to address that the panel itself \nstands as symbolic failure of the regulators and the regulatory \nsystem.'' Look at that panel. See who was on it, and you could see \nregulatory capture right before your eyes. Thankfully, the SEC agreed \nto make some modifications to the panel but concerns still remained.\n  At the opening of the panel, SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar noted in \nhis opening statement:\n\n       I am disappointed that our Roundtable is not constituted to \n     showcase the full breadth of relevant voices. And I am \n     concerned that\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\n     as a result, today's discussion will not bring to light how \n     conflicts of interest, and particular business models, may \n     influence the various views we'll hear today.\n\n  Commissioner Aguilar, I couldn't agree with you more. To rely on \nthose who have benefited from the status quo to point out the very \nregulatory imperfections that allowed them to prosper is to doom the \nregulatory process from its inception.\n  As we emerge from this period of regulatory abdication and begin to \nrediscover the vital role regulation must play in ensuring fair \ncompetition and a level playing field, it will take strong leadership \nand determination in the face of constant industry resistance to retake \nthe initiative in our regulatory agencies for the good of the American \npublic.\n  Some commentators have looked at the record of regulatory failure and \nhave argued that all regulation is inherently prey to capture. \nRegulatory capture is a fact of life, they say, and we should therefore \nendeavor to have as little regulation as possible. Think about that \nnow. Regulatory capture is a fact of life, and they say we should \ntherefore endeavor to have as little regulation as possible. Let's let \nthe industries run it all is essentially what they are saying.\n  This position ignores the commonsense solutions to regulatory \ncapture, however. Open publication of regulatory data, for example, \ncould allow academic scrutiny and mitigate the problem of the closed \nloop. Strict ethics rules could mandate cooling-off periods so \nregulators do not take proprietary information to their new employees. \nIt seems like common sense, right?\n  Congress can draw clear lines that empower regulators to act for the \npublic interest and minimize vague mandates that can be exploited by \nshrewd companies. Vigorous congressional oversight can hold regulators \naccountable before their agencies are too far gone to the problem of \ncapture. Agency employees should be paid fairly and treated with \nrespect so they are not tempted to compromise their judgment in hopes \nof earning a lucrative industry job.\n  This country has a long and proud history of successful Federal \nregulation--a long and proud history of successful Federal regulation. \nIn large part, the safety of our food, our roads, airspace, workplaces, \nand so many other things is due to successful Federal regulation. Our \ncontinued prosperity depends on continuing to have good, positive, \nwell-done regulation, strongly and intelligently done, for the good of \nthe public.\n  The final Wall Street reform bill is a case in point. It invests \nenormous responsibilities and discretion into the hands of the \nregulators. Its ultimate success or failure will depend on the actions \nand follow-through of these regulators in the years to come.\n  Congress has a vital role in overseeing the enormous regulatory \nprocess that will now take place. I have talked about this before. \nCongress's role in this is key. We are talking about a lot of \nregulations down the road. It is up to Congress to do its oversight \nresponsibility. This will include ensuring that the regulators have \nadequate resources and staff, that the regulations reflect wide and \nobjective input, and that the failed experiments of deregulation and \nself-regulation are put to an end.\n  Industry and big business have already begun their counterattack. \nAlready they have begun their counterattack. Daily, we hear that the \neconomic recovery is being slowed by uncertainty about Federal \nregulations. This argument, which went on for a number of years, might \nhave been plausible a few years ago. I might have stopped to listen to \nit. But after the massive financial failures and oilspills, it rings \nempty to me.\n  I am certainly not a fan of overregulation. I think one of the \nproblems of not having regulation is that when we do regulate, we \noverregulate. We do not need overregulation. But the complaint that we \nare starting down the path of overregulation is plainly overstated, to \nsay the least--especially after industry malfeasance and regulatory \ncomplicity cost so many Americans their jobs, their homes, and their \nway of life.\n  How can we look at what has happened out there now; how can we look \nat the people unemployed and the people who have lost their homes and \nsay we should go back to the way things were and continue with no \nregulation and have another incredible meltdown? Unfortunately, some in \nbig business will always complain about having to follow the rules. But \nwithout effective rules and rules that are effectively enforced, we are \nall certain to bear, once again, the cost inflicted upon us by the next \nindustry-caused disaster.\n  Never again can we allow our environment and our economy to be \nentrusted to agencies that serve no purpose other than to provide a \nfalse sense of security. Lip service, we have found, does not work. Our \nleadership, the Congress and our regulatory agencies, must walk the \nwalk of enforcement while keeping regulatory capture to a minimum. Our \ngovernment exists to do no less, and the American people deserve no \nless.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague, the \nSenator from Delaware, for his remarks on important banking issues and \nfor his diligence in trying to continue to focus on the need for \nfinancial regulation.\n  I agree there were definitely winners and losers in the process in \n2008. That probably shouldn't have been done that way. So I thank him \nfor his comments on that, and, yes, Congress needs to play a larger \noversight role.\n  One thing we need to do now is to make sure we are moving forward on \nthe small business package that is in front of us. We had an important \nvote last week to make sure we are increasing access to capital for \nsmall businesses by helping them recapitalize. I am already receiving \ncalls from small businesses and organizations in my State. One I \nreceived is from the central part of our State from a lender who said:\n\n       We would absolutely use the funds for small business \n     lending. Our bank has a backlog of $50 million to $70 million \n     in loan requests which is counter to statements of soft loan \n     demand. We have reduced our lend to preserve capital as \n     expected by the regulators. This legislation would give us \n     the capital to significantly increase lending.\n\n  So that is what we are hearing from financial institutions; that this \nis a critical piece of legislation to move small business lending.\n  Another component of the bill is a provision to enhance the loan \nguarantee program--the 7(a) and the 504 lending program, the Recovery \nAct, and subsequent extensions providing funding authority to reduce \nloan fees from borrowers and to increase the 7(a) guarantees.\n  Just this morning, a constituent of mine called saying he had made \nsome hires in January and was trying to continue to grow his business \nbut wasn't able to get access to capital. So he certainly wants to see \nthis program and its enhancements.\n  These enhancements to the SBA programs expired at the end of May. So \nthis is so timely that we move ahead. In June, approved loans from the \nSBA fell two-thirds, from $1.9 billion down to just $647 million. So \nthat is a drop of $1.2 billion in loans to small businesses. It was the \nworst month for SBA lending in a number of years.\n  So that is where we are. We have banks calling in saying they need \naccess to capital, we have a program that can help, and we have an SBA \nprogram that has fallen off and needs to be implemented. So we need to \npass this small business legislation. The longer we delay, the longer \nconstituents all across the country and small businesses will be \nstarved for the capital they need to grow jobs.\n  I wish to give an example because in my State we have over 140,000 \nsmall businesses that have employees; that is, in addition to the \nowners. Since this recession began in 2008, our State has lost over \n142,000 jobs. So if each of those small businesses just hired one more \nemployee, it would more than wipe out the jobs lost in the State. So \nthis kind of job growth--one employee per small business--would be a \nhuge economic boost to our economy.\n  I hope my colleagues will want to move forward on this legislation as \nsoon as possible. There are 27,000 small\n\n[[Page S6293]]\n\nbusinesses in America, and small businesses were the hardest hit by the \nrecession. Two-thirds of the job losses we saw came from small \nbusinesses. Seventy-five percent of new job creation comes from those \nsmall businesses.\n\n  This bill, besides the SBA program and the Small Business Access to \nCapital Program, addresses the depreciation rate for capital, another \nthing that many people say will help investment in small business \nequipment and manufacturing and help us restore jobs.\n  We know what our opportunities are. We can move ahead on this \nlegislation, with this bill that includes these small business tax cuts \nand access to capital and expansion of this critical small business \nprogram or we can continue to stymie what creates the real economic job \ngrowth of our economy--small business.\n  I urge my colleagues to support moving ahead on this legislation. \nLet's not delay another day. Wall Street certainly got its due. It \ncertainly got help and support from many in the previous \nadministration. Let's make sure that small business and Main Street get \nthe support they deserve to move ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \nwith my colleagues on the floor about jobs, job creation, opportunities \nthat are there that are here now, and things we need to do.\n  I report to my colleagues the report came out yesterday from the \nBrookings Institute, citing exports and export opportunities that we \nhave. They were pointing out that the President rightfully, in the \nState of the Union Message, called for a doubling of exports by the \nUnited States in the next 5 years. They were looking around, studying \nwhere is this possible for it to be able to happen. What are the \npossible communities to see this happen?\n  The Brookings Institute came out with a report yesterday that it \nreleased, and cited four metropolitan areas that doubled the real value \nof their exports between 2003 and 2008. One of them is Wichita, KS, and \nthe aviation cluster--doubling its exports based primarily on aviation \nand the aviation industry. I congratulate Wichita and my State for what \nit has done to expand exports in essentially--a good portion of this \nbeing essentially a home-grown industry, general aviation. These are \nsmaller aircraft, business aircraft, that travel to many of the \nairports throughout this country, and now airports throughout the \nworld, that are not served by commercial aviation. Of the 5,000 \nairports nationwide, only 500 are served by common carriers that would \nbe going out from different cities across their countries and our \ncountry. But that is only 10 percent of the airports that are connected \nthat way. The rest have to be connected by business aviation, by \nproducts made in Wichita.\n  We make both large aircraft and small general aviation products--both \nof those--but particularly many of the general aviation products are \nmade in my State, and this is an industry that is a home-grown one that \nwe can grow and we can build exports on. Brookings cited to it \nyesterday. They pointed out that 40 percent now of the U.S. production \nof general aviation aircraft is going overseas.\n  Madam President, $150 billion of the U.S. economy is based on general \naviation, the smaller business aircraft employing 1.2 million people in \nthe United States.\n  The problem with this is that earlier this year the administration \nhad attacked a lot of business aircraft and business aviation, saying \nthis is not useful, squandering resources, when in fact it makes \nefficient use of resources and it is a home-grown business that is now \nexporting 40 percent of its product and is one of the leading clusters \nin the country to push exports which we need to have a lot more of, and \nexport-related jobs.\n  I ask the administration and I personally invite the President to \ncome to Wichita, KS, to see the business aviation, to see the general \naviation business for himself, to see the fine products produced by \nBombardier Learjet, Cessna, Hawker Beechcraft Corporation--those \ncompanies that are producing these excellent aircraft, and to help this \nbusiness grow.\n  I also point out to my colleagues and to the administration that this \nis an industry that has been targeted by other countries for takeover. \nThis is the same sort of thing that is starting to happen on general \naviation that happened on the large-scale airliners when Airbus was \nbuilt by government money in Europe to take on and build large \nairliners and take that business away from Boeing, McDonald-Douglass, \nLockheed Corporation. Airbus succeeded in knocking two of those \nentrants out of the field, where they do not make large aircraft any \nlonger and only Boeing is left and we recently won a large trade case \nagainst the European Union and Airbus for its heavy subsidization that \nit has had by the European Union to get to that marketplace and to \nsteal market share from U.S. production. That is what has taken place \nin the large-scale aircraft business.\n  What is now setting up is many countries around the world are looking \nat getting into smaller aircraft, and mid-size aircraft, I believe, \nsubsidizing their way into this marketplace to take those jobs and \nthose opportunities to other countries around the world.\n  Embraer Air in Brazil is one that has had a fast expansion taking \nplace in the small- and mid-size aircraft market, defying the market \nlogic at the present time, that it has been a difficult marketplace. \nThey have expanded the number of aircraft and they have expanded the \nnumber of different types of aircraft that they produce, all in a \nmarketplace that has been under a great deal of difficulty in the last \nseveral years. I call on the administration to, No. 1, be supportive of \nthis industry--I invite the President to come to Wichita--and, No. 2, \nto start looking at what other countries are doing to bid into this \nmarketplace and to take these jobs from the United States by \nsubsidizing these jobs with their foreign treasuries. That is illegal \nunder the World Trade Organization. We need to be aggressive in our \ncountry in protecting this key export industry that is being targeted \nfor attack by other countries around the world.\n  We will be putting forward more information on this as this develops \nfurther. I am going to be contacting the U.S. Trade Representative's \noffice about looking into these practices of other countries. I meet \nregularly with people who lead various companies in the business \naircraft marketplace and they are talking constantly about China \nlooking at this, Brazil going into this market space--other countries \nlining up with different products to go after this home-grown, \nsuccessful, now export-oriented business in the United States that \nconnects the other 4,500 airports that do not have commercial service.\n  This is a big issue. I congratulate Wichita for its growth in \nexports, being one of the leading cities in the world--certainly in our \ncountry and in the world--in exports. I ask the administration to \nsupport this home-grown industry. I ask my colleagues to look at this \nas well.\n  I further point out when we look at military aircraft, certainly the \nbig tanker contract that has been such a controversy around here, that \nwe do not give those jobs to overseas companies such as Airbus that is \nbidding on the tanker contract but, rather, that those jobs be done \nhere and not subsidized and bought by other countries around the world. \nLet's not let it happen in the large-scale commercial market. Let's not \nlet it happen in the tanker business. Let's not let it happen in \ngeneral aviation. These are high-wage, high-skill manufacturing jobs \nthat we need in the United States, that we have in the United States, \nand we should not let them be stolen by practices overseas that are not \nlegal under the World Trade Organization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                NATIONAL RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY STANDARD\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today to urge us here \nin the Senate to seize an opportunity that is critically important to \nour Nation's economic recovery and our long-term energy future by \nestablishing a National Renewable Electricity Standard which is known \nin the industry as\n\n[[Page S6295]]\n\nan RES. We will without a doubt spur a new clean energy economy.\n  Many of my colleagues here in the Senate agree with me. My colleague \nfrom Kansas has been a leader on the need for a renewable electricity \nstandard, and this week he has made a call to all of us to join him in \npromoting one.\n  Let me also specifically thank Senator Dorgan from North Dakota and \nSenator Tom Udall from New Mexico for joining me to urge adoption of \nthe strong Federal RES. Establishing energy security, perhaps above any \nother issue, will assure our Nation's future success. Quite simply, a \n21st century clean energy policy is essential to our Nation's economic \ngrowth, it is essential to creating jobs now and into the future, and \nit is clearly the linchpin for our national security. The philosopher \nSantayana famously wrote, ``Those who cannot remember the past are \ncondemned to repeat it.''\n  If I can turn that saying on its head a little bit, I wish to review \nwhat happened in Colorado in the hopes that we can repeat it across our \ngreat country. Back in 2004, Colorado took a big step forward and \nembraced the emerging clean energy economy.\n  In that year, I led a bipartisan ballot issue with Republican former \nSpeaker of the Colorado House Lola Spradley in a campaign to convince \nthe voters of Colorado to approve a State-based RES that would harness \nrenewable resources such as the Sun, the wind, the heat that comes out \nof the Earth called geothermal.\n  We barnstormed the State over and over again, the two of us, a \nRepublican and a Democrat. We spoke to anybody who would listen to us. \nThere was a lot of industry opposition to an RES, and there were dire \npredictions that it would cost consumers money and it would damage \nColorado's economy. They were familiar arguments. I had heard them \nbefore, and I had witnessed defeat on this issue before. The Colorado \nlegislature had voted against an RES four different times, including my \nbill back in 1997, to establish an RES when I was a member of the \nColorado house.\n  We could not convince elected officials to vote for an RES at the \nState house, and in our State senate. But Colorado voters understood \nthe value and the promise of renewable energy. In the end, in that \ncampaign in 2004, they approved what we called Amendment 347, and it \nestablished a target that 10 percent of Colorado's electricity would \ncome from renewable energy resources by 2015.\n  In so doing, we became the first State to create an RES by a voter-\npassed initiative. This clearly defined goal, this clean energy goal, \ninspired us Coloradans to rise to the challenge. In 3 years, we had \ngiven ourselves over 10 years to meet this challenge. We were on pace \nto meet that 10-percent RES goal. We were well ahead of schedule. Our \nlegislatures saw this rapid success, and they decided to take the bull \nby the horns. They approved an increase to 20 percent by 2020, which \nwas another aggressive but a reachable goal. By that time, Xcel \nEnergy--I know the Presiding Officer and I talked earlier today about \nutilities and the important role they play in our States--Xcel Energy, \nwhich is a major Colorado utility that opposed the RES in 2004, fully \nsupported this increase to 20 percent by 2020, because they saw that \nrenewable energy sources can provide clean, cost-effective energy to \ntheir customers.\n  By the way, it turned out it was good for business. Xcel is now the \nNation's No. 1 provider of wind energy, and a leading proponent of a \nstrong RES. But we were not done. Earlier this year the Colorado \nlegislature approved and our Governor Bill Ritter signed a bill to \nincrease the RES even further, 30 percent by 2020.\n  That makes our standard, our RES, the second most aggressive one in \nthe Nation, just behind California. I put up a chart here to show the \nviewers how many States have renewable electricity standards. I see the \nPresiding Officer's home State right there, down in the lower left \ncorner. Over two-thirds of the States have an RES or renewable energy \ngoal.\n  I know if we here in Congress can act and start by thinking boldly \nand then act, and learn from the success of our State and all of the \nother States on this map, our Nation can position itself to take the \nlead in the new global clean energy economy.\n  I know some still want to look backward instead of forward and \ncontinue to offer dire predictions that an RES would cost consumers, be \ntoo expensive, or kill jobs. But I have to tell you, in Colorado those \npredictions turned out simply to be false. In fact, the opposite was \nproven true. With an RES in place, our economy, our clean energy \neconomy, sparked to life. We have had clean energy companies sprouting \nup all across our State, creating sustainable American jobs, jobs that \ncannot be outsourced.\n  I want to share a couple of the examples with the Senate. SMA Solar, \nwhich is one of the world's lead producers of solar inverters, \nestablished manufacturing facilities in Colorado. Abound Solar, which \nis a successful thin-film solar company, spun out of Colorado State \nUniversity, our land grant university, opened a manufacturing facility \nin Longmont, CO, creating hundreds of jobs in that community. This \nmonth, they announced they are going to expand their facility.\n  Vestas, the world's largest manufacturer of wind turbines, has also \ntaken root in our great State and has created over 1,000 highly skilled \nmanufacturing jobs at its three Colorado factories since 2007. They \nrecently announced a major hiring initiative to employ hundreds of \nadditional workers at their three Colorado factories in the next 12 to \n18 months.\n  The good news as well is that the presence of a company such as \nVestas, which is manufacturing, is that you then attract supply chain \nbusinesses. An example of such a business is Hexcel Corporation. They \nhave established a manufacturing facility in Windsor, a nice Colorado \ntown up in the northeastern part of our State. They produce carbon \nfiber and other components for Vestas right in our back yard.\n  So as you can tell, these are clear examples of how an RES can create \njobs and growth in our economy. In fact, if you look at the numbers in \nColorado, we have created nearly 20,000 new jobs in my State since 2004 \ntied to this RES.\n  Estimates about the solar energy requirement--that is a subset of \namendment 37--have brought in nearly 1,500 jobs. So we are aggressively \ninstalling solar panels and producing electricity on the roofs of \npeoples' homes and businesses. These stories abound all over Colorado.\n  In my mind, the question then becomes--it is an obvious one--how can \nwe replicate the success that Colorado has had on our national level? \nIt obviously helps to be blessed with the natural resources that we \nhave in our State. All of our States are created differently with \ndifferent resources.\n  I know this particularly lands in front of my colleagues. My \ncolleagues from the South are tracking this issue very closely for that \nreason. They have concerns that their States do not have enough \nrenewable energy resources to meet a national RES without electricity \nprices increasing.\n  I wanted to share with my colleagues a report released this week by \nthe Nicholas Institute at Duke University, which found that the South \nhas more renewable resources than expected, and could reasonably \nreceive 15 percent of its electricity from wind, biomass, and solar \nenergy by 2020, and without an increase in electricity costs.\n  I know this is one study. But as we have seen in Colorado, renewable \nresources are only one part of the equation. Once there is a market in \nplace, and our utilities become familiar with renewable energy, meeting \nan RES becomes increasingly achievable. In fact, recent analysis \nindicates that wind, geothermal, and biomass are already cost \ncompetitive with traditional electricity production.\n  The result, in many situations, is the costs across the country then \nare leveled. It affects each and every one of our utilities and \ntherefore consumer rates. We can change how we generate and approach \nenergy use to take full advantage of renewable energy resources in each \nof our States, and then we create new markets and business \nopportunities out of this clean energy focus, and that truly is a clean \nenergy future.\n  This is an enormous economic opportunity for us in the 21st century. \nThe global demand for clean energy is growing by $1 trillion. That is \nalmost a number I cannot get in my head, $1 trillion every year. The \nlesson to be\n\n[[Page S6296]]\n\nlearned from Colorado is that an effective RES, a real RES, can unleash \nthe American entrepreneurial spirit.\n  I believe it is our job in the Senate to pursue these sorts of \nforward-looking policies that will help America seize and lead this \ngrowing market. Again, I want to urge my colleagues to support the \nstrongest possible RES in any energy legislation that is brought to the \nfloor this year.\n  I have alluded to the hesitation that some of my colleagues have felt \nabout a robust RES. I saw that in Colorado firsthand for many years. It \nis tempting to dip your toe in the water when it comes to renewable \nenergy. But make no mistake, we are in a race against foreign \ncompetitors, and we are being left behind. The Presiding Officer and I \nrecently returned from China where we discussed clean energy issues \nwith American businesses located there. And China, we found out, will \nsoon be the owners of the largest wind and solar-powered \nfacilities. They are pursuing renewable energy and clean energy \ntechnology so ambitiously, not because they necessarily want to save \nthe planet, but because it makes good business and economic sense.\n\n  This week, we heard that China's energy use has surpassed ours for \nthe very first time. But I have to tell you, in my opinion from what I \nread and hear, they are taking more bold action to address their \ngrowing demand than we are. Then they also announced last week that \nthey are considering plans to invest $738 billion over the next 10 \nyears in clean energy development. That is nearly the entire size of \nour Recovery Act that we put in place last year in the United States. \nJust imagine, their economy is using a comparable amount of energy, but \nthey take clean energy so seriously that they plan to invest a \nstimulus-size amount of money solely in renewables. I saw it firsthand. \nAnd to use a well-worn term, they are about ready to eat our lunch when \nit comes to clean energy.\n  I do not want to miss this historic opportunity to implement a strong \nRES, so let me take a few more minutes to explain what standard I \nbelieve we must meet. I want to put a chart up here to show what \ndifferent levels of percentages would mean for job creation. When you \nset a standard, you want to set it at a level you can be proud of and \none that would spur innovation and the creativity to achieve it.\n  Senator Tom Udall and I filed a bill last year in the Senate which \nhad previously passed in the House, where we served, mandating an RES \nof 25 percent of renewable electricity by 2025. That is this side of \nthe chart here. Senator Dorgan has recommended a similarly aggressive \nstandard.\n  Why is it important to aim for these ambitious levels? Well, looking \nagain at the chart, if we were to invest wisely in a robust RES, a \nrecent Navigant report estimates that the U.S. economy could add nearly \n275,000 jobs. These are excellent paying jobs. They cannot be \noutsourced, and they support this concept of energy independence.\n  I cannot think of a better deal than this for Americans. Make no \nmistake about it, our country must have an all-of-the-above energy \npolicy. Conservation and energy efficiency efforts are the quickest way \nto reduce energy demand today. Nuclear energy and natural gas can and \nshould fill a larger share of our energy portfolio as they both are \ncleaner fuels.\n  In addition, we all know that America is going to be dependent on \nfossil fuels for years to come, so all of those have to be in our \nenergy mix. We have to acknowledge those facts in order to embrace 21st \ncentury solutions. But when you look at the future demands for clean \nenergy and economic opportunities ahead of us, renewable energy holds \nthe greatest promise.\n  The more homegrown renewable energy we can produce, the less money we \nneed to spend buying oil from foreign nations that wish to do us harm \nor do not agree with our principles or values. I do not think anyone--I \nhope--I do think not anyone in this Chamber can argue with the \nproposition that we should be moving aggressively toward energy \nindependence.\n  As I begin to close, it is time we make a concerted national effort \nto reclaim our position at the front of the pack. Many of the \ntechnologies that the Chinese are utilizing, the Europeans are \nutilizing, and other nations around the world, we developed in the \n1970s and 1980s. But we have got to get back to the front of the \nparade, where we harness the wind and the Sun and other renewable \nresources here in America and we put Americans to work developing, \nbuilding, and leading the clean energy revolution.\n  I urge and ask my colleagues to work with Senator Dorgan, Senator \nUdall of New Mexico, and me and the many others who have joined us in \nthis effort to have a strong renewable electricity standard. With all \nhumility, let's follow Colorado's successful example, and let's adopt a \nclean energy policy that drives innovation, inspires entrepreneurs, and \ndelivers commonsense American solutions to meet our 21st century energy \nchallenges.\n  I want to close on a final note. I wanted to acknowledge that a \nwonderful young man, my energy fellow, Kelly Knutsen, who is in the \nChamber right now, is leaving my office to join the office of Senator \nReed of Rhode Island as a legislative assistant. I wish to thank him \nfor his work in my office, especially for his help on several bills I \nintroduced this year, including my SUN Act and my E-Know bill. Although \nwe will miss him, I know Kelly will be a very strong asset for Senator \nReed and Senator Reed's focus on energy policy as well.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6296-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN.

Mr. President, today i pay tribute to Clarence Wolf Guts \nwho passed away on June 16, 2010, at the South Dakota State Veterans \nHome at the age of 86. Clarence was the last surviving Lakota Code \nTalker. Code talkers played a crucial role in World War II in \ncommunicating positions and messages that the enemies could not \ndecipher. Their contributions to the war effort are immeasurable. \nClarence enlisted in the Army at age 18 and was the personal code \ntalker for MG Paul Mueller, commander of the U.S. Army's 81st Infantry. \nHe traveled with General Mueller and the 81st as the division moved \nfrom island to island during the fight against the Japanese during \nWorld War II.\n  Clarence did not seek the limelight; he simply served his Nation \nhonorably. In later years, Clarence became a spokesman among tribal \nelders and traditional leaders about the importance of keeping Native \nlanguages alive for future generations. He was very proud to be a \nveteran, a full-blooded Lakota, and a Lakota speaker.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Clarence at a ceremony honoring him in \n2006 on Capitol Hill. Clarence is one of many South Dakotans who make \nus proud with their service to our Nation. Our nation owes him a debt \nof gratitude, and the best way to honor his life is to emulate his \ncommitment to our country. Mr. President, I join with all South \nDakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to the family of Clarence \nWolf Guts. He will be missed, but his service to our Nation will never \nbe forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6296-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6296-S6297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ROSE (PENNY) PENN ROSS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I wish to thank Rose Penn Ross \nfor her dedicated service to our Nation during World War II. Mrs. Ross, \nor Penny as she is called, is a retired school teacher who selflessly \nanswered the patriotic\n\n[[Page S6297]]\n\ncall to duty when she enlisted in the Women Airforce Service Pilots--\nWASP--organization during World War II.\n  Like many of her counterparts in the ``Greatest Generation,'' Penny \nwanted to help the war effort. As a licensed pilot, Penny wanted to \nserve by flying planes, and joined 25,000 women in applying for the \nWASP program. After completing exactly the same rigorous military \nflight training as her male counterparts, Penny became one of only \n1,100 women to receive her Silver Wings.\n  While the WASP organization was not recognized as part of the \nmilitary until 1977, Penny and the other women serving in WASP played a \ncritical role in the war effort. Within the United States, Penny \nbrought planes from factories to bases, flew experimental aircraft, and \ntowed targets for the gunnery school vital tasks that also freed up \nmale pilots for combat service and duties.\n  Prior to the war, Penny graduated from the University of Wisconsin \nwith a bachelor's degree in business and earned her master's in \neducation from the University of Missouri. She married her beloved \nVernon M. Ross and settled in Missouri. Vernon and Penny started a \nfamily, which grew to include four children: Robert, Barbara, David, \nand Richard; eight grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. After \nWASP was disbanded in 1944, Penny began her teaching career. She taught \nsecondary school for 30 years in Harrisburg, Glasgow, and Moberly, \nmolding young minds in the subjects of business, math, and French.\n  In addition to her legacy of family and her love of learning, Penny \nhas created a legacy of service to our Nation.\n  Penny, her fellow female pilots, and the countless other men and \nwomen who served their nation during World War II made possible the \nconquering of some of freedom's worst foes of the 20th century: Hitler, \nMussolini, and Hirohito. Thanks to the struggles and sacrifices of all \nof our troops from here at home, to Normandy, Tunisia, Midway, and \nGuadalcanal, those of us in subsequent generations have lived in \nrelative peace and prosperity.\n  It is only fitting that earlier this year Americans like Penny were \nrecognized for their contributions to the freedom we enjoy today. On \nMarch 10, 2010, Mrs. Ross attended the WASP Congressional Gold Medal \nCeremony in the U.S. Capitol. With her family by her side, she was \npresented with a bronze medal replica of the Gold Medal. Today, Penny \nresides in the Veterans Home-Mexico, MO.\n  Penny, we are grateful for your service to your family, your \ncommunity, and your country. Your story is an inspiration to people in \nall generations today who want to make a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6297-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FRESNO CITY COLLEGE'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the 100th anniversary of Fresno City College, California's \nfirst community college and the second oldest in the Nation.\n  Fresno City College was the brainchild of Charles L. McLane, the \nsuperintendent of Fresno Schools in the early 1900s. Mr. McLane was \nconcerned that many students from the San Joaquin Valley could not \nafford to attend the nearest universities located outside the San \nJoaquin Valley. He envisioned a junior college in Fresno that would \nallow young students to receive an affordable and quality education \nthrough their first 2 years of college while still being able to reside \nat home.\n  Mr. McLane worked diligently to recruit instructors and design the \ncurriculum. He secured commitments from the University of California \nand Stanford University that students who completed their coursework in \nFresno would be accepted to those schools to further their education.\n  In September 1910, Fresno Junior College officially opened with 20 \nstudents and 3 full-time faculty members. Students studied mathematics, \nEnglish, Latin, history, and economics. In addition, the new campus \nprovided vocational training in areas such as agriculture, commerce and \nthe industries that many 4-year universities did not offer.\n  In 1958, Fresno Junior College adopted its current name, Fresno City \nCollege. A year later, it permanently moved to its home for over the \npast 51 years on 1101 E. University Avenue in central Fresno.\n  Today, Fresno City College has grown from a small campus of 20 \nstudents and 3 faculty members to a dynamic community college whose \naverage enrollment is approximately 25,000 students. It is a highly \nregarded community college that features award-winning programs in \nseveral disciplines, including nursing and vocational training.\n  For the past century, Fresno City College has been a dependable and \naccessible institute of higher learning that has empowered generations \nof San Joaquin Valley residents, many of whom overcame challenging \nbackgrounds, to realize their full potential in many different aspects \nof life.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate the administration, students, \nfaculty, staff and proud alumni of Fresno City College on 100 years of \neducational leadership and excellence in the San Joaquin Valley. I send \nmy best wishes for many more years of continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6297-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6297-S6298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LEWIS MONROE HUDDLESTON\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I honor Lewis Monroe \nHuddleston on the upcoming occasion of his 80th birthday. Mr. \nHuddleston has spent his life committed in service to his country, his \nchurch and, foremost, his family.\n  Lewis was born September 14, 1930, although this apparently has long \nbeen a source of discussion in his family. His actual date of birth may \nbe September 13. His mother always swore he was born on September 13, \nand that all the legal documents, which list his birthday at September \n14, were wrong. As one should, I think I will side with Lew's mother on \nthis one and would like to share with you some of the commendable \nactions of Lew's life.\n  He honorably served our country in the military, entering the U.S. \nNavy in 1950. He was assigned to the USS Henry W. Tucker as a boatman's \nmate. His military service took him on reconnaissance missions both in \nKorea and Red China. He received four medals: Good Conduct Medal, \nNational Defense Service Medal, Korean Service Medal--2-Star--and \nUnited Nations Service Medal. Lew was honorably released in 1954, and \nthen headed to the Midwest.\n  He found work in the oil fields there, and one of his jobs took him \nto Sidney, NE, where he fell head over heels for a lovely young lady, \nJoyce Sewell. They were married on December 20, 1955, and have built a \nhappy life together in Sidney where they raised three children, Lewis, \nJr., Cindy and Shawn, who have given them three wonderful \ngrandchildren.\n  Lew and Joyce built a life committed to family, service to God and \nservice to the community. Throughout his life, Lew has given of \nhimself--first in military service, then to his church and his \ncommunity. Always involved, he could be heard cheering for his kids at \ntheir sporting events or found heading up a DeMolay or Jobs Daughter \nfundraiser. Not ever characterized as shy, Lew walks into a room of \nstrangers and leave that room as everyone's best friend. Those friends, \nspread across the country, know that if called upon for help and he \nwill always answer.\n  Even as he approaches his 80th birthday, Lew remains very much \ninvolved with his community. Although his children are grown with \nfamilies of their own, Lew continues to volunteer in the local schools \nand wherever he is needed.\n  I am honored to number his son Lewis, Jr., and his wife Leslie among \nmy friends. Through them, I have come to know Lew Huddleston as a true \npatriot, who exemplified that label not only by his military service, \nbut the continued gift he gives every day to family, community and \ncountry. Lew, it is individuals like you who are America's true heroes \nand give the United States its strength. We can never fully repay your \ncontribution. Thank you for your service to our country, and happy \nbirthday.\n\n[[Page S6298]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6298-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WILLIE JEFFRIES\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I ask the Senate to join me \nin recognizing Coach Willie Jeffries on the occasion of his induction \ninto the College Football Hall of Fame on Saturday, July 17, 2010. \nWillie Jeffries is a legend in the State of South Carolina. As the \nfirst African-American head coach of a NCAA Division I-A football \nprogram, he was a giant in the football world, and proved to be an \nincredible leader both on and off the field.\n  Coach Jeffries was born in Union, SC, on January 4, 1937. He \ngraduated from South Carolina State University, SCSU, where he would \nlater return as the head football coach. If there was ever a ``glass is \nhalf full'' guy, it was Willie Jeffries. Coach Jeffries was defined by \nhis optimistic outlook on life and the world around him.\n  Willie Jeffries began his career at South Carolina State University \nwhere he served as coach from 1973-1978. From there, he went on to \nbecome head coach at Wichita State University in 1979. With his hiring, \nCoach Jeffries became the first African-American head coach of a NCAA \nDivision I-A program. After winning only one game his first season, he \nheld the post for five seasons and led his team to an 8-2 record his \nthird year. During his tenure at Wichita State University, Coach \nJeffries became the only man to coach against legendary coaches Eddie \nRobinson of Grambling and Paul ``Bear'' Bryant of the Alabama. He left \nWichita State University with a record of 21-32-2, ranking him third in \nuniversity history for total wins.\n  From 1984-1988 Coach Jeffries took over the program at Howard \nUniversity, leading them to the first of his seven Mid-Eastern Athletic \nConference--MEAC--Championships. In 1989 he returned to his alma matter \nto take his position as head coach for the South Carolina State \nUniversity Bulldogs. Coach Jeffries finished out his career as the head \ncoach of South Carolina State.\n  During his time in coaching, he led his teams to numerous post-season \nappearances, six Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference--MEAC--titles, and two \nBlack college national championships. Coach Jeffries won almost 60 \npercent of the games he coached, and when he retired in 2001 he did so \nas the winningest coach in MEAC history with a 179-132-6 career record. \nIn 2010, South Carolina State University further honored him by naming \nhim Head Football Coach Emeritus by the University Board of Trustees.\n  Throughout his career, Coach Jeffries was named coach of the year on \neight different occasions. In 2002 he was awarded the lifetime \nachievement award by the Black Coaches Association. In addition to \nbeing an inductee of both the MEAC Hall of Fame and SCSU Athletic Hall \nof Fame, Jeffries was awarded the Order of the Silver Crescent in 2001. \nThis is South Carolina's highest honor for Outstanding Community \nService.\n  Coach Jeffries success on the field is not only matched but exceeded \nby his actions off the field. He possesses a great spirit of optimism, \nhumor, intellect, and decency that has made him a role model for all \nthe young men he has coached and those of us who call him a friend.\n  I ask that the U.S. Senate join me in honoring him for his impressive \ncoaching career and newest honor as an inductee into the College \nFootball Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6298-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       2010 ALTUS GRAPE FESTIVAL\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I join residents of Altus \nand all Arkansans to commemorate the 2010 Altus Grape Festival.\n  For 27 years, the Altus Grape Festival has celebrated area grape \ngrowers and recognized the heritage of the grape in Altus. The festival \nis sponsored each year by the area's local wineries--Post Familie, \nMount Bethel, Wiederkehr, and Chateau Aux Arc--and by area grape \ngrowers, businesses, civic organizations and residents.\n  Known as the ``Arkansas Wine Capital,'' Altus welcomes visitors from \nacross the State, Nation, and world to celebrate the area's rich \nheritage during the festival. The 2-day event features a variety of \nactivities, including a Friday night street dance and fireworks \ndisplay, live music, grape-related games for children and adults, a \ngrape stomp competition, quality juried arts and crafts, and wine and \njuice tasting by all local wineries. Amateur winemakers are also \ninvited to bring the best of their homemade wine to the Amateur \nWinemaking Competition.\n  I commend the residents of the Altus area for their commitment to the \nhistory and heritage of Arkansas.

These students represent the best of \nour State, and I was proud to visit with them during their trip to our \nNation's Capitol.\n  Arkansas's Boys Nation delegates for 2010 are Alex Geiger from North \nLittle Rock and Joseph Kieklak from Fayetteville. Arkansas's Girls \nNation delegates for 2010 are Brittany Webb of Jonesboro and Devika \nMenta of Conway.

Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in \nrecognizing Devon Alexander ``The Great'' of Saint Louis, MO. It is an \nhonor to celebrate and pay tribute to Devon's undefeated boxing career \nand commitment to giving back to his community.\n  Devon was born on February 10, 1987, in North Saint Louis. Seven \nyears later, he began his boxing career after discovering a gym run by \nSt. Louis police officer Kevin Cunningham. The gym was housed in the \nbasement of a former St. Louis City Police Station in the neighborhood \nof Hyde Park, which had one of the highest crime rates in the city of \nSt. Louis at the time.\n  Devon continued to improve in the sport of boxing, eventually joining \nthe ranks of the most recognized amateur boxers in the United States. \nHis long list of accomplishments stands as a testament to his love of \nthe sport and personal dedication to success.\n  As an amateur, Devon participated in almost 300 fights and won every \ntitle possible in St. Louis and many at the national level. The titles \nincluded four-time Silver Gloves national champion from age 10 to 14; \nthree-time Police Athletic League national champion; 2001 Junior Golden \nGloves national champion and Junior Olympic national champion before \nmoving on to win the World Junior Olympics, where he was also named \nBest Boxer; 2003 U.S. National Champion for those 19 and under; the \nU.S. National Championship in 2004 in the 141-pound junior welterweight \ndivision; and was invited to join the U.S. National Team.\n  On May 20, 2004, at the age of 17, Devon made the decision to become \na professional boxer. He continued to win and amassed a professional \nrecord that stands at 20 wins and zero losses. As a professional boxer, \nDevon faced and received praise from some of boxing's most recognized \nnames.\n  On August 7, 2010, Devon Alexander ``The Great'' marks his return to \nSt. Louis to defend his undefeated title. He is a strong example of \nwhat hard work and perseverance can accomplish. Devon's journey from \nadversity to success is an inspiration to countless others and it is \ntruly commendable.\n  Devon will use all proceeds from the ``Devon Alexander Hometown Hero \nCelebration'' that will be held on August 1, 2010, at St. Louis City \nHall, to benefit nonprofit boxing organizations in the St. Louis \namateur boxing community.\n  Devon Alexander ``The Great'' has made the city of St. Louis and the \nState of Missouri proud.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in honoring Devon Alexander ``The \nGreat'' for his personal success and service to the Saint Louis \ncommunity and to our country. I am proud to recognize this \nextraordinary Missourian and wish him many more healthy, happy, and \nsuccessful years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6299-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6299-S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING PAULINE MARTENS\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I honor the life and \ncontributions of Pauline Ruth Martens, who recently passed away at the \nage of 87. Born in Maine and raised near Boston, Pauline came to Alaska \nsoon after World War II with her husband Arnold. Her relationship with \nthe Frontier State began, much as it did with her beloved Arnold, with \nlove at first sight.\n  In many ways, Pauline's life was about taking the next step while \nnever leaving those who were most important behind. The period after \nWWII was an exciting time in Alaska, and Pauline was an active \nparticipant in the development of Anchorage, the Great Land's largest \ncity. While raising their family, Pauline and Arnold worked together to \ndevelop both business and residential properties, including the Palm \nMotel and the Forest Park South subdivision. To Pauline, however, it \nwas her relationships with family and friends--her role in guiding her \nchildren and grandchildren and helping her friends and community--that \nmattered most.\n  In addition to the love she gave to her family, Pauline brought her \nideals, her zest for life, and her strong character to bear on helping \nthose in the community around her. Beginning as a Girl Scout troop \nleader during her daughter's Scouting years, to becoming a board member \nand chairman of the Susitna Council of the Alaska Girl Scouts, \nPauline's contributions to the development of Alaska's young women were \nsignificant and positive. As her own children grew, Pauline took on the \nrole of helping other children take positive steps forward as a member \nof the board of Junior Achievement and Hope Cottages, which serves \ndevelopmentally disabled children and their families.\n  In whatever endeavor Pauline Martens took on, she was never just a \nname on a roster. She believed that any undertaking deserved her full \nparticipation. So it was no surprise that her commitment to the \nRepublican Party led to her service in roles both ordinary and \ndistinguished. Whether as the ``bouncer'' at the Annual International \nFood Festival, poll watcher, FREE member promoting the opening of ANWR, \nState chairman of the Alaska Republican Party, or president of the \nAlaska Federation of Republican Women, Pauline worked hard for those \nwho shared her beliefs and ideals. Her enthusiasm, hard work, and \ncommitment earned her the title of Woman of the Year in three separate \ndecades from the Anchorage Republican Women's Club, and the Lifetime \nAchievement Award from the Republican Party of Alaska.\n  Pauline was a mentor to many young Republican women--including me. \nShe gave encouragement, good counsel, and always a warm smile. I recall \nmany Republican State conventions working side by side with Pauline \nwhile she directed so much of the political operations with a \ngraciousness that was appreciated by all.\n  Still, it was Pauline's love for her family and the beauty of \nAlaska's\n\n[[Page S6300]]\n\nmountains and lakes that many will remember most. I know that she will \ncontinue to guide and inspire her children, grandchildren, and the many \nAlaskans who loved her. I am certain that each time we glimpse Alaska's \nmajestic mountains, lakes, and rivers we will remember Pauline with a \nsmile.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6300-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MRS. MARY WADE\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I bid farewell to \na great Nebraskan. Mrs. Mary Wade, affectionately known as ``Mother \nWade.'' She has selflessly served thousands of members of the Salem \nBaptist Church in Omaha for more than 65 years.\n  At the age of 92, Mrs. Wade is now moving away from Nebraska where \nshe has lived since moving to my home State in 1944. She will be living \nwith her adult children in Los Angeles, CA.\n  Mrs. Wade is known far and wide for her service to not only Salem \nBaptist Church but to the entire Omaha community. She worked hand in \nhand with her late husband, Dr. J.C. Wade, Sr., who was the pastor at \nSalem Baptist for many years before his retirement in 1988.\n  After Dr. Wade's death in 1999, Mrs. Wade continued to serve the \npeople of Omaha and to provide counsel to members of Salem Baptist \nChurch, whose membership, under the leadership of the Wades, grew from \n250 to more than 2000.\n  Thanks to her wise counsel, direction, and leadership, Omaha is a \nbetter place because of Mother Mary Frazier Wade.\n  I join all Nebraskans in bidding Mrs. Wade a fond farewell and \nthanking her for her service. We will miss her, and we wish her \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6300-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6300-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6300-4", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolutions, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to provide for comprehensive budget reform in order \nto increase transparency and reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we have been bombarded with some pretty big \nnumbers lately. Our total national debt recently topped $13 trillion. \nIn 5 years, it is expected to pass $20 trillion. This fiscal year \nalone, the Federal Government plans to run a deficit of $1.4 trillion. \nIn other words, we are borrowing 41 cents out of every $1 we spend.\n  The numbers are mind blowing. We cannot even wrap our heads around \nthe immensity of these numbers that run into the trillions. But they \nshould be a very big red flag indicating that something--something--has \ngone very wrong here in Washington.\n  The American people are struggling with high unemployment and a \ndifficult economy, trying to make ends meet. The American Government--\ntheir government--ought to be doing what it can to balance its own \nbudget, not spending like drunken sailors in a way that will put the \nfuture of many American families at risk.\n  I hear it in my State. I know most of my colleagues do. I hear it as \nI drive around the country. There is a palpable fear that this enormous \nburden of debt is going to crush us.\n  The Federal budget for 2010 is already 24 percent higher than it was \nin 2008. How many families are able to increase their spending by 24 \npercent over a 2-year period? Congress has to realize what the American \npeople already know: Our current rate of spending is unsustainable. \nThere is an old saying that if the only tool you have is a hammer, you \ntend to see everything as a nail. Well, this administration and the \nDemocratic leadership of Congress seem to think the only tool they have \nis a checkbook and every problem can be solved with more money.\n  But all of this reckless spending is not solving the problems it was \nmeant to solve. If you recall, the trillion dollar stimulus was \nsupposed to create jobs and get the economy growing again. \nUnfortunately, it has not worked that way.\n  Look at the latest jobs report for last month. We actually lost \n125,000 total jobs across the country. Where I come from, that is known \nas heading in the wrong direction. Look as the massive health care law \npassed earlier this year. When the other side was jamming this bill \nthrough the Senate, they said, even though it would cost $2.5 trillion, \nit would actually bring down--down--our spending on health care and \nlower the deficit over time.\n  In the past few weeks, however, we have gotten new estimates that the \nlaw will cost billions more than was thought a few months ago. On top \nof that, health care spending is expected to rise even faster as a \nresult of the law than if we had done nothing at all.\n  Time after time after time that is what we have seen: more spending, \nmore debt, and a bill we will hand to\n\n[[Page S6304]]\n\nour children--all because we cannot live within our means and we refuse \nto make the tough choices we were elected to make.\n  The irresponsible spending and borrowing that is making our mountain \nof debt bigger every day has to stop. Today, I am introducing a bill \nentitled the Deficit Reduction and Budget Reform Act that will take the \nfirst steps toward reining in our spending. It is high time we show the \nAmerican taxpayers we are responsible stewards not just of their tax \ndollars but of the future of this country.\n  The goal here is to reform the budget process and to reduce our \nstructural deficits so we will live within our means. My proposal is a \nthree-legged stool that aims to support our country and economy while \nreducing the burden our rapidly expanding government places on American \nfamilies and businesses.\n  The first proposal is to create a new standing joint committee of \nCongress for budget deficit reduction. The committee would be required \nto put forward a plan to cut the deficit by 10 percent every budget \ncycle, and to do it without raising taxes. This would be Members of \nCongress--both parties--taking responsibility and not punting the job \nto outsiders.\n  This bill would then receive expedited consideration in both Chambers \nof Congress. We have 26 committees and subcommittees in Congress that \nare dedicated to spending tax dollars. We should have at least one \ndedicated to saving tax dollars.\n  Second, to make sure those changes have a better chance of success in \npractice, I am proposing additional reforms to the budget process. \nCrucially, we would reform pay-go rules to prevent the double counting \nof new revenues or reduced spending in trust funds for the purpose of \noffsetting other expenditures.\n  When pay-go rules were set up earlier this year, they allowed for \nthese kinds of gimmicks that have been used over and over to subvert \nthe budget responsibility the rules were meant to impose.\n  More than $600 billion in trust fund offsets was used to pass the \nhealth care reform bill, and an attempt was made to increase the per-\nbarrel tax for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to offset other \nunrelated measures. By preventing these changes from being used as an \noffset under pay-go rules, this provision would end the practice of \ndouble counting these spending reductions and revenue increases.\n  Then we would add teeth to the budget by making it a binding joint \nresolution signed into law by the President. This would force the \nadministration and Congress to work more closely together, and Congress \nwould have less flexibility to violate the nonbinding resolutions we \ncurrently use.\n  My legislation would also establish a biennial budget timeline to \ngive Congress more time for oversight and to determine whether our \nspending is doing what it is supposed to do.\n  I will simply point out that it seems to me the way we do the budget \nprocess currently is broken. In the last 34 years, I think there have \nbeen 4 times when all of the appropriations bills have been passed by \nthe Congress on time, according to schedule. If you look at the number \nof budgets that have been passed here in the past few years, there have \nbeen a lot of years when we have not passed budgets at all.\n  It seems to me it would make sense--in an even-numbered year, when \nthere is an election going to be held--that we ought to do oversight, \nthat we ought to be looking at ways to save taxpayer money rather than \nspend taxpayer money. Then we could do the budget in the odd-numbered \nyears, after an election, so we have an opportunity to do the \nappropriations bills and go through the budget process in the odd-\nnumbered year, so when the even-numbered year comes around again we are \nnot consumed with trying to spend money to attract some constituency to \nvote for us in an election year, but, rather, we are focused on \noversight and on ways we could actually save the taxpayers money as \nopposed to spending it.\n  So a biennial budget process, budget timeline, is something this bill \nwould also do. When Congress inevitably resorts to pork-barrel politics \nthat inflates our budgets, we need a legislative line-item veto to \nallow the President to cut them out and to send a more responsible \nbudget back to Congress for an up-or-down vote. Governors of most \nStates, including my State of South Dakota, have some kind of a line-\nitem veto. The President ought to have that power as well.\n  Third, on top of these vital systemic changes, we need to take \ncontrol of the government's outrageous spending. My bill would impose a \n10-year spending freeze to cap the Federal Government's discretionary \nspending at the level it was in fiscal year 2008, adjusted for \ninflation. I said earlier that between 2008 and 2010, Federal spending \nhad increased 24 percent, at a time when inflation in this country was \nabout 3.5 percent. If we take that baseline back to that 2008 level and \nindex it for inflation every year for the next 10 years, we can save \nthe taxpayers literally hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Beyond that freeze, we should end the failed stimulus program and \nreclaim any money remaining unspent and unobligated and apply it to the \nFederal debt.\n  Those are not the only possible answers, and many are not new. Many \nof these are ideas my Republican colleagues and I have proposed and \nthat we fought for in the past. We will keep fighting for them because \nthey are the kinds of things we need to do to break the back of this \nbudget problem we are fighting.\n  The government's current level of borrowing, this out-of-control \nspending, and this amount of taxation are too much for our economy and \nour taxpayers to bear. What may be even more troubling is the point \nthat was made by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike \nMullen. He said the biggest threat to our national security is our \ndebt, not al-Qaida, not Iran's nuclear program, not Russian spies, but \nthe debt Congress itself has created.\n  It does not have to be this way. My plan is a responsible approach \nthat takes prudent but manageable steps to get our spending under \ncontrol and to start to draw down our debt. It provides concrete \nsavings of nearly a trillion dollars, and it puts in place a framework \nto help us save trillions more over time.\n  It is easy to say: I will be responsible tomorrow, but first I want \nto spend a little more today. Well, there will always be something that \nseems important to spend tax dollars on, and if we keep taking that \nsame old approach that the other side has been pushing since they took \ncontrol of Congress in 2007, we will be waiting for fiscal \nresponsibility forever.\n  Tackling our outrageous national debt is not a priority we should put \noff until the long term, after the debt has gone up even higher and \nhigher and higher than it is today. It needs to be a priority now.\n  I will also note that we cannot afford the old trick where the \nPresident calls for spending cuts in theory but then happily signs \ncongressional spending bills that do not save a dime. We have to move \nbeyond the same old political games and the same old phony rhetoric. We \nneed real commitment to making a real difference.\n  There is another old saying that the definition of insanity is doing \nthe same thing over and over and expecting different results. The \nPresident and the Democratic leadership of Congress want to keep doing \nthe same thing over and over: borrowing money, spending too much, and \nthen borrowing even more.\n  But thinking that somehow with all that borrowing and spending we \nwill buy our way out of the hole we are in, that is insanity. In \nreality, all we are doing is digging ourselves deeper and deeper into \ndebt.\n  I am going to conclude by urging my colleagues to take up this \nlegislation I am introducing and to take that first crucial step to \nfiscal responsibility. The American people expect us to take our debt \nseriously, and it is high time we lived up to that expectation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Webb):\n  S. 3654. A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code to \ninclude firearms in the type of property allowable under the \nalternative provision for exempting property from the estate; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to create an \nexpress exemption in the Federal Bankruptcy Code for personal firearms.\n\n[[Page S6305]]\n\nGiven the place that firearms occupy in our culture for law-abiding \nAmericans, I believe it makes sense for the Federal Bankruptcy Code to \nreflect these values. The Supreme Court has confirmed that the Second \nAmendment protects a fundamental right. I agree that the right \nprotected by the Second Amendment is ``deeply rooted in this Nation's \nhistory and tradition.'' One needs to look no further than the woods of \nVermont in the autumn to know this is true. Amending the Code to \nexpressly include this exemption will not only allow more Americans to \nparticipate in these traditions, but will further the exercise of the \nSecond Amendment right itself.\n  Under the Bankruptcy Code, debtors are permitted to exempt from the \nbankruptcy estate a wide variety of household goods and other personal \neffects. For example, a debtor using the Federal bankruptcy exemptions \nmay exempt furniture, musical instruments, jewelry, and other household \ngoods. The code defines ``household goods'' to include items such as \nlinens, china, and a television or other entertainment equipment. All \nof this is subject to limitations on monetary value, which is important \nto ensure that the exemptions are not abused to the detriment of \ncreditors. The code's list of exemptions is designed to permit a debtor \nto obtain a fresh start in such a way that he or she has the continued \nuse of personal items that are both utilitarian and that add to the \nenjoyment of day to day life. I believe many Americans would place \npersonal firearms squarely within both of these categories.\n  Several States have enacted specific bankruptcy exemptions for \nfirearms in their State laws. The Federal exemption I propose would \nleave all of these state exemptions untouched and would only apply if a \ndebtor affirmatively chose, where permitted, to use the Federal \nexemptions. The exemption is modeled on the work these states have done \nand takes a modest approach that will nonetheless be meaningful for \nsomeone using the Federal exemptions. This legislation would permit a \ndebtor using the Federal exemptions to at least exempt one rifle, \nshotgun, or pistol, separately or in combination, with an aggregate \nvalue of $3,000.\n  For many Americans, a personal firearm--whether a hunting rifle, a \nfamily heirloom, or a firearm for self-protection--is an important \npossession. It is one that in many cases may have little significant \nmonetary value to creditors. People own firearms for many lawful \nreasons. In many parts of the United States, hunting is an essential \npart of life. In others, people feel strongly about the need to own a \nfirearm to help keep themselves and their families safe. For still \nothers, firearms have deep historical or sentimental value. The \nBankruptcy Code should reflect these values.\n  Our bankruptcy policy is intended to help those in severe financial \ndifficulty regain financial health and repay what they owe to their \ncreditors to the extent possible. And in encouraging and helping those \nin bankruptcy to make a new start we are right to do so in a way that \nallows room for the things that give our lives enjoyment and meaning. \nIf the amendment made by this legislation makes it possible for a \nparent and child to continue a family hunting tradition or a person to \nretain a piece of family history passed down through generations to \nthem, those are good things.\n  I hope all Senators will join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3654\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nimprove the reporting on sales of livestock and dairy products, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Chambliss and Grassley, to introduce legislation \nthat would reauthorize mandatory price reporting for another 5 years. \nThis bill will guarantee transparency of the livestock marketing sector \nand help improve producers' timely access to market prices so that they \ncan make the best decision on when to sell the livestock they have \nworked hard to bring to market.\n  To address producers' concerns regarding low livestock prices, \nindustry concentration, and the unavailability of accurate market \ninformation, Congress passed the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act in \n1999 to help improve market transparency.\n  Producers tell me that Mandatory Price Reporting yields valuable \ninformation, helps to keep the markets honest, and helps take the guess \nwork out of business decisions for producers and packers.\n  This legislation, which is supported by producers and packers alike, \nwill extend for an additional 5 years the reporting requirements of \nlivestock daily markets. This bill makes two important changes from \nexisting law.\n  First, as specified in the 2008 Farm Bill, this bill will require \nMandatory Reporting of Wholesale Pork, MRWP, cuts. A study on MRWP, \nrequired by the 2008 Farm Bill and published earlier this year, will \nhelp guide the new regulations. This legislation also included \nnegotiated rule making that requires the Secretary of Agriculture to \nbring stakeholders, as well as representatives from industry and the \nDepartment of Agriculture together to design the regulations for \nreporting MRWP cuts. The bill requires that a final rule be completed \nno later than 18 months after it is signed by the President. This \nimportant addition, once completed, would simply expand transparency to \nthe pork industry that was not previously required and further protect \nproducers.\n  Second, the bill instructs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish \nwithin 1 year an electronic price reporting system for dairy products. \nPublished reports will be required on a weekly and monthly basis. This \nis a first critical step in continuing to assist our producers as they \nmake decisions that impact their businesses. Furthermore, on a weekly \nbasis, the Secretary of Agriculture must publish a report disclosing \nmilk prices from the previous week. This too was included in the Farm \nBill, and I am hopeful it will be another tool for dairy farmers across \nthe country.\n  This bill represents several months of negotiations by all interested \nstakeholders who worked hard to find compromise on these critical \nissues. I want to thank everyone involved in this process for working \ntogether to reach consensus. Those groups supporting the \nreauthorization bill include:\n  American Farm Bureau Federation, American Meat Institute, American \nSheep Industry Association, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, \nNational Farmers Union, National Pork Producers Council, National Meat \nAssociation, and the United States Cattleman's Association.\n  I look forward to moving this critical reauthorization through \nCongress so we do not disrupt the critical reporting\n\n[[Page S6306]]\n\non livestock markets and so that family farmers and ranchers in \nArkansas can have confidence that they are receiving fair market value.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     July 9, 2010.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Agriculture, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lincoln and Ranking Member Chambliss: We, the \n     undersigned organizations, are writing to request that the \n     Senate Agriculture Committee work with relevant stakeholders \n     in the livestock industry to reauthorize for a period of five \n     (5) years the Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting provisions \n     contained in the 2006 Livestock Mandatory Reauthorization Act \n     (P.L. 109-296).\n       The original 1999 Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act \n     was a culmination of many hours of negotiations among \n     industry participants and required packers to report, among \n     other things, livestock purchase prices to the USDA's \n     Agricultural Marketing Service. Livestock producers and \n     processors continue to need a transparent, accurate and \n     timely market price reporting system to make informed \n     business decisions. Mandatory price reporting makes markets \n     more transparent and offers new market information with \n     regard to pricing, contracting for purchase and supply and \n     demand conditions for cattle, hogs and sheep. During the \n     109th Congress, the Mandatory Price Reporting provisions were \n     reauthorized until September 30, 2010.\n       The U.S. pork industry supports the inclusion in this \n     reauthorization of two new pork industry-specific provisions. \n     We believe these consensus recommendations will increase and \n     improve the transparency of the Livestock Mandatory Price \n     Reporting system. We recommend that the following consensus \n     provisions be included:\n       1. Reporting of wholesale pork cuts. Require USDA to enter \n     a negotiated rulemaking process to develop this system.\n       2. Reporting on a weekly basis of pork exports. These \n     exports should be added to the list of commodities that are \n     required to be reported to the Secretary of Agriculture. \n     Information reported should include any contract for export \n     sales entered into during the reporting period.\n       These proposed provisions are part of a carefully balanced \n     consensus legislative package reached by interested \n     stakeholders over a long period of negotiation and discussion \n     representing all segments of the industry. We support the \n     consensus legislative package, including the new pork \n     reporting provisions, with the collective goal that mandatory \n     price reporting will be enacted before September 30, 2010.\n       We recognize that the Committee has a full slate of \n     legislative business ahead, and we urge expeditious action to \n     reauthorize the Act for a period of five years with these \n     industry consensus recommendations. We look forward to \n     working with the Senate Agriculture Committee on this \n     important issue to America's livestock industry.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Farm Bureau Federation,\n     American Meat Institute,\n     American Sheep Industry Association,\n     National Cattlemen's Beef Association,\n     National Farmers Union,\n     National Pork Producers Council,\n     National Meat Association,\n     United States Cattleman's Association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Begich, \n        Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 3658. A bill to provide professional development for elementary \nschool principals in early childhood education and development; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along \nwith Senators Michael Bennet, Mark Begich, Bob Casey, and Jeanne \nShaheen, legislation to support elementary school principals and help \nprepare America's children for a successful education. Our bill would \nprovide grant funds to train elementary school principals on how best \nto bridge the gap between early childhood development programs and \nelementary school learning.\n  Oftentimes for elementary school principals, the competing demands of \nrunning a school, without the proper training or experience, can crowd \nout successful partnerships with early childhood learning programs. \nThis can lead to an assortment of educational approaches and, on a \npractical level, disjointed efforts to ensure students receive a \ncontinuum of learning.\n  The aim of my bill is to provide elementary school principals with \nthe ability to take research-based, early childhood development \npractices and incorporate those skills into their schools in order to \nbetter prepare our Nation's youth for success. As part of this effort, \nour House colleagues, Congressmen Altmire and Himes, will be \nintroducing a companion version to this legislation in their chamber.\n  As we all know, a child's education does not begin on that first day \nof kindergarten; rather, it begins much earlier in life as an infant's \nbrain develops and cognitive skills are acquired through daily \ninteraction with parents, grandparents, siblings, and other caregivers. \nAs a parent, I remember firsthand the interactions I had with my two \nchildren during their infant years. When the time came, my wife and I \nknew that our children were prepared for pre-school, where they would \nacquire additional skills to further prepare them for their K-3 years. \nWe wanted them to be ready to learn on day one.\n  My story is similar to the stories of millions of American parents \nwho do what they can to ensure their children are fully prepared for \nthat first day of kindergarten. While there are many different early \nlearning settings, whether through the Head Start or other programs, we \ncan all agree that ensuring our children are school-ready is an \nadmirable goal.\n  As the research suggests, children who participate in early learning \nprograms often perform better upon entering elementary school than \ntheir peers who do not. In order to build on that success and do right \nby our children by giving them the best chance to succeed when they \nbegin kindergarten, our bill will help train principals on how to \nestablish relationships with early childhood learning providers and \ncollaborate to ensure they are on the same page when it comes to a \nchild's development.\n  Building this pathway and ensuring a close connection between these \ntwo critical educational settings, especially for principals early in \ntheir careers, is a common-sense way to build better learning \nenvironments for our children. Our legislation has the support of the \nNational Association of Elementary School Principals and a host of \nearly learning advocacy organizations. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 3659. A bill to reauthorize certain port security programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the SAFE Port \nReauthorization Act of 2010. This bill extends important programs that \nprotect our nation's critical shipping lanes and seaports from attack \nand sabotage.\n  The SAFE Port Reauthorization Act of 2010 is co-sponsored by my \ncolleague, Senator Murray. Senator Murray and I drafted the original \nSAFE Port Act in 2005, leading to its enactment in 2006. I am pleased \nthat she has again joined me to extend and strengthen this important \nlaw. Several stakeholders have expressed their support for our efforts, \nincluding the American Association of Port Authorities, the National \nRetail Federation, and the National Association of State Boating Law \nAdministrators.\n  The scope of what we need to protect is broad. America has 361 \nseaports--each vital links in our Nation's transportation network. Our \nseaports move more than 95 percent of overseas trade. In 2009, U.S. \nports logged 68,000 ports-of-call by foreign-flagged vessels, bringing \n9.8 million shipping containers to our shores.\n  The largest 21 ports handle 98 percent of the shipping container \ntraffic. Indeed, nearly 60 percent of all container-ship calls are made \nin just three States--California, New York, and Georgia--but this \ncontainer traffic arrives at many points across the United States, from \nMaine to Hawaii.\n  Coming from a State with three international cargo ports--including\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\nPortland, the largest port by tonnage in New England--I am keenly aware \nof the importance of seaports to our national economy and to the \ncommunities in which they are located.\n  Because seaports are flourishing, our harbors operate as vital \ncenters of economic activity; they also represent vulnerable targets. \nShipping containers are a special source of concern.\n  A single obscure container, hidden among a ship's cargo of several \nhundred containers, could be used to hide a squad of terrorists or a \ndirty bomb. In other words, a container could be turned into a 21st-\nCentury Trojan horse.\n  The shipping container's security vulnerabilities are so well known \nthat it has also been called ``the poor man's missile,'' because for \nonly a few thousand dollars, a terrorist could ship one across the \nAtlantic or the Pacific to a U.S. port.\n  The contents of such a container don't have to be something as \ncomplex as a nuclear or biological weapon. As former Customs and Border \nProtection Commissioner Robert Bonner told The New York Times, a single \ncontainer packed with readily available ammonium sulfate fertilizer and \na detonation system could produce ten times the blast that destroyed \nthe Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.\n  Whatever the type of weapon, an attack on one or more U.S. ports \ncould cause great loss of life and large numbers of injuries; it could \ndamage our energy supplies and infrastructure; it could cripple \nretailers and manufacturers dependent on incoming inventory; and it \ncould hamper our ability to move and supply American military forces \nfighting against the forces of terrorism.\n  I have had the opportunity to visit seaports across the country and, \nas one looks at some of the nation's busiest harbors, one sees what a \nterrorist might call ``high-value targets.'' Ferries move thousands of \npeople daily. Large and sprawling urban populations are situated around \nthe ports. At some locations, there are large sports stadiums nearby as \nwell.\n  Add up those factors and one realizes immediately the death and \ndestruction that a ship carrying a container hiding a weapon of mass \ndestruction could inflict at a single port.\n  Of course, a port can be a conduit for an attack as well as a target. \nA container with dangerous cargo could be loaded on a truck or rail \ncar, or have its contents unpacked at the port and distributed to \nsupport attacks elsewhere. In 2008, we saw that the port in Mumbai, \nIndia, offered the means for a gang of terrorists to launch an attack \non a section of the city's downtown. That attack killed more than 170 \npeople and wounded hundreds more.\n  To address these security threats, our bill would reauthorize the \nSAFE Port Act cargo security programs that have proven to be \nsuccessful: the Automated Targeting System that identifies high-risk \ncargo; the Container Security Initiative that ensures high-risk cargo \ncontainers are inspected at ports overseas before they travel to the \nUnited States; and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, or \nC-TPAT, that provides incentives to importers to enhance the security \nof their cargo from point of origin to destination.\n  The bill would also strengthen the C-TPAT program by providing new \nbenefits, including voluntary security training to industry \nparticipants and providing participants an information sharing \nmechanism on maritime and port security threats, and by authorizing \nCustoms and Border Protection to conduct unannounced inspections to \nensure that security practices are robust. The cooperation of private \nindustry is vital to protecting supply chains, and C-TPAT is a \nnecessary tool for securing their active cooperation in supply chain \nsecurity efforts.\n  The bill also would extend the competitive, risk-based, port security \ngrants that have provided $1.5 billion to improve the security of our \nports. An authorization for the next 5 years at $400 million per year \nis a continued major commitment of resources, but it is fully \nproportional to what is at stake, and a priority that we cannot ignore.\n  In addition to continuing and strengthening critical programs, the \nbill also would expand the America's Waterway Watch Program to promote \nvoluntary reporting of suspected terrorist activity or suspicious \nbehavior against a vessel, facility, port, or waterway. While the \nprogram has proven valuable in ports throughout the country, the \nlegislation would broaden its scope and increase public awareness \nthrough boating education and industry stakeholder meetings coordinated \nby the Coast Guard and its Reserve and Auxiliary components. The \nAmerica's Waterway Watch Program has received strong endorsements from \nnumerous professional boating associations for the enhanced situational \nawareness it will bring to our nation's ports and waterways.\n  Our bill would protect citizens from frivolous lawsuits when they \nreport, in good faith, suspicious behavior that may indicate terrorist \nactivity against the United States. It builds on a provision from the \n2007 homeland security law that encourages people to report potential \nterrorist threats directed against transportation systems by protecting \npeople from those who would misuse our legal system in an attempt to \nchill the willingness of citizens to come forward and report possible \ndangers.\n  In addition, this legislation enhances the research and development \nefforts to improve maritime cargo security. The demonstration project \nauthorized by this law would study the feasibility of using composite \nmaterials in cargo containers to improve container integrity and deploy \nnext generation sensors.\n  This legislation also addresses the difficulties in administering the \nmandate of x-raying and scanning for radiation all cargo containers \noverseas that are destined for the United States by July 2012. Until x-\nray scanning technology is proven effective at detecting radiological \nmaterial and not disruptive of trade, requiring the x-raying of all \nU.S. bound cargo, regardless of its risk, at every foreign port, is \nmisguided and provides a false sense of security. It would also impose \nonerous restrictions on the flow of commerce, costing billions with \nlittle additional security benefit.\n  Under the original provisions of the SAFE Port Act, all cargo \ndesignated as high-risk at foreign ports is already scanned for \nradiation and x-rayed. In addition, cargo entering the U.S. at all \nmajor seaports is scanned for radiation. These security measures \ncurrently in place are part of a layered, risk-based method to ensure \ncargo entering the U.S. is safe.\n  This legislation would eliminate the deadline for 100 percent x-\nraying of containers if the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies \nthe effectiveness of individual security measures of that layered \nsecurity approach. This is a more reasonable method to secure our cargo \nuntil a new method of x-raying containers is proven effective.\n  The SAFE Port Reauthorization Act of 2010 will help us to continue an \neffective, layered, coordinated security system that extends from point \nof origin to point of destination, and that covers the people, the \nvessels, the cargo, and the facilities involved in our maritime \ncommerce. It will continue to address a major vulnerability in our \nhomeland security critical infrastructure while preserving the flow of \ngoods on which our economy depends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6307-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6307-S6308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 595--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 12, \n2010, AS ``NATIONAL HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WEEK''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bond, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. \nBurris, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Coburn, \nMr. Cochran, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \nHagan, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Kaufman, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nLeMieux, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. McCain, Mrs.  McCaskill, Mr. \nMenendez, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nVitter, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, and Mr. Wicker) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n[[Page S6308]]\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to continue the \ndiscussion of the erosion of the very important principle of separation \nof powers.\n  Our Constitution was devised with three branches: article I, the \nCongress; article II, the Executive, the President; article III, the \njudiciary. A very important concept in the operation of our \nconstitutional government has been the separation of powers to provide \nchecks and balances.\n  During the course of the past two decades, we have seen a substantial \nerosion of the power of Congress. Congress's authority has been taken \naway in significant measure by the Supreme Court of the United States, \nwhich has, in effect, entered into the legislative process by \ndisregarding the finding of fact that the Congress has undertaken and \nchanged the standard for determining constitutionality of legislation.\n  There had been in effect the rational basis test which had been in \nexistence for decades. But then in 1995, in a case captioned ``United \nStates v. Lopez,'' involving the bringing of guns onto school property, \nthe Supreme Court overturned 60 years of precedent.\n  In the case of United States v. Morrison, when the Congress had \nlegislated to protect women against violence, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, in a 5-to-4 decision--as was the Lopez case, 5 to 4--\ndecided that because of the ``method of reasoning'' of the Congress, \nthe act was unconstitutional, notwithstanding a mountain of evidence, \nas noted by Justice Souter in his dissent.\n  Then in a third case, Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, an age \ndiscrimination case, the Court again undertook to declare an act of \nCongress unconstitutional on a new standard, and the standard is \n``proportionate and congruent,'' which is really a virtual \nimpossibility to understand.\n  This evening, I propose to discuss two other cases: the case of \nAlabama v. Garrett, which interpreted the legislation to protect \nAmericans with disabilities, and the case of Lane v. Tennessee, also to \nprotect people with disabilities.\n  In the case of Alabama v. Garrett, the Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, \ndecided that the legislation was unconstitutional because it did not \nfit this illusive congruent and proportionality test. That was an \nemployment discrimination case.\n  In the case of Lane v. Tennessee, it involved a paraplegic who could \nnot gain access to a courtroom. There was no elevator in the courtroom, \nand he could not walk up the steps. There, the same statute, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act--a voluminous record, hearings held all \nover the United States--by a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States decided that application of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act was constitutional. The shifting vote was the vote of \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. But the standard which was applied was \nthis test of congruence and proportionality. Justice Scalia, in his \ndissenting opinion in that case, said the test was a flabby test which, \nin effect, enabled the court to engage in legislation. This subject of \nthe standard to be applied was a significant concern in the recently \nconcluded hearings for Solicitor General Elena Kagan for the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. We are faced in these confirmation \nhearings, regrettably, with the fact that we can't get answers on \njudicial philosophy or judicial ideology.\n\n  I am not talking about how the case is going to be decided; that is a \nmatter for the Court and, as a matter of judicial independence, that is \nfor the Court to decide. The questions directed to nominees--directed \nto Ms. Kagan and directed to others--have not been about how they would \ndecide a specific case. But in the confirmation hearing with Ms. Kagan, \nif we really couldn't get answers from her, it is hard to see any \nnominee from whom we could get answers in light of the fact that she \nhad written extensively on the nomination procedure in a now famous \nUniversity of Chicago Law Review where she criticized specifically \nJustice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer for stonewalling the Senate and \ncriticized the Senate for not doing its job in getting information. But \nher confirmation proceeding was, in effect, a repeat performance. So we \nare really searching for ways to make a determination as to ideology to \nhave some accountability for what the Justices are doing.\n  In a later floor statement, I will address the separate issue as to \nwhat, if anything, is possible when the nominees do a 180-degree U-\nturn, as Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito did when they decided \nthe case of Citizens United, upsetting 100 years of precedent and a \n100,000-page record in allowing corporations to engage in political \nadvertising.\n  One of the suggestions which has been made following the proceedings \nfor confirmation of Justice Scalia in 1986 where he would answer \nvirtually nothing, Senator DeConcini and I considered a resolution to \nestablish Senate standards. Then, in the next year, Judge Bork answered \na great many questions as he, in fact, had to because he had such an \nextensive paper trail and had such an unusual interpretation of the \nConstitution on original intent. So after the Bork hearings, Senator \nDeConcini and I decided we didn't need to proceed. Perhaps we were too \nprecipitous because the following nominations since Judge Bork in 1986 \nproduced the same result: failure to really answer questions.\n  Another possibility was suggested by later Justice Louis Brandeis in \na famous article he wrote in 1913 talking about sunlight being the best \ndisinfectant and that publicity was the way to deal with society's \nills. That raises the possibility of finding accountability through \ninforming the public as to what is going on. The Supreme Court flies \nunder the radar. It is pretty hard to get an understanding as to what \nis going on.\n  A noted commentator on the Supreme Court, Stuart Taylor, has made a \ncomment that the way to get accountability is to infuriate the public. \nThat was his standard. He said until the public is infuriated, the \nSupreme Court will be able to continue to take power from the other \nbranches of government and, most importantly, from my point of view, \ninstitutionally from the Senate of the United States and from the House \nof Representatives, in some cases where they leave the Executive with \nextensive authority. By refusing to decide a case, as they refused to \ndecide the conflict between the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nwhich is the congressional determination that the only way to get a \nwarrantless wiretap is through a court order showing the probable cause \nand the President's assertion of article II power as Commander in Chief \nor the court's refusal to take up the issue of the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunities Act\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\nwhen lawsuits were brought by survivors of 9/11. Those are subjects I \nwill discuss at a later time. The hour grows late this evening.\n  But these are issues which we have to grapple with because the \ndoctrine of separation of powers is so important and, institutionally, \nthe Congress ought to be assertive of our authority, when the authority \nis taken to the Court, which, in effect, is legislation illustrated by \nthe two cases, the Garrett case and the Lane case, which I have \ndiscussed--same standard, congruency and proportionality--we can't get \nan answer from Ms. Kagan as to what standard she would apply, whether \nit would be the rational basis test which had been in effect until the \nBoerne case in 1997; not asking her how she would decide a case but \nwhat standard she would apply.\n  So these are issues I think that have to be very carefully considered \nby the Congress.\n  I have been speaking on the issue of televising the Court for a \ncouple of decades now, and I tend to continue to acquaint the public as \nbest we can through C-SPAN, through this medium. But if the public knew \nwhat was happening, I think we might meet the standard of Stuart Taylor \non an infuriated public. I think it will take public concern to provide \nsome accountability to restore the important balance on separation of \npowers.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank the staff for staying extra, and I yield \nthe floor. I believe that is the curtain for the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/27/senate-section/article/S6343-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
