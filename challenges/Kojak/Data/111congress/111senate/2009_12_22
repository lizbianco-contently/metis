Under the previous order, the time \nuntil expiration of cloture on amendment No. 3276 shall be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will be taking the leader time on \nour side. How much time is there?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today we are taking another step toward passing a bill \nthat has not seen the light of day for very long. It is a bill that is \ngoing to change health care policy in this country forever if it is \nfinally coming to enactment. It will take effect in 2014. The reason we \nare talking about this bill and trying to let people know what is in it \nis because we hope there is still a chance this bill will not become \nlaw.\n  This bill was drafted behind closed doors without Republican input. \nThe votes are 60 to 40. Sixty Democrats and 40 Republicans make up the \nSenate, and that is what is providing cloture on this bill.\n  This bill increases taxes by over $\\1/2\\ trillion over a 10-year \nperiod--that is over $500 billion--and $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to \nMedicare. This is a time when we should not be increasing taxes. Small \nbusinesses are burdened already. This adds to their burden. Families \nare trying to make ends meet. They are trying to pay their mortgage so \nthey will not be thrown out of their homes. They are trying to pay \ntheir bills. They are trying to find jobs in the highest level of \nunemployment in our country since World War II, and we are going to \nheap taxes and burdens on them starting as early as next year--in 2 \nweeks. This is not a time to raise taxes. We don't need a tax burden \nincrease, we don't need Medicare cuts, and we do need health care \nreform that would lower the cost of health care. This is going to do \nthe opposite. We are going to increase taxes and lower the service for \nMedicare in our country.\n  I remember reading some of the history and the anecdotes about the \nvote on the constitutional amendment to allow women the right to vote. \nThere was a Congressman from Tennessee who was wavering. He said what \nfinally made up his mind--and he was the Congressman who made the \ndifference--was that his mother wrote him a letter and said: Vote for \nratification.\n\n  What is going to be said about this bill that changes health care \npolicy for every American? What is going to be written about how the \nvotes were brought together to have a bill that would tax our American \npeople $\\1/2\\ trillion and take Medicare as the pay-for for this \nprogram is that there will be essential protection for seniors in \nFlorida and New York to prevent them from suffering the cuts to \nMedicare Advantage but no other State. Insurance companies in only two \nStates, Nebraska and Michigan, are exempt from the taxes that will take \neffect on insurance companies, raising the premiums for every insured \nperson in this country. Changes to the language restricting physician \nownership of medical facilities appear only to benefit a single medical \ncenter in Nebraska, and additional Federal payments to Louisiana, \nMassachusetts, Nebraska, and Vermont to expand Medicaid will cost \ntaxpayers in every other State in America over $1 billion. This is part \nof the deal that was brokered to make sure 60 votes would pass this \nbill. The people of Nebraska will never pay a dime for Medicaid \nincreases, whereas my State of Texas will carry a new burden of over $9 \nbillion, and every other State in America will eventually take the \nburden of the Medicaid increases but not Nebraska, not ever. Even the \nGovernor of Nebraska has said he does not think that is fair.\n  So I think we can do better. We can do better in this country than \nhaving the history of the overhaul of our health care system that is \ngoing to affect the quality of life and the tax burden on every \nAmerican. I think we should have a better history.\n  So I am asking my colleagues to think about this vote. We could \nchange one vote, one person who says: I don't\n\n[[Page S13715]]\n\nwant the Senate to do something this way. I want the Senate to rise to \nthe level that we know has been the tradition of this Senate for all of \nthe years of our Republic, and that is that we would have an open, \ntransparent process; that we would have bipartisan input; that a \nRepublican amendment--one might have passed; that what we offer is what \nwe promised the American people: lower costs in health care----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.--and a way for people to have more affordable access.\n  We still have a chance. That is why we are here today. And I hope we \ncan turn away from this process and share the light of day with our \ncolleagues and with America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The deputy majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a famous Washington figure once wrote a \nbook entitled ``Slouching Towards Gomorrah.'' If you were to describe \nwhat is happening in the Senate procedurally, we would call it lurching \ntoward cloture. The cloture rules in the Senate require 30 hours \nbetween votes, and as a consequence we find ourselves in the early \nmorning hours trying to finish this bill before the Christmas holiday, \nand it calls for the Senate to convene at extraordinary times, as we \ndid this morning, but it is for a good purpose.\n  This is to bring to a close a debate which has gone on for more than \n3 weeks. You have noticed more and more Republican Senators now coming \nto the floor with ideas and amendments, and the obvious question we \nhave to ask is, Where have you been? For the first 21 days of debate on \nthis bill, the Republicans offered four substantive amendments. They \noffered six motions to take the bill off the floor, send it back to \ncommittee, and quit the deliberations, but only four substantive \namendments. Now they say they are just brimming with all of these \nnotions and ideas that can improve this bill. They had the chance. In \nfact, they had more than a chance. They were invited into this process \nearly on.\n  I would say to the Senator from Texas, she knows that 3 of her \ncolleagues met over 61 times with their Democratic counterparts trying \nto come up with a bipartisan approach, and they couldn't. We also know \nthat in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the \nRepublicans came and engaged in more than 50 days of deliberations in \nthat committee and offered and had accepted more than 150 Republican \namendments to this bill. We were not excluding Republicans from the \nprocess; they excluded themselves. When it came time for a final vote \nin the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, not a single \nRepublican Senator would vote for it. Senator Coburn of Oklahoma \noffered and had accepted 38 amendments to this bill and wouldn't vote \nfor it. Other Senators were the same. They had their chance, and they \ndidn't use their chance. In fact, the record shows now that after \nalmost a year of deliberations, we have one Republican Congressman from \nNew Orleans, LA, who voted for the House health care reform \nproposal, and one Republican Senator, Ms. Snowe of Maine, who voted for \nthe Finance Committee proposal. To say the Republicans have been \nactively engaged in this process is a misstatement.\n\n  Here is why we have to go forward, even if we have to meet at 7 in \nthe morning or even if we have to meet this Christmas week. When this \nbill is passed, we know from the CBO several things will occur. First, \n30 million Americans who currently don't have health insurance will \nhave the peace of mind of knowing they have health insurance. Secondly, \nwe know 94 percent of the American people will finally be insured--the \nhighest percentage in the history of the United States. We know the \nrates for health insurance premiums will start to come down, as they \nmust, so businesses and individuals can afford it. We know that, \nfinally, consumers across America will be able to stand and fight back \nwhen health insurance companies turn them down in their moments of \nneed.\n  We say in this new amendment we are going to say to health insurance \ncompanies: You cannot deny coverage to anybody under 18, any child, for \na preexisting condition. That is going to bring peace of mind to \nmillions of American families who understand that without this they \ncouldn't get the health insurance they absolutely need for their \nchildren.\n  Let me address quickly this notion that this is somehow a mystery \namendment. This amendment has now been before the American public for \nat least 70 hours on the Internet. The bill itself has been before the \nAmerican public now for more than 3 weeks on the Internet. You can find \nit not only on the Democratic Senate Web site, you can find it on the \nRepublican Web site. They put our bill on their Web site because they \ndon't have a comprehensive health care reform bill. They put ours up \nfor people to read. There has been ample opportunity for people to \nread, dissect, and to be critical of it and raise questions about it. \nBefore our final vote, America will have had its chance to read and \nunderstand the import of this effort and this effort is substantial.\n  This is something we have built up to for decades. To finally put the \nSenate on record as to whether we are endorsing the current health care \nsystem in America that is unaffordable, discriminates against people, \nand leaves so many behind, a system that currently rations care and \nsays to 50 million Americans you have no coverage, and to millions of \nothers that you have coverage that will not be there when you need it--\nwe have to bring that to an end.\n  As Senator Harkin said the other day in closing the debate, this is a \nreal debate over whether health care will be a right or a privilege in \nAmerica. If you believe it is a privilege for those who are wealthy and \nwell off, then, of course, you will vote against this. If you believe \nit is a right that should be extended to more Americans, I hope you \nwill join us in supporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Forty seconds remain.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 3278, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, it is my understanding--Senator McConnell \nand I have agreed--I should not say I understand--we have agreed that \nthe time until 9:30 will be equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders, and at 9:30 we will go, as we have worked in recent days, \ninto having blocks of time until our caucuses, until 12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is correct. Under the \nprevious order, until 9:30 the time is equally divided and controlled \nbetween the leaders or their designees, and under the previous order \nthe time until 5:30 today will be divided into 1-hour alternating \nblocks of time, the majority controlling the first block.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask everyone to acknowledge that we have \nour regular weekly caucuses at 12:30. We will come back at 2:30, and we \nwill be going back to blocks of time until 5:30 this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I said when the Senate opened today and I \nwill say again, because of the long hours we have spent here for weeks \nnow, there is a lot of tension in the Senate. Feelings are high, and \nthat is fine. Everybody has very strong concerns about everything we \nhave done and have to do. But I hope everyone would go back to their \ngentlemanly ways. I was trying to figure out how to say this--\ngentlemanly ways. We used to say in the House gentlewomen, so I guess \nit is the same here.\n  Anyway I hope everyone has--I have said to a number of people--Rodney \nKing--let's all just try to get along. That is the only way; we need to \ndo it. This is a very difficult time in the next day or so. Let's try \nto work through this.\n  For those of the Christian faith we have the most important holiday, \nand that is Christmas.\n\n[[Page S13717]]\n\n  I would hope everyone would keep in mind that this is a time when we \nreflect on peace and the good things in life. I would hope everyone \nwould kind of set aside all the personal animosity, if they have any in \nthe next little bit, and focus on the holiday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add, to my good friend the \nmajority leader, he and I have an excellent relationship. We speak a \nnumber of times in the course of every day and have no animosity \nwhatsoever. We are working on an agreement that will give certainty to \nthe way to end this session. Hopefully, the two of us together can be \nrecommending something that makes sense for both sides in the not-too-\ndistant future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 9:30 is equally divided between \nthe leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it has been more than a month since the \nmajority leader moved to proceed to the health care reform bill before \nus today. At long last, the Senate is now in the final throes of \npassing this historic legislation.\n  From the beginning, this Senator has sought out what Abraham Lincoln \ncalled ``the better angels of our nature.'' That is the way this \nSenator has always sought to legislate.\n  A year and a half ago, I convened a bipartisan retreat at the Library \nof Congress. Half a year ago, I convened three bipartisan roundtables \nwith health care experts. Half a year ago, the Finance Committee \nconducted three bipartisan walk-throughs of the major concepts behind \nthe bill before us today.\n  We went the extra mile. I reached out to my good friend, the ranking \nRepublican member of the Finance Committee. I reached out to the \nranking Republican member of the HELP Committee.\n  We sought to craft a bill that would appeal to the broad middle. We \nsought to craft a bill that could win the support of Republicans and \nDemocrats alike.\n  We met, a group of six of us, three Democrats and three Republicans. \nWe met more than 30 times. We met for months, encouraged by the \nPresident to do so. Our group met with the President several times. The \nPresident encouraged us to keep pursuing our negotiations, hoping to \nreach bipartisan agreements.\n  No, we did not reach a formal agreement. The leadership on the other \nside of the aisle went to great lengths to stop us from doing so.\n  But even though we did not reach a formal agreement, we came very \nclose to doing so. The principles that we discussed are very much the \nprinciples upon which the Finance Committee built its bill. The \nprinciples that we discussed are very much the principles reflected in \nthe bill before us today. Our work began much earlier than I have \nindicated. We met all the preceding year, held about ten hearings in \nthe Finance Committee working toward health care reform. We also \nfinished a white paper in November 2008. I say with trepidation that \nbasically that is the foundation from which almost all ideas in health \ncare reform emanated. To be fair, the ideas in that paper had been \nfloating around, principles from the Massachusetts health care reform, \nfor example. Most policy experts and health care economists who had \nbeen working on reform published their ideas. We sought the best, \ncompiled them, and put together that white paper published in November \nof last year.\n  From the debate that the Senate has conducted this past month, you \nwould not know it. During this debate, some on the other side of the \naisle have mischaracterized the bill before us. Some on the other side \nof the aisle have set about a systematic campaign to demonize this \nbill.\n  Through bare assertion alone, with the thinnest connection to fact, \nthey have sought to vilify our work. If one listened to their \nassertions alone, one would not recognize the bill before us.\n  And so, let me, quite simply, state the facts.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle assert that this bill is a \ngovernment takeover of health care.\n  The fact is that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says \nthat this bill would reduce the government's fiscal role in health \ncare. Just 3 days ago, CBO wrote, and I quote:\n\n       CBO expects that the proposal would generate a reduction in \n     the federal budgetary commitment to health care during the \n     decade following the 10-year budget window.\n\n  Some on the other side of the aisle assert that this bill would add \nto our Nation's burden of debt.\n  The fact is that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says \nthat this bill would reduce the deficit by $132 billion in the first 10 \nyears and by between $650 billion and $1.3 trillion in the second 10 \nyears. The fact is that this is the most serious deficit reduction \neffort in more than a decade.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle assert that this bill would harm \nMedicare.\n  The fact is that Medicare's independent actuary says that this bill \nwould extend the life of Medicare by 9 years. The fact is that this is \nthe most responsible effort to shore up Medicare in more than a decade.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle assert that this bill does not do \nenough to ensure the uninsured.\n  The fact is that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says \nthat this bill would extend access to health care to 31 million \nAmericans who otherwise would have to go without. The fact is that CBO \nsays, and I quote:\n\n       The share of legal nonelderly residents with insurance \n     coverage would rise from about 83 percent currently to about \n     94 percent.\n\n  Nothing that Senators on the other side of the aisle have proposed \nwould come close. CBO estimated that the Republican substitute offered \nin the House of Representatives would have extended coverage to just 3 \nmillion people. The fact is that CBO says of that plan, and I quote:\n\n       The share of legal nonelderly residents with insurance \n     coverage in 2019 would be about 83 percent, roughly in line \n     with the current share.\n\n  I would cite the facts about the Republican substitute in the Senate. \nBut the fact is that there is no Republican substitute.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle assert that they simply prefer a \nmore modest reform of health care.\n  The fact is that the Republicans controlled the Senate from 1995 to \n2001 and from 2003 to 2006. The fact is that before they took control, \nin 1994, 36 million Americans, 15.8 percent of nonelderly Americans \nwere without health insurance coverage. In the last year of their \ncontrol, in 2006, nearly 47 million Americans, 17.8 percent of non-\nelderly Americans were without health insurance coverage. The legacy of \nRepublican control was 10 million more Americans uninsured.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle say that we are moving too fast.\n  The fact is that it was 1912, when former President Theodore \nRoosevelt first made national health insurance part of the Progressive \nParty's campaign platform. The fact is that people of good will have \nbeen working at this for nearly a century.\n  The fact is, health care reform for America is now within reach. The \nfact is, the most serious effort to control health care costs is now \nwithin reach. The fact is, life-saving health care coverage for 31 \nmillion Americans is now within reach.\n  Let us, at long last, grasp that result. Let us, this time, not let \nthis good thing slip through our hands. And let us, at long last, enact \nhealth care reform for all.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, are we now in a period where we go \nback and forth without limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask to be notified after 5 minutes, \nafter\n\n[[Page S13718]]\n\nwhich Senator Vitter is going to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have talked a lot about what is in \nthis bill, the massive tax increases, the massive cuts in Medicare. But \nthere is another issue I think, looking down the road, we are going to \nneed to pursue. We have talked about how groundbreaking this bill is. \nIn fact, the majority calls it historic, and it is historic. We believe \nit is historic in the bad precedents it is setting, both in process and \nin substance. I think some of these precedents are going to be tested \nunder the Constitution of the United States.\n  I wish to start by talking about a couple of those. No. 1, in the \neffort to get the last vote, clearly there were deals made. There were \ndeals that affect individual States and even one that affects two \ninsurance companies that will have a different treatment from all the \nother insurance companies in America. It is said there will be two \nNebraska insurance companies that will not have to pay the tax \nincreases of the insurance companies that will be levied on all the \nother health insurance companies. This is an issue that must be raised \nunder the Constitution, the equal protection clause of the \nConstitution. To take a set of companies in an industry, competitors--\nand we value the free market system and the free enterprise system--to \npluck out two competitors and say: You will be treated differently \nbecause we need your vote to pass this bill should be tested under the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  It is my hope some insurance company that has standing to bring this \nsuit will be able to test this precedent. It is a very bad precedent, \nand it is certainly bad policy to start passing laws that distinguish \nsome parts of an industry versus other parts of an industry that would \nbe treated in a different way. I hope we will do that.\n  No. 2, I believe there is a 10th amendment issue. Here is my concern. \nMany States, including my State of Texas, have self-insurance plans for \nState employees. States with large numbers of State employees find that \nself-insurance is a better way to go than private insurance programs. \nIn this bill, every insurance company that plans to increase its \npremiums must get approval from the Department of Health and Human \nServices first.\n  Now, my State of Texas, with its self-insurance plan, then, has to go \nto the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ask permission to \nincrease the premiums on their State self-insured insurance plan. That \nis a violation of the 10th amendment, as I see it.\n  I am very concerned that a State that has State employees who accept \na self-insurance plan would then be able to be told by the Federal \nGovernment that they cannot increase their premiums to cover the cost \nand keep the sound system that they have in place.\n  Now, other States have self-insurance plans, so I believe they would \nalso be very affected by this, and I believe there will be a standing \nfor a State with this type of plan to be able to challenge this part of \nthis bill and, hopefully, bring it down if it is a violation of the \n10th amendment.\n  I want to talk about another area that I think is a stretch in this \nbill; that is, apparently the individual mandate is being justified by \nthe commerce clause of our Constitution. Now, the commerce clause \nbasically says no State may impede interstate commerce. You may say, \nout in America: I don't see the connection. I am going to be mandated \nto buy health insurance or be fined if I don't because States cannot \nimpede interstate commerce?\n  Well, I would agree with people out there that seems like a \ndisconnect because, apparently, using the commerce clause, the majority \nis saying the Federal Government has the right to manage insurance, and \nthat a requirement of an individual mandate is part of the Federal \ncapability to manage insurance in this country, and you cannot impede \nthat right by the Federal Government because you cannot impede \ninterstate commerce.\n  I think this whole individual mandate issue is going to be a center \nfor discussion, debate, and opposition to the bill that is clearly \nmoving down a track that we are trying to stop, but that train is \nmoving. I think we are going to have to talk about the individual \nmandate. People are saying to me: How can the Federal Government tell \nme I have to buy insurance? I think they have a point.\n  You have to buy automobile insurance because, but that comes with the \nright to drive. So you get the right, licensed by the State, to drive \nyour car, and in exchange for that a State may require that you have \ncollision insurance on your automobile, and many States do. But when \nyou say you have to buy an insurance policy, I think that crosses a \nline where a person has a right to say: I am not going to buy insurance \nif I guarantee that I am not going to be a burden to the Federal \nGovernment or to the State government or to any other taxpayer. I think \nyou should have that right, but that is not the way this bill is \nwritten.\n  The bill is a Federal mandate that every person in America has to \nhave health insurance or be fined if they do not. So at least if we \nwere going to write such a provision, to keep the right of an \nindividual not to have a mandate under the commerce clause of the \nConstitution, at least you ought to say that a person would have to \nsign something that says: I will give you a promissory note if I do not \nchoose to buy insurance. But that is not the way this bill is written.\n  So I think this, along with the State mandate on Medicaid--which, \nagain, I think is an equal protection issue, and maybe that is a \nstretch--but that one State will not have to ever pay the State's share \nof the increase in Medicaid that is in this bill but the other 49 \nStates in America will is certainly a violation of our responsibility \nto treat all States equally or to have formulas that have some ability \nto say there is a standard that has been set that should prevail. But \nnot in this bill.\n  My State of Texas will have almost a $10 billion increase in its \nState's share of Medicaid because of the expansion in this bill. But \nthere are States that are exempted from the increases and one State \nthat is exempted forever because of a deal made to get that 60th vote \nto pass this bill.\n  I think people are looking at this issue in America today and saying: \nWhat has gotten into the people in Congress who are voting for this \nbill?\n  So, Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair apologizes. The Chair did not notify \nthe Senator at 5 minutes. The Chair forgot. The Senator's 5 minutes has \npassed.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, thank you for the notification.\n  I think there are issues now that will be raised going forward in the \nfuture, and there is still time for one Senator in the 60 to change the \nvote. Therefore, I hope one will hear from his or her constituents \nenough that that person will say: It is time to slow this bill down. I \nam going to change my vote so people can see all the effects that we \nhave not talked about yet, and let's do this right.\n  We can lower the cost of health care, we can provide more access to \nmore people to have health care coverage, which should be the goal of \nthis legislation, this massive reform of a health care system that is \nworking for many and has provided the best quality of health care in \nthe world. We have a chance to keep it by slowing this bill down. That \nis why we are fighting. That is why we are still here talking 3 days \nbefore Christmas. We want to stop this bill and do it right. Doing it \nright is more important than doing it fast, and I think the American \npeople believe that too.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, how much time remains on the minority side \nbefore 9:30 a.m.?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 24 minutes remaining on the minority \nside.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, since this latest version of comprehensive health care \nreform was unveiled a few days ago--a 2,733-page bill--I have been \nlooking at it very carefully, particularly, of course, with the \nLouisiana perspective, and I want to share my strong concerns with that \nLouisiana perspective with my colleagues today.\n  Of course, we have all heard this Senate health care reform bill \nreferred to\n\n[[Page S13719]]\n\nas the ``Louisiana purchase'' because of the special $300 million \nprovision in it related to our Medicaid match rate.\n  Quite frankly, I do not much like that nickname for two reasons. \nFirst of all, the fact that we in Louisiana have to pay a higher \nMedicaid match rate under present law because of the hurricanes is a \nreal inequity, which I support fixing. It is a shame the merits of that \nfix, which are very real, have been completely lost in this debate \nbecause of the way this Louisiana fix has been used and abused, quite \nfrankly, in trying to pass this megabill.\n  But, secondly, I do not like the phrase because it suggests that \nLouisiana in general would fare very well under the bill overall, and \nnothing could be further from the truth. This bill overall sells \nLouisiana short. It sells Louisiana out. In fact, rather than the \n``Louisiana purchase,'' I think the bill could be very accurately \ncalled the ``Louisiana sellout.''\n  What are those costs and those serious problems for Louisiana I am \ntalking about?\n  Let's start with Medicaid, the program for the poor. Let's start with \nthat $300 million fix. It is certainly true that fix is there--a $300 \nmillion benefit to the State under our Medicaid Program--but that is \nnot all of the picture. It is not even all of the Medicaid picture \nbecause besides that fix, in the bill overall there is a dramatic \nexpansion of Medicaid--a huge expansion--and the Louisiana State \ngovernment and Louisiana taxpayers have to help pay for that expansion. \nThat extra cost to the State government, to the State taxpayer, is way \nmore than the $300 million benefit.\n  By very conservative estimates by the Louisiana Department of Health \nand Hospitals, it is at least $1.3 billion over 10 years of full \nimplementation. So, sure, a $300 million benefit but, at least, \nminimum, a $1.3 billion cost--extra cost--to the State.\n  Now, three things are important about these figures. One is obvious: \n$300 million is a whole lot less than $1.3 billion. But, secondly, this \n$1.3 billion over 10 years of full implementation is a very \nconservative estimate from the Louisiana Department of Health and \nHospitals. And, No. 3, while this money, the $300 million, is one time, \nthis other goes on forever. This $1.3 billion is the first decade cost, \nbut it goes on forever from there; and every 10 years, this grows and \nis repeated.\n  So what does that mean? That means in the first 10 years of full \nimplementation, the net impact on the State is very negative, at least \n$1 billion, and it goes on from there.\n  I am very concerned about a lot of other groups in Louisiana, not \njust the State government and State budget. I am particularly concerned \nabout Louisiana seniors. Of course, Louisiana seniors, like seniors \neverywhere, depend on Medicare. They have paid into it their whole \nlives. This bill--it is a simple fact; it is confirmed by the \nCongressional Budget Office, nonpartisan--this bill cuts Medicare $466 \nbillion. Medicare now is already facing insolvency by 2017. So instead \nof fixing that in a real way, the bill steals almost $\\1/2\\ trillion \nfrom Medicare and uses it not within Medicare but to help pay for a \nbrand-new entitlement.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. I will not at this time. I will be happy to yield after \nmy presentation.\n  That means real cuts in terms of hospitals, home and hospice, nursing \nhomes, and Medicare Advantage. There are over 151,000 Louisiana seniors \non Medicare Advantage. They are going to be particularly hard hit. They \nlike that choice now. They will not have that choice as it exists now \nunder this bill.\n  How about Louisiana taxpayers? I am also very concerned about \nLouisiana taxpayers. Again, according to the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, the bill contains $518 billion of tax increases \nnationwide--over $\\1/2\\ trillion of tax increases. As for that oft \nrepeated promise that no one who earns under $200,000 will be affected, \nwell, again, think again. The Joint Committee on Taxation--\nnonpartisan--has said 42.1 million Americans earning below $200,000 \nwill get a tax increase over the next several years--42.1 million. That \nmeans hundreds of thousands of Louisiana taxpayers will be hit, will \nget a tax increase--I am talking about folks who earn well below \n$200,000--will also pay more in the form of higher insurance premiums \nbecause, again, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said \nthis bill increases overall health care costs. It does not decrease \nthose costs.\n  Well, what about Louisiana small businesses? Surely, this bill \nprotects them in the midst of this serious recession. Well, not \nexactly. The biggest impact on businesses is a brandnew mandate in the \nbill. Most businesses have to either provide a government-defined \nhealth insurance benefit or they have to pay a new tax to the \ngovernment. NFIB, the National Federation of Small Business, says that \nis going to cost the Nation 1.6 million jobs. Translated to Louisiana, \nthat is tens of thousands of additional lost jobs on top of our current \nhigh unemployment. Again, we are in the middle of a serious recession. \nThis will cost us jobs on top of that.\n  There is also another big problem, which is an incentive for \nbusinesses to drop coverage. I mentioned that brandnew mandate: Either \nyou provide a government-defined health benefit or you pay a new tax to \nthe Federal Government. The other problem with that is, for a lot of \nbusiness, it is going to be cheaper to drop coverage and pay the new \ntax. So many employees who have coverage now that they are reasonably \nsatisfied with are going to lose it, and that is a big concern as well.\n  Just for good measure, the bill forces pro-life taxpayers to, in many \nvery meaningful ways, subsidize abortion. Louisiana is one of the most \nproudly pro-life States in the Nation, so that is particularly \noffensive. Everyone who cares about life, who has followed this issue, \nwhether it is the Catholic Bishops, National Right to Life, and other \norganizations have said, clearly, the language in this bill doesn't \nprotect against taxpayer-funded abortion. The language in this bill \ndoes not honor the Hyde amendment, which has been Federal law since \n1977. The language in this bill crosses an important line, does not \noffer the conscience protections we have depended on for years. So this \nsets radical new precedent in terms of taxpayer and Federal Government \nsupport of abortion. That is a big Louisiana concern as well.\n  So what do we have? We have a 2,733-page bill, mega health care \nreform, with all these very serious problems for Louisiana and \nimportant Louisiana groups and important Louisiana citizens, including \nseniors, small business, taxpayers, and the State budget, which is \nalready facing serious cuts and challenges.\n  If we want to put Louisiana first considering all these costs, we \nhave to say no to this bill. If we want to put America first \nconsidering all these unsustainable costs, we have to say no to this \nbill. But we can and we should say yes to the right kind of health care \nreform. This isn't a debate about yes or no, health care reform or not; \nthis is a debate about what the right kind of health care reform is.\n  To me, we need to start over with that right kind of reform. To me, \nthat would mean something such as starting by passing five bills. Each \none doesn't need to be longer than 25 pages. Each one would be focused \nlike a laser beam on a real problem that affects real Louisianans, real \nAmericans, offering a real, concrete, focused solution. My five bills \nwould be this: Cover preexisting conditions. That is a real problem in \nLouisiana. That is a real problem in America. Let's have a focused bill \nthat does that.\n  Secondly, allow buying insurance across State lines. That would \ndramatically expand competition in the marketplace. That would lower \npremiums. That would give all folks wanting health insurance \ndramatically decreased costs than they have now.\n  Third: Let's do something real about prescription drug prices. Let's \nnot sell out to PhRMA and cut a special deal with the pharmaceutical \nindustry, as the White House has. Let's pass reimportation and pass \nreal generics reform.\n  Fourth: Let's pass tort reform and take all that unnecessary cost out \nof the system. That doesn't provide better health care for anyone. It \ndoesn't do anything positive for anyone except wealthy trial lawyers. \nLet's pass tort reform.\n  And fifth: Let's allow small business to pool across State lines to \nform larger pools of insurance across State lines\n\n[[Page S13720]]\n\nand gain from that extra buying power. Why shouldn't a restaurant in \nBaton Rouge that may only have seven or eight people to cover in health \ninsurance, why shouldn't they be able to pool through the National \nRestaurant Association, create a pool of millions nationwide and enjoy \nthe same buying power Apple Computers or Toyota has and get the same \nbenefit in the insurance marketplace through that increased buying \npower and increased competition?\n  So I urge all my colleagues to put their State first and vote no, to \nput our Nation first and vote no, and to start anew with the right sort \nof focused reform as I have outlined.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I just have a couple statements to make, \npoints to make, in view of the last statement, to correct some \nmisimpressions given by the last statement.\n  The last speaker said Medicare cuts apply and this is going to cut \nMedicare. The fact is--I wish the previous speaker would stay on the \nfloor, but he is fleeing the floor because he knows I am going to \nmention facts in total refutation to the assertions he is making. He \nleaves the floor. He will not stay with me to talk about what is going \non. He makes statements that are misrepresentations and then he leaves \nthe floor.\n  Let me talk about some of the things he said which are incorrect. \nOne, he basically says Medicare is going to be hurt by these huge cuts \nto Medicare. The fact is, we are helping the Medicare trust fund with \nthis legislation. The fact is, the Chief Actuary at HHS has said this \nlegislation before us will increase the solvency of the Medicare trust \nfund another 9 years. That is a fact.\n  Second, he is trying to say there are a lot of big tax increases \nhere. He is trying to direct the public away from what the fact is. The \nfact is, the Joint Committee on Taxation says there are $436 billion of \ntax cuts in this legislation, reductions in taxes; $436 billion in tax \ncuts in the form of tax credits for people who purchase insurance in \nthe exchange. It is a tax cut of $436 billion of tax cuts in the \nexchange. I might say $40 billion of that is small business tax cuts. \nThey are not increases, they are tax cuts for small business and the \ntax cuts for individuals is $436 billion.\n  Frankly, I wish I had a lot of the data before me. I don't have it \nright now to refute other points he made. He talked about premiums \ngoing up. The Congressional Budget Office basically says 93 percent of \nAmericans will find their premiums will come down because of this \nlegislation, and for a certain class of individuals--those in the \nindividual market and the small group market will get very significant \nreductions in premiums on account of this bill.\n  It irritates me, frankly, when Senators come to the floor and make \nall these misstatements and they are not based at all on fact.\n  In fact, what we need to do around here is get more and more \ninstitutions to objectively analyze policy so we know what the facts \nare. It is pretty hard to argue the facts. The CBO does a pretty good \njob. The Joint Committee on Taxation does a pretty good job. But if \nsomehow this country could turn to an organization or organizations to \nfind the facts--just the facts--I think it would help a little bit \nbecause it is hard to argue the facts. If you have good facts, you \ngenerally can create good policy.\n  Back to premiums. CBO says 93 percent of premiums go down. Actually, \nfor about five-sixths of those insured--that is, those who work for \nlarger companies, it is called the large group markets--premiums will \ngo down not a lot but a little. According to CBO, it is up to a 3-\npercent reduction in premiums. They look at the year 2016 as a \nbenchmark year, so CBO says that for those, about 70 percent of \nAmericans who work for large markets, premiums will actually go down 3 \npercent.\n  What about 13 percent of Americans who work for small groups, small \ncompanies? Basically, CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation say those \ncould go up 1 percentage point as well as down 2 percentage points. It \nis about even. It is difficult to tell. But those who get credits in \nthe small group market will find their premiums down by about 8 to 11 \npercent. Those who work for small companies will find their premiums go \ndown 8 to 11 percent.\n\n  What about the nongroup market--individuals. Well, basically, if you \ncompare today's insurance premiums with what it might be in the future, \nthe premiums will go down 14 to 20 percent, but because of better \nbenefits, premiums could go up 10 to 13 percent for 7 percent of \nAmericans. As I mentioned earlier, 93 percent will find their premiums \ngo down. For 7 percent they will go up, but for those 7 percent, they \nare going to have a lot better coverage, a lot better insurance in \n2016. All the insurance market reforms will have kicked in: denial of \npreexisting conditions, market status, health status and so on and so \nforth.\n  Get this: For the nongroup market, 17 percent of Americans who buy \ninsurance through the nongroup market, 10 percent of that 17 percent, \nbecause of tax credits, will find their premiums go down by--guess how \nmuch--56 to 59 percent. Once more: 17 percent of Americans buy \ninsurance individually. Of those 17 percent, 10 percent of them will \nfind their premiums will be reduced 56 to 59 percent. That is according \nto the Joint Committee on Taxation. Only one small group, according to \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, will find an increase in 2016. That is \n7 percent of Americans in 2016, but that will be compensated with a lot \nbetter insurance, high-quality insurance. No more rescissions. No more \ndenial based on preexisting conditions. The rating reforms will have \nkicked in and the annual limits, the lifetime limits will have been \nrepealed. It will be a heck of a lot better insurance. So maybe their \npremiums will go up a little bit, but they will get a heck of a lot \nbetter buy for what they are getting. It is similar to buying a new car \ninstead of a used car--hopefully, a good new car. All in all, in a very \nreal sense, all Americans are going to find his or her premiums will go \ndown. Seven percent will find them go up a little bit, but they will \nget a heck of a lot better insurance for the premiums they will be \npaying.\n  The previous speaker is wrong when he says it will increase premiums. \nThe Joint Committee on Taxation says it will not. I didn't hear him \nquote the Joint Committee on Taxation saying premiums will go up. If \nyou look at the actual analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nthey find the premiums will go down.\n  Seeing nobody who wishes to speak, I wish to address the question of \nthe constitutionality of the individual mandate. Let me read into the \nRecord an analysis by Mark Hall, prepared by the O'Neill Institute. \nBasically, he says the following:\n\n       Health insurance mandates have been a component of many \n     recent health care reform proposals. Because a Federal \n     requirement that individuals transfer money to a private \n     party is unprecedented, a number of legal issues must be \n     examined. This paper analyzes whether Congress can legislate \n     a health insurance mandate and the potential legal challenges \n     that might arise given such a mandate. The analysis of legal \n     challenges to health insurance mandates applies to federal \n     individual mandates, but can also apply to a federal mandate \n     requiring employers to purchase health insurance for their \n     employees. There are no constitutional barriers for Congress \n     to legislate a health insurance mandate as long as the \n     mandate is properly designed and executed as discussed below. \n     This paper also considers the likelihood of any change in the \n     current judicial approach to these legal questions.\n       Potential solutions. Congress's Authority to Regulate \n     Commerce: The federal government has the authority to \n     legislate a health insurance mandate under the Commerce \n     Clause of the United States Constitution. A federal mandate \n     to purchase health insurance is well within the breadth of \n     Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. Congress \n     can avoid legal challenges related to the 10th Amendment and \n     states' rights by preempting state insurance laws and \n     implementing the mandate on a Federal level. If Congress \n     wants states to implement a federal mandate, it has the \n     following two options:\n       Conditional Spending: Congress may condition federal \n     funding, such as that for Medicaid or public health, on state \n     compliance with federal initiatives. Conditional Preemption: \n     Congress may allow states to opt out of complying with direct \n     federal regulation as long as states implement a similar \n     regulation that meets Federal requirements.\n       Congress's Authority to Tax and Spend for the General \n     Welfare: Congress also has the authority to legislate a \n     health insurance mandate under its Constitutional authority \n     to tax and spend.\n       There are no plausible Tenth Amendment and states' rights \n     issues arising from Congress's taxing and spending power. \n     However, Congress's taxation power cannot be\n\n[[Page S13721]]\n\n     used in a way that burdens a fundamental right recognized in \n     the Constitution's Bill of Rights and judicial \n     interpretations by the U.S. Supreme Court. Since there is no \n     fundamental right to be uninsured, no fundamental right \n     challenge exists.\n       Other Relevant Constitutional Rights: Challenges under the \n     First and Fifth Amendments relating to individual rights may \n     rise, but are unlikely to succeed. The federal government \n     should include an exemption on religious grounds to a health \n     insurance mandate as an added measure of protection from \n     legal challenges based on religious freedom. In the \n     alternative, the federal government can simply exempt a \n     federal insurance mandate from existing federal legislation \n     protecting religious freedom.\n       Considerations: To avoid a heightened level of security in \n     any judicial review, the federal government should articulate \n     its substantive rationale for mandating health insurance \n     during the legislative process.\n\n  It goes on, and it is probably too lengthy to read. Professor Hall \nwrote this. He is a professor at Wake Forest University.\n  I will read the conclusion:\n\n       The Constitution permits Congress to legislate a health \n     insurance mandate. Congress can use its Commerce Clause \n     powers or its taxing and spending powers to create such a \n     mandate. Congress can impose a tax on those who do not \n     purchase insurance, or provide tax benefits to those that do \n     purchase insurance. . . . If Congress would like the States \n     to implement an insurance mandate, it can avoid conflicts \n     with the anti-commandeering principle by either preempting \n     state insurance laws or by conditioning federal funds on \n     State compliance. A federal employer mandate for state and \n     local government workers may be subject to a challenge; \n     however, such a challenge is unlikely to be successful. \n     Individual rights challenges under the First Amendment's Free \n     Exercise Clause or RFRA are unlikely to succeed, although a \n     federal insurance mandate should include a statement that \n     RFRA does not apply or provide for a religious exemption. \n     Fifth Amendment Due Process and Takings Clause challenges are \n     also unlikely to be successful. A legal analysis presented is \n     likely to endure, as the Supreme Court's current position and \n     approach to interpreting relevant constitutional issues \n     appear to be stable.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, as this debate draws to a close and my \ncolleagues and I prepare to vote on a health care reform bill, I \nrecognize that long hours and tense negotiations have left some nerves \nand tempers frayed. That is why I come to the floor.\n  Although our work keeps us away from our family and friends for much \nof this holiday season, I see no reason why we cannot share good cheer \nwith one another right here in Washington.\n  So in the spirit of the season, I would like to share my own version \nof a classic holiday story with my good friends on both sides of the \naisle.\n  It goes something like this:\n\n     `Twas the night before Christmas and all through the Senate\n     The Right held up our health bill, no matter what was in it.\n     The people had voted--they mandated reform--\n     But Republicans blew off the gathering storm.\n     ``We'll clog up the Senate!'' they cried with a grin,\n     ``And in midterm elections, we'll get voted in!''\n     They knew regular folks need help right this second--\n     But fundraisers, lobbyists and politics beckoned.\n     So, try as they might, Democrats could not win\n     Because their majority was simply too thin.\n     Then, across every State there arose such a clatter\n     The whole Senate rushed out to see what was the matter!\n     All sprang up from their desks and ran from the floor\n     Straight through the cloakroom, and right out the door.\n     And what in the world could be quite this raucous?\n     But a mandate for change! From the Democratic caucus!\n     The President, the Speaker, and of course Leader Reid\n     Had answered the call in our hour of need.\n     More rapid than eagles the provisions they came,\n     And they whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:\n     ``Better coverage! Cost savings! A strong public plan!\n     Accountable options? We said `yes we can!'\n     ``No exclusions or changes for pre-existing conditions! Let's \n           pass a bill that restores competition!''\n     The Democrats all came together to fight for the American \n           people, that Christmas Eve night.\n     And then, in a twinkle, I heard under the dome--the rollcall \n           was closed! It was time to go home.\n     Despite the obstructionist tactics of some, the filibuster \n           had broken--the people had won!\n     A good bill was ready for President Obama, ready to sign, and \n           end health care drama.\n     And Democrats explained, as they drove out of sight: ``Better \n           coverage for all, even our friends on the right!''\n\n  And I say to all of my colleagues: In this season, Merry Christmas \nand a happy, happy New Year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, in a little while, I will be making a \nconstitutional point of order against the substitute amendment. I won't \nmake that now because we are working on an agreement on when we can \nhave that vote.\n  I want to start talking about the reason I believe this substitute \namendment is unconstitutional--the individual mandate contained in it. \nI will be speaking for about 10 minutes now, and then I will resume my \nremarks at 9:30, after one of the Democrats comes down and uses their \n15 minutes.\n  If this constitutional point of order is rejected and the health care \nreform bill is passed, I believe the Court should reject it on \nconstitutional grounds.\n  Some of my colleagues may not be aware of the Finance Committee's \ndebate on the constitutionality of this health care reform bill. During \nthe committee markup of its version of the bill, Senator Hatch raised \nsome thought-provoking constitutional questions. He offered an \namendment, which I supported, to provide a process for the courts to \npromptly consider any constitutional challenge to the Finance Committee \nbill. He chose the same language that was put into the bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act. Unfortunately, the amendment was deemed \nnongermane.\n  I am seriously concerned that the Democrats' health care reform bill \nviolates the Constitution of these United States. As part of \ncomprehensive health care reform, the Democrats would require every \nsingle American citizen to purchase health insurance. Americans who \nfail to buy health insurance that meets the minimum requirements would \nbe subject to a financial penalty. This provision can be found in \nsection 1501 of the Democrats' health care reform bill. It is called \nthe ``requirement to maintain minimal essential coverage.''\n  While this is a constitutional point of order, I feel it is important \nto note that in the Declaration of Independence, America's Founding \nFathers provided that:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  What happened to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? I guess \nAmericans can only have them if they comply with this new bill and buy \na bronze, silver, gold, or platinum health insurance program.\n  America's Founders and subsequent generations fought dearly for the \nfreedoms we have today.\n  I question the appropriateness of this bill and specifically the \nconstitutionality of this individual mandate. Is it really \nconstitutional for this body to tell all Americans they must buy health \ninsurance coverage? If so, what is next? What personal liberty or \nproperty will Congress seek to take away from Americans next? Will we \nconsider legislation in the future requiring every American to buy a \ncar, to buy a house, or to do something else the Federal Government \nwants?\n  My friend and colleague, Senator Hatch, raised similar questions \nduring the debate in the Finance Committee. In fact, he raised the \nfollowing question:\n\n       If we have the power simply to order Americans to buy \n     certain products, why did we need a cash for clunkers \n     program, or the upcoming program providing rebates for \n     purchasing energy efficient appliances? We can simply require \n     Americans to buy certain cars, dishwashers, or refrigerators.\n\n  Where do we draw the line? Will we even draw one at all? The \nConstitution draws that line. It is called the enumerated powers. I \ndon't think Congress has ever required Americans to buy a product or \nservice, such as health insurance, under penalty of law. I doubt \nCongress has the power to do that in the first place.\n  As the CBO explained during the 1990s:\n\n\n[[Page S13722]]\n\n\n       A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health \n     insurance would be an unprecedented form of Federal action. \n     The government has never required people to buy any good or \n     service as a condition of lawful residence in the United \n     States.\n\n  Yet that is exactly what this health care bill would do. This bill \nwould require Americans to buy a product many of them do not want or \nsimply cannot afford.\n  Some individuals have raised the example of car insurance in the \ncontext of this debate. But requiring someone to have car insurance for \nthe privilege of being able to drive is much different from requiring \nsomeone to have health insurance. As Senator Hatch pointed out, people \nwho do not drive do not have to buy car insurance. Senator Hatch is \nright. If you live in New York City, you probably rely on subways or \nsome other form of mass transit. You probably do not own a car, so you \nhave no reason to buy car insurance and you are not forced to do so. \nYet this health care reform bill requires Americans to buy health \ninsurance whether or not they ever visit a doctor, get a prescription, \nor have an operation.\n  Under this bill, if you do not buy health insurance coverage, you \nwill be subject to a penalty. Let's call this penalty what it really \nis--a tax. Even worse, this penalty operates more like a taking than an \nordinary tax. If an American chooses not to buy minimal essential \nhealth coverage, he or she will face rapidly increasing taxes--up to \n$750 or 2 percent of taxable income, whichever is greater, by the year \n2016. There is no penalty for Americans who qualify for hardship or \nreligious exemptions. There is also no penalty for illegal immigrants \nor prisoners.\n  Americans typically pay taxes on a product or service they buy or on \nincome they earn. For example, if you fill up your car at the pump, you \npay a gas tax. If you earn income, you pay an income tax. Yet this bill \ncreates a new tax on Americans who choose not to buy a service. It is \nvery counterintuitive. This bill taxes Americans for not doing anything \nat all, other than just existing. This penalty is assessed through the \nInternal Revenue Code.\n  Senator Hatch made the following statement:\n\n       If this is a tax at all, it is certainly not an excise tax. \n     Instead, it is a direct tax. While the Constitution requires \n     that excise taxes must be uniform throughout the United \n     States, it requires that direct taxes must be apportioned \n     among the States by population. Just as the excise tax on \n     high premiums is not uniform, this direct tax on individuals \n     who do not purchase health insurance is not apportioned.\n\n  I recognize that the authors of this health reform bill included an \nindividual mandate in this bill based on the idea that health care \ncosts would be spread among all Americans and would ultimately reduce \ntheir health insurance costs. The claim is, insurance costs will be \nlowered because cost shifting will be reduced. This cost shift arguably \ntakes place because health care providers--doctors and hospitals--who \nprovide free or uncompensated care to the uninsured, shift the cost to \nthe insured or paying patients. The hospital or doctor then shifts the \ncost of that unpaid care to the insured patient in the form of higher \ncharges in order to cover the cost of uninsured patients.\n  I understand this concept, but I am incredibly concerned that the \nindividual mandate provision takes away too much freedom and choice \nfrom Nevadans and from Americans across the country.\n  I have read and studied multiple articles by scholars on the \nconstitutionality of the individual mandate. I believe the individual \nmandate provision in this health care reform bill calls into question \nseveral provisions of the Constitution. I think the Congress does not \nhave the authority, under the enumerated powers, to enact such a \nmandate.\n  I know the supporters of the individual mandate have claimed the \ncommerce clause and the taxes and general welfare clause in article I, \nsection 8 of the Constitution provide authority for Congress to enact \nsuch a mandate. I wholeheartedly disagree with that assessment.\n  According to the Constitution, the Federal Government only has \nlimited powers. Although the Supreme Court has upheld some far-reaching \nregulations of economic activity--most notably in Wickard v. Filburn \nand Gonzales v. Raich--neither case supports enacting the independent \nhealth insurance mandate based on the commerce clause. In these cases, \nthe court held that Congress was allowed to regulate intrastate \neconomic activity as a means to regulate interstate commerce in \nfungible goods. The mandate to purchase health insurance, however, is \nnot proposed as a means to regulate interstate commerce, nor does it \nregulate or prohibit activity in either the health insurance or the \nhealth care industry.\n  The mandate to purchase health insurance does not purport to regulate \nor prohibit activity of any kind, whether economic or noneconomic. \nInstead, the individual mandate provision regulates no action. It \npurports to regulate inactivity by converting the inactivity of not \nbuying insurance into commercial activity. In effect, advocates of the \nindividual mandate contend that under congressional power to ``regulate \ncommerce . . . among the several states'' Congress may reach the doing \nof nothing at all.\n  In recent years, the Supreme Court has invalidated two congressional \nstatutes that attempted to regulate noneconomic activities. To uphold \nthe individual mandate based on the commerce clause, the Supreme Court \nwould have to concede that the commerce clause provides unlimited \nauthority to regulate. This is a position that the Supreme Court has \nnever affirmed and that it rejected in recent cases.\n  Congress lacks the authority to regulate the individual's decision \nnot to purchase a service or enter into a contract. Similarly, Congress \ncannot rely on its power to tax to justify imposing the individual \nmandate.\n  In addition to being beyond the scope of Congress' enumerated powers, \nthis individual mandate also amounts to a taking under the fifth \namendment takings clause. I would like to take a moment to read the \nrelevant parts of the fifth amendment. It says in part:\n\n       No person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or \n     property, without due process of law; nor shall private \n     property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n\n  Let me repeat the part of the fifth amendment that applies to the \nissue at hand. It says:\n\n        . . . nor shall private property be taken for public use, \n     without just compensation.\n\n  The bill before us today would require an American citizen to devote \na portion of income--his or her private property--to health insurance \ncoverage. There is an exception, of course, for religious reasons and \nfor financial hardships.\n  If one of my constituents in Nevada does not want to spend his or her \nhard-earned income on health insurance coverage and would prefer to \nspend it on something else, such as rent or a car payment, this \nrequirement could be a taking of private property under the fifth \namendment.\n  As noted in a recent article coauthored by Dennis Smith and the \nformer Deputy General Counsel of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, Peter Urbanowicz, requiring a citizen to purchase health \ninsurance ``could be considered an arbitrary and capricious `taking' no \nmatter how many hardship exemptions the federal government might \ndispense.''\n  Some of my colleagues may also be familiar with David B. Rivkin and \nLee A. Casey. They are attorneys, based in Washington, DC, who served \nin the Department of Justice during the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations. In September, Rivkin and Casey published an op-ed in \nthe Wall Street Journal entitled: ``Mandatory Insurance is \nUnconstitutional.'' I urge my colleagues to read this article and many \nothers I will be submitting for the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks this Wall Street Journal by David B. \nRivkin, Jr., and Lee A. Casey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ENSIGN. In the op-ed, Rivkin and Casey argue that the health \ninsurance mandate:\n\n       . . . would expand the federal government's authority over \n     individual Americans to an unprecedented degree. It is also \n     profoundly unconstitutional.\n\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       Making healthy young adults pay billions of dollars in \n     premiums into the national health-care market is the only way \n     to fund universal coverage without raising substantial new \n     taxes.\n\n[[Page S13723]]\n\n       In effect, this mandate would be one more giant, cross-\n     generational subsidy--imposed on generations who are already \n     stuck with the bill for the federal government's prior \n     spending sprees.\n       A ``tax'' that falls exclusively on anyone who is uninsured \n     is a penalty beyond Congress's authority. If the rule were \n     otherwise, Congress could evade all constitutional limits by \n     ``taxing'' anyone who doesn't follow an order of any kind.\n\n  As the fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Marshall, \nstated:\n\n       The power to tax involves the power to destroy.\n\n  Unfortunately, this could certainly be true in the context of this \nhealth bill.\n  We in Congress must zealously defend our citizens' rights and prevent \nthis from happening. I believe the legislation before us violates the \ngreatest political document in the history of the world, the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to think very carefully about the constitutional \nissues I have raised. I know most people around here do not like to \ntalk about whether something is constitutional. We just want to do what \nfeels good because we think we are helping people. But our Founders set \nforth in the enumerated powers limits on what this body and this \nFederal Government could do.\n  As Members of Congress, one of our most important responsibilities is \nto protect, to defend, and preserve the Constitution of the United \nStates. In that light, it is not only appropriate but essential for \nthis body to question whether it is constitutional for the Federal \nGovernment to require Americans to buy health insurance coverage.\n  We should also question whether it is constitutional for the Federal \nGovernment to tell Americans what kind of health insurance coverage \nthey have to purchase. So not only does this bill tell them they have \nto buy health insurance, it tells Americans what kind of health \ninsurance must be purchased.\n  Americans also deserve to know how the bill will impact their ability \nto choose the health insurance coverage that best fits their needs. \nThat is exactly why I will raise this constitutional point of order. \nFreedom and choice are very precious rights. Let's not bury our heads \nin the sand and take away freedom and choice from American citizens. We \nneed to think about this individual mandate very carefully.\n  I have several articles, and I would like to read a couple of quotes \nfrom these articles. The first one is from the Washington Post. The \narticle is entitled, ``Illegal Health Reform.'' It is written by David \nRivkin and Lee A. Casey. It says:\n\n       The otherwise uninsured would be required to buy coverage, \n     not because they were even tangentially engaged in the \n     ``production, distribution or consumption of commodities,'' \n     but for no other reason than people without health insurance \n     exist. The federal government does not have the power to \n     regulate Americans simply because they are there. \n     Significantly, in two cases, United States v. Lopez (1995) \n     and United States v. Morrison (2000), the Supreme Court \n     specifically rejected the proposition that the commerce \n     clause allowed Congress to regulate noneconomic activities \n     merely because, through a chain of causal effects, they might \n     have an economic impact. These decisions reflect judicial \n     recognition that the commerce clause is not infinitely \n     elastic and that, by enumerating its powers, the framers \n     denied Congress the type of general police power that is \n     freely exercised by the states.\n\n  Mr. President, to read further from the article in the Washington \nPost:\n\n       Like the commerce power, the power to tax is the Federal \n     Government's vast authority over the public, and it is well \n     settled that Congress can impose a tax for regulatory rather \n     than purely revenue-raising purposes. Yet Congress cannot use \n     its power to tax solely as a means of controlling conduct \n     that it could not otherwise reach through the commerce clause \n     or any other constitutional provision. In the 1922 case \n     Bailey v. Drexel Furniture, the Supreme Court ruled that \n     Congress could not impose a ``tax'' to penalize conduct (the \n     utilization of child labor) it could not also regulate under \n     the commerce clause. Although the court's interpretation of \n     the commerce power's breadth has changed since that time, it \n     has not repudiated the fundamental principle that Congress \n     cannot use a tax to regulate conduct that is otherwise \n     indisputably beyond its regulatory power.\n       Of course, these constitutional impediments can be avoided \n     if Congress is willing to raise corporate and/or income taxes \n     enough to fund fully a new national health system. Absent \n     this politically dangerous--and therefore unlikely--scenario, \n     advocates of universal health coverage must accept Congress' \n     power, like that of the other branches, has limits. These \n     limits apply regardless of how important the issue may be, \n     and neither Congress nor the president can take \n     constitutional short cuts. The genius of our system is that, \n     no matter how convinced our elected officials may be that \n     certain measures are in the public interest, their goals can \n     be accomplished only in accord with the powers and processes \n     the Constitution mandates, processes that inevitably make \n     them accountable to the American people.\n\n  I want to read from another article that was written by Randy \nBarnett, Nathaniel Stewart, and Todd Gaziano. This article is entitled, \n``Why the Personal Mandate to Buy Health Insurance is Unprecedented and \nUnconstitutional.''\n\n       Members of Congress have the responsibility, pursuant to \n     their oath, to determine the constitutionality of legislation \n     independently of how the Supreme Court has ruled or may rule \n     in the future. But Senators and Representatives also should \n     know that, despite what they have been told, the health \n     insurance mandate is highly vulnerable to challenge because \n     it is, in truth, unconstitutional. And all other \n     considerations aside, the highest obligation of each Member \n     of Congress is fidelity to the Constitution.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, following my \nremarks, the articles I have before me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 2.)\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Continuing to quote, Mr. President, from the Barnett, \nStewart, and Gaziano article:\n\n       A long line of Supreme Court cases establishes that \n     Congress may regulate three categories of activity pursuant \n     to the commerce power. These categories were first summarized \n     in Perez v. United States, and most recently reaffirmed in \n     Gonzalez v. Raich. First, Congress may regulate the channels \n     of interstate or foreign commerce such as the regulation of \n     steamship, railroad, highway or aircraft transportation or \n     prevent them from being misused, as, for example, the \n     shipment of stolen goods or of persons who have been \n     kidnapped. Second, the commerce power extends to protecting \n     ``the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,'' as, for \n     example, the destruction of an aircraft, or persons or things \n     in commerce, as, for example, thefts from interstate \n     shipments. Third, Congress may regulate economic activities \n     that ``substantially affect interstate commerce.''\n       Under the first prong of its Commerce Clause analysis, the \n     Court asks whether the class of activities regulated by the \n     statute falls within one or more of these categories. Since \n     an individual health insurance mandate is not even arguably a \n     regulation of a channel or instrumentality of interstate \n     commerce, it must either fit in the third category or none at \n     all. . . . The Senate bill asserts (erroneously) that: \n     ``[t]he individual responsibility requirement . . . is \n     commercial and economic in nature, and substantially affects \n     interstate commerce. . . . The requirement regulates activity \n     that is commercial and economic in nature: economic and \n     financial decisions about how and when health care is paid \n     for, and when health insurance is purchased.''\n\n  That is within the bill.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       The second prong of the Court's Commerce Clause analysis \n     requires a determination that a petitioner has in fact \n     engaged in the regulated activity, making him or her a member \n     of the regulated class. In its modern Commerce Clause cases, \n     the Supreme Court rejects the argument that a petitioner's \n     own conduct or participation in the activity is, by itself, \n     either too local or too trivial to have a substantial effect \n     on interstate commerce. Rather, the Court has made clear \n     that, ``where the class of activities is regulated and that \n     class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have \n     no powers `to excise, as trivial, individual instances' of \n     the class.'' Thus, for example, a potential challenger of the \n     proposed mandate could not argue that because her own \n     decision not to purchase the required insurance would have \n     little or no effect on the broader market, the regulation \n     could not be constitutionally applied to her. The Court will \n     consider the effect of the relevant ``class of activity,'' \n     not that of any individual member of the class.\n       To assess the constitutionality of a claim of power under \n     the Commerce Clause, the primary question becomes, ``what \n     class of activity is Congress seeking to regulate?'' Only \n     when this question is answered can the Court assess whether \n     that class of activity substantially affects interstate \n     commerce. Significantly, the mandate imposed by the pending \n     bills does not regulate or prohibit the economic activity of \n     providing or administering health insurance. Nor does it \n     regulate or prohibit the economic activity of providing \n     health care, whether by doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical \n     companies, or other entities engaged in the business of \n     providing a medical good or service. Indeed, the health care \n     mandate does not purport to regulate or prohibit activity of \n     any kind, whether economic or noneconomic. To the contrary, \n     it purports to ``regulate'' inactivity.\n\n  In other words, not buying health insurance. Continuing once again:\n\n\n[[Page S13724]]\n\n\n       Proponents of the individual mandate are contending that, \n     under its power to ``regulate commerce . . . among the \n     several states,'' Congress may regulate the doing of nothing \n     at all! In other words, the statute purports to convert \n     inactivity into a class of activity. By its own plain terms, \n     the individual mandate provision regulates the absence of \n     action. To uphold this power under its existing doctrine, the \n     Court must conclude that an individual's failure to enter \n     into a contract for health insurance is an activity that is \n     ``economic'' in nature--that is, it is part of a ``class of \n     activity'' that ``substantially affects interstate \n     commerce.''\n       Never in this Nation's history has the commerce power been \n     used to require a person who does nothing to engage in \n     economic activity.\n\n  Let me repeat that. ``Never in this Nation's history has the commerce \npower been used to require a person who does nothing to engage in \neconomic activity.''\n  Let me close with this because I see the senior Senator from Utah is \non the Senate floor, and he has argued eloquently on the \nunconstitutionality of this particular provision.\n  Again, I am quoting:\n\n       Today, even voting is not constitutionally mandated. But if \n     this precedent is established--\n\n  That is the precedent in this bill is established--\n\n       Congress would have the unlimited power to regulate, \n     prohibit, or mandate any or all activities in the United \n     States. Such a doctrine would abolish any limit on federal \n     power and alter the fundamental relationship of the national \n     government to the states and the people. For this reason it \n     is highly doubtful that the Supreme Court will uphold this \n     assertion of power.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield to the \nsenior Senator from Utah.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 18, 2009]\n\n                Mandatory Insurance Is Unconstitutional\n\n               (By David B. Rivkin, Jr. and Lee A. Casey)\n\n       Federal legislation requiring that every American have \n     health insurance is part of all the major health-care reform \n     plans now being considered in Washington. Such a mandate, \n     however, would expand the federal government's authority over \n     individual Americans to an unprecedented degree. It is also \n     profoundly unconstitutional.\n       An individual mandate has been a hardy perennial of health-\n     care reform proposals since HillaryCare in the early 1990s. \n     President Barack Obama defended its merits before Congress \n     last week, claiming that uninsured people still use medical \n     services and impose the costs on everyone else. But the \n     reality is far different. Certainly some uninsured use \n     emergency rooms in lieu of primary care physicians, but the \n     majority are young people who forgo insurance precisely \n     because they do not expect to need much medical care. When \n     they do, these uninsured pay full freight, often at premium \n     rates, thereby actually subsidizing insured Americans.\n       The mandate's real justifications are far more cynical and \n     political. Making healthy young adults pay billions of \n     dollars in premiums into the national health-care market is \n     the only way to fund universal coverage without raising \n     substantial new taxes. In effect, this mandate would be one \n     more giant, cross-generational subsidy--imposed on \n     generations who are already stuck with the bill for the \n     federal government's prior spending sprees.\n       Politically, of course, the mandate is essential to winning \n     insurance industry support for the legislation and acceptance \n     of heavy federal regulations. Millions of new customers will \n     be driven into insurance-company arms. Moreover, without the \n     mandate, the entire thrust of the new regulatory scheme--\n     requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing \n     conditions and to accept standardized premiums--would produce \n     dysfunctional consequences. It would make little sense for \n     anyone, young or old, to buy insurance before he actually got \n     sick. Such a socialization of costs also happens to be an \n     essential step toward the single payer, national health \n     system, still stridently supported by large parts of the \n     president's base.\n       The elephant in the room is the Constitution. As every \n     civics class once taught, the federal government is a \n     government of limited, enumerated powers, with the states \n     retaining broad regulatory authority. As James Madison \n     explained in the Federalist Papers: ``[I]n the first place it \n     is to be remembered that the general government is not to be \n     charged with the whole power of making and administering \n     laws. Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated \n     objects.'' Congress, in other words, cannot regulate simply \n     because it sees a problem to be fixed. Federal law must be \n     grounded in one of the specific grants of authority found in \n     the Constitution.\n       These are mostly found in Article I, Section 8, which among \n     other things gives Congress the power to tax, borrow and \n     spend money, raise and support armies, declare war, establish \n     post offices and regulate commerce. It is the authority to \n     regulate foreign and interstate commerce that--in one way or \n     another--supports most of the elaborate federal regulatory \n     system. If the federal government has any right to reform, \n     revise or remake the American health-care system, it must be \n     found in this all-important provision. This is especially \n     true of any mandate that every American obtain health-care \n     insurance or face a penalty.\n       The Supreme Court construes the commerce power broadly. In \n     the most recent Commerce Clause case, Gonzales v. Raich \n     (2005), the court ruled that Congress can even regulate the \n     cultivation of marijuana for personal use so long as there is \n     a rational basis to believe that such ``activities, taken in \n     the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce.''\n       But there are important limits. In United States v. Lopez \n     (1995), for example, the Court invalidated the Gun Free \n     School Zones Act because that law made it a crime simply to \n     possess a gun near a school. It did not ``regulate any \n     economic activity and did not contain any requirement that \n     the possession of a gun have any connection to past \n     interstate activity or a predictable impact on future \n     commercial activity.'' Of course, a health-care mandate would \n     not regulate any ``activity,'' such as employment or growing \n     pot in the bathroom, at all. Simply being an American would \n     trigger it.\n       Health-care backers understand this and--like Lewis \n     Carroll's Red Queen insisting that some hills are valleys--\n     have framed the mandate as a ``tax'' rather than a \n     regulation. Under Sen. Max Baucus's (D., Mont.) most recent \n     plan, people who do not maintain health insurance for \n     themselves and their families would be forced to pay an \n     ``excise tax'' of up to $1,500 per year--roughly comparable \n     to the cost of insurance coverage under the new plan.\n       But Congress cannot so simply avoid the constitutional \n     limits on its power. Taxation can favor one industry or \n     course of action over another, but a ``tax'' that falls \n     exclusively on anyone who is uninsured is a penalty beyond \n     Congress's authority. If the rule were otherwise, Congress \n     could evade all constitutional limits by ``taxing'' anyone \n     who doesn't follow an order of any kind--whether to obtain \n     health-care insurance, or to join a health club, or exercise \n     regularly, or even eat your vegetables.\n       This type of congressional trickery is bad for our \n     democracy and has implications far beyond the health-care \n     debate. The Constitution's Framers divided power between the \n     federal government and states--just as they did among the \n     three federal branches of government--for a reason. They \n     viewed these structural limitations on governmental power as \n     the most reliable means of protecting individual liberty--\n     more important even than the Bill of Rights.\n       Yet if that imperative is insufficient to prompt \n     reconsideration of the mandate (and the approach to reform it \n     supports), then the inevitable judicial challenges should. \n     Since the 1930s, the Supreme Court has been reluctant to \n     invalidate ``regulatory'' taxes. However, a tax that is so \n     clearly a penalty for failing to comply with requirements \n     otherwise beyond Congress's constitutional power will present \n     the question whether there are any limits on Congress's power \n     to regulate individual Americans. The Supreme Court has never \n     accepted such a proposition, and it is unlikely to accept it \n     now, even in an area as important as health care.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n       [From the Washington Post, Aug. 22, 2009]\n\n                         Illegal Health Reform\n\n               (By David B. Rivkin, Jr. and Lee A. Casey)\n\n       President Obama has called for a serious and reasoned \n     debate about his plans to overhaul the health-care system. \n     Any such debate must include the question of whether it is \n     constitutional for the federal government to adopt and \n     implement the president's proposals. Consider one element \n     known as the ``individual mandate,'' which would require \n     every American to have health insurance, if not through an \n     employer then by individual purchase. This requirement would \n     particularly affect young adults, who often choose to save \n     the expense and go without coverage. Without the young to \n     subsidize the old, a comprehensive national health system \n     will not work. But can Congress require every American to buy \n     health insurance?\n       In short, no. The Constitution assigns only limited, \n     enumerated powers to Congress and none, including the power \n     to regulate interstate commerce or to impose taxes, would \n     support a federal mandate requiring anyone who is otherwise \n     without health insurance to buy it.\n       Although the Supreme Court has interpreted Congress's \n     commerce power expansively, this type of mandate would not \n     pass muster even under the most aggressive commerce clause \n     cases. In Wickard v. Filburn (1942), the court upheld a \n     federal law regulating the national wheat markets. The law \n     was drawn so broadly that wheat grown for consumption on \n     individual farms also was regulated. Even though this rule \n     reached purely local (rather than interstate) activity, the \n     court reasoned that the consumption of homegrown wheat by \n     individual farms would, in the aggregate, have a substantial \n     economic effect on interstate commerce, and so was within \n     Congress's reach.\n       The court reaffirmed this rationale in 2005 in Gonzales v. \n     Raich, when it validated Congress's authority to regulate the \n     home cultivation of marijuana for personal use. In doing so, \n     however, the justices emphasized that--as in the wheat case--\n     ``the activities\n\n[[Page S13725]]\n\n     regulated by the [Controlled Substances Act] are \n     quintessentially economic.'' That simply would not be true \n     with regard to an individual health insurance mandate.\n       The otherwise uninsured would be required to buy coverage, \n     not because they were even tangentially engaged in the \n     ``production, distribution or consumption of commodities,'' \n     but for no other reason than that people without health \n     insurance exist. The federal government does not have the \n     power to regulate Americans simply because they are there. \n     Significantly, in two key cases, United States v. Lopez \n     (1995) and United States v. Morrison (2000), the Supreme \n     Court specifically rejected the proposition that the commerce \n     clause allowed Congress to regulate noneconomic activities \n     merely because, through a chain of causal effects, they might \n     have an economic impact. These decisions reflect judicial \n     recognition that the commerce clause is not infinitely \n     elastic and that, by enumerating its powers, the framers \n     denied Congress the type of general police power that is \n     freely exercised by the states.\n       This leaves mandate supporters with few palatable options. \n     Congress could attempt to condition some federal benefit on \n     the acquisition of insurance. States, for example, usually \n     condition issuance of a car registration on proof of \n     automobile insurance, or on a sizable payment into an \n     uninsured motorist fund. Even this, however, cannot achieve \n     universal health coverage. No federal program or entitlement \n     applies to the entire population, and it is difficult to \n     conceive of a ``benefit'' that some part of the population \n     would not choose to eschew.\n       The other obvious alternative is to use Congress's power to \n     tax and spend. In an effort, perhaps, to anchor this mandate \n     in that power, the Senate version of the individual mandate \n     envisions that failure to comply would be met with a penalty, \n     to be collected by the IRS. This arrangement, however, is not \n     constitutional either.\n       Like the commerce power, the power to tax gives the federal \n     government vast authority over the public, and it is well \n     settled that Congress can impose a tax for regulatory rather \n     than purely revenue-raising purposes. Yet Congress cannot use \n     its power to tax solely as a means of controlling conduct \n     that it could not otherwise reach through the commerce clause \n     or any other constitutional provision. In the 1922 case \n     Bailey v. Drexel Furniture, the Supreme Court ruled that \n     Congress could not impose a ``tax'' to penalize conduct (the \n     utilization of child labor) it could not also regulate under \n     the commerce clause. Although the court's interpretation of \n     the commerce power's breadth has changed since that time, it \n     has not repudiated the fundamental principle that Congress \n     cannot use a tax to regulate conduct that is otherwise \n     indisputably beyond its regulatory power.\n       Of course, these constitutional impediments can be avoided \n     if Congress is willing to raise corporate and/or income taxes \n     enough to fund fully a new national health system. Absent \n     this politically dangerous--and therefore unlikely--scenario, \n     advocates of universal health coverage must accept that \n     Congress's power, like that of the other branches, has \n     limits. These limits apply regardless of how important the \n     issue may be, and neither Congress nor the president can take \n     constitutional short cuts. The genius of our system is that, \n     no matter how convinced our elected officials may be that \n     certain measures are in the public interest, their goals can \n     be accomplished only in accord with the powers and processes \n     the Constitution mandates, processes that inevitably make \n     them accountable to the American people.\n                                  ____\n\n\nExecutive Summary: Why the Personal Mandate To Buy Health Insurance Is \n                   Unprecedented and Unconstitutional\n\n       (By Randy Barnett, Nathaniel Stewart, and Todd F. Gaziano)\n\n       As the Congressional Budget Office explained: ``A mandate \n     requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would \n     be an unprecedented form of federal action. The government \n     has never required people to buy any good or service as a \n     condition of lawful residence in the United States.'' Yet, \n     all of the House and Senate health-care bills being debated \n     require Americans to either obtain or purchase expensive \n     health insurance, estimated to cost up to $15,000 per year \n     for a typical family, or pay substantial tax penalties for \n     not doing so.\n       The purpose of this compulsory contract, coupled with the \n     arbitrary price ratios and controls, is to require some \n     people to buy artificially high-priced policies as a way of \n     subsidizing coverage for others and an industry saddled with \n     the costs of other government regulations. Rather than \n     appropriate funds for higher federal health-care spending, \n     the sponsors of the current bills are attempting, through the \n     personal mandate, to keep the forced wealth transfers \n     entirely off budget.\n       This takes congressional power and control to a strikingly \n     new level. An individual mandate to enter into a contract \n     with or buy a particular product from a private party is \n     literally unprecedented, not just in scope but in kind, and \n     unconstitutional either as a matter of first principles or \n     under any reasonable reading of judicial precedents.\n\n\n                          The Commerce Clause\n\n       Advocates of the individual mandate have claimed that the \n     Supreme Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence leaves ``no \n     doubt'' that the insurance requirement is a constitutional \n     exercise of that power. They are wrong.\n       Although the Supreme Court has upheld some far-reaching \n     regulations of economic activity, most notably in Wickard v. \n     Filburn and Gonzales v. Raich, neither case supports the \n     individual health insurance mandate. In these cases, the \n     Court held that Congress's power to regulate the interstate \n     commerce in a fungible good--for example, wheat or \n     marijuana--as part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme \n     included the power to regulate or prohibit the intrastate \n     possession and production of this good. In both cases, \n     Congress was allowed to reach intrastate economic activity as \n     a means to the regulation of interstate commerce in goods.\n       Yet, the mandate to purchase health insurance is not \n     proposed as a means to the regulation of interstate commerce; \n     nor does it regulate or prohibit activity in either the \n     health insurance or health care industry. Indeed, the health \n     care mandate does not purport to regulate or prohibit \n     activity of any kind, whether economic or noneconomic. By its \n     own plain terms, the individual mandate provision regulates \n     no action. To the contrary, it purports to ``regulate'' \n     inactivity by converting the inactivity of not buying \n     insurance into commercial activity. Proponents of the \n     individual mandate are contending that, under its power to \n     ``regulate commerce . . . among the several states,'' \n     Congress may reach the doing of nothing at all!\n       In recent years, the Court invalidated two congressional \n     statutes that attempted to regulate non-economic activities. \n     In United States v. Lopez (1995), it struck down the Gun-Free \n     School Zones Act, which attempted to reach the activity of \n     possessing a gun within a thousand feet of a school. In \n     United States v. Morrison (2000), it invalidated part of the \n     Violence Against Women Act, which regulated gender-motivated \n     violence. Because the Court found the regulated activity in \n     each case to be noneconomic, it was outside the reach of \n     Congress's Commerce power, regardless of its effect on \n     interstate commerce.\n       To uphold the insurance purchase mandate, the Supreme Court \n     would have to concede that the Commerce Clause has no limits, \n     a proposition that it has never affirmed, that it rejected in \n     Lopez and Morrison, and from which it did not retreat in \n     Raich. Although Congress may possibly regulate the operations \n     of health care or health insurance companies directly, given \n     that they are economic activities with a substantial effect \n     on interstate commerce, it may not regulate the individual's \n     decision not to purchase a service or enter into a contract.\n       If Congress can mandate this, then it can mandate anything. \n     Congress could require every American to buy a new Chevy \n     Impala every year, or a pay a ``tax'' equivalent to its blue \n     book value, because such purchases would stimulate commerce \n     and help repay government loans. Congress could also require \n     all Americans to buy a certain amount of wheat bread annually \n     to subsidize farmers.\n       Even during wartime, when war production is vital to \n     national survival, Congress has never claimed such a power, \n     nor could it. No farmer was ever forced to grow food for the \n     troops; no worker was forced to build tanks. And what \n     Congress cannot do during wartime, with national survival at \n     stake, it cannot do in peacetime simply to avoid the \n     political cost of raising taxes to pay for desired government \n     programs.\n\n\n                     Other Constitutional Problems\n\n       Senators and Representatives should also know that:\n       There are four constitutionally relevant differences \n     between a universal federal mandate to obtain health \n     insurance and the state requirements that automobile drivers \n     carry liability insurance for their injuries to others on \n     public roads;\n       A review of the tax provisions in the House and Senate \n     bills raises serious questions about the constitutionality of \n     using the taxing power in this manner; and\n       Since there literally is no legal precedent for this \n     decidedly unprecedented assertion of federal power, it is \n     highly unlikely that the Supreme Court would break new \n     constitutional ground to save an unpopular personal mandate.\n       Members of Congress have a responsibility, pursuant to \n     their oath, to determine the constitutionality of legislation \n     independently of how the Supreme Court has ruled or may rule \n     in the future. But Senators and Representatives also should \n     know that, despite what they have been told, the health \n     insurance mandate is highly vulnerable to challenge because \n     it is, in truth, unconstitutional. And all other \n     considerations aside, the highest obligation of each Member \n     of Congress is fidelity to the Constitution.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to support the constitutional point \nof order raised against the legislation before us by the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada. I applaud the senior Senator from Nevada for \ntaking this step so that all Senators can take a position on whether \nthis legislation is constitutional, or whether this legislation is \nconsistent with the Constitution each of us is sworn to protect and \ndefend.\n  The Senator from Nevada serves with me on the Senate Finance \nCommittee,\n\n[[Page S13726]]\n\nand he will remember that I started raising constitutional questions \nand objections against this legislation more than 3 months ago during \nthe committee markup, and so has he.\n  This body has spent its time debating the policy of this legislation. \nThis is a terrible piece of legislation that will raise insurance \npremiums, raise taxes, and limit access to care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from \nyesterday's Wall Street Journal, titled ``Change Nobody Believes In,'' \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. From the standpoint of policy, Mr. President, we should \nnot pass this bill. Perhaps more importantly, from the standpoint of \nthe Constitution, we may not pass it.\n  Much has changed since the founding of this great country, but one \nthing has not: The liberty we love requires limits on government. It \nrequires limits on government. It always has and it always will. \nAmerica's founders knew that and built limits into the system of \ngovernment they established. Those limits come primarily from a written \nConstitution that delegates enumerated powers to the Federal \nGovernment. We must point to at least one--at least one--of those \npowers as the basis for any legislation we pass.\n  The Constitution and the limits it imposes do not mean whatever we \nwant them to mean.\n  This legislation brings America into completely uncharted political \nand legal waters and I will not be at all surprised if there is \nlitigation challenging it on constitutional and other grounds. In the \nFinance Committee, I offered an amendment to add a procedure for the \ncourts to handle constitutional challenges in an expedited fashion. The \nFinance Committee chairman ruled that amendment out of order so that it \ncould not even be considered. That was his decision, but that means \nthat any future challenges will be handled the old fashioned way, even \nif that means an extended, rather than an expedited, process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a memo prepared by the Conservative \nAction Project be printed in the Record following my remarks. Its \nsignatories include former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese; former \nCongressman David McIntosh; Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Council; and Brian McManus of the Council \nfor Affordable Health Insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me briefly repeat the constitution objections I have \nbeen raising for the past few months and which the Senator from Nevada \ncarefully raised this morning. First, the only enumerated power that \nconceivably can support the mandate for individuals to purchase health \ninsurance is the power to regulate interstate commerce. Since the \n1930s, the Supreme Court has expanded this to include regulation of \nactivities that substantially affect interstate commerce. But the key \nword is activities. Congress has never crossed the line between \nregulating what people choose to do and ordering them to do it. The \ndifference between regulating and requiring is liberty. I agree with \nthe 75 percent of Americans who believe that the insurance mandate is \nunconstitutional because Congress's power to regulate interstate \ncommerce does not include telling Americans what they must buy.\n  Second, the financial penalty enforcing the insurance mandate is just \nthat, a penalty. It is not a tax and, therefore, it is constitutional \nonly if the insurance mandate it enforces is constitutional. If it is a \ntax, it is a direct tax on individuals rather than an excise tax on \ntransactions and, therefore, it violates article I, section 9, of the \nConstitution which requires that direct taxes be apportioned according \nto population.\n  Third, the excise tax on high-cost insurance plans, which applies \ndifferently in some states than in others, is unconstitutional because \nit is not uniform throughout the United States as required by article \nI, section 8. The Supreme Court has said that to be uniform as the \nConstitution requires, an excise tax must have the same force and \neffect wherever the subject of the tax is found. Not only is this not \nthe case with this tax, which makes it plainly unconstitutional, but \nthat is exactly the design and intention of those who drafted this \nlegislation.\n  Fourth, the legislation orders states to establish health benefit \nexchanges which will require states to pass legislation and \nregulations. If they do not, or even if the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services believes they will not by a certain date, the Secretary \nwill literally step into each state and establish and operate this \nexchange for them. This is a direct violation of the division between \nfederal and state government power. The Supreme Court could not have \nbeen clearer on this point, ruling over and over that Congress may \nregulate individuals but may not regulate states. Congress has no \nauthority to order states, in their capacity as states to pass \nlegislation. We have encouraged states to pass legislation, we have \nbribed them, we have even extorted them by threatening to withhold \nfederal funds. But this legislation simply commandeers states and makes \nthem little more than subdivisions of the federal government. In 1997, \nthe Supreme Court held ``state legislatures are not subject to Federal \ndirection'' and reaffirmed ``categorically'' its earlier holding that \n``the federal government may not compel the states to enact or \nadminister a federal regulatory program.'' That should be clear enough \nfor Senators to understand here in this body.\n  I was amazed to learn that when President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose \nFrances Perkins as his Secretary of Labor, they discussed social policy \nlegislation including health insurance. As Secretary Perkins later \ndescribed it, they agreed that such legislation would pose ``very \nsevere constitutional problems,'' including fundamentally altering \nfederal-state relationships. That is why the Social Security Act relies \non the payroll tax. Even the Roosevelt administration, which oversaw \nthe most dramatic expansion of Federal power in our Nation's history, \nwould not go as far as the legislation before us today would go.\n  Should this legislation become law, there would be nothing that the \nfederal government could not do. Congress would be remaking the \nConstitution in its image, rather than abiding by the Constitution's \nlimits as liberty requires. There must come a time when we say that the \npolitical ends cannot justify the constitutional means, that the \nConstitution and the liberty it protects are more important than we \nwonderful Members of Congress are. That time is now, and that is why we \nwill vote to sustain this constitutional point of order.\n\n  I wish to personally thank and congratulate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada for his work on this issue, for his work on the committee, \nbecause he was one of the more energetic and more capable people on the \ncommittee in raising some of these very important issues such as this \nconstitutional set of issues we have been discussing over this short \nperiod of time today. I am grateful for him, I am grateful he has \nraised it, and I am grateful to be able to be here on the floor to \nsupport him in his raising of this constitutional point of order when \nhe chooses to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 21, 2009]\n\n                       Change Nobody Believes In\n\n       And tidings of comfort and joy from Harry Reid too. The \n     Senate Majority Leader has decided that the last few days \n     before Christmas are the opportune moment for a narrow \n     majority of Democrats to stuff ObamaCare through the Senate \n     to meet an arbitrary White House deadline. Barring some \n     extraordinary reversal, it now seems as if they have the 60 \n     votes they need to jump off this cliff, with one-seventh of \n     the economy in tow.\n       Mr. Obama promised a new era of transparent good \n     government, yet on Saturday morning Mr. Reid threw out the \n     2,100-page bill that the world's greatest deliberative body \n     spent just 17 days debating and replaced it with a new \n     ``manager's amendment'' that was stapled together in covert \n     partisan negotiations. Democrats are barely even bothering to \n     pretend to care what's in it, not that any Senator had the \n     chance to digest it in the 38 hours before the first cloture \n     vote at 1 a. m. this morning. After procedural motions that \n     allow for no amendments, the final vote could come at 9 p.m. \n     on December 24.\n       Even in World War I there was a Christmas truce.\n       The rushed, secretive way that a bill this destructive and \n     unpopular is being forced on\n\n[[Page S13727]]\n\n     the country shows that ``reform'' has devolved into the raw \n     exercise of political power for the single purpose of \n     permanently expanding the American entitlement state. An \n     increasing roll of leaders in health care and business are \n     looking on aghast at a bill that is so large and convoluted \n     that no one can truly understand it, as Finance Chairman Max \n     Baucus admitted on the floor last week. The only goal is to \n     ram it into law while the political window is still open, and \n     clean up the mess later.\n       Health costs. From the outset, the White House's core claim \n     was that reform would reduce health costs for individuals and \n     businesses, and they're sticking to that story. ``Anyone who \n     says otherwise simply hasn't read the bills,'' Mr. Obama said \n     over the weekend. This is so utterly disingenuous that we \n     doubt the President really believes it.\n       The best and most rigorous cost analysis was recently \n     released by the insurer WellPoint, which mined its actuarial \n     data in various regional markets to model the Senate bill. \n     WellPoint found that a healthy 25-year-old in Milwaukee \n     buying coverage on the individual market will see his costs \n     rise by 178%. A small business based in Richmond with eight \n     employees in average health will see a 23% increase. \n     Insurance costs for a 40-year-old family, with two kids \n     living in Indianapolis will pay 106% more. And on and on.\n       These increases are solely the result of ObamaCare--above \n     and far beyond the status quo--because its strict \n     restrictions on underwriting and risk-pooling would \n     distort insurance markets. All but a handful of states \n     have rejected regulations like ``community rating'' \n     because they encourage younger and healthier buyers to \n     wait until they need expensive care, increasing costs for \n     everyone. Benefits and pricing will now be determined by \n     politics.\n       As for the White House's line about cutting costs by \n     eliminating supposed ``waste,'' even Victor Fuchs, an eminent \n     economist generally supportive of ObamaCare, warned last week \n     that these political theories are overly simplistic. ``The \n     oft-heard promise `we will find out what works and what does \n     not' scarcely does justice to the complexity of medical \n     practice,'' the Stanford professor wrote.\n       Steep declines in choice and quality. This is all of a \n     piece with the hubris of an Administration that thinks it can \n     substitute government planning for market forces in \n     determining where the $33 trillion the U.S. will spend on \n     medicine over the next decade should go.\n       This centralized system means above all fewer choices; what \n     works for the political class must work for everyone. With \n     formerly private insurers converted into public utilities, \n     for instance, they'll inevitably be banned from selling \n     products like health savings accounts that encourage more \n     cost-conscious decisions.\n       Unnoticed by the press corps, the Congressional Budget \n     Office argued recently that the Senate bill would so \n     ``substantially reduce flexibility in terms of the types, \n     prices, and number of private sellers of health insurance'' \n     that companies like WellPoint might need to ``be considered \n     part of the federal budget.''\n       With so large a chunk of the economy and medical practice \n     itself in Washington's hands, quality will decline. \n     Ultimately, ``our capacity to innovate and develop new \n     therapies would suffer most of all,'' as Harvard Medical \n     School Dean Jeffrey Flier recently wrote in our pages. Take \n     the $2 billion annual tax--rising to $3 billion in 2018--that \n     will be leveled against medical device makers, among the most \n     innovative U.S. industries. Democrats believe that more \n     advanced health technologies like MRI machines and drug-\n     coated stents are driving costs too high, though patients and \n     their physicians might disagree.\n       ``The Senate isn't hearing those of us who are closest to \n     the patient and work in the system every day,'' Brent \n     Eastman, the chairman of the American College of Surgeons, \n     said in a statement for his organization and 18 other \n     speciality societies opposing ObamaCare. For no other reason \n     than ideological animus, doctor-owned hospitals will face \n     harsh new limits on their growth and who they're allowed to \n     treat. Physician Hospitals of America says that ObamaCare \n     will ``destroy over 200 of America's best and safest \n     hospitals.''\n       Blowing up the federal fisc. Even though Medicare's \n     unfunded liabilities are already about 2.6 times larger than \n     the entire U.S. economy in 2008, Democrats are crowing that \n     ObamaCare will cost ``only'' $871 billion over the next \n     decade while fantastically reducing the deficit by $132 \n     billion, according to CBO.\n       Yet some 98% of the total cost comes after 2014--remind us \n     why there must absolutely be a vote this week--and most of \n     the taxes start in 2010. That includes the payroll tax \n     increase for individuals earning more than $200,000 that rose \n     to 0.9 from 0.5 percentage points in Mr. Reid's final \n     machinations. Job creation, here we come.\n       Other deceptions include a new entitlement for long-term \n     care that starts collecting premiums tomorrow but doesn't \n     start paying benefits until late in the decade. But the worst \n     is not accounting for a formula that automatically slashes \n     Medicare payments to doctors by 21.5% next year and deeper \n     after that. Everyone knows the payment cuts won't happen but \n     they remain in the bill to make the cost look lower. The \n     American Medical Association's priority was eliminating this \n     ``sustainable growth rate'' but all they got in return for \n     their year of ObamaCare cheerleading was a two-month patch \n     snuck into the defense bill that passed over the weekend.\n       The truth is that no one really knows how much ObamaCare \n     will cost because its assumptions on paper are so \n     unrealistic. To hide the cost increases created by other \n     parts of the bill and transfer them onto the federal \n     balance sheet, the Senate sets up government-run \n     ``exchanges'' that will subsidize insurance for those \n     earning up to 400% of the poverty level, or $96,000 for a \n     family of four in 2016. Supposedly they would only be \n     offered to those whose employers don't provide insurance \n     or work for small businesses.\n       As Eugene Steuerle of the left-leaning Urban Institute \n     points out, this system would treat two workers with the same \n     total compensation--whatever the mix of cash wages and \n     benefits--very differently. Under the Senate bill, someone \n     who earned $42,000 would get $5,749 from the current tax \n     exclusion for employer-sponsored coverage but $12,750 in the \n     exchange. A worker making $60,000 would get $8,310 in the \n     exchanges but only $3,758 in the current system.\n       For this reason Mr. Steuerle concludes that the Senate bill \n     is not just a new health system but also ``a new welfare and \n     tax system'' that will warp the labor market. Given the \n     incentives of these two-tier subsidies, employers with large \n     numbers of lower-wage workers like Wal-Mart may well convert \n     them into ``contractors'' or do more outsourcing. As more and \n     more people flood into ``free'' health care, taxpayer costs \n     will explode.\n       Political intimidation. The experts who have pointed out \n     such complications have been ignored or dismissed as \n     ``ideologues'' by the White House. Those parts of the health-\n     care industry that couldn't be bribed outright, like Big \n     Pharma, were coerced into acceding to this agenda. The White \n     House was able to, er, persuade the likes of the AMA and the \n     hospital lobbies because the Federal government will control \n     55% of total U.S. health spending under ObamaCare, according \n     to the Administration's own Medicare actuaries.\n       Others got hush money, namely Nebraska's Ben Nelson. Even \n     liberal Governors have been howling for months about \n     ObamaCare's unfunded spending mandates: Other budget \n     priorities like education will be crowded out when about 21% \n     of the U.S. population is on Medicaid, the joint state-\n     federal program intended for the poor. Nebraska Governor Dave \n     Heineman calculates that ObamaCare will result in $2.5 \n     billion in new costs for his state that ``will be passed on \n     to citizens through direct or indirect taxes and fees,'' as \n     he put it in a letter to his state's junior Senator.\n       So in addition to abortion restrictions, Mr. Nelson won the \n     concession that Congress will pay for 100% of Nebraska \n     Medicaid expansions into perpetuity. His capitulation ought \n     to cost him his political career, but more to the point, what \n     about the other states that don't have a Senator who's the \n     60th vote for ObamaCare?\n       ``After a nearly century-long struggle we are on the cusp \n     of making health-care reform a reality in the United States \n     of America,'' Mr. Obama said on Saturday. He's forced to \n     claim the mandate of ``history'' because he can't claim the \n     mandate of voters. Some 51% of the public is now opposed, \n     according to National Journal's composite of all health \n     polling. The more people know about ObamaCare, the more \n     unpopular it becomes.\n       The tragedy is that Mr. Obama inherited a consensus that \n     the health-care status quo needs serious reform, and a \n     popular President might have crafted a durable compromise \n     that blended the best ideas from both parties. A more honest \n     and more thoughtful approach might have even done some good. \n     But as Mr. Obama suggested, the Democratic old guard sees \n     this plan as the culmination of 20th-century liberalism.\n       So instead we have this vast expansion of federal control. \n     Never in our memory has so unpopular a bill been on the verge \n     of passing Congress, never has social and economic \n     legislation of this magnitude been forced through on a purely \n     partisan vote, and never has a party exhibited more sheer \n     political willfulness that is reckless even for Washington or \n     had more warning about the consequences of its actions.\n       These 60 Democrats are creating a future of epic increases \n     in spending, taxes and command-and-control regulation, in \n     which bureaucracy trumps innovation and transfer payments are \n     more important than private investment and individual \n     decisions.

As \n     such, it is unconstitutional, and should not survive a court \n     challenge on that issue. Supporters of the legislation have \n     incorrectly contended that the legal justification for the \n     mandate is authorized by the Commerce Clause, the General \n     Welfare Clause, or the Taxing and Spending Clause. Given that \n     this mandate provision is essential to Obamacare; its \n     unconstitutionality renders the entire program untenable.\n       The individual mandate is unconstitutional unless there is \n     a specific constitutional provision that authorizes it. The \n     federal government is a government of limited jurisdiction. \n     It has only enumerated powers. Therefore unless a specific \n     provision of the Constitution empowers a particular law, then \n     that law is unconstitutional. There is no such authorization \n     for the mandate.\n       The individual mandate is not authorized by the Commerce \n     Clause. Most of those advocating the Democrats' bill say that \n     Congress can pass this legislation pursuant to its power to \n     regulate interstate commerce. That argument is incorrect, \n     because there is no interstate commerce when private citizens \n     do not purchase health insurance.\n       The Commerce Clause only covers matters where citizens \n     engage in economic activity. The last time the Supreme Court \n     struck down a law for violating the Commerce Clause, in \n     United States v. Morrison (2000), the Court did so on the \n     grounds that the activity in question was not an economic \n     activity.\n       The Commerce Clause only extends to persons or \n     organizations voluntarily engaging in commercial activity. \n     Government can only regulate economic action; it cannot \n     coerce action on the part of private citizens who do not wish \n     to participate in commerce. In the most expansive case for \n     Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce, Wickard v. \n     Filburn (1942), the Court upheld the agricultural regulation \n     in question against a wheat farmer who earned his entire \n     living from growing and selling wheat, making him a willing \n     participant in interstate commerce.\n       The Commerce Clause requires an actual economic effect, not \n     merely a congressional finding of an economic effect. When \n     the Court struck down the Violence Against Women Act in \n     United States v. Morrison (2000), the Court noted that \n     although the statute made numerous findings regarding the \n     link between such violence and interstate commerce, it held \n     that those findings did not actually establish an economic \n     effect. Therefore the various interstate-commerce findings in \n     the Senate version of the ``Obamacare'' legislation do not \n     make the bill constitutional.\n       The individual mandate is not authorized under the General \n     Welfare Clause. The Supreme Court made clear in United States \n     v. Butler (1936) and Helvering v. Davis (1937) that the \n     General Welfare Clause only applies to congressional \n     spending. It applies to money going out from the government; \n     it does not confer or concern any government power to take in \n     money, such as would happen with the individual mandate. \n     Therefore the mandate is outside the scope of the General \n     Welfare Clause.\n       The individual mandate is not authorized under the Taxing \n     and Spending Clause or Income Tax. The Constitution only \n     allows certain types of taxation from the federal government.\n       The Article I Taxing and Spending Clause permits duties, \n     imposts, excises and capitation taxes--duties, imposts and \n     excises are taxes on purchases. A capitation tax is a tax \n     that every person must pay, and the Constitution's \n     apportionment rule requires that every person in each state \n     must pay exactly the same amount. The Obamacare mandate is \n     imposed on people who are making no purchase, and is a tax \n     that some people in a state would pay, but others do not.\n       The Sixteenth Amendment allows an income tax. An income tax \n     is imposed only on earnings, but people would have to pay \n     this tax even if they had no income.\n       Therefore it cannot be any of these constitutionally-\n     permitted taxes.\n       The individual mandate is unconstitutional regardless of \n     whether there are criminal penalties involved. There is no \n     distinction between criminal and civil penalties for \n     determining the constitutionality of legislation, and the \n     penalty imposed in Wickard v. Filburn (1942) was not a \n     criminal penalty. Therefore even if the criminal sanctions \n     were removed from the legislation, the imposition of any \n     penalty or consequence for not purchasing insurance renders \n     the mandate unconstitutional.\n       The individual mandate cannot be properly compared to \n     requiring auto insurance. President Obama said in a Nov. 9 \n     interview on ABC television that requiring people to buy \n     health insurance and penalizing those that do not buy is \n     acceptable because people are required to buy car insurance. \n     That statement is untrue.\n       Only state governments can require people to get car \n     insurance. While the federal government is limited to the \n     powers enumerated in the Constitution, the states have a \n     general police power. The police power enables state \n     governments to pass laws for public safety and public health. \n     The federal government has no general police power, and \n     therefore could not require car insurance.\n       States do not require people to purchase car insurance. \n     Driving a car is a privilege, not a right. States require \n     people to get insurance only as a condition for those people \n     who voluntarily choose to drive on the public roads. If a \n     person chooses to use public transportation, or use a bicycle \n     instead of a car, or operate a car only on their own \n     property, they are not required to have car insurance, and \n     cannot be penalized for lacking insurance.\n\n\n  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE HEALTH \n               CARE MANDATE, PLEASE VISIT THESE WEBSITES\n\n       http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpdyn/content/article/2009/\n08/21/AR2009082103033.html\n       http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28463.html\n       http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28620.html\n       http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28787.htm1\n       http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2009/10/30/ken-klukowski-\nopen-letter-pelosi-gibbs-constitution-individual-mandate/\n http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/nov/02/beware-the-\nhealth-insurance-police/\n http://www.heritage.org/Research/LegalIssues/1m0049.cfm\n       http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/11/interview-\nwith-the-president-jail-time-for-those-without-health-care-\ninsurance.html\n       http://hatch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?\n FuseAction=PressReleases.Detail\n     Release_id=097a758af3-1b78-be3e-e03a-c0eea6d515c.5\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I know we are waiting for the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee to come. I ask unanimous consent to speak in the \nmeantime, in these few seconds.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Utah. He is one of the best \nconstitutional scholars we have here in the Senate. I appreciate his \nwords and analysis on why this bill is unconstitutional. I think his \nwords this morning were eloquent. I appreciate his support as I raise \nthis constitutional point of order.\n  I yield to the Senator from Montana, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that I \nunderstand has been cleared by both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after Senator Ensign raises the point of \norder that the Reid substitute amendment No. 2786 is in violation of \nthe Constitution, the point of order be set aside to recur on \nWednesday, December 23, at a time to be determined by the majority and \nRepublican leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to make a constitutional point of \norder against this bill on the grounds that it violates Congress' \nenumerated powers in article I, section 8 and that it violates the \nfifth amendment of the Constitution. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the unanimous consent, the point \nof order shall be set aside until a time tomorrow to be determined by \nthe majority leader and the minority leader.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond. The yeas and nays are ordered on the point of order.\n\n[[Page S13729]]\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share some thoughts on a \ncentral issue to this health care reform legislation. It is something \nthat has gotten away from us. I do not believe we fully comprehended \nit. It is a critical issue.\n  It seems to me we are double-counting the money. We are counting \nmoney twice--maybe the largest amount of money ever having been counted \ntwice in the history of the world. It is very dangerous with regard to \nthe financial viability of the legislation we are looking at today.\n  It was promised by the President that this legislation would not add \none dime to the national debt. He said yesterday that this legislation \nwould strengthen Medicare. This is his quote:\n\n       . . . and Medicare will be stronger and its solvency \n     extended by nearly a decade.\n\n  I don't think that is accurate. We have had other Members of the \nDemocratic leadership say that.\n  What we know is we have, I think it is about $460 billion in tax \nincreases and $490 billion in tax increases and a little less than \nthat, $400-and-some-odd billion in savings to Medicare, and that \naccounts for the $871 billion the bill is supposed to cost in the first \n10 years. Of course, that is not an accurate ultimate cost since most \nof the benefits in the bill do not start until the fifth year. So when \nyou go the first full 10 years of the bill, it costs $2.5 trillion. \nBut, regardless, let's take this first 10 years. The assertion is that \nMedicare can be improved and that we can take money from it and that \nthis is going to make Medicare stronger and that somehow this is going \nto extend the solvency of Medicare, which is going insolvent by 2017. \nThat is because more and more people are retiring and people are living \nlonger, among other reasons. So the cost of Medicare goes up.\n  I guess what I am framing now is what I believe to be a matter of the \ngreatest importance. The argument is that somehow, by cutting benefits \nin Medicare by almost $\\1/2\\ trillion, we are somehow strengthening \nMedicare. That would be true if the money that was taken out of \nMedicare Programs and benefits and providers who are providing the \nbenefits--if that money were maintained in Medicare.\n  They go to the CMS, the institution that keeps up with Medicare \ncosts, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Chief Actuary \nthere, Mr. Richard Foster, and they ask him: Won't these reductions in \nMedicare expenses extend the life of Medicare? And he said yes. OK. He \nsaid yes. He writes this:\n\n       We estimate that the aggregate net savings to the Part A \n     trust fund under the PPACA--\n\n  That is the health care reform bill--\n\n     would postpone the exhaustion of the trust fund assets by 9 \n     years--that is from 2017 under current law to 2026 under the \n     proposed legislation.\n\n  Great. That is not a bad result. But then he goes on. I think he was \nsimply asked: If you reduce spending in Medicare by effecting these \ncuts and reductions in Medicare, will it extend the life? And he said \nit would. However, I think he felt he might have been used, and so he \ndidn't leave it right there. I think he believed there was something \nelse afoot in this deal. He goes on to say this:\n\n       In practice, the improved Part A financing--\n\n  That is what he is talking about, these cuts--\n\n     . . . the improved Part A financing cannot be simultaneously \n     used to finance other Federal outlays (such as the coverage \n     expansions under the PPACA)--\n\n  The health care bill--\n\n     and to extend the trust fund, despite the appearance of this \n     result from the respective accounting conventions.\n\n  Maybe I am wrong about this. I am happy to have a lot of people look \nat it. Wait a minute, we have the President of the United States \nyesterday saying that Medicare will be stronger and its solvency \nextended for nearly a decade. We have Senator Durbin and I think \nSenator Baucus and others saying the same thing. We are talking about \n$400 billion.\n\n  So I would think this Congress can get a straight answer somewhere. \nDon't you? Well, I have been asking staff, and they say it is double \ncounting.\n  I said: What do you mean it is double counting?\n  Well, Senator Gregg, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee--\nformer chairman of the Budget Committee--said it is double accounting. \nHe offered an amendment, a simple amendment that said any money that is \nsaved in Medicare stays in Medicare. Did that pass? No. They voted that \ndown. That should be a signal, I submit. That should be a red flag.\n  So now I am looking at this really, really hard because the way I see \nthe financial accounting of the bill, perhaps the largest bogus part of \nit is to say that the money that is being saved from Medicare is going \nto create this new program and, at the same time, saying the savings in \nMedicare are going to be used to extend the life of Medicare. You \ncannot do both.\n  That is what Mr. Foster said in his letter of December 10:\n\n       In practice, the improved Part A financing--\n\n  He is talking about the improved Part A financing of Medicare by \nthese cuts--\n\n     the improved Part A financing cannot be simultaneously used \n     to finance other Federal outlays (such as the coverage \n     expansions under the PPACA) and to extend the trust fund. . . \n     .\n\n  All right. You got it? Let's go back and leave out the parentheses:\n\n       . . . the improved Part A financing cannot be \n     simultaneously used to finance other Federal outlays . . . \n     and to extend the trust fund, despite the appearance of this \n     result from the respective accounting conventions.\n\n  So they got CBO to score it as if the money is going into the new \nhealth care reform, and they got CMS to score it as if it is saving \nMedicare.\n  Now, I was a Federal prosecutor for a long time. I know the \nresponsibilities placed on presidents of corporations. If the president \nof a corporation were to issue a prospectus and ask people to invest \nmoney in his company and support his program, his agenda, and he said: \nI have $400 billion or $400,000 I am going to spend in it, and he knew \nthe money was being spent on something else and he did not really have \nthat money, that is a criminal offense, and people would go to jail for \nit.\n  I am worried about it; I really am. This is unbelievable. So we are \ngoing to get to the bottom of this. If I am wrong, I would like to see \nwhere the money is coming from. So my question to my colleagues is--and \napparently this has been asked by staff for weeks and they have never \ngotten a straight answer--where do you get this $871 billion? How much \nof that are you counting coming from savings in Medicare; and where, \nprecisely, are you getting it from Medicare? If you are going to spend \nit on the new program, how are you going to say it is going to \nstrengthen Medicare as to its insolvency problem?\n  You cannot count the money twice, and I believe that is what Mr. \nFoster was suggesting; that you cannot simultaneously count the money \n``despite the appearance of this result from the respective accounting \nconventions.'' What he is saying is, CBO is following proper accounting \nconventions for their scoring and CMS is doing it their way and it \ngives the appearance that you have some money that can be spent twice. \nBut he said you cannot simultaneously use the same money. Now, isn't \nthat true? But in this body, I do not know.\n  What is another fundamental matter of budgetary importance that goes \nwith it? The President has repeatedly said that not one dime will be \nadded to the national debt, and it should not be. We cannot continue to \ndo that. So when this legislation started, the idea was we needed to \nreform a lot of problems in our health care situation.\n  One of the problems everybody recognized was that the doctors are not \ngetting paid in a proper fashion for the work they do. Under the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, we effected rules on how much doctors \nshould be paid, and if those rules went into effect today, doctors \nwould have a 21-percent pay cut on all Medicare work. Already Medicare \nphysicians are leaving the practice because they get paid much\n\n[[Page S13730]]\n\nless from the Federal Medicare Program than they do from private health \ninsurance. So they would rather do private work than Medicare. But they \ndo Medicare--most doctors do--but if you took them another 21 percent \ndown, they would not.\n  Every year, they come here and ask the Congress to waive this cut, \nand Congress--as part of the duplicity of this body that has gone on \nunder both parties, but each year it gets worse and worse--we fix it, \nand we do not execute the cut. But we only do it for 1 year. So when we \nhave a budget, it assumes a 10-year budget. As President Obama \nsubmitted it to us, it assumes in the first year you pay the physicians \nand you do not cut their pay. Then for 9 years you assume they get a \n21-percent reduction. It is a gimmick because you cannot cut the \nphysicians 21 percent; and we know that. If we budgeted for the full \namount, we are going to have to pay physicians, and we are going to pay \nphysicians, then there would be a big hole because we do not have the \nmoney and we either have to cut something else, raise taxes, or raise \nthe debt. What we have been doing is paying for it with more debt.\n  Well, each year, the doctors get all upset because they are staring \nat a 21-percent pay cut. All their representatives in the AMA and \neverybody come up every year and tell us: Don't cut our pay, and we do \nnot--1 year at a time.\n  This is a misrepresentation. It hides the financial precariousness of \nour position. It is not good. It should never continue. It needs to be \npermanently fixed, and that was supposed to be part of health care \nreform from the beginning. The President said that is what he was going \nto do. The leadership on the other side said that is what they were \ngoing to do.\n  But what happened--when they met in their secret rooms, and they all \nwheeled and dealed and tried to add up these numbers and see how they \ncould manipulate numbers and scores and accounting to make it add up so \nthey could say it would not add one penny to the debt--they could not \nget around the $250 billion it takes to pay the doctors. They could not \ndo it.\n  They say, under this bill, there is a $130 billion surplus over the \nfirst 10 years. But it does not fix the doctor payments for Medicare in \nhealth care work, Medicaid. It does not fix it. So when you fix it, it \ncosts $250 billion. There is no dispute about that. We have analyzed \nthat. The accounting numbers are clear: $250 billion.\n  So what the Democrats tried to do--it was a clever--Senator Ensign \nreferred to it the other day as a shell game. They moved the doctor fix \nout of the health care reform--just took it out--and so, therefore, you \ndo not have the $250 billion hole and you just put it over here. They \nthought they would be clever, they would just pass it, and we would add \nit all to the debt. They tried to do so, so they could tell the doctors \nthey tried to vote to have a permanent fix of their payments. \n``Doctors, we are going to take care of it. We'll just pass it, and \nevery penny of this will add to the debt.''\n  Well, 13 Democrats would not swallow that, and I think every \nRepublican opposed it, and it went down. So now I think we have a 2-\nmonth fix. Two months is where we are working from today, so we would \nnot have a slashing of payments to physicians by failure to fix it.\n  So they just took it out, and I assume we are going to have some \nother gimmick to hide that $250 billion. So if you put the $250 billion \ncost into health care reform, you end up with a $120 billion deficit \nright off the bat. Then, when you get into this double accounting of \n$450 billion, you have really got a mess. They are estimating $871 \nbillion in income for the first 10 years of this plan. As I analyze it, \nyou have a $250 billion hole from not paying the doctors, and then you \nhave a $400-plus billion double accounting--the savings from Medicare.\n  So it is just not good. I am telling you, we only have one President. \nHe has a lot of things on his mind, and it is very frustrating. But I \nwill say one more thing he said at that press conference. He said, and \nhe has repeatedly stated: It is going to reduce health care premiums \nfor your insurance. Right? This was yesterday, after this bill passed. \nHe says he is tired of people carping about the cost of the bill. \nRemember him saying that--tired of these carpers? I guess he is talking \nabout me because I have been carping about the cost of it for some time \nbecause the numbers do not add up.\n  All right. They claim the legislation will reduce insurance costs. \nThis is the score of the CBO about small businesses. What about \ninsurance premiums? If you are small businesses, the average premiums \ntoday for a family is $13,300. If the Reid bill passes, by 2016 the \npremiums will be $19,200. Is that cutting premiums? Well, yes, it is \nbecause under the Reid bill it would increase, on average, 5.38 \npercent. But if we did not pass any bill at all, it would increase it \n5.46 percent. So it saved money; it reduced your premium. It will be \n$19,200 instead of $19,300. That is for small businesses.\n  What about for large businesses? Does it cut insurance premiums \nthere? For large business plans, under the Reid bill, the increase, if \nwe pass this legislation, would be 5.41 percent per year in your \npremiums. If you do not pass the bill at all, it would be 5.56 percent. \nIs that a savings? Very little. Instead of $21,100, under the Reid bill \nyou would pay $20,300.\n  Then, finally, the individual market--this is the people who already \nare the ones who are getting hurt because they are not in group plans; \nthey don't have employers paying a third, a half, or whatever, for \ninsurance; they don't get the same tax breaks. They are getting killed. \nBarbers, individual people who can't get into group plans, it is \nhorrible for them. What happens to the individual market? Under the \nReid bill, their premiums would go up 7.77 percent per year. They would \ngo up more than the others. What about if we didn't do anything? How \nmuch would their bills go up then, their insurance bills? Only 5.51 \npercent. Theirs go up more than 2 percent.\n  So I am just saying this legislation may have a great vision, it may \nhave a great idea about trying to make the system work better, but it \ndoesn't. These are huge costs. It is not financially sound. It is not \ngoing to reduce our premiums. It is going to increase the percentage of \nwealth in America going to health care instead of reducing it as I \nthought we were supposed to do from the beginning.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Kyl, here. I would just leave it at that. \nI thank my colleagues. But if I am correct about these numbers, we \nshouldn't vote for the bill. People should change their vote. If I am \nin error, I would like to be informed of how I am in error.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I listened carefully to what my colleague \nsaid, and as a member of the Finance Committee, I can tell him that he \nis not in error. What he said about premiums going up under this \nlegislation is true. The promise was that premiums would not go up. \nWell, they continue to go up. In fact, in the case of the individual \nmarket, the legislation itself causes them to go up between 10 and 13 \npercent. My colleague is not in error.\n  If the Reid bill has a motto, it is ``in government we trust.'' With \nthe turn of every page, it is no exaggeration to say the Reid bill \ncreates a Washington takeover of health care, to wit, $2.5 trillion in \nnew government spending; $494 billion in new taxes; $465 billion in \nMedicare cuts; 70 new government programs; and higher health insurance \npremiums for individuals, families, and businesses. It is packed with \nnew Federal requirements and mandates that amount to a stunning assault \non liberty. Even in the absence of a government-run insurance plan, \nthis bill would give the government virtually total control over health \ncare. The bill itself is the government option.\n  Michael Cannon, a health policy expert at the Cato Institute, warns \nthat the bill's linchpin, the requirement that all individuals buy a \ngovernment-approved insurance plan, would be ``the most sweeping and \ndangerous measure in any of the bills before Congress.''\n  Of course, if Congress mandates that every American purchase health \ninsurance, then Congress gets to define exactly what that health \ninsurance entails. Welcome to the future, where bureaucrats and \npoliticians know what is best for families, small businesses, and \nseniors. For example, under this legislation the government would set \nnew Federal rating rules. Rating rules dictate how insurers may \ncalculate premiums, which experts estimate would\n\n[[Page S13731]]\n\nincrease premiums by a whopping 72 percent in my home State of Arizona. \nThey would determine the coverage benefits for all plans regardless of \nconsumer preferences or health care needs. The government would limit \ninsurers to offering only four plans. You have to offer two; you can't \noffer any more than four. They would prohibit individuals over the age \nof 30 from enrolling in a catastrophic health care plan. And to \nhighlight the magnitude of government interference and micromanagement, \nthe bill even dictates the number of pages--by the way, it is no more \nthan 4--and the font size--no smaller than 12 point--of the summary of \nbenefits. These are just a few examples of the heavyhanded government \ncontrols. Indeed, the word ``shall'' appears 3,607 times in the Reid \nbill. I haven't had a chance yet to count how many more times it \nappears in the almost 400-page amendment that has been now filed.\n  In my view, however, the most dangerous consequence of the Washington \ntakeover of health care is the inevitable rationing that will result in \nthe delay and denial of care. Ensuring access to the highest quality \ncare and protecting the sacred doctor-patient relationship should be \nthe fundamental goals of any health reform effort. These intangibles \nare the cornerstones of U.S. health care, the very things Americans \nvalue most, that the Reid bill puts in jeopardy. Don't look for the \nwords ``ration'' or ``withhold coverage'' or ``delay access to care'' \nin the bill. Obviously, they are not there. Instead, contemplate the \ninevitable result of new Federal rules that aim to reduce health care \ncosts but will inevitably result in delayed or denied tests, \ntreatments, and procedures deemed to be too expensive. For example, the \nReid bill would establish a Medicare Commission. This is an unelected \nbody of bureaucrats with the task of finding, and I am quoting here, \n``sources of excess cost growth,'' meaning, of course, tests and \ntreatments that are allegedly too expensive or whose coverage would \nmean too much government spending on seniors. The Commission's \ndecisions will result in the delay and denial of care.\n  Medicare already delays more medical claims than private insurers do, \nbut this bill would redistribute Medicare payments to physicians based \non how much they spend treating seniors. It would rely on \nrecommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force--the \nentity, by the way, that recently recommended against mammograms for \nwomen under the age of 50--to set preventive health care benefits, and \nit would authorize the Federal Government to use comparative \neffectiveness research when making coverage determinations. It is this \nlast issue--comparative effectiveness research--that I wish to discuss \nin more detail.\n  The Reid bill would create a new entity called the Patient-Centered \nOutcomes Research Institute to conduct comparative effectiveness \nresearch. This research, which is already done in the private sector, \ncompares the effectiveness of two or more health care services or \ntreatments, and, of course, it is used to provide doctors with \ninformation as to what works best in most cases. The goal is to provide \npatients and doctors with better information regarding the risks and \nbenefits of a drug, let's say, for example, versus surgery in a \nparticular kind of case. The question before us is not as to the merits \nof the research but, rather, whether the research should be used by the \ngovernment to determine the treatments and services covered by \ninsurance.\n  In a recent interview, President Obama said:\n\n       What I think the government could do effectively is to be \n     an honest broker in assessing and evaluating treatment \n     options.\n\n  The President believes the government should assess and evaluate \nhealth care treatments, and certainly that is how health care works in \nother countries such as Great Britain. For example, there, they have \nthe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence; the acronym \nis NIHCE. NIHCE routinely uses comparative effectiveness research to \nmake cost-benefit calculations. They don't even attempt to hide it. On \nits Web site, NIHCE says:\n\n       With the rapid advancement in modern medicine, most people \n     accept that no publicly funded health care system, including \n     the National Health Service, can possibly pay for every new \n     medical treatment which becomes available. The enormous costs \n     involved mean that choices have to be made.\n\n  Choices are made, and this is the key: They are made by the \ngovernment, not by patients and doctors.\n  The National Health Service, which runs Britain's health care system, \nhas issued guidance known as the Liverpool Care Pathway whereby a \ndoctor can withdraw fluids and drugs from a patient if the medical team \ndiagnoses that the patient is close to death. Many are then put on \ncontinuous sedation so that they die free of pain. Doctors warn that \nsome patients are being wrongly put on the pathway, which is creating a \nself-fulfilling prophecy that they would die because sedation often \nmasks the signs of improvement.\n\n  Also, due to excessively long waiting periods, the National Health \nService launched what they call an End Waiting, Change Lives campaign. \nThe goal here was to reduce patients' waiting times to 18 weeks from \nreferral to treatment--18 weeks. That is supposed to be a good thing? \nThat is 4\\1/2\\ months for an appointment. This is why many Europeans \nand Canadians visit the United States each year, places such as the \nMayo Clinic in Arizona, for access to the treatments that are denied to \nthem in their own countries.\n  These are the dangers of a government-run health care system. The \ngovernment, not the patients and doctors, makes the health care \ndecisions. The government decides if your health care is an effective \nuse of government resources, and the government inevitably interferes \nin your ability to access care. That is rationing, and it is wrong. \nThis is not what Americans want or expected from health care reform. \nYet it is precisely the path Congress is taking. Perhaps that is why 61 \npercent of Americans disapprove of this bill.\n  Nothing in the Reid bill would prohibit the Federal Government from \nusing comparative effectiveness research, just as it has done in \nBritain, as a tool to delay or deny coverage of a health care treatment \nor service. The bill actually empowers the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to use comparative effectiveness research when making \ncoverage determinations. For example, on page 1,684 of the original \nbill, it says:\n\n       The Secretary may only use evidence and findings from \n     research conducted under section 1181 to make a determination \n     regarding coverage . . .\n\n  And so on.\n  As the Washington Examiner notes:\n\n       Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius would \n     be awarded unprecedented new powers under the proposal, \n     including the authority to decide what medical care should be \n     covered by insurers as well as the terms and conditions of \n     coverage and who should receive it. The Reid legislation \n     lists 1,697 times where the Secretary is given the authority \n     to create, determine, or define things in the bill.\n\n  I know my colleagues will point to language that says: Well, the \nSecretary can't make these decisions on rationing care solely on the \nbasis of comparative effectiveness research. Whoopee. I am not sure if \nthat is a word we can use on the Senate floor, but big deal. You can't \nmake it solely on that basis, but you can use comparative effectiveness \nresearch to ration care. That is wrong, and that is what this bill \npermits. And despite numerous times to get a simple amendment I offered \nto say no comparative effectiveness research can be used by a Federal \nagency to deny care or treatment--simple--the other side says: No, we \nalready have it covered. It is good enough. Our language is fine. You \ndon't need that simple statement that would prevent this research from \nbeing used in that fashion. I think it is pretty clear that the attempt \nhere is to be able to do it.\n  During the Finance Committee, I asked the majority counsel why they \ndidn't bar the Federal Government from using comparative effectiveness \nresearch as a tool to ration care. The staff replied:\n\n       The reason why we did not include an express prohibition is \n     we did not want to limit the institute from considering areas \n     of science that have a budgetary impact, if you will.\n\n  That is, of course, precisely the problem. Americans do not want the \nFederal Government using this research as a cost-cutting tool.\n  Regina Herzlinger, a professor at Harvard Business School, warns: CER \ncould easily morph into an instrument of health care rationing by the \nFederal Government without the appropriate safeguards.\n\n[[Page S13732]]\n\n  That is why earlier this year I joined Senator McConnell and Senator \nRoberts and Senator Crapo in introducing the PATIENTS Act, and it \ncreates this firewall to prevent the use of research for rationing. We \nfiled it as an amendment, but, of course, we are not going to be able \nto vote on it now that cloture has been invoked. This is the third time \nthis year we have tried to institute this pro-patient firewall, but \nobviously we are not going to be able to vote on it, as I said.\n  From the very beginning of the health care reform debate, I have \nbelieved that any bill should be rooted in a simple yet fundamental \nprinciple: that very American should be able to choose the doctor, \nhospital, and health plan of his or her choice. No Washington \nbureaucrat should interfere with that right or substitute the \ngovernment's judgment for that of a physician. There is nothing more \nimportant to Americans, other than maybe their freedom, than the health \nof their family--and that does, by the way, include an element of \nfreedom, obviously, the freedom to do what you think is best for your \nfamily. We would all do anything we could to help a loved one. We don't \nwant Washington impeding our ability to do so.\n  Maybe that is why this new Washington Post-ABC poll ``finds the \npublic generally fearful that a revamped system would bring higher \ncosts while worsening the quality of their care.'' Even, they say, \nthose without insurance are evenly divided on the question of whether \ntheir care would be better if the system were overhauled.\n  The American people get it. The bill itself is the government option, \nbut in government, they do not trust.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of \nthe Patient Protection and Affordability Act, and I wish to give some \nof the reasons why I am supporting this important piece of legislation.\n  Before my colleague leaves the floor, I would like to respond to his \nlast comment. One of the reasons the American people are having \ndifficulty believing the government can do anything right is that he \nand his colleagues have spent the last several decades convincing them \nthat the government is the problem and that the government can't do \nanything right.\n  Even in the face of strong evidence that suggests otherwise, they \ncontinue that worn-out, tired mantra. People in my State and around the \nNation are getting tired of it because they know that government must \nstand sometimes to protect them from abusive practices in the private \nmarketplace, abusive practices of insurance companies, to try to level \nthe playing field and set the rules. Of course, those on the other side \ndon't believe in a level playing field and rules. They believe citizens \nin our country should be at the whim and mercy of the private market. \nThat has been their philosophy for decades. That is not the philosophy \nof the Democratic Party. We believe in a public-private partnership. We \nbelieve in a level playing field. We believe in giving people the \nopportunity to earn their way, with fair rules in place. That party has \nnever believed that, and that is at great issue in the underlying \ndebate. They can continue to fabricate myths and lies about this bill, \nbut those of us who support it will proudly continue to tell the truth \nabout it.\n  I have served in public office for 30 years as a State legislator, \nState treasurer, and now as a United States Senator. But it doesn't \ntake 30 years to know the health care system our citizens live under \nand live with today is expensive, wasteful, and painfully inefficient.\n  From my visits with doctors and nurses, to seniors on Medicare, to \nrecent college graduates struggling to afford coverage, to dozens and \ndozens of small business owners who are frightened to death that they \nare not going to be able to continue in their business because of the \nrising cost of health care, it has become clear to me that the time for \nreform is now.\n  In Louisiana, the average family spends more than $12,000 each year \nfor health insurance. That is almost 100 percent of the earnings of a \nperson who is working 40 hours a week at the minimum wage. Think about \nthat. Only in one developed country in the world would we have a system \nthat says if you go to work 40 or 50 hours a week, you have the \nprivilege of taking all that money and having to purchase health care \nin the system that my colleagues on the other side want to advocate \nfor. That is wrong. We must drive down the cost to the government, to \nbusinesses, and to families. This bill will begin to do that.\n  Since 2000, the amount that working families are charged for health \ninsurance has increased by 91 percent. That doesn't seem to concern my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. If this Congress stood by \nand did nothing, those costs would nearly double in the next 6 years, \nwith economists predicting that families in my State will pay a \nwhopping $23,000 for insurance in 2016--an 85-percent increase. To say \nthat a different way, that means that if we do nothing, the average \nfamily in Louisiana will be paying 60 percent of their income for \nhealth care--if they can find it and if they can get around a \npreexisting condition--leaving only 40 percent of their wages to cover \nfood, education, children, housing, transportation, and everything else \nfamilies need their funds for.\n  These skyrocketing costs are burdening families not just in Louisiana \nbut in every State. We don't have a choice but to change. We cannot \ncontinue to rely just on the private market without reform, without \nguidelines, and without incentives to change. Our people will be priced \nout of the market. Maybe that is what my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle want. That is not what I want.\n  Small businesses are struggling to remain competitive and to turn a \nprofit. In the face of highly unstable and unpredictable health care \ncosts this is getting harder and harder. As chair of the Small Business \nCommittee, I have held 23 hearings and roundtables just this year, and \nseveral of them have been focused on how the current health care system \nand volatile health care costs are hurting our Nation's small \nbusinesses.\n  Today, small businesses are seeing their health care costs increase \nfaster than the prices of the products and services they sell four \ntimes faster than the rate of inflation since 2001. Premiums for single \npolicies increased by 74 percent for small businesses in the last eight \nyears, according to a 2009 Kaiser Family Foundation survey. Nationally, \n40 percent of small businesses say that health care costs have had a \nnegative impact on other parts of their business.\n  What are we supposed to do, stand here and do nothing? No--that is \nwhy acting now is so important. That is why this bill is so important, \nbecause the status quo is unsustainable. It is unsustainable for our \ngovernment and it is unsustainable for small businesses.\n  Even though families, businesses, and government budgets are being \nsqueezed by unsustainable costs, Senate Republicans are doing \neverything they can to argue for the status quo. Why? I don't know. \nEach day, they find a new excuse for their obstruction. I wish they had \nput the same amount of passion, energy, and creative thinking into \ncontributing policies and ideas to this debate as they have into their \ndelaying tactics. Every amendment they offered was to send the bill \nbackward, not forward. They seem hell-bent on defeating and not \nimproving this bill, contrary to their statements on the floor.\n  The Republicans have charged that we are rushing in to vote for this \nbill. That is simply not true. We have been debating this issue on and \noff for the last 87 years.\n  Republican President, Theodore Roosevelt, made national health \ninsurance a plank in his party platform when he sought the Presidency \nin 1912. President Harry Truman, in 1945 and then again in 1948, called \non Congress to pass reform legislation to expand quality health care \ncoverage to more Americans. President Truman believed we needed a \nstronger system and that the federal government must play a role in \nestablishing a more robust system of care. His critics called his \napproach ``socialized medicine.'' Sound familiar?\n  Only in Washington would 87 years be considered rushing!\n  This has been a debate that has gone on with particular intensity for \nthe last 2 years, as our Presidential candidates took to the airwaves \nin debate after debate--Republican and Democratic--outlining their \nideas for reform. This hasn't sprung up in the last\n\n[[Page S13733]]\n\n2 weeks. This hasn't sprung up in the last 2 months.\n  Millions of Americans went to the polls, understanding, in large \nmeasure, what we needed to do to change the system. Despite the \nrhetoric from the other side, that is the reality, and the record will \nreflect that. Instead of coming to the table and working with Democrats \nto write a bipartisan bill, Republicans chose to put partisan party \npolitics first. I listened to my friend, Max Baucus, this morning. I, \nmyself, who thought I had followed carefully the work of the Senate \nFinance Committee, was actually moved to hear the number of meetings--\ndozens and dozens, maybe hundreds and hundreds of meetings--he \nattempted to have in a bipartisan way months ago, years ago, with \nRepublicans. Then, at some point, they decided they thought that \npolitics was more important than policy. I think they made the wrong \nchoice.\n\n  They fabricated death panels, distorted Medicare cuts, and undermined \nand disrespected the role of government in protecting its citizens. \nThey have engaged in a relentless misinformation campaign, aimed solely \nat using fear to sway public opinion against this bill.\n  Recently--just yesterday--Senator John McCain, our colleague from \nArizona, claimed that the American people are opposed to reform, and he \nspeaks about the will of the majority. I remind my colleague from \nArizona that the will of the majority spoke loud and clear last year \nwhen they elected President Obama to be President and decided not to \nelect him. The President is carrying out the will of the majority of \nthe people by trying to provide for them hope and opportunity in an \narea that has eluded us for 87 years.\n  This is a good effort, a strong effort, and I most certainly believe \nthat the will of the American people is being heard. The other side has \ntried to paint a picture of a nation opposed to health care reform. \nRecent polls show otherwise. When we cut through the misinformation and \nscare tactics, when Americans hear what is in the bill, they \noverwhelmingly support it.\n  According to a recent CNN poll, 73 percent of Americans support \nexpanding Medicaid for the poor. Americans know what most of us know: \nMost people on Medicaid are the working poor. These are people who wake \nup early in the morning, work hard all day, and they go back home at \nnight, often by taking public transportation because they don't have an \nautomobile. They work hard. They are American citizens. But they don't \nhave enough money to spend 60 percent or 80 percent of their income on \nhealth insurance in a broken, unbridled, unfixed private market. So we \njoin together with our States to provide them access to care through \nthe Medicaid system. I support that. And in this bill, the Federal \nGovernment will pick up a large share of the cost of expanding \ncoverage.\n  That same poll showed that providing subsidies for families that make \nup to $88,000 a year is favored by 67 percent of Americans. Additional \nregulations on insurance companies, such as banning denial of coverage \nfor those with preexisting conditions are favored by 60 percent of the \nAmerican people.\n  I am one of the Democrats who didn't want to eliminate insurance \ncompanies. I believe in private markets. But there have to be certain \nrules and regulations in order for the private market to work for \neveryone, and not just for those with wealth or those with the inside \nscoop on how private markets work.\n  So we are incentivizing a healthier insurance industry--not coddling \nit but encouraging it to be competitive and to provide services and \ncoverage for more people in our country.\n  A recent poll by the Mellman Group shows that support for this bill \nexists in all States. In my home State of Louisiana, when the \nprovisions of the bill were actually read to voters, 57 percent of \nLouisianians supported the bill, with 43 percent strongly supporting \nthe reform effort. And most importantly, 62 percent of Louisianians \noppose using the filibuster to stop health care reform.\n  I will read the language used in the poll because people say you can \nsay anything in polls, which is true. If pollsters are not reputable, \nthey can twist and distort. I will read the language used by the poll \nto describe the plan:\n\n       The plan would require every American citizen to have \n     health insurance and require large employers to provide \n     coverage to their employees. It would require insurance \n     companies to cover those with pre-existing conditions and \n     prevent them from dropping coverage for people who get sick, \n     while providing incentives for affordable preventive care. \n     Individuals and small businesses that do not have coverage \n     would be able to select a private insurance plan from a range \n     of options sold on a National Insurance Exchange. Lower and \n     middle income people would receive subsidies to help them \n     afford this insurance, while those individuals who like the \n     coverage they already have will be able to keep their current \n     plan.\n\n  This is a very accurate description of this bill before us--the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It is not a government \ntakeover. There is no public option. There is a national plan available \nnow to every American, just like the Members of Congress and the \nFederal employees have. There will be exchanges--similar to shopping \ncenters--and Americans will be go to the exchanges and choose from a \nnumber of insurance options. The prices will be more transparent. \nAdministrative costs will be lowered. You will not need a Ph.D. to be \nable to read these policies--they will be written in plain English.\n  Again, this is not a government takeover, as the other side claims. \nThat is why 57 percent of people in Louisiana, when given the right \ninformation, without the rhetoric, without the railing, without the \ndistortions, say: Absolutely, I am for a public-private partnership.\n  The American people elected President Obama to bring about change. A \nbig part of the change President Obama and Democrats promised during \nthe campaign was improving health care for all Americans. Thanks to the \nPresident's leadership and the leadership of Senator Reid and many \nothers, we are taking several meaningful steps toward fulfilling that \npromise.\n  With the exception of two colleagues, Republicans have failed to \nnegotiate in good faith. I want to say how much I respect our two \ncolleagues from Maine, Senator Snowe and Senator Collins. I have been \nin dozens of meetings with both of them and know that they struggled \nmightily to find a way to work with us and to support this bill. I have \nnot spoken with them in the last few days, so I will not discuss their \nreasons for withholding their support. I am sure they will express \nthose on the floor. But I can say that they are the exception to the \nrule. I know Senator Grassley, Senator Graham, Senator Bennett, and a \nfew others engaged early on. I want to acknowledge them and I \nappreciate their good will. But, unfortunately, the leadership of the \nRepublican Party chose politics over policy. I am disappointed that not \na single Republican could support an end to the filibuster. I suppose \nit is easy to stay unified when the only word in your vocabulary is NO. \nAlthough Democrats did not initially agree on exactly how to get there, \nwe were united in saying yes to the common goal of delivering \nmeaningful health care reform to America's families and small \nbusinesses. It has been difficult. Some of us come from very \nconservative States. Some of us come from liberal States. We have \ndiverse populations in our States that have different needs and \ndifferent views. It has not been pretty, but it has been a practical \nand hopefully a positive exercise that will bring comfort, support, and \nstrength to the American people and to our economy.\n  I do hold out hope that when we take our vote on final passage, \nRepublicans will recognize this historic opportunity and vote in favor \nof this bill that will reduce costs and increase access to health care \nfor millions of Americans.\n  Last month, I stood here on the floor of the Senate to announce my \nintention to vote in favor of bringing Senator Reid's melded bill to \nthe floor. At the time, I was very clear that my vote was not an \nindication that I supported that particular version of the bill. My \nvote was to bring that bill to the floor so that we could do the \nlegislative work the American people sent us here to do.\n  After weeks of floor debate and amendments and round-the-clock \nnegotiations, that work has been completed. We produced a health care \nbill that is significantly improved from the one that came to the \nfloor. I would like to share a few thoughts about why, in my view, it \nis improved.\n\n[[Page S13734]]\n\n  Through tough negotiations, Senate Democrats have developed a \nconsensus that blends the best of public and private approaches to \nreduce costs, expand coverage, and increase choice and competition for \nAmericans and have done so without a government-run public option.\n  Since I continue to hear distortions from my colleagues on the other \nside, let me be clear: there is no government-run public option in this \nbill. Instead, we reached an agreement to provide private health \ninsurance plans to be sold nationwide. The Office of Personnel \nManagement will negotiate lower premiums, just as they negotiate the \nplans currently available to Federal employees and to Members of \nCongress. Importantly, we ensured that at least one nonprofit plan will \nbe offered in every State exchange and that the States cannot opt out \nat the whim of every Governor and legislature. For the first time in \nour Nation's history, Americans will have an opportunity to have the \nsame kind of insurance that federal employees, including Members of \nCongress, have.\n  In addition, there has been a lot of talk about the cost of this bill \nto the government and to taxpayers. There have been a number of false \nclaims about how this bill will add to the deficit and be a burden to \nour children and grandchildren. The fact is, this bill is completely \npaid for and it will reduce the deficit by $132 billion over the next \n10 years and as much as $1.3 trillion in the following 10 years.\n  Based on our efforts, the Congressional Budget Office and the \nNation's premier economists have confirmed that premiums will go down \nover time or remain stable so that wages for millions of Americans can \nincrease. When this bill is passed, 3l million uninsured Americans will \nhave access to quality health coverage.\n  This bill is a big step toward fiscal responsibility and a stronger \neconomy. It aims to achieve these goals by streamlining the health \ninsurance market, ensuring efficiency, and limiting insurance company \nadministrative costs, and to some degree, their profits.\n  It also imposes an excise tax on insurance companies with high-cost \nplans. This will encourage employers to be more value-conscious \npurchasers of health insurance. Employers are expected to choose \ncheaper plans, and as less capital is spent on health care, wages will \ngo up for hard-working families. Economists predict that this could \ngive American workers a $223 billion pay raise, amounting to $660 per \nhousehold.\n  I strongly urge that this provision be included in the final \nlegislation. I know that there is fierce opposition to this on the \nHouse side. But--and the President has said this publicly and privately \nto us--this is one of the most significant provisions that will help \ndrive down costs for the entire health care system. It cannot be \njettisoned at this point in the debate. This provision must be in the \nbill for me to give my final support.\n  We have also created administrative savings through insurance \nexchanges, and during Senate consideration of the bill we strengthened \nthe Independent Medicare Advisory Board to find more ways to reduce \ncost growth and improve quality.\n  The final Senate bill includes a substantial investment in community \nhealth centers and will provide funding to expand access to health care \nin rural communities and under-served urban areas as well. In \nLouisiana, federally-supported health clinics have saved the state over \n$354 million in emergency room visits by the uninsured. The legislation \nalso expands access by increasing funding for rural health care \nproviders and training programs for physician and other health care \nproviders.\n  There are many parts of the current bill that I am proud to have \nfought for. The bill creates health insurance exchanges that will \nprovide individuals, families, and small businesses with a wide variety \nof affordable choices and ensure that they will always have coverage, \nwhether they change jobs, lose a job, move or get sick. These state-\nbased exchanges will enable consumers to comparison shop online for \nhealth insurance which will drive down costs by increasing choice and \ncompetition.\n  The exchange will help the uninsured obtain needed coverage and will \nalso help the more than 200,000 Louisiana residents who currently do \nnot have insurance through their employer to get quality coverage at an \naffordable price. Many of these Louisianians in the exchange will \nqualify for a tax credit to help them purchase the insurance of their \nchoice.\n  For example, in Calcasieu Parish, the median household income is \n$39,713. In the exchange created by this bill, the average family in \nCalcasieu would receive an affordability credit that limits what they \nspend on their premium to around 5.6% of their income or $2,225. \nConsidering, right now the average Louisiana family is spending up to \n28% of their income on health care, this is a huge improvement.\n  This version of the bill that we improved on the Senate floor now \nincludes additional much-needed help for small business owners, led by \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Stabenow, myself, and other members of my \ncommittee. Senator Shaheen, Senator Cardin, Senator Hagan, Senator \nBayh, and others worked very diligently on these provisions.\n  While small businesses make up 74 percent of Louisiana's businesses, \nonly 37 percent of them offered health coverage benefits in 2008. Of \nthose, 62 percent say they are struggling to do so. Of the 64 percent \nwho don't provide insurance, 87 percent say they can't afford it.\n  I worked closely with Senator Stabenow to improve affordability and \nchoices for small businesses and amended the bill to make the bridge \ncredit available immediately to help small businesses afford health \ninsurance for their employees, and improve the tax credits for small \nbusinesses. This means that small businesses who want to offer quality \nhealth insurance to their employees will get tax breaks right away, \nrather than waiting until 2011. I also worked with Senator Lincoln to \nexpand the number of small businesses that will be eligible for tax \ncredits so that more small businesses get help in offering health \ninsurance coverage for their employees--allowing more small business \nworkers to benefit. In all, these changes bring an additional $13 \nbillion in tax relief--on top of the $27 billion already in the bill--\nto small businesses.\n\n  If you own a small business of 25 or less employees here is how \nreform will help you: Businesses with 25 or less employees whose \naverage annual wages are less than $50,000 will get immediate help \nthrough a three-year bridge credit. The creation of exchanges and a 2 \nyear exchange tax credit will lift the burden of excessive paperwork \nadministrative costs. The exchanges will create more stable, secure \nchoices for your employees\n  In Louisiana, more than 50,000 small businesses could be helped by \nthis small business tax credit proposal!\n  This will help small business owners such as Mary Noel Black and her \nhusband, who own a UPS franchise store in Baton Rouge. They offer their \nfour employees group coverage and are willing to pay half the cost, but \nthe premium rates have gone up so much that neither the workers nor the \nbusiness can afford to pay the $3,600 a year per employee for \ninsurance. To help Mary pay for the health insurance of each employee, \nbeginning in 2011, Mary could get a $1,260 bridge credit per employee \nunder this bill for 3 years. Then, in 2014, if she purchases coverage \nthrough the exchange, her business is eligible for an exchange credit \nof $1,800 per employee for an even more generous tax credit for another \n2 years. This savings could mean the difference between offering \ninsurance or dropping coverage because instead of costing her business \n$14,400 a year now for her four employees--a cost that is just \nunaffordable--the tax credit could initially bring her cost down to \n$9,360 and later to $7,200.\n  Through our work on the Senate floor during this public debate, we \nhave made this good bill better for small business. Not only have we \nextended and expanded the small business tax credits, the legislation \nincludes several amendments I authored to ensure small businesses \ncontinue to have a seat at the table once this bill is implemented.\n  The bill requires that small businesses receive information regarding \nreinsurance for early retirees, small business tax credits, and other \nissues specifically for small businesses regarding affordable health \ncare options.\n  It lists Small Business Administration resource partners as eligible \nrecipients of exchange public awareness\n\n[[Page S13735]]\n\ngrants and will include all Small Business Administration partners in \nthe program, including Women's Business Centers, SCORE, Minority \nBusiness Centers, Veteran Business Centers, and others.\n  The bill now requires the Government Accountability Office to \nspecifically review the impact of exchanges on access to affordable \nhealth care for small businesses to ensure that exchanges are indeed \nmaking a difference for small business owners.\n  It also clearly states that agencies cannot waive the Federal \nacquisition regulation, which requires them to report small business \ncontracting numbers and meet small business contracting goals of 23 \npercent.\n  There is a provision that modifies the definition of a full-time \nemployee to take into account fluctuation in employee hours, and reduce \nthe impact of employer responsibility requirements for industries with \nhigh turnover and that rely on part-time employees.\n  The bill eliminates penalties for businesses that wait up to 60 days \nto provide health insurance to their full-time employees.\n  Finally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act establishes a \nnational workforce commission to gather information on the health care \nworkforce and better coordinate and implement workforce planning and \nanalysis. The managers' amendment ensures that small businesses and the \nself-employed will be represented on the commission.\n  These are important considerations for small businesses and I was \nproud to ensure these concerns were addressed through the amendment \nprocess.\n  Despite claims from opponents of the bill, we have taken important \nsteps to strengthen Medicare, not weaken it. The Senate health care \nreform bill creates an independent Medicare advisory board to find ways \nto reduce cost growth and improve quality and moves to a system that \nrewards quality over quantity. It reduces payments for preventable \nhospital readmissions in Medicare, and cuts waste, fraud and abuse by \nenhancing oversight, identifying areas prone to fraud and requiring \nMedicare and Medicaid providers and suppliers to establish compliance \nprograms.\n  As much as our Republican colleagues have tried to scare seniors into \nopposing this bill, the fact is that Louisiana's 650,000 Medicare \nbeneficiaries stand to gain from this health care reform bill. The AARP \nand many seniors' organizations are continuing to support this bill \nbecause they know it improves care for our seniors.\n  The bill lowers premiums by reducing Medicare's overpayments to \nprivate plans. All Medicare beneficiaries pay the price of excessive \noverpayments through higher premiums--even the 78 percent of seniors in \nLouisiana who are not enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. Without \nreform a typical couple in traditional Medicare would pay nearly $90 in \nadditional Medicare premiums next year to subsidize these private \nplans.\n  Our bill extends the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by 9 years and \nlays the groundwork for a more sustainable health system. Thanks to \nthese reform efforts, there will be no additional cost for preventive \nservices under the Medicare program. This includes a free wellness \nvisit and personalized prevention plan designed to help give \nbeneficiaries the resources they need to take better care of themselves \nin these important years.\n  This legislation puts taxpayers' dollars above insurance company \nprofits by forcing insurers to bid competitively for the business of \nMedicare beneficiaries and makes changes to the Medicare Advantage \npayment structure that will give insurers an incentive to deliver more \nvalue.\n  Another critical aspect of the bill is that it increases the amount \nof coverage Medicare Part D beneficiaries receive before they begin to \npay out of pocket for their prescriptions. Right now, roughly 116,000 \nMedicare beneficiaries in Louisiana hit a wall in Medicare Part D drug \ncoverage that will cost some of them an average of $4,080 per year. \nThis reform legislation will provide a 50 percent discount for brand-\nname drugs.\n  Some of the bill's most important provisions will benefit the most \nimportant population--children.\n  The underlying bill includes a provision allowing children to remain \non their parents' plans up until the age of 26. I have children. I \nwould like to think that by 22 or 23, they will be on their own, they \nwill be gainfully employed and off my payroll. But any of us who have \nraised children know that sometimes it takes a little more time to \nlaunch our children. I see Senator Shaheen, who is nodding. She has \ndone this herself. It takes a little time to launch them. According to \nthe latest data from the Census Bureau, in 2007 there were an estimated \n13.2 million uninsured young adults. So the bill includes this \nimportant provision to allow kids to stay on their parents' insurance \nfor a bit longer as they transition into adulthood.\n  But my question was, where do the young people who age out of the \nfoster care system sign up, because they do not have parents? I was \nproud to work on a provision that Leader Reid included in this bill to \nensure that every young person who ages out of the foster care system \nwill be able to stay on Medicaid until the age of 26 starting in 2014. \nAlmost 30,000 young people age out of the foster care system every \nyear, having never been adopted or reunified with their birth parents. \nThe fact that they aged out is our failure as government. We have \nfailed them once and we just can't fail them twice. We must support \ntheir transition to adulthood, and guaranteeing access to quality \nhealth care will help with that transition.\n  When this legislation is signed into law, insurance companies will \nnot be able to drop children for preexisting conditions beginning \nimmediately. This is crucial for families with children who have \nbattled cancer or diabetes. When a parent loses a job, they may \nstruggle to get insurance when they find new employment. Once this bill \nbecomes law, no insurance company will be able to deny a child with \npreexisting conditions.\n  This health care reform bill holds insurance companies' feet to the \nfire to ensure they are accountable to their customers. By 2014, \ninsurers will not be able to deny coverage due to preexisting \nconditions. That means they will not be allowed to drop you from \ncoverage if you get sick or are in an accident.\n\n  Because of the good work of my colleagues Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Ben Nelson, this bill requires insurance companies to disclose \nthe pricing of their benefits to ensure that premiums are spent on \nhealth benefits not profits and gives consumers rebates, putting the \ninsurance companies' excessive profits back into your pockets. It \ncontains new requirements ensuring that insurers and health care \nproviders report on their performance, empowering patients to make the \nbest possible decisions. Under this bill, a health insurer's \nparticipation in the exchanges will depend on its performance. Insurers \nthat jack up their premiums before the exchanges begin will be \nexcluded--a powerful incentive to keep premiums affordable.\n  Finally, I was also proud to work with Leader Reid and Finance \nCommittee Chairman Max Baucus to address an inequity in the formula \nthat determines the federal match of Medicaid dollars. As we all know, \nin 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ravaged the Gulf Coast and \ndestroyed homes, neighborhoods, and even full communities throughout \nSouth Louisiana. In an effort to aid the recovery, Congress approved a \nmuch-needed aid package for Louisianians that infused grant dollars and \ndirect assistance to speed our recovery.\n  Some of the necessary one-time recovery dollars were calculated into \nour state's per capita income. In addition, labor and wage costs \nincreased because there was heightened recovery activity and a \nconstriction in the market. Consequently, Louisiana's per capita income \nwas abnormally inflated and put us in a category with richer states.\n  The result is that our federal match for Medicaid is scheduled to \ndrop pretty dramatically. I worked with my colleagues to correct this \nformula. I never asked for special treatment for Louisiana, but only \nfor understanding of our state's unique situation. We only wanted to be \ntreated fairly and not to get penalized because we have been forced to \nrebuild following the worst natural disaster in the United States' \nhistory. Our federal Medicaid match rates should reflect that the \nreality on\n\n[[Page S13736]]\n\nthe ground in Louisiana, not the cold calculations of inflexible \nfederal formulas.\n  An important note is that this Medicaid funding fix was supported by \nevery Member of our Congressional Delegation, and specifically and \nrepeatedly requested by our Republican Governor Bobby Jindal. Some \npoliticians in my state may run and hide when the heat gets turned up, \nbut that's not the way I was raised. I never have and never will run \nfrom what I think is right. I was sent here to fight for my state and \nthat is exactly what I'm doing.\n  Those who have dubbed this provision the ``Louisiana Purchase'' know \nlittle about lawmaking and even less about my views on health care \nreform. This Medicaid fix alone would not have been enough to earn my \nvote on this legislation. This was one of literally a dozen priorities \nI had as the Senate considered health care reform. I am voting for this \nbill because it achieves the goals I laid out at the beginning of this \ndebate: it drives down costs and expands affordable health care choices \nfor millions of families and small businesses in Louisiana and around \nthe nation. Any claim to the contrary, is a pathetic lie meant to \nderail this bill, a tactic that was all too common during this debate.\n  Today, we stand on the verge of history, with an opportunity to \nsupport a bill that will provide health insurance to 31 million more \nAmericans, reducing the deficit by $132 billion over the next ten \nyears.\n  The bill is not perfect. It is not the exact health care bill that I \nwould have written. I think the same could be said for each of my \ncolleagues. It was a long, difficult process and during the course of \ncompleting this landmark bill there were a lot of twists and turns. \nBut, as former President Clinton was fond of saying, we should never \nlet the perfect become the enemy of the good.\n  And through hard work and good faith and tough negotiations and \nkeeping our eye on the ball, Senate Democrats have actually crafted, in \nmy view, an extraordinary piece of legislation that will go a long way \nto providing comfort and security to the American people who elected us \nto do so.\n  It will provide comfort and security for the local grocery store \nowner in Jennings, the 22-year-old in Lake Charles who has just left \nthe foster care system, the single mother of three in Monroe, the 9-\nyear-old boy in Natchitoches who was just diagnosed with diabetes, and \nthe 70-year-old Medicare beneficiary in Houma who worked for three \ndecades in the offshore oil industry.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will make a difference \nin these lives and millions more across America, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining Democratic time be divided equally between myself, Senator \nStabenow, and Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to begin by congratulating \nSenator Landrieu and thanking her for all the hard work she has done on \nthis bill--first of all for small business. I think we have \nsignificantly, with her leadership, improved this legislation for small \nbusiness so that many of the small businesses in this country--many in \nmy home State of New Hampshire--will now be able to get help as they \ntry to cover their employees for health care. I also wish to \ncongratulate her for all her good work to help children in the foster \nsystem. It is significant they will be able to get health insurance \nonce they age out of the foster system and, of course, to help those, \nas she has pointed out, who have children who are in their early \ntwenties and who are still trying to get settled in a profession.\n  My daughter was fortunate enough to have health insurance last year \nin her first job out of college. But now she is going to a new job that \ndoesn't have health insurance, and so she will be able to be covered \nonce this legislation is passed under our plan. As Senator Landrieu \npoints out, it is going to make a real difference for families and for \nsmall business.\n  I am very pleased to be here today to support this legislation and \nalso to try to dispel some of the myths we have heard from our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle about what is actually in \nthis legislation. Despite what many of our colleagues may want us to \nbelieve, passing this bill is the fiscally responsible thing to do. Our \ncurrent health care system is a threat to the security of our families, \nour small businesses, and the entire economy of this Nation. The costs \nof health care in America make up almost 18 percent of our economy--our \ngross domestic product. That is more than any other industrialized \ncountry. Health care costs are rising three times faster than wages. \nThe leading cause of about two-thirds of the bankruptcies in America is \nmedical bills. Our current health care system is simply not \nsustainable.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act moves us in a new \ndirection--a direction that is fiscally responsible because this bill \nis fully paid for. In fact, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would reduce our \nFederal deficit by $132 billion over the next 10 years. In fact, this \nlegislation represents one of the largest deficit-reduction measures we \nhave seen certainly in many years and possibly ever.\n  Small businesses in my home State of New Hampshire and across this \ncountry are going to benefit from this legislation. We heard Senator \nLandrieu talk about many of the provisions she worked on--and many of \nwhich I cosponsored--to help improve the legislation for small \nbusiness. The fact is, the steep annual increases in the cost of health \ninsurance have been forcing more and more businesses to make the very \ndifficult decision to either drop coverage for their workers or to \nincrease their employees' contribution to the point that too many \nworkers have had to decline coverage.\n  I have heard from a number of businesspeople in New Hampshire, and I \nwish to read what a couple of them have said.\n  A young woman named Adria Bagshaw testified this summer at a Small \nBusiness Committee field hearing we held in New Hampshire. Adria and \nher husband Aaron own the W.H. Bagshaw Company. It is a fifth-\ngeneration small manufacturing company in Nashua, NH. There aren't a \nlot of those fifth-generation companies left that are owned by the same \nfamily. They offer health insurance to their 18 employees and cover \nanywhere between 10 to 25 percent of their monthly premium. But now the \npremiums are $1,100 per month per family, and Adria is afraid she will \nhave to cut back on the quality of their health insurance plan or the \namount the company covers to make ends meet. The sad thing is that she \nsays right now they are spending more on health insurance than they are \nfor raw materials to make their products.\n  I also heard from a man named John Colony, who is a small business \nowner in the small, very picturesque town of Harrisville, NH. He e-\nmailed me saying:\n\n       The cost of health insurance is the biggest problem that \n     our small business faces.\n\n  He has 24 employees. He went on to say:\n\n       The present system is expensive, inefficient and broken. I \n     can't tell you how the 20 to 35 percent annual rate increases \n     depress us all and there is no end in sight. Over the past \n     five years, most of our employees have had to drop coverage \n     because they simply can't afford to pay their share of the \n     premium. I really believe that the time has come to put the \n     existing system out of its misery.\n\n  Well, I am happy to tell John we are about to do that, because under \nthis legislation, beginning next year, we provide significant tax \ncredits for small businesses to help them pay for the cost of coverage \nfor their workers. This bill contains a number of significant measures \nto rein in runaway health care costs--measures such as creating a new \npathway for biologic drugs so we can get biologic generic drugs to the \nmarket and help lower costs for people. There are measures in this bill \nthat will eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse--something that takes too \nbig a chunk out of our health care dollar. There are also measures in \nhere that will get rid of the subsidies\n\n[[Page S13737]]\n\nthe government pays to insurance companies for Medicare Advantage \nplans. These are all commonsense actions that will save the government \nand health care consumers money over time.\n  In addition, this bill makes significant improvements to our health \ncare delivery system. That is the way we provide health care for \npeople. It injects more competition into the health care marketplace. \nControlling health care spending is critical to address the fiscal \nhealth of this Nation--no pun intended. This legislation takes a very \nimportant first step in slowing down the growth.\n  I am sure every Member of the Senate--Republican and Democratic \nalike--has heard heartbreaking stories from our constituents about \nhealth care--stories about being denied health insurance, about having \nto stay at a job they do not like because of the fear of losing \ncoverage, about frustration over the lack of choice and who provides \ntheir health insurance or a lack of understanding about their plan's \nlimits until it is too late and they are facing financial peril. Well, \nthis bill will, I am happy to say, change that. Not only do we ensure \ncoverage for an additional 31 million people----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN.--but we eliminate the abuses of the insurance \ncompanies.\n  I will be back to talk about some of these other areas.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my friend from \nNew Hampshire for her advocacy on health care reform in general, but \nspecifically working together on the areas that affect small business, \nI very much appreciate, and we are so pleased to have her in the \nSenate.\n  I come to the floor to join my colleagues. I know the chair of the \nSmall Business Committee, Senator Landrieu, has been here and others \nwill be here--Senator Lincoln, who has played such a critical role in \nputting together the small business provisions in the bill.\n  I am very pleased to have authored one of the provisions in the \nmanagers' amendment that will guarantee that small businesses get \nimmediate help starting next year--tax cuts to help them pay for the \ncost of health insurance. Michigan has close to 200,000 small employers \nthat represent about 96 percent of the employers in our State.\n  Most folks who think of Michigan think of large employers, large \nmanufacturers. But, in fact, the majority of our employers, as in the \nmajority of each of our States, are small businesses. That is where the \nmajority of the new jobs are being created. We have just 41 percent of \nour firms that have fewer than 50 employees who actually are able to \noffer health insurance. So less than half our small businesses are able \nto offer health insurance, which is why we are focused on small \nbusinesses in this reform bill.\n  The majority of people in this country who don't have insurance are \nactually working. The majority of us--about 60 percent--have insurance \nthrough our employers. We have about another 20 percent or so who \nreceive their insurance through Medicare or Medicaid or the Veterans' \nAdministration or some other public entity and then 15 to 20 percent of \nthe people overall in America who don't have insurance are \npredominantly small businesses--people working for small businesses or \nthey are self-employed or they are working one, two, or three part-time \njobs just to try to hold things together. So that is a major focus of \nthe health care reforms that are in the legislation that is before us.\n  I am very pleased we have been able to put together a package that \nhas $40 billion in direct tax cuts--$40 billion in direct tax cuts--for \nsmall businesses across America to help them afford health insurance \ngoing forward, rather than waiting for the new insurance pooling--the \nexchange--which will provide additional help for small businesses. This \nhelp, this tax cut, starts right away. We will see 3.6 million small \nbusinesses that could qualify for the tax cuts in this bill that will \nbegin next year.\n  In my State, that means over 109,000 small businesses that could be \nhelped by the small business tax cuts that will make premiums more \naffordable. So I am very pleased to be part of a group of Members who \ncame together and worked very hard to focus on the fastest growing part \nof the economy, which are our small businesses.\n  I will just share one story, and this was from Crain's Detroit, a \nhighly respected business publication in Michigan. Mark Hodesh, who is \nthe owner of an Ann Arbor home and garden store, said he has seen his \nhealth insurance premiums go up more than 300 percent since 1997. In \n1996, he paid $132 in health care premiums a month per employee; and \nthis year, regular premium increases have led him to pay upward of $375 \nper month for each employee. So that is a 300-percent increase. He \nsays:\n\n       I have been in small business for 40 years, and my \n     conclusion is that without health care reform, these \n     increasing costs will put me out of business.\n\n  That is the reality for businesses across this country. I do believe \nhealth care reform is directly tied to jobs, whether it is large \nbusinesses competing internationally that make a determination to move \ntheir facility because of health care costs, whether it is small \nbusinesses going out of business or having to decide if they keep \npeople working or pay for health insurance or whether it is the self-\nemployed person out on their own, in their own enterprise--maybe it is \nlocal realtor. We know realtors have struggled for years because they \nhaven't been able to buy through a large insurance pool. That is what \nthis reform is all about. That is what this legislation is all about, \nto help small businesses, people who are working out of their homes, \nwho are self-employed, as well as people who have lost their job and \nthen lost their insurance. That is what this is all about.\n\n  When we look at this legislation, according to the Small Business \nMajority, without health insurance reform that is in this legislation \nthe annual costs of health benefits will more than double in less than \na decade. They will more than double. We know, because we have seen the \nstatistics, that when we talk about doubling health care costs for \nbusinesses in the next 10 years, it is estimated to equal another 3.5 \nmillion jobs.\n  We cannot afford to lose another 3.5 million jobs because of the \ndoubling of health care costs in America. We are focused on creating \nmore jobs. We need to be laser focused--certainly, I am, coming from \nMichigan--on creating jobs not losing jobs. According to the economic \nanalysis of the Small Business Majority, health insurance reform could \nsave up to 72 percent of small business jobs otherwise lost to a \ncontinuing rise in health care costs. We need those jobs.\n  Again, health insurance reform is all about saving lives, saving \nmoney, saving Medicare, and it is certainly about saving jobs. That is \nwhy I am so pleased we have made small businesses a major priority in \nthis legislation--both through $40 billion in tax cuts for small \nbusinesses, creating the new insurance pool through which small \nbusinesses can get the same kind of deal, have the same kind of clout \nas a large business today in being able to negotiate with private \ncompanies, and other provisions that are in the bill as well.\n  There are many reasons to support health insurance reform. Standing \nup for small businesses is certainly at the top of the list.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from New Mexico \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, over the past few weeks we have heard \na lot of heated debate about this health care proposal. Much of it has \nconcentrated on a few key issues: whether there should be a public \noption, whether there should not be. Of course, much of that debate was \non the Democratic side among Members with strongly held views on both \nsides of the issue.\n  The question of whether we should try to allow people 55 and older to \nbuy into Medicare was also debated. There were strongly held views on \nthat issue.\n  It is clear now we have a bill before us that will do neither one of \nthose things but which I think will accomplish very major health care \nreform for the country. I want to just concentrate\n\n[[Page S13738]]\n\nfor a few minutes on some of the other policies that are contained in \nthis legislation that have received much less attention but which \nclearly are very constructive proposals that will dramatically improve \nthe health care delivery system in the country.\n  I can remember when we started these discussions early in the spring \nand summer and had many meetings and hearings and workshops both in the \nHELP Committee and in the Finance Committee, there were statements made \nthat--on the Democratic and Republican side--we can agree upon maybe \n80, maybe 85 percent of the changes we ought to embrace in health care \nreform. The question is, What about the other 15 to 20 percent? I think \nwe need to spend more time focused on that 80 to 85 percent, and let me \ndo that for just a minute.\n  This Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which Senator Reid \nand others have introduced and is in the House legislation as well, \nboth pieces of legislation do contain very important policies. Let me \ntalk a minute about some of those.\n  First, this act before us includes long overdue reforms to increase \nthe efficiency and the quality of the U.S. health care system while \nholding down the growth in costs. For example, the legislation includes \npayment reforms--I have championed those for a long time; others in \nthis body have championed them as well--to shift from a fee-for-service \npayments system to a bundled payments system. This will reshape our \nhealth care reimbursement system to reward better care and not simply \nmore care as the system currently does.\n  The legislation also includes broad expansion of quality reporting \nand pay-for-performance reforms that will further incentivize quality \nand efficiency. The legislation also puts in place the framework for a \nnational quality strategy and several new key Federal oversight bodies \nto allow both providers and consumers to have unbiased information \nabout whether health care treatments and devices and pharmaceuticals \nare effective and efficient.\n  We have heard a lot of charges made that trying to find out what is \neffective and efficient is objectionable somehow because it might lead \nto rationing of care. There is no rationing of care contemplated in \nthis legislation. But how anyone could come to the Senate floor and \nargue against providing good, scientifically based information both to \nproviders and the consumers about which treatments, which devices, \nwhich pharmaceuticals are effective and useful is hard for me to \nunderstand.\n  Second, this Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes a \nbroad new framework to ensure that all Americans have access to quality \nand affordable health insurance. It includes the creation of new health \ninsurance exchanges which will provide Americans a centralized source \nof meaningful private insurance, as well as refundable tax credits to \nensure that the coverage they need is affordable. These new health \ninsurance exchanges will help improve the choices that are available to \nAmericans by allowing families and businesses to easily compare \ninsurance plans and prices and the performance of those plans. This \nwill put families rather than insurance companies or insurance \nbureaucrats or government bureaucrats in charge of health care. These \nexchanges will help people to decide which quality, affordable \ninsurance option is right for them.\n  On the issue of cost, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nforecasts that this legislation would not add to the Federal deficit. \nIn fact, the latest estimate they have given us is that it would reduce \nthe deficit by $132 billion by 2019 and well over $1 trillion in the \nsecond 10-year period; that is, the period from 2020 to 2029.\n  On the subject of premium costs, which all of us care about, all \nAmericans care about, CBO has also found that in the individual market \nthe amount that subsidized enrollees would pay for coverage would be \nroughly 56 percent to 59 percent lower, on average, than the premiums \nthey are expected to be charged when this law takes effect in the \nindividual market under current law.\n  Among enrollees in the individual market who would not receive new \nsubsidies, average premiums would increase by less than 10 to 13 \npercent--this, again, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The \nlegislation would have smaller effects on premiums for employment-based \ncoverage. Its greatest impact would be on smaller employers qualifying \nfor new health insurance tax credits. For these businesses and their \nemployees, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that premiums would \ndecrease by somewhere between 8 and 11 percent, compared with the costs \nthat they would have to pay under current law.\n  These estimates by the Congressional Budget Office are consistent \nwith the estimates of the impact in my home State of New Mexico, where \naverage families may see a decrease in premiums of as much as 60 \npercent from what they might otherwise have to pay. This is families, I \nam talking about, who would be eligible for these advance refundable \ntax credits.\n  In addition, about two-thirds of the people in my State of New Mexico \nwould potentially be able to qualify for subsidies or for Medicaid. In \nfact, a quarter of our population in New Mexico is at an income level \nthat would allow them to qualify for near full subsidies if they bought \ninsurance through an insurance exchange or for Medicaid itself.\n  An overall decrease in premium costs also is consistent with the \nexperience that the State of Massachusetts had after they enacted \nsimilar reform to what is now being considered in the Senate. There has \nbeen a substantial reduction in the cost of nongroup insurance in that \nState. In fact, the average individual premium in Massachusetts fell \nfrom $8,537 at the end of 2006 to $5,142 in mid-2009. That is a 40-\npercent reduction in premium for that coverage. This was at a time when \nthe rest of the Nation was seeing a 14-percent increase.\n\n  Finally, much of the debate on health care reform has focused on \ninsurance coverage. It is important to recognize that as we expand \ncoverage to include more Americans, the demand for health care services \nis going to increase as well. A strong health care workforce is, \ntherefore, essential for successful health reform. Within this country, \napproximately 25 percent of the counties are designated as health \nprofessional shortage areas. That is a measure that indicates that \nthere are insufficient medical staff to properly serve that geographic \narea.\n  This problem is even more apparent in rural States such as mine, such \nas New Mexico. For example, 32 out of the 33 counties in our State--we \nhave just 33 counties--32 of those counties have this shortage \ndesignation--health professional shortage area designation. As a \nresult, New Mexico ranks dead last compared to all other States with \nregard to both access to health care and the ability to utilize \npreventive medicine.\n  This Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also contains key \nprovisions to improve access and delivery of health services throughout \nthe Nation. These provisions include increasing the supply of \nphysicians and nurses and other health care providers, enhancing \nworkforce education and training, providing support for the existing \nworkforce--health care workforce, increasing the support for community \nhealth centers.\n  I applaud Senator Reid and Senator Baucus and Senator Dodd and \nSenator Harkin and many other colleagues in the Senate who worked so \nhard on this bill. The legislation represents major health care reform. \nIt is time for the Senate to enact this critical and long overdue \nlegislation. There will be chances and opportunities to improve on this \nlegislation in the future. I hope to participate in some of those.\n  Nothing that is passed into law in this Congress or any Congress that \nI have served in is what it should be in all respects. But this \nlegislation is extremely important and significant health care \nlegislation. It will do a tremendous amount of good for a vast number \nof Americans and it will do that ``good'' in a very responsible way.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation so we can \nget on with a conference with the House of Representatives and finally \nsettle on a bill that could be sent to President Obama for his \nsignature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I know our leader is coming to speak,\n\n[[Page S13739]]\n\nbut prior to him coming, I will take a portion of my time that has been \nallotted to me by my side.\n  I sat here with great interest listening to the Senator from New \nMexico. He referenced the State of Massachusetts. I entered into the \nRecord yesterday the 21 percent of the people under the plan who could \nnot get care in Massachusetts because they could not afford the copay \nand the deductible. This is basically a copy or model off of that.\n  He also discussed the fact that this shows a $132 billion savings \nover the next 10 years. That is provided you do not think you are going \nto allow any increase in doctor payments and you are not going to \nreverse the 21-percent cut.\n  Madam President, my leader is here, and I will be happy to yield to \nhim at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma. I \nwill be very brief.\n  Madam President, Americans woke up yesterday stunned to read that \nDemocrats had voted to end debate on the latest version of this massive \nbill while they were sleeping. They will be stunned again when they \nlearn about this second early-morning vote to advance a bill that most \nof them oppose. Americans are right to be stunned because this bill is \na mess. And so was the process that was used to get it over the finish \nline.\n  Americans are outraged by the last-minute, closed-door, sweetheart \ndeals that were made to gain the slimmest margin for passage of a bill \nthat is all about their health care. Once the Sun came up, Americans \ncould see all the deals that were tucked inside this grab bag, and they \ndo not like what they are finding. After all, common sense dictates \nthat anytime Congress rushes, Congress stumbles. It is whether Senator \nso-and-so got a sweet enough deal to sign off on it. Well, Senator so-\nand-so might have gotten his deal, but the American people have not \nsigned off.\n  Public opinion is clear. What have we become as a body if we are not \neven listening to the people we serve? What have we become if we are \nmore concerned about a political victory or some hollow call to history \nthan we are about actually solving the problems the American people \nsent us here to address? This bill was supposed to make health care \nless expensive. It does not. Incredibly, it makes it more expensive.\n  Few people could have imagined that this is how this debate would \nend--with a couple of cheap deals hidden in the folds of this 2,700-\npage bill and rushed early-morning votes. But that is where we are. \nAmericans are asking themselves: How did this happen? How did a great \nnational debate that was supposed to lead to a major bipartisan reform \nlead to a bag full of cheap legislative tricks inside a $2.3 trillion, \n2,733-page bill that actually makes health care costs go up?\n  This legislation will reshape our Nation in ways its supporters will \ncome to regret. But they cannot say they were not warned. The verdict \nof the American people has been clear for months: They do not want it.\n  Madam President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I would just follow with one comment to \nmy leader as far as his comments.\n  In 2007, we passed a bill called the Honest Leadership and Open \nGovernment Act of 2007. That act requires the posting of any earmarks \nor direct benefits for Senators in any bill. It has to be posted. We \nhave not seen that with this bill, though we know there are numerous \nand sundry specific earmarks for Members.\n  So my hope is that sometime during this process, we will take up the \nviolation of this very law by the leader of this Chamber in terms of \nignoring it and flaunting it. What he said, when we passed it, was it \nwas a needed change, and now we see it ignored as they bring this bill \nto the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Oklahoma.\n  One thing about rushing, not only is there a potential violation of \nthe provision the Senator from Oklahoma mentioned, but we are learning \nmore about this bill every day as we scrub it and try to understand it \nand figure out what all is in it. All of that, of course, is made more \npossible by rushing things through in sort of an expedited, hurried \nfashion to get it by the American people before Christmas in the hopes \nthey will not notice.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the leader.\n  I want to spend my time this morning kind of talking about how you \ncontrol health care costs in our country. My experience, just from my \nqualifications--I have 9 years of experience in manufacturing medical \ndevices. I did that as a young man, had hundreds of employees and a \nfairly large business. I left that business to become a physician. The \ncall of my life was to help people directly rather than indirectly \nthrough my medical device association.\n  So I want to lay out the two different ways, the two different \narguments for how we control health care costs because everybody in \nthis Chamber wants to control health care costs. All the Democrats and \nall the Republicans do. We have 11 studies that say premiums are going \nto rise and one that says they are not under this bill. So that is not \ngoing to control costs.\n  But I want to read a story that a lady from my district wrote me \nbecause I think it is very important in us considering which way we go.\n\n       Dr. Coburn,\n       I hope you don't mind a personal story, but as I listen to \n     the health care debate, I can't help but think constantly of \n     my middle daughter. I am convinced that Chloe would have lost \n     her chance for a normal life, had these policies--\n\n  In this new health care bill--\n\n     been in effect two years ago. No government agency could \n     possibly have understood Chloe's unique needs or her \n     extremely rare condition.\n       After a perfectly healthy childhood, my seventeen-year-old \n     showed me that her left arm was twitching and wouldn't stop. \n     Within weeks, the entire left side of her body was jerking \n     constantly, every waking moment of every day. Her MRI \n     revealed more than one periventricular heterotrophic nodule--\n\n  That is a growth around the ventricular system, the fluid system of \nthe brain--\n\n     but her first two neurologists weren't sure there was a \n     connection between the [changes in her movement and the \n     movement disorder and the symptoms and the nodules]. They \n     certainly had nothing useful to offer in terms of treatment. \n     But I made the rash promise to my daughter that someone, \n     somewhere, knew what to do, and that we would not stop \n     looking until we found that person. Unlike mothers in a \n     government run system, I was free to research the options and \n     apply where I wanted. Our search took less than three months.\n       Chloe's pediatric movement disorder specialist at Mayo \n     Clinic called her condition ``unique'' and unclassifiable. He \n     had to debate her case with his neurology team, but in the \n     end they were willing to try an unprecedented series of brain \n     surgeries. Chloe was desperate to live a normal life again, \n     so my husband and I agreed, though perhaps you can imagine \n     what an excruciating decision that was. Today, Chloe twitches \n     a little, but anyone who didn't know her history would think \n     she is just fidgeting. She is an honors linguistics student \n     at OU, and she even takes dance lessons. She recently started \n     driving again. She said once, ``Mom, without the surgery, I \n     would be strapped into a wheelchair now.\n       I know that Chloe would never have had the unique care she \n     needed, if we had been required to petition a government \n     agency for permission. A less dedicated person than her \n     subspecialist would have tried to classify her condition and \n     restrict her to known treatments. In fact, other \n     subspecialists wanted to make those same restrictions. \n     Chloe's doctor learned how to treat her by spending a great \n     deal of time with her, by talking to her and to us for hours \n     at a time, and by observing her in multiple contexts. I fear \n     for the next mother whose child has an unclassifiable \n     condition, and whose treatment is planned by a faraway \n     committee with a diagnostic manual open on the table. \n     Chloe won't be in that manual.\n\n  The thing that keeps people from getting health care in America today \nis the cost of health care. We have had all sorts of attempts of, how \ndo we do that? We have had the Massachusetts model, and, as entered \ninto the Record yesterday, they have insurance reform. Almost everybody \nin Massachusetts is covered. Yet last year 21 percent of those people \nwho were covered could not get care because they could not afford the \ndeductibles and copays. So expanding insurance and expanding the model \ndoes not solve it.\n  So you can either approach controlling costs or you can ration care. \nWhat has happened in this bill, as it comes through, is we have chosen \nto ration care. My colleagues are going to dispute that, but I want to \noffer significant evidence to offset that and discuss what is in the \nbill and to also discuss what is not in the bill.\n\n[[Page S13740]]\n\n  What is not in the bill is a prohibition against rationing, which all \nof my colleagues on both the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee \nvoted against, which means you are for rationing if you vote against, a \nprohibition. The leader denied an amendment on the floor of the Senate \nto eliminate rationing, so we do not get to see where everybody stands. \nBut we understand the intent. So there is no question that the way we \nare going to control costs is to limit your access by rationing health \ncare.\n  The other side of controlling costs is to incentivize the prevention \nof disease and incentivize payments for good outcomes when we manage \nchronic disease that is there in an efficient and effective way. That \nis not in the bill. That is not anywhere in the bill. What we have to \ndo is incentivize an insurance company to invest in the management of \nchronic disease rather than to pay for the consequences of the chronic \ndisease. That is not in the bill either.\n  So we get two choices.\n  Now, what do we find in this bill? We find a Medicare advisory \ncommission. They actually dropped the name ``Medicare'' from it, but we \nfind an advisory commission that is going to tell us how much money we \nhave to cut from Medicare, and we either have to cut that amount or \nmake some cuts somewhere else.\n  We have the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and we have already \nseen during the debate on this bill when they do something that is \nbased on cost alone--not clinical; breast cancer screening for women \nbetween the ages 40 to 50--when they do something on the basis of cost \ninstead of clinical, we run in and jump and say no, but we are going to \npass a bill that is going to totally empower that. Seventeen times in \nthis bill is the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force referenced in what \nit is going to tell us what to do, and it is not going to tell us just \nin Medicare and Medicaid, it is going to tell us in every area what we \nare going to do. But because there was such a reaction to the first \nrecommendation based on cost--and let me explain what that was. They \nsaid that if you are age 50 and over, the incidence of finding somebody \nwith breast cancer is 1 in 1,470 people, but if you are between the \nages of 40 and 50, it is only 1 in 1,910 people; therefore, it is not \ncost-effective. So it does not matter if you have breast cancer between \nthe ages of 40 and 50, we do not think the government ought to be \npaying for your mammogram and we do not think anybody ought to have \none. Well, that is fine for all those people who do not have breast \ncancer. It is terrible for the people who do have breast cancer and it \ncould be found early with a mammogram.\n  So we rushed in here and we offset what that task force did. But they \nare going to be doing it time and time again. And is the Congress going \nto truly--every time they make a decision based on cost-effectiveness, \nnot clinical effectiveness, are we going to reverse it? We are not. So \nthere is another proof that we are, in fact, going to use the rationing \nof care to control costs.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. BURR. If, in fact, the Congress did reverse the decision of an \nadvisory board, what does that do to the budget deficit? And what does \nit do to the claims that this current bill being considered is paid \nfor?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am not sure I can answer the question. But it would \nmake it less effective in terms of supposed claims.\n  Mr. BURR. So if the authors of this bill never intended to make cuts, \nthen it blows the budget neutrality that is portrayed in this bill. But \nif they use all the mechanisms that are in place to make sure \nreimbursements are cut or the scope of coverage is affected by a \ndecision to limit one's care, then we could see prevention cut, \nwellness programs cut, or even the preventive diagnosis such as for \nbreast cancer limited to a much smaller group.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think the Senator from North Carolina is really going \nto where I am going to get to later; that is, what is the motivation \nfor the decisionmaking? I think my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are well intended, but I don't think they are well informed about \nthe consequences of their intentions.\n\n  So if you set up the Task Force for Preventive Health Services and \nsay you are going to rely on it, but we know they are going to make the \ndecisions based on cost-effectiveness, not clinical effectiveness, what \nwe are going to see is the American Cancer Society coming again and \nagain and again because what we are going to do is we are going to \ncover those where it is cost-effective but not clinically effective. \nFor 80 percent of Americans, they are not going to notice the \ndifference, but one out of five Americans is going to notice the \ndifference.\n  The second area, which I wish to spend some time on because we have \nactually modeled it after England, is cost comparative effectiveness. \nWe ought to talk about what is comparative effectiveness research \nbecause there is nothing wrong with the research. It is health care \nresearch comparing various drugs, devices, and treatments head to head, \nand the whole goal of that is to find out what works best and what \ncosts the least.\n  The assumption in this bill is, we can have 24 or 36 people in \nWashington decide that. In the Framingham studies they have been \nrunning for over 50 years on heart disease, we still don't have the \nanswers and we have been studying it for 50 years. But we are going to \nbe making decisions on cost, not on clinical effectiveness, which is \ngoing to limit your ability to have what you and your doctor think you \nneed.\n  So we are going to pull out clinical experience of individual \nphysicians. We are going to eliminate the heart of medicine, which is \nthe combination of vast experience, gray hair, long years of training, \nfamily history, clinical history and physical exam and we are going to \nsay: No, it doesn't matter. We are going to say: Here is the way you \nare going to do it.\n  Who uses comparative effectiveness research? Well, several countries \ndo. When I share with my colleagues the stories about how it is used, \nyou are going to get a real vision of what is coming with this bill--a \nreal vision.\n  This bill creates a new agency called the Patient-Centered Outcomes \nResearch Institute to perform comparative effectiveness research. I \nhave already said the idea behind it is good. I strongly support \nmedical research. I strongly support helping doctors and their patients \nchoose the best research and the best treatment. The problem is, this \nbill doesn't do that. On the contrary, this bill will empower the \ngovernment to decide which treatments you can have and which ones you \ncannot have. That is what this does. This removes the judgment of the \ndoctor and replaces it with the judgment of the bureaucracy in \nWashington. It is not a hypothetical concern, it is a real-world \nproblem.\n  In Britain, they control health care costs by denying or delaying \naccess to expensive therapies. That is one of the reasons this country \nhas one-third better survival for every cancer you can imagine over \nGreat Britain because we don't do that. As a two-time cancer survivor I \nam acutely aware as a patient, not as a doctor, in that I want to make \nsure for my family and my patients they have the best alternatives, not \nthe cheapest, because the cheapest alternatives are the ones that take \nyears away from your life.\n  I am going to go through some examples. Nobody can dispute this is \nwhat is happening now and what will happen under our program. To \nSenator Baucus's credit, he had a bill that wasn't cost comparative \neffectiveness; he had one based on clinical comparative effectiveness. \nThat is not in here. What is in here is cost comparative effectiveness. \nSenator Baucus knew you don't want to use cost as the main thing; you \nwant to use clinical outcomes as the No. 1 deciding agent in how we \napproach health care--not cost--because if you only look at cost, \nnobody in this country would get a mammogram between 40 and 50. But \nthis bill is different from what Senator Baucus had offered in his \nFinance Committee markup.\n  There is an agency in Great Britain called the National Institutes \nfor Health and Clinical Excellence. It is pronounced NIHCE. Here are \nsome of the decisions of NIHCE in the most recent years. They have a \nproblem in England with cost, too, and they have a single-payer, \ngovernment-run system. They have the government running it, but they \nstill can't control their costs, so what have they done?\n\n[[Page S13741]]\n\nThey have repeatedly denied breast cancer patients breakthrough drugs. \nThey have forced patients with multiple sclerosis to wait 2\\1/2\\ years \nto receive new innovative treatments that people in this country are \ngetting as soon as they are available. They have denied early stage \nAlzheimer's patients medication, requiring their condition to worsen \nbefore they give them the medicine. What do we know about the medicine? \nIt works best when you have the slightest symptoms of Alzheimer's, not \nwhen you get worse. But that is the bureaucratic thinking: We will save \nmoney rather than practice good medicine.\n  They deny life-prolonging treatments to kidney cancer patients. They \ndenied new medicine to all but a small percentage of patients with \nosteoporosis and then only as a last resort. In other words, you have \nto about have your bones breaking by standing before you get medicine \nfor osteoporosis in Great Britain. In this country, we have prevented \nmillions of hip fractures through effective medicines to restore the \ncalcium and bone matrix in seniors' bones. But we have Medicare now \nsaying you are doing too many tests to check on that, so you can only \ndo it every 2 years. So we are going to use rationing, and we are.\n  They denied access to the only drugs available to treat aggressive \nbrain tumors. They denied effective drugs to bowel cancer patients, \ncolon cancer.\n  Macular degeneration is something that affects a large number of \npeople in this country. That is where the macula--the area that \nactually allows you to see and concentrate your vision--as we age, we \nhave what is called cystoid macular degeneration or dry degeneration. \nThat is a disease of the eye where it causes vision loss. NIHCE \nrequired patients suffering from macular degeneration to go blind in \none eye before they could have the medicine that almost every American \nwho has macular degeneration in this country has. She had to go blind \nfirst in one eye before you could ever get the medicine. That is a \nbureaucrat making this decision or a bureaucratic committee because it \nwas cost-effective to allow you to live with one eye. Elderly patients \nwent to court to fight for drugs to keep them from going blind. Twenty-\ntwo thousand Britains became totally blind through that ruling by the \nNIHCE. In one case, an 88-year-old World War II veteran and former Air \nForce pilot sold his house to pay for the drug after the government \nsaid they weren't going to pay for it. The Royal National Institute of \nBlind People said that as a result of NIHCE's decision, countless \npeople have either been stripped of their sight or stripped of their \nlife savings to pay for private treatment.\n  For Alzheimer's, they ruled that three drugs, common to many people \nwho are listening today--Aricept, Reminyl, and Exelon--were not cost-\neffective for patients with early Alzheimer's disease. Well, those are \nthe only ones they work effectively on. One hundred thousand \nAlzheimer's patients a year were denied treatment that could have \nslowed the progress of their disease. The British Alzheimer's Society \nsaid this decision was disgraceful and victimized the most vulnerable \nin our society.\n  Brain cancer. Gliadel and Temodal were not cost-effective for \ntreating brain tumors and severely restricted their access to them. A \n47-year-old woman sold her house to buy the drug the government refused \nto provide. They have been held as the biggest breakthroughs in \ntreating brain tumors in the last 30 years. Finally, in April of the \nyear before last, they finally relented and allowed brain cancer \npatients to have the drugs that were available on the market.\n  Erbitux, very effective in resistant colon cancers. In 2006, denied. \nSeventeen thousand Britons a year get the sort of advanced colon cancer \nthat Erbitux is designed for. Yet they can't have it.\n\n  Mr. BURR. May I ask a question of my colleague? Listening to this \nlist of products that have been denied people in Great Britain, and \ncertainly this is true in some other countries, makes me look at the \nMedicare population in this country with the realization that the way \nMedicare was constructed, a senior can't pay out of pocket because no \nprovider can receive a payment from a senior. If for some reason this \nbill were passed and you took part of the arsenal of drugs away from \nseniors or procedures away from seniors, how can a senior get a benefit \nif no provider can receive an out-of-pocket payment from a senior?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is the problem with our system today. What we are \ngoing to hear them say is the insurance companies do this now. At \nfirst, for new treatments, until they are proven effective, most \ninsurance companies don't cover them, but they cover them much sooner \nthan Medicare does today. Today, Medicare is the last to approve the \ndrugs.\n  We are going to hear that is not any different than the limitations \nfrom insurance. That is true. We need to change that. But the fact is, \nwe are getting ready to put all these people into insurance programs, \nand then we are going to have the Federal Government, which is just as \nbad or worse than the insurance company, making those decisions.\n  I wish to finish my point on cost. We get two ways for fixing cost \nbecause that is what is keeping people from getting access. We can \neither ration it--and there are three methods to rationing in this bill \nwhich will be used--or we can incentivize outcomes and we can \nincentivize prevention and we can pay, based on the transparency of \noutcomes and quality. We haven't done any of that in this bill. We have \nsaid we have, but when you look at how do you prevent it--and the model \nis the 200,000 employees at Safeway and what they have been able to do \nin using their incentive systems to pay for prevention, to use \ncompetitive purchasing to reconnect the employee with the purchase of \nhealth care.\n  I understand my colleague from Nebraska is here, and I will yield to \nhim because I understand he was a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy extended by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending substitute amendment be \nmodified to delete the following special carve-outs: eliminating or \nreducing the Medicaid unfunded mandate on Nebraska, Vermont, \nMassachusetts; exempting certain health insurance companies in Nebraska \nand Michigan from taxes and fees; providing automatic Medicare coverage \nfor anyone in Libby, MT; earmarking $100 million for a health care \nfacility, reportedly, in Connecticut; giving special treatment to \nHawaii's disproportionate share of hospitals; boosting reimbursement \nrates for certain hospitals in Michigan and Connecticut; and mandating \nspecial treatment for hospitals in frontier States such as Montana, \nSouth Dakota, North Dakota, and Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator's desire to \nwant to cut the payments to his own State, but I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Thank you. I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we had a very early vote, and it \nbrings the health care reform bill obviously one step closer to final \npassage--at least it looks obvious that is going to happen. Regardless \nof whether the other side has 60 votes, my friends on the other side \nstill have a problem they want to not have the public concentrate on; \nthat is, that the pending bill still raises taxes on middle-income \nAmericans. The Reid modification did nothing to reverse this fact.\n  I will take a few moments to illustrate the winners and losers under \nthe bill. We start with a question: If a person is not receiving a \nsubsidy for health insurance under the bill, then how can the person \nreceive a tax cut? This is a relevant question because the White House \nand the majority leadership continue to proclaim that the bill is a \n``net tax cut'' for middle-class Americans. For example, on Wednesday, \nDecember 16, a senior White House aide wrote:\n\n       The bill being considered represents a substantial net tax \n     cut for middle income families.\n\n  So I think that statement begs more questions. Who do you believe? \nThe\n\n[[Page S13742]]\n\nWhite House, on the one hand, or on the other hand, the nonpartisan \nindependent experts upon whom we on Capitol Hill rely for judgment--the \npeople who are not political, the Joint Committee on Taxation?\n  This committee tells us that in 2019, a little more than 13 million \nindividual families and single parents would receive the government \nsubsidy for helping people under 400 percent of poverty buy health \ninsurance. The Joint Committee also tells us that the number of tax \nfilers in 2019 will be 176 million people. If people are wondering why \nwe talk about 2019, it is the budget window from now until the end of \nthe 10-year period of time that we call a ``budget window.'' That means \nout of--comparing this 13 million to the 176 million taxpayers, 13 \nmillion people receiving the subsidy and 176 million tax filers--that \nmeans out of that 176 million individuals, families, and single \nparents, only 13 million of them would receive a government subsidy for \nhealth insurance. That is only 7 percent of the tax filers. It is \npretty important to understand that only 7 percent of Americans will \nbenefit from the subsidy for health insurance.\n  We have a pie chart so people can see exactly what I am talking \nabout. This says 176 million taxpayers, with 13 million receiving the \nsubsidy. This means 163 million families, individuals, and single \nparents--or 93 percent of all taxpayers--will receive no government \nbenefit under the Reid bill. What does that mean? It means there is a \nsmall beneficiary class under the Reid bill--7 percent. Thirteen \nmillion people will receive benefits under the Reid bill. A very large \nnonbeneficiary class--93 percent--will not benefit.\n  This nonbeneficiary class is affected in other ways. Yes, while one \ngroup of Americans in this class would be unaffected, another group of \nAmericans will see their taxes go up. This group would not have a tax \nbenefit to offset the new tax liability. That means these Americans \nwill be worse off under the Reid bill.\n  It is legitimate to ask, for these 93 percent of the people, what \nhappened to their net tax cut? What they will see instead is a net tax \nincrease. Based on the Joint Committee's data, in 2019 42 million \nindividuals, families, and single parents with incomes under $200,000 \nwill see their taxes go up. This is even after taking into account the \nsubsidy for health insurance. Again, this is on a net basis.\n  If we were to identify those Americans who are not eligible to \nreceive the tax credit and those whose taxes go up before they see some \ntype of tax reduction from the subsidy, this number will climb to 73 \nmillion Americans. The first bar on the chart illustrates what we have \nalready established but looks at Americans earning less than $200,000. \nRight here, 13 million families and single parents and individuals \nwould receive the subsidy.\n  The middle bar on the chart shows the net tax increase number of 42 \nmillion Americans under $200,000-a-year income. Finally, when we \nidentify those Americans who get no benefit under this bill, and those \nAmericans who see a tax increase, we find that there are 73 million \nindividuals, families, and single parents under the $200,000 category. \nThat is this group.\n  I want to close by referring to a final chart that illustrates the \nwinners and losers under the Reid bill. What we see is that there is a \ngroup of Americans who clearly benefit under the bill from the \ngovernment subsidy for health insurance. This group, however, is \nrelatively small--8 percent of Americans, if you look at those earning \nless than $200,000.\n  There is another much larger group of Americans who are seeing their \ntaxes go up. This group is not benefiting from the government subsidy, \nthis group on the chart. There is another group of taxpayers who are \ngenerally unaffected, this 82 million here. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation tells us this group may be affected by tax increases that are \nnot included in this study, like the cap on flexible savings accounts \nand the individual mandate tax that people are going to pay if they \ndon't buy health insurance.\n  The bottom line is this: My friends on the other side of the aisle, \nfirst, cannot say that all taxpayers receive a tax cut; two, they \ncannot say the Reid bill does not raise taxes on middle-income \nAmericans because we have the professionals who are nonpolitical at the \nJoint Committee telling us differently. No one can dispute that data.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, my friends on the other side of the \naisle continue to argue that the Reid bill eliminates the so-called \nhidden tax. They argue that this would reduce the cost of health care. \nFor example, on Wednesday, December 16, a senior White House aide \nwrote:\n\n       Even if you believe that some of the tax on insurance \n     companies is passed along, it would be more than outweighed \n     by the benefits middle-class families would get from reducing \n     the hidden tax they currently pay for the uninsured.\n\n  I don't believe the fees on health insurance companies will be passed \nthrough to the policyholders. I think it is just idiotic not to think \nthey would not be passed through.\n  I want to flatout state I know they are going to be passed through. \nMy authority for this is the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation telling us that fact. The CBO and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation told us that these fees will actually increase \nhealth insurance premiums. Premiums will go up because the companies \nare paying increased taxes under this bill. For insurance premiums to \ngo up, under a title of a bill that encompasses health care reform, \nthat is going in the wrong direction. Also, for argument's sake, let's \nassume my Democratic colleagues are correct and this so-called hidden \ntax that results from uncompensated care equals $1,000. The pending \nhealth care reform bill still leaves a large number of Americans \nuninsured. Specifically, the Reid bill leaves 23 million out of 54 \nmillion without health insurance at the end of this budget window, \n2019. So, at best, the Democrats' reform cuts the hidden tax in half--\nin this case, to about $500 a family.\n  To add insult to injury, however, the bill adds new hidden taxes. \nThese taxes are the fees imposed on health insurance. CBO and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation--two respected organizations--say this will \nincrease costs. If you check the report, no one can dispute that. These \nfees go into effect in 2011--still 3 years before any of the major \nreforms under the pending bill kick in.\n  That means this hidden tax will increase premiums in 2011, 2012, and \n2013. That is before there is any government assistance for health \ninsurance being provided to families that need it. The new hidden tax \nis also created as a result of the Medicaid expansion on the one hand, \nand Medicare cuts on the other hand, a major cost shift in health care \nderived from government programs--Medicare and Medicaid--which \nreimburse providers at rates roughly 20 percent to 40 percent lower \nthan private providers.\n  President Obama understands that paying doctors below market rates \nleads to cost shift. This is what he said at a townhall meeting on \nhealth care reform:\n\n       If they are only collecting 80 cents on the dollar, they \n     have to make that up someplace else, and they end up getting \n     it from people who have private insurance.\n\n  The Medicare and Medicaid cost shift will be increased significantly \nunder the pending health care reform bill. According to the CBO \nestimate, Medicaid will be increased by more than 40 percent, from 35 \nmillion to 50 million people. Additionally, the bill includes almost \n$\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts that will result in lower payments to \nproviders.\n  Increasing the current Medicare and Medicaid cost shift as a result \nof the Democrats' health reforms would add even more costs to a \nfamily's health insurance policy. The easier cost shift to address \nwould be the $1,700 cost shift from defensive medicine. The Democrats \ndo not address the cost shift from defensive medicine which former CMS \nDirector Mark McClellan has estimated adds $1,700 in additional cost \nper average family.\n  Addressing this reform alone could save more than covering all of the \nuninsured in America.\n\n[[Page S13743]]\n\n  So, you see, my friends on the other side say their bill will \neliminate the so-called hidden tax. My friends seem to come up short on \nthat one. Also, they add new hidden taxes that will burden middle-class \nAmericans.\n  I think in the present situation, the legislation before us and the \nlanguage used by debaters on the other side, they should be transparent \nwhen they are talking about getting rid of the hidden tax. The pending \nhealth care reform bill makes things from these three perspectives \nwork.\n  Madam President, I will be happy to yield the floor for a minute for \nthe purpose of a colloquy with Senator Baucus on another subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would like to address a colloquy with \nSenator Grassley, as he said, on another subject that is not related to \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Expiring Tax Provisions\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Senate is wrapping up legislative \nbusiness shortly, but there are a few expiring tax provisions that have \nunfortunately not been extended. These provisions include tax benefits \nfor individuals and businesses. These provisions would help teachers \nwho purchase supplies for their classrooms and families with college \nstudents.\n  Further, a great number of U.S. businesses rely on important tax \nbenefits, such as the research and development tax credit and the \nactive financing exception, both of which expire at the end of this \nyear. The energy industry also relies on several provisions that expire \non December 31. Unfortunately, this is not the first time we have \nallowed important tax benefits to expire. As soon as the Senate \nreconvenes next year, my intention is that we take up legislation to \nextend these important provisions.\n  That is why Senator Grassley and I have written a letter to the \nSenate leadership. I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 22, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell: \n     We write to inform you that early in the next year, we intend \n     to address the extension of various tax provisions expiring \n     on or before December 31, 2009. We intend to extend the \n     provisions without a gap in coverage, just as the House did \n     on December 9th of this year. The legislation will extend \n     several important tax benefits to individuals and businesses. \n     The legislation will also extend a number of energy tax \n     provisions, including the biodiesel tax credit, and natural \n     disaster relief.\n       These provisions are important to our economy--not only \n     because they help create jobs, but also because they are used \n     to address pressing national concerns. We understand that the \n     expiration of these provisions creates uncertainty and \n     complexity in the tax law.\n       Taxpayers need notice of the availability of these \n     provisions to fully and effectively utilize the intended \n     benefits. We hope to address this issue as soon as possible \n     to cause the fewest disruptions and administrative problems \n     for taxpayers and also generate the greatest economic and \n     social benefit.\n           Sincerely,\n     Max Baucus,\n       Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance.\n     Chuck Grassley,\n       Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the letter states our intention to work \ntogether to get the extenders done as quickly as possible in the new \nyear.\n  Senator Grassley and I both understand that expiration of these \nprovisions creates uncertainty and complexity in the tax law. Taxpayers \nneed notice of the availability of these provisions to fully and \neffectively utilize their intended benefits. Finally, we must act \nquickly to cause the least disruptions and administrative problems for \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  I hope when the Senate convenes early in 2010, we can address these \nexpiring provisions as soon as possible. I wonder if that is also the \nintention of the my good friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to add to what Senator \nBaucus said by speaking positively on this issue and to remind my \ncolleagues who maybe have been watching in the last 3 weeks and have \nseen Senator Baucus and I on opposite sides of the issue of health care \nreform--it is uncharacteristic for us to have different points of view \non legislation. In the 10 years he and I have been leaders of the \nFinance Committee, most of the issues coming out of our committee have \nbeen very bipartisan. What he just talked about and what I am going to \nrespond to is one of those issues.\n  I agree with Chairman Baucus that we should retroactively extend the \nexpiring tax provisions as soon as possible after Congress reconvenes \nin 2010.\n  As chairman of the Finance Committee in 2005, I worked with then-\nRanking Member Baucus, and we authored the biodiesel tax credit.\n  The biodiesel tax credit is a tax credit that is needed to be \nextended before the end of the year to prevent the U.S. biodiesel \nmarket from grinding to a halt on January 1, 2010. This tax credit \ndiffers from other tax provisions in that the price of biodiesel will \nbe $1 higher on January 1, 2010, as a result of the tax credit not \nbeing extended before that date. That means people will simply buy \npetroleum diesel rather than biodiesel come January 1, 2010.\n  I point out that support in Congress for extending the biodiesel tax \ncredit, I think, has been and still is robust, bipartisan, and \nbicameral, and that it has not been extended prior to January 1, 2010, \ndue solely to issues unrelated to the merits of the biodiesel tax \ncredit.\n  I want everybody to know that I agree with Chairman Baucus that the \nexpiration of these tax provisions creates uncertainty and complexity \nin the tax law. I also agree that the taxpayers need notice that these \ntax provisions will be in place so they can plan their personal and \nbusiness affairs to fully and efficiently use the intended tax \nincentives.\n  In addition, extending the tax provisions as early as possible in \n2010, as we intend to do, will minimize the administrative problems \ncreated for the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Baucus to retroactively \nextend these provisions as soon as possible when the Senate reconvenes \nin 2010.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his statement. I \nlook forward to working with him and other Senators so we can pass this \nlegislation as soon as possible next year.\n  Again, I commend my colleague and friend. It is true that much more \noften than not we are working on the same side of an issue. Even on the \nfew occasions when we are on the opposite side, I do say we do it \nagreeably. I wish more of the Senate would act the same way.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senators. The delay in the \npassage of the Tax Extenders Act of 2009 will cause problems for a wide \nvariety of groups, as the distinguished Senators from Montana and Iowa \nhave outlined. I believe the negative impact of our failure to act this \nyear will be felt first, and felt most strongly, by manufacturers of \nbiodiesel. Without the immediate passage of legislation to extend the \nbiodiesel tax credit, a large number of biodiesel manufacturing plants \nare likely to close down because they do not have the resources to \noperate without the financial benefit of the credit.\n  Biodiesel is a key part of our Nation's success in biofuels. These \nbiofuels, produced here in our own country, are helping to reverse our \nnear-total dependence on petroleum for transportation in this country. \nThe hard truth is that we get about 70 percent of our petroleum from \nother countries, and many of those countries are unstable or are \nunfriendly to the United States or both. So biodiesel is helping us \nrestore national energy security.\n  Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils or animal fats. The biodiesel \nindustry employed over 50,000 workers and added over 600 million \ngallons of biobased fuel last year to help power the diesel engines \nacross our Nation and throughout the economy.\n  However, this is still a very small and struggling industry. It is \nabsolutely dependent on continuation of\n\n[[Page S13744]]\n\nthe biodiesel tax credit. Without this credit, most of the biodiesel \nplants in this country will simply be forced to shut down, thus idling \nimportant domestic fuels production capacity as well as putting as many \nas 20,000 employees out of work. We can't let that happen. And, if for \nany reason the credit was not made retroactive, bankruptcy would in a \ngood number of instances be a quick result.\n  I do appreciate the efforts by the chairman and ranking member to \nmove forward with this badly needed legislation at the first \nopportunity.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as we work toward economic recovery, \nit is imperative that we act quickly to extend critical tax provisions \nscheduled to expire this year that promote research and development, \nspur community development, support the deployment of alternative \nvehicles and fuels, and provide certainty for businesses and families.\n  Knowing these tax provisions are in place allows Americans to plan \nfor the upcoming year. The longer we wait to pass this legislation, the \nmore uncertainty we place on businesses during a time when they are \nstarting to recover. Many of these tax provisions encourage investment, \nthe development of new technologies, and business growth, which allow \nour companies to be competitive in a global marketplace.\n  Delaying the extension of the research credit could put more than \n100,000 jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity and Treasury \nrevenue expected in 2010 in jeopardy, according to estimates from \nTechAmerica. If the credit is renewed, the association estimates that \n120,000 jobs would be generated and/or sustained, there would be an \nadditional $16 billion in additional research and development and other \neconomic activity and $13 billion in Federal tax revenue over the \ncourse of 2010. However, for every day that the credit is left expired, \nthere is the potential to lose 331 jobs, $45 million in economic \nactivity, and $37 million in tax revenue.\n  Another important tax provision set to expire this year allows \nbusinesses to write off the expenses of cleaning up brownfields, \nindustrial land that would otherwise continue to be a blight on our \ncommunities and harm our environment. In my home State of Michigan, \nthese credits will be needed more than ever to address the brownfields \nthat have been left behind as a result of the restructuring of the \nautomotive industry. Revitalization of these brownfields will be \ncritically important to communities throughout the State and the \nMidwest.\n  It is also imperative that we restore the estate tax retroactively to \nJanuary 1, 2010. I am extremely disappointed that an extension was \nblocked and that the estate tax will be allowed to expire in 2010. \nContrary to Republicans' claims, more heirs of farm and business \nestates will be hit with a tax increase than if we extended the estate \ntax at current levels. If the 2009 rules are retroactively applied, \nthen only approximately 6,000 estates would pay the estate tax each \nyear; however, if the estate tax expires, then it is estimated that \n61,000 estates could be hit with the capital gains tax. It is critical \nthat we extend the estate tax under the 2009 parameters to protect \nsmall businesses and family-owned farms, continue the incentive that \nthe estate tax provides for charitable giving, and provide certainty \nfor the heirs of farm and business estates.\n  During one of the most challenging economic times our country has \nfaced, dragging our feet on these tax extensions could have a \nsubstantial impact on our Nation's businesses and families at a time \nwhen we should be doing all we can to help them succeed. I look forward \nto working with Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley to \nretroactively extend expiring tax credits expeditiously when we return \nnext year.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, there was a report released recently \nby the Chief Actuary, Rick Foster. I hope this report will once and for \nall put an end to any serious consideration of the CLASS Act. The CLASS \nAct is going to be in the bill, if this bill passes Congress. But it \nshould not be in it, and we should have had a long discussion on this \nprovision because it is simply fiscally unsustainable.\n  The information the Chief Actuary's letter provides is ample evidence \nof why the CLASS part of this bill cannot work. Quoting from page 13 of \nthe Chief Actuary's letter:\n\n       We estimate that an initial average premium level of about \n     $240 per month would be required to adequately fund CLASS \n     program costs for this level of enrollment, antiselection, \n     and premium inadequacy for students and low income \n     participants.\n\n  So who would enroll in the CLASS program? An American making 300 \npercent of poverty has a gross income of $32,490. If the CLASS premium \nis, as the Chief Actuary predicts, $240 per month--that is $2,880 per \nyear--and an individual at 300 percent of poverty would have to commit \n8.9 percent of their income to join the program. That is simply not \npossible, nor is it plausible to argue that young, healthy persons will \ncommit almost 9 percent of their income to long-term care insurance \npolicy.\n  The people who will enroll then are those who have real expectations \nof using the long-term care benefit. People who join the CLASS program \nwith the expectation of needing the benefit become the Bernie Madoffs \nof the CLASS Act Ponzi scheme.\n  An individual becomes eligible for the CLASS program after paying \npremiums for just 5 years. If a person pays premiums of $2,880 per year \nfor 5 years, they would have paid a total of $14,400 in premiums for \nthat program. That person can then begin collecting a benefit of $1,500 \nper month. In 10 months, the person will have recouped their 5 years' \nworth of premiums.\n  This simple explanation should make it crystal clear why the CLASS \nAct is a fiscal disaster waiting to happen, not based on our \ndetermination but based on the determination of the Chief Actuary. The \npremium will be too expensive to entice young, healthy people to \nparticipate. The benefit payout is very enticing for people who know \nthey will need the benefit. Healthy people do not participate; sicker \npeople will. This adverse selection problem will send the program into \nthe classic insurance death spiral.\n  The Chief Actuary concluded on page 14 of his report with this one \nsentence:\n\n       There is a very serious risk that the problem of adverse \n     selection would make the CLASS program unsustainable.\n\n  If the CLASS Act becomes law, the Federal taxpayers are at very \nserious risk of paying a price to clean up the fiscal disaster when the \nCLASS Act fails.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this chart shows very graphically--this \nis data put together by the Joint Committee on Tax, combining all the \nvarious provisions in the bill. Basically, it shows that in 2015--that \nis the bar on the far left--there will be a $26.8 billion net tax cut \nfor individuals--net tax cut. Two years later in 2017--that is the \nmiddle vertical bar--there is a net tax cut of $40 billion for all \nAmericans--a net tax cut. Not for all Americans. Some will not get it, \nbut most Americans by far will. Then, of course, 2 years later in 2019, \nthere is a net tax cut of $40.8 billion.\n  I wanted to make it clear that there is a net tax cut in this bill, \naccording to Joint Tax. This is the distribution over 3 different \nyears--2015, 2017, and 2019. That is information prepared by the Joint \nCommittee on Tax. I want Americans to know there are tax cuts in this \nbill, and they are very significant.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/22/senate-section/article/S13744-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13744-S13745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have control of the Democratic block of \ntime, and I yield 25 minutes to the good Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding me the \ntime and also thank him for his great effort on this legislation.\n  It is a profound privilege to have the opportunity to serve the \npeople of Rhode Island and in that capacity to support the legislation \nbefore us. This effort has been decades in the making. Every year that \npasses without health insurance reform has made the task more difficult \nand, the need for reform, more essential.\n  Rhode Islanders have seen their health care costs double in just the \nlast decade. In 2000, the average employer-sponsored family health \ninsurance policy cost about $6,700. In 2008, the same plan cost nearly \n$12,700. Without reform, by 2016, that family will pay over $24,000 in \npremiums, consuming 45 percent of their projected median income. Such a \ncourse is unsustainable by the families of Rhode Island.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S13745, December 22, 2009, the Record reads: . . . \npremiums, consuming 24 percent . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . premiums, \nconsuming 45 percent . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Soaring health care costs are hurting family budgets, small \nbusinesses, and the national economy. In 1980, Americans spent $253 \nbillion on medical bills. Today, we are paying $2.5 trillion on medical \nbills. That pressure is pushing Medicare toward collapse and 750,000 \nAmericans into bankruptcy each year.\n  This legislation will help contain health costs, extend insurance to \nmillions, and give health consumers more protection against \ndiscriminatory insurance practices. By shifting the balance of power \nfrom insurance companies to consumers, we will make health care more \naffordable for individuals and businesses and provide families with \ngreater health care access and stability.\n  This bill is fiscally responsible. It is fully paid for. We trimmed \nwasteful programmatic spending and imposed new fees on drugmakers, \nreined in entitlement spending, and imposed taxes on things such as \ntanning beds, which lead to health care costs. But we also provided \nevery American family with greater health care stability and extended \naffordable health insurance to 30 million more of our fellow citizens.\n  The nonpartisan, independent Congressional Budget Office--the CBO--\nestimates this bill will reduce the deficit by $132 billion over the \nnext decade and $1.2 trillion over the following 10 years.\n  We need urgent action. The delay tactics and the procedural obstacles \nemployed by the other side are hurting our fellow citizens. Every day, \n14,000 more Americans lose their health coverage, and every day we \nremain here delaying this measure, 14,000 more Americans will lose \ntheir coverage. We have to, I think, reverse that trend and begin to \nfix our broken health care system.\n  Since 1999, Rhode Island's uninsured population has nearly doubled, \ngrowing from 6.1 percent to 11.8 percent in 2008, and it has soared up \nto about 15 percent today in the wake of unprecedented economic issues. \nBut while some of us have made this debate about trying to fix a broken \nhealth care system, others have made it clear their real intention was \nto use this issue to ``break President Obama'' and make health reform \nhis ``Waterloo.'' Partisanship must not come before providing access to \nlifesaving health care to children, families, and seniors.\n  I also don't understand how some party loyalists who spent the past 8 \nyears helping George W. Bush drive our economy into the ground and \ninflate the deficit to record levels are now obstructing every \nreasonable effort to fix these problems. How could they help George W. \nBush double our national deficit, running it up more in 8 years than \nall 42 Presidents before him, and then turn around and claim President \nObama isn't doing enough to control it?\n  How could they say this $800 billion insurance reform bill--which is \nfully paid for and reduces costs to consumers--is too expensive, but \nthe $1.2 trillion prescription drug bill they passed--which was \nfinanced through deficit spending and amounted, in many respects, to a \ngiveaway to drug companies--was somehow good policy?\n  How can they rail against health care reform right after overseeing \nthe largest expansion of our government in decades? How will they \nchange their approach when, through hard work, we do, in fact, extend \ncoverage and reduce cost and begin to deal with the deficit that has to \nbe dealt with in the years ahead?\n  Health insurance reform hasn't always been this partisan. Indeed, \nmany Republicans have said they support a great deal of what is in this \nbill but, for whatever reason, they refuse to support it. Indeed, by my \ncount, this bill increases competition, which Republicans said they \nwanted. Indeed, by my count, this bill lowers cost, which Republicans \nsaid they wanted. Indeed, by my count, this bill does not contain a \npublic option. I regret that, but that is the position I think most of \nthe Republicans--not all--supported. And, indeed, this bill provides \nAmericans with tax credits to purchase insurance, which Republicans \nsaid they wanted.\n  So the bill we will pass seeks to tear down the inefficiencies in the \ncurrent system, curb the cost, and reduce the waste and abuse Rhode \nIslanders and Americans experience every day.\n  It is our responsibility to enact meaningful health reform. Just \nsaying no may be a powerful political weapon, but this country is built \non hope and a better future, not fear.\n  Health insurance reform will offer Rhode Islanders access to stable \nand affordable health insurance coverage. Here are some of the changes \nthat will happen immediately with the enactment of this bill:\n  Insurance coverage for the uninsured with preexisting conditions will \nbe provided through a high-risk pool within 6 months of this bill being \nsigned into law. In my State, one plan already acts as the insurer of \nlast resort and provides coverage for those who have preexisting \nconditions. This bill will support their efforts. And, all insurers \nwill be prevented from denying coverage to children immediately due to \na preexisting condition.\n  There will be no lifetime limits on coverage for all new policies. \nThis means no one will exhaust their coverage plan, no matter how sick \nthey become.\n  There will be restrictions on annual limits for all new policies. \nInsurance companies will have more difficulty denying care in the \nmiddle of treatment.\n  All new policies sold will cover children up to the age of 26. This \nis particularly helpful since graduates from college often--\nparticularly in this economy--have a hard time finding employment with \nhealth care benefits.\n  Insurers will no longer be able to rescind coverage upon illness--\nwhen treatments, checkups, screenings, and medication are absolutely \ncritical.\n  Insurance companies will be required to cover--free of charge--\npreventive care for new policyholders.\n  Beginning next year, in 2011, small businesses will be eligible for a \ntax credit to purchase insurance for employees.\n  Then, in 2014, after allowing the States a time to design and develop \nand prepare themselves, our bill will extend affordable coverage to \nover 30 million uninsured Americans through a new health insurance \nexchange which promises to expand choice, increase competition, and \nrein in cost.\n  Rhode Islanders without a job will be able to purchase insurance on a \nnewly established and government-regulated health insurance market. \nMany will receive Federal support for the purchase of coverage.\n  Rhode Islanders employed by a company that does not provide \ninsurance--or inadequate insurance--will be able to purchase insurance \non this new market exchange.\n  Small business owners will be able to easily compare the cost of \ninsurance coverage offered by a multitude of plans through a new health \ninsurance exchange, and it will allow small business owners to pick the \ncoverage that fits the needs and budget of their employees.\n  Rhode Islanders on Medicare will no longer have to pay out of pocket \nfor important preventive services and no longer spend portions of the \nyear in the so-called doughnut hole without paid drug coverage.\n  Low-income adults, without children, will have access to Medicaid, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S13746]]\n\nwill provide them with insurance at reasonable costs.\n  Having access to health insurance is important. Individuals, \nemployers, employees, and families will have access to new insurance \noptions after reform, which is important. However, affordability--the \namount a family has to pay--is also critically important.\n  We have examples of States that have already enacted insurance reform \nthat covers their entire population, and what we found is, premiums \nhave gone down significantly since this reform was enacted. We have \nlearned a lot from their efforts, and Federal reform will improve upon \nthose efforts for the rest of the country.\n  As I suggested before, the average premium for a Rhode Island family \nis $12,700. If we don't do something, experts predict this premium will \ndouble in just 6 or 7 years. Rhode Islanders will be looking at health \ninsurance bills--just the bills of annual premiums--of over $25,000. \nAgain, that is not sustainable. It will literally bankrupt the families \nof Rhode Island, and they will make a very difficult choice: paying \nthis much money--which for many, if not most, is extraordinarily \ndifficult--or not having insurance or doing other things, such as \nlimiting the access their children have for college or not saving for \ntheir retirement. We can change that today by moving forward with this \nlegislation.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has also analyzed the effect of this \nbill on the premiums that Rhode Islanders pay, and they expect premiums \nto decrease anywhere from 14 to 20 percent. CBO found these decreases \nwill result from an influx of enrollees with below-average spending for \nhealth care.\n  One of the problems we have in the health care system today is, \nhealthy, young people--unless they are offered health insurance through \ntheir employer--don't typically purchase it. They are the classic free \nriders. If they get hurt in an accident, they will go to the emergency \nroom and be treated for free. They will not have paid into the system \nthat cares for them. The whole principle of insurance is spreading risk \nacross the largest population to reduce cost. That is precisely what we \nare doing. This is fundamental to any insurance program.\n  So this approach will actually lower the cost, as the CBO has \nreported. Additionally, the bill will provide permanent tax credits for \nRhode Islanders to purchase insurance.\n  Depending on income, individual Rhode Islanders can expect a $500 to \n$3,000 break on their insurance costs because of these tax credits. \nRhode Island families can expect to save much more--$1,400 to $8,500--\non their insurance through these credits. Everyone should recognize the \ninsurance reforms in this bill will mean people will get better \ncoverage at lower costs.\n  The bill also mitigates the costs facing small businesses, which in \nmy State accounts for 95 percent of all businesses. Every year, these \nbusiness owners face increasing premiums of 15 to 20 percent. They do \nnot have much choice. Two companies control 80 percent of the market in \nRhode Island, and you either accept what is offered or you go without \ninsurance. Every year, they see double-digit increases. Again, this is \nnot sustainable, not only over the long term but over the next several \nyears.\n  Starting a business and finding the right personnel is a challenging \nand expensive proposition. Innovation and entrepreneurship is risky. \nOften startup companies have difficulty hiring qualified individuals \nbecause the business owners can't face these increasing costs of health \ninsurance. In Rhode Island, these kinds of pressures have led to the \nloss of employer-sponsored health care or reduction in premium \nassistance from employers.\n  What has happened over the last several years is, real wages have \nbeen flat because health care has been taking all the extra money that \nin other times would have gone to increased wages. As a result, if you \nare a middle-income American and you look around through all the \nstruggle and all the work you are doing and you have this sense that \nyou haven't made a lot of real progress in terms of additional wealth \nor additional money put aside, it is no wonder. You have been paying \nthe indirect costs of an ineffective, inefficient health care system. \nThe money is going into health care. The money is going into--in many \nrespects--health care that is not efficient or effective and it is not \ngoing into the paycheck of working Americans.\n  The reforms set forth in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct will strengthen the employer-sponsored health insurance market. \nThere has been some suggestion that this is going to create no \nopportunities or options for employers to continue to provide health \ninsurance for their workers. But, according to the CBO, 83 percent of \nthe privately insured Americans will be insured through their \nemployers. That is a dramatic change, nearly double the total of \nAmericans insured through their employer today.\n\n  What we are going to see is not a decrease in employer insurance but \nan increase. I think this is something that will match the best aspects \nof our economy--individual business men and women making judgments \nabout what plan is best for them and providing that benefit in a cost-\neffective way to their employees. It will occur because of a few simple \nchanges:\n  First, as I mentioned, small business owners will actually receive a \ntax credit to purchase insurance for employees, should they choose, \nbeginning next year, 2011. I will repeat, small businesses will get a \ntax credit, a tax break which they are not getting now, to help provide \ninsurance for their workers.\n  Second, individuals will have the option of finding affordable \ninsurance on their own with increased competition to drive down costs, \nas more people shop effectively for health care insurance.\n  Third, there will be lower administrative overhead and greater \nsimplification of insurance as a result of this legislation.\n  Under the proposal we are considering, premiums for small businesses \nwill stop the never-ending trend of increase after increase and will \nbegin to come down. Making health insurance more affordable for small \nbusiness owners will help them by defraying their startup costs and \nensuring individuals can seek employment regardless of the benefit \noptions.\n  It will foster innovation and put companies in a situation where they \nhave an edge over foreign competitors and can win in the global \nmarketplace. American companies today are competing against nations \naround the globe that either have a national system, which does not \ndirectly affect their balance sheet in terms of health insurance costs, \nor they have no health insurance at all, and as a result, that is not \non the balance sheet of these companies. Every one of our businesses \nis, in some way or another, competing against other countries that \nheavily subsidize their insurance, that provide an advantage, a \ncompetitive advantage. We want to in some small way diminish--in fact, \nin a large way at least begin to diminish that advantage.\n  While there have been many ill-founded claims about the reform \npackage, the simple fact is that the tax credits provided in this bill \nis the largest health tax credit bill that has ever been considered in \nCongress. Over $400 billion in tax credits will be provided to \nAmericans in order to increase affordability.\n  Since health insurance reform will provide Rhode Islanders access to \naffordable health coverage, our providers should no longer face the \nfinancial pressure from uncompensated care. Hospitals will care for \npatients with insurance, and doctors will be able to prescribe \npreventive measures to patients so they do not become ill. Today, it is \nestimated that of all the private insurance premiums we pay in Rhode \nIsland, at least $1,000 dollars of those premiums is to pay for \nuncompensated care in our hospitals, in our clinics throughout the \nState. When we have a significant number--95, 94-plus percent--of Rhode \nIslanders covered, those uncompensated costs won't be uncompensated. \nThere will be an insurance program behind these individuals, so they \ncan seek preventive care and they can pay for emergency care and pay \nfor regular care.\n  Each one of the hospitals in my state is contributing in our efforts \nto insure more Americans and doing so with the knowledge that they can \npotentially benefit from the fact that people will not be showing up in \ntheir emergency rooms without insurance but will bring their insurance \ncard, and the support their card ensures, to the emergency room.\n\n[[Page S13747]]\n\n  In addition, the safety net providers throughout the country, our \ncommunity health centers, will find great support in this legislation.\n  There will be direct improvements for physicians in Rhode Island. The \nlooming 21 percent Medicare payment reduction will be eliminated, as it \nis impending. We will continue to look for permanent solutions, not \nonly to this issue of Medicare payments but also a payment formula used \nto pay doctors in a more equitable and more appropriate way.\n  I am also pleased that we have taken steps to improve and enhance \ntraining of a new generation of primary care physicians who will be \nnecessary to fill the increased demand. These improvements will help \nour overall efficiency.\n  This bill will also provide seniors with an improved Medicare \nProgram. Nearly one-fifth of my State is on Medicare; over 180,000 \nRhode Islanders rely on Medicare. Seniors have paid into Medicare \nduring their lifetime. They deserve a program that will provide \ncomprehensive coverage at the lowest cost without risk of coverage \nbeing terminated. However, that is not the Medicare coverage Rhode \nIslanders always receive today. Here is what Medicare does today. \nMedicare frequently allows the same test for the same complaint to be \nperformed multiple times. This costs money, but it doesn't necessarily \nimprove patient care. Medicare leaves over 31,000 Rhode Islanders \nwithout prescription drug coverage for parts of the year. This costs \nthem money. And Medicare today is on the path toward insolvency in just \n8 short years, which will affect every senior in Rhode Island.\n  Instead of allowing Medicare to go bankrupt, the comprehensive health \nreform bill we are currently debating would extend Medicare solvency \nfor at least 5 additional years. Some predict it will be extended for \nnearly a decade. This is important for seniors enrolled in the program \ntoday and those who will soon enroll in the program.\n  Solvency is extended by reforming the system. Seniors in my State \nwill not have to make multiple trips to their doctors' offices for the \nsame test for the same complaint because we will eliminate unnecessary \nduplication and tests and services. They will not fear being readmitted \nto a hospital after discharge because we will encourage care \ncoordination after discharge. And they will not put off important \npreventive care because the out-of-pocket costs are just too great \nbecause the cost-sharing component for preventive care will be \neliminated.\n  Many of my seniors are on the Medicare Advantage Program, which is a \nprivatized version of traditional Medicare. Over 65,000 seniors in my \nState have elected to enroll in this option, and there has been an \neffort to characterize the changes to this program as undermining that \nprogram. The private insurance companies have been saying that for over \na month now. Why? Because they profit very handsomely from Medicare \nAdvantage. They spent months telling seniors health reform will take \naway their coverage. These claims are inaccurate.\n  We will eliminate excessive overpayments to private insurance \ncompanies. In my State, Medicare Advantage plans are paid over 20 \npercent more per beneficiary than traditional Medicare fee-for-service. \nThis overpayment is particularly astounding given the fact that the \nGovernment Accountability Office found that 19 percent of Medicare \nAdvantage beneficiaries pay more than traditional Medicare for home \nhealth care and 16 percent pay more for inpatient services. Seniors \nshould be angry and upset at insurance companies, that they continue to \nprofit from the Medicare system while simultaneously taking more money \nfrom seniors' pocketbooks as they charge extra for these services. This \nwas not the intent of the program. In fact, the intent of the program--\nthe argument the insurance companies made is: Give us the flexibility \nto manage Medicare patients, and we will lower costs. Very shortly \nafter that, it became clear that they were not managing the costs that \nwell.\n  Of course, the bill is going to target waste, fraud, and abuse. For \nevery $1 we spend in this effort--and you have to invest in this fraud \ndetection--we expect to recover $17.\n  Our efforts will improve health care of seniors and will stabilize \nMedicare.\n  Also, we should note that we will be doing significant amounts with \nrespect to children. I particularly applaud Senator Bob Casey's \namendment to ensure that Rhode Islanders on Rite Care will not have to \nfear losing their safety net coverage.\n  Finally, it is important to note, as I mentioned before, that these \nreforms are paid for. This is a stark contrast to others. We voted on \nthe Medicare prescription bill in 2003, which I opposed. It was unpaid \nfor, and it was more costly than the amendment which was originally \npresented to us.\n  We voted on countless measures outside the normal process of \nbudgeting to fund the wars in Iraq. We voted tax cut after tax cut for \nthe wealthy, which has left my State not prosperous and wealthy but 13 \npercent of my State unemployed and 15 percent of my neighbors are \nuninsured.\n  We are moving forward to reduce the deficit with this bill, to \nprovide valuable coverage, to ensure the promise of health care in the \nUnited States is fulfilled, not denied.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, pending a potential unanimous consent \nrequest by the two leaders, I now yield such time as the Senator from \nMassachusetts desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KIRK. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business, \nthe time to be counted postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kirk are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture \ntime be considered expired on H.R. 3590 at 8 a.m., Thursday, December \n24, if cloture is invoked, and that immediately the bill, as amended, \nbe read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage; that after \npassage of H.R. 3590, as amended, the Senate then proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 245, H.R. 4314, an act to \npermit continued financing of government operations; that no amendments \nbe in order; that the bill be read a third time, and the Senate then \nproceed to vote on passage; that passage require an affirmative 60-vote \nthreshold; and if that threshold is achieved, then the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; further, that on \nWednesday, January 20, 2010, at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, following consultation with the Republican leader, the Finance \nCommittee be discharged of H.J. Res. 45, increasing the statutory limit \non the public debt and the Senate then proceed to the measure; that \nimmediately after the joint resolution is reported, the majority leader \nor his designee be recognized to offer a substitute amendment and that \nthe following be the only first-degree amendments in order to the joint \nresolution: Thune, TARP; Murkowski, endangerment EPA regs; Coburn, \nrescissions package; Sessions, spending caps; McConnell, relevant to \nany on the list; Reid, one relevant to any on the list; Reid, pay-go; \nBaucus, three relevant to any on the list; Conrad-Gregg, fiscal task \nforce; that each of the listed amendments be subject to an affirmative \n60-vote threshold and that if any achieve that threshold, then they be \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that if \nthey do not achieve the 60-vote threshold, then they be withdrawn; that \nupon disposition of all amendments, the substitute amendment, as \namended, if amended, be agreed to, the joint resolution, as amended, be \nread a third time and the Senate then proceed to vote on passage; \nfurther, that passage also be subject to an affirmative 60-vote \nthreshold; further, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent \nthat on Wednesday, January 20, 2010, after a period of morning \nbusiness, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar \nNo. 421, the nomination\n\n[[Page S13748]]\n\nof Beverly Martin to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Eleventh Circuit; \nthat there be 60 minutes of debate with respect to the nomination, with \nthe time equally divided and controlled between Senators Leahy and \nSessions or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate then proceed to vote on confirmation of the \nnomination; that upon confirmation, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, no further motions be in \norder, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not be objecting, I wish to make sure the Senate is aware of an \nunderstanding the majority leader and I have that the substitute \namendment referred to in paragraph 1 will be limited to an actual \namount when it is offered.\n  Mr. REID. That is right. And if there are any amendments here that \npass, of course, they would automatically be part of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to \ninquire whether, under that consent request that is being propounded, \nsecondary amendments would be in order to any of the first-degree \namendments on that list.\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n       Thanking Senate Pages Martin Charboneau and Mikhaila Fogel\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to recognize two young pages who \nare actually on the floor with us today. Martin Charboneau and Mikhaila \nFogel are the pages who energetically volunteered to stay until the \nSenate adjourns and actually have sacrificed some of their Christmas \nvacation. Also, they both volunteered their service over the weekend \nbefore the Thanksgiving break.\n  We typically have seven pages at a time on each of the sides, the \nDemocratic side and the Republican side, but both Martin and Mikhaila \nmarvelously have worked hard and dutifully, on both sides of the \nfloor--both the Democratic side and the Republican side--to make a 14-\nperson job work with just two people.\n  One can imagine how hard a task it must be for just two individuals \nto prepare for the numerous speeches we have had over the course of the \npast week. I know Senator Reid joins me in thanking them for their \ngracious and impeccable service to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to begin by recognizing the work on \nthis legislation of Leader Reid, Chairman Baucus, Chairman Harkin, and \nChairman Dodd.\n  I believe, when the history of this bill is written, it will be \nrecognized what a remarkable job of leadership Senator Reid has \nprovided, bringing together a disparate caucus around extraordinarily \ncomplex issues to accomplish something that will be seen in the future \nas a leap forward for America in reforming the health care system in \nthis country.\n  Chairman Baucus--no one has made a deeper, more committed, personal \nsacrifice than Senator Baucus in advancing this legislation. His \ncommitment to getting this bill done and getting it done right will \nstand the test of history.\n  Chairman Harkin, who succeeded Chairman Kennedy, made major \ncontributions on the wellness provisions.\n  Chairman Dodd, who filled in for Chairman Kennedy and continued in \nthe role of handling this legislation, even while being chairman of the \nBanking Committee, provided an example of legislative leadership that \nis unmatched.\n  The four of them have done a superb job in putting together the \npieces of the bill that I believe will lead the way to a dramatically \nimproved health care system in our country.\n  If we reflect, objectively, on the package before us, it is an \nentirely reasonable and responsible approach. There is no government \ntakeover of health care, no rationing, no cuts to guaranteed Medicare \nbenefits, no benefits for illegal immigrants, and the bill sets a goal \nof no taxpayer funding for abortion beyond the Hyde amendment \nprovisions in current law.\n  In fact, this bill does much of what Republicans said they want in a \nhealth care plan. It is fully paid for, and it reduces deficits in both \nthe short and the long term. It expands coverage and provides \nassistance to help families and small businesses afford health \ninsurance. It sets new rules to stop insurance company abuses. It \nreforms the delivery system to control costs and improve quality. It \nallows for the sale of insurance across State lines. It supports \nmedical malpractice reforms.\n  Those are facts. Every one of those elements is in this bill. This is \nan approach that Senators on both sides of the aisle, who want \nsolutions rather than slogans, should embrace.\n  The need to act is clear. The status quo is simply unsustainable. \nHealth care costs are crushing families, businesses, and even the \ngovernment. The premiums for individuals and families are rising three \ntimes as fast as wages. You can see where we are headed. It is as clear \nas it can be.\n  Without action, families will see average health care premiums rise \nto $22,000 a family by 2019--$22,000, on average, for family health \ncare premiums in 2019, unless we act.\n  It does not stop there. Premiums, as I have indicated, are \nskyrocketing, and national health care costs are skyrocketing right \nalong with them. Without action, total health care spending will equal \n38 percent of the gross domestic product of the country by 2050. \nThirty-eight percent of the gross domestic product for health care? \nThat would be one in every two and half dollars in this economy. \nAlready, we are consuming one in every six in this economy on health \ncare, and that is an unsustainable course. These costs are driving our \nlong-term fiscal imbalances, threatening our future economic \nprosperity.\n  Without action, Federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid will reach \n12.7 percent of GDP by 2050. This chart I have in the Chamber makes it \nvery clear. In 1980, the two programs were consuming 2 percent of gross \ndomestic product, but on the current trend line, by 2050, these two--\nMedicare and Medicaid--will consume more than 12 percent of our GDP--\none in every eight dollars in our economy.\n  The growth in health care costs threatens to bankrupt Medicare. \nMedicare went cash negative last year. Without action, Medicare will be \nbankrupt in 2017. The trustees have just told us that will happen. That \nis 2 years earlier than forecast just last year. Again, Medicare went \ncash negative already. That means more money is going out than is \ncoming in, in the Medicare accounts, and it will be insolvent--broke--\nin 8 years. This legislation extends its life by 9 years.\n  These health care costs are hurting our competitive position in the \nworld. We are spending far more than other countries on health care, \nleaving less money for research and development, investment, and higher \nwages for Americans. In fact, as a percentage of our gross domestic \nproduct, we spend twice as much as most other advanced countries.\n  Here it is, as shown on this chart. We are now even higher than 16 \npercent of our GDP. The latest numbers indicate we have gone to 17 \npercent of our GDP for health care. That is one in every six dollars. \nLook at other countries. Japan and the United Kingdom are half as much; \nBelgium, Germany, Switzerland, France, a little over half as much as we \nare paying.\n  But even with the fact that we are spending more, we are actually \nperforming worse on virtually every metric on health care outcomes. We \nare ranked 19th in preventable deaths, 22nd in infant mortality, 24th \nin life expectancy; and we still leave 46 million people without \ninsurance.\n  Continuing the status quo is not an option. America can do better, \nand this bill proves it. The bill before us is fiscally responsible. \nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--the official scorekeeper, \nrelied on by both sides of the aisle--tells us the bill reduces the \ndeficit by $130 billion over the first 10 years.\n\n[[Page S13749]]\n\n  Now, those aren't my numbers, those aren't the numbers of the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, those aren't the Democratic leader's \nnumbers. Those are the numbers of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice. They say this bill will reduce the deficit by $130 billion over \nthe first 10 years.\n  The savings in the following decade are even more impressive: between \n$650 billion and $1.3 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office says:\n\n       All told, CBO expects that the legislation, if enacted, \n     would reduce Federal budget deficits over the decade after \n     2019 relative to those projected under current law--with a \n     total effect during that decade that is in a broad range \n     between one-quarter percent and one-half percent of gross \n     domestic product.\n\n  One-quarter and one-half percent of GDP for that second 10 years is \n$650 billion to $1.3 trillion. Shame on those who get up on the other \nside and say this is going to increase the deficit. Where is their \nevidence, other than claims, other than assertions? We are talking \nabout the considered judgment of the Congressional Budget Office that \nis nonpartisan and is the official scorekeeper for the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  The bill bends the cost curve for the Federal commitment to health \ncare in the long term. In its December 19 estimate, CBO reports that \nthe proposal would generate a reduction in the Federal budgetary \ncommitment to health care during the decade following the 10-year \nbudget window. So, yes, it bends the cost curve for the Federal \nexpenditure during that period.\n  This legislation also reforms the insurance market. We have all heard \nthe horror stories. I have loads of letters in my office from \nconstituents telling me about what has happened to them: being dropped \nbecause they got sick, even after paying years of premiums; being \ndenied coverage because of preexisting conditions, in many cases \npreexisting conditions that had nothing to do with the illness for \nwhich they now need assistance; and being denied even though they have \npaid the premiums. This is serious business.\n  This bill puts a stop to these abuses. It prohibits insurers from \ndenying coverage for preexisting conditions on new policies. It \nprohibits insurers from rescinding coverage when people become sick \nafter they have paid premiums for years on new plans. It bans insurers \nfrom lifetime caps and annual limits on health care benefits, and it \nprevents insurers from charging more based on health status.\n  It also expands choice and competition. The bill before us builds on \nour current market-based system and makes it better. It is not \ngovernment-run health care. Instead, it embraces choice and \ncompetition. It sets up a new health exchange where consumers can shop \nfor the best value. It creates consumer-run, co-op health plans not \ngovernment-run plans but plans run by the members. It allows for \ninsurance sales across State lines to further increase competition.\n  The managers' amendment also creates a new national plan. The Office \nof Personnel Management, the same agency that currently oversees health \nplans for all Federal employees, including Members of Congress, would \nselect private health insurance carriers to offer plans that would be \navailable nationwide. These plans would provide new competition for \nState-based health plans, particularly in areas where just one or two \ninsurers currently dominate the market. At least one multistate plan \nwould have to be a not-for-profit insurer, such as one of the newly \ncreated co-ops. I am particularly excited by this development.\n  When we look around the world at the countries with the best outcomes \nand the lowest cost, one feature stands out: these countries rely on \nprimarily not-for-profit insurance. Germany, France, Switzerland, \nBelgium, Japan, all have adopted this model. They don't have \ngovernment-run health care, but they do have universal coverage. They \ndo have extremely high-quality health care outcomes and much lower \ncosts than we do. So I believe the not-for-profit national plans and \nthe co-op option may, in the long run, play a key role in transforming \nour system into a more efficient, higher quality system.\n  This legislation also expands coverage. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, it covers 94 percent of the American \npeople. It creates State-based exchanges for individuals and small \nbusinesses. It provides $476 billion in tax credits to help working \nAmericans and small businesses buy coverage. You don't hear that much \nfrom the other side about this $467 billion of tax assistance for \npeople to afford better health care coverage. It also reforms the \ndelivery system to focus on quality and not quantity. The bill before \nus slows cost growth while improving quality. The sad fact is that 30 \npercent of current health care spending does nothing to improve health \ncare outcomes. We are wasting about $750 billion a year on unnecessary \nand counterproductive procedures. Again, that is not a congressional \nestimate; that comes from a Dartmouth nationwide survey that concluded \n30 percent of health care expenditure in this country is wasted. This \nbill reforms the delivery system in a fundamental way. It contains \nevery delivery system reform health care experts believe is needed to \nprovide better care while slowing cost growth.\n  This proposal also extends the solvency of Medicare. Medicare's \nactuary says the Senate bill extends the life of Medicare by 9 years. \nSome on the other side say that because Medicare is heading toward \ninsolvency, we can't have Medicare savings. What? What are they talking \nabout?\n  Perhaps the oddest thing I have seen in this debate is the contrast \nwith the last year of the Bush administration. The previous \nadministration sent up a proposal to have nearly $500 billion in \nsavings under Medicare, and we didn't hear one peep from the other \nside, not one. In fact, they all said it was critically important to \ndo. Now all of a sudden it is the death of Medicare.\n  What is even more bizarre about their argument is that now there is \nan offset for the savings from Medicare providers. The offset is they \nare going to get 30 million new customers, 30 million Americans who \nhaven't had insurance who will now have it so their uncompensated care \ncosts will go down, making it more affordable for providers to provide \nthese savings.\n  Most of these savings have been negotiated with providers. Why have \nthey been willing to agree to savings--hospitals, nursing homes, and \nhome health care? It is because they know they are going to get \nsubstantially expanded business--30 million customers with insurance \nwho previously did not.\n  This is important legislation. These Medicare reforms don't hurt \nseniors. Some on the other side have said you can't reduce the growth \nin Medicare costs without taking benefits away from seniors. That is \njust scare tactics. The Medicare savings provisions lower cost growth \nwithout harming beneficiaries.\n  This legislation also helps my State. I am proud to say it. Some have \nsaid the Medicare changes will hurt North Dakota providers. Clearly, \nthey haven't read the bill. Right now, we get paid way below the \naverage for Medicare reimbursement. In fact, we are the second or third \nlowest State in the country in Medicare reimbursement. North Dakota \nproviders get $5,000 a year per Medicare beneficiary.\n  In Miami, they get three times as much, more than $16,000 a year to \ntake care of seniors there. Now I would be the first to say it may cost \nmore to provide medicine in Miami than it does in Minot, but it doesn't \ncost three times as much. The fact is, moving to a system that is based \non outcomes rather than procedures will benefit, not hurt, a State such \nas North Dakota.\n  In addition, this legislation includes the frontier States provision \nthat Senator Dorgan and I offered as an amendment. Our provision puts a \nfloor under payments to North Dakota providers and in other States like \nours that are rural States that have not received fair levels of \nreimbursement. It will mean an additional $66 million a year in \nMedicare payments to my State.\n  Overall, this bill is a win for North Dakota, a win for the Nation. \nIt reduces the deficit, it controls costs, it saves Medicare--or at \nleast extends its life for at least 9 years--it embraces choice for \nAmerican consumers and competition and expands coverage. It reforms the \ninsurance industry, and it rewards quality and efficiency.\n  This legislation is an excellent start. I urge my colleagues to allow \nit to continue because we all know this isn't the last step. Next we go \nto the conference committee where we will have\n\n[[Page S13750]]\n\na chance to write the final legislation. No doubt this bill will be \nfurther improved as it has been at every step of the process.\n  Again, let me conclude as I began by thanking the leadership who has \nmade this bill a possibility: Senator Reid, who has done a remarkable \njob of bringing people together; Senator Baucus, who has spent more \nthan a year and a half in as dedicated an effort as I have ever seen by \na committee chairman in this body to bring major legislation to \nconclusion; Senator Dodd, who filled in for Senator Kennedy on a pinch \nhit basis but worked so hard to produce a result in that committee; and \nSenator Harkin, the new chairman of the committee, for all of his \nassistance in getting the job done.\n  When the history of this legislation is written, those four will be \nrecognized as producing something that was critically important for \nthis country. We should salute them.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much thank my good friend from \nNorth Dakota for his generous statements. As he knows, this is all \nteamwork. We are all in this together, all Senators, especially on this \nside of the aisle, with the President, to get health care reform \nfinally passed for all Americans. Teddy Roosevelt started this many \nyears ago, and many Presidents since have been unable to get health \ncare reform passed. I think finally this time we are going to do it, \nand it is a moment of which we are all very proud.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nWashington. I don't know how much that is, but whatever it is, it is \nall hers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 7\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, who, I remember, months ago, with a \nsmile on his face, said we can get this done. We are on the verge, and \nwe owe him a huge debt of gratitude. So I thank the Senator very much.\n  As this debate now moves forward, it has become apparent that some of \nour colleagues are losing sight of what we are working on. What should \nbe a robust debate about a critical issue that is facing all of our \nfamilies and businesses is being bogged down by distractions and \npolitical gimmicks and obstructions and a lot of delay while American \nfamilies watch and wait and wonder where they exactly fit into this \nconversation. So I want to be clear with my colleagues and with \nAmericans across the country today: This bill is about you. It is about \nyour loved ones. It is about the people just like you across the \ncountry to bring down your premiums, expand your options, and increase \nyour stability.\n  It is about helping our economy and creating jobs by reducing the \ndrag that has been created by the skyrocketing premiums and unlocking \nthe potential for new health care careers. It is about supporting the \ndoctors and the nurses, the hospitals and the clinics that work every \nday to take care of you. It is about helping you or your father or your \nmother, your grandfather or your grandmother, by increasing benefits, \ncutting waste, and strengthening the Medicare on which you depend. And \nit is about Katerina.\n  Katerina is a woman from Redmond, WA, and she is one of my more than \n10,000 constituents from my home State who have sent me their stories \nabout their experiences with our broken health care system. Katerina is \na single mom. She has a good education, she told me, and she has a good \njob and a solid middle-class lifestyle. But like a lot of Americans \nthis year, struggling in the toughest economy since the Great \nDepression, she was laid off from her job, and she lost her employer-\nprovided health care. She was able to scrape enough money together to \npay for COBRA coverage, but she told me she didn't dare go to the \ndoctor because she knew she wouldn't be able to afford the copays. So \nthough she was technically covered right now, in practice, neither she \nnor her child have access to true health care or preventive services. \nShe found that living that way had some real consequences.\n  Last month she told me she got an eye infection and eventually had to \ngo to the doctor for treatment. She said after all of her out-of-pocket \ncosts and still with no job and no income, she had to make some very \nserious and very tough choices about her family's food and clothing \nbudget. Who knows what would have happened if Katerina or her child got \nseriously ill.\n  Our broken health insurance system is failing Katerina, and she is \nnot alone. Millions of people have lost jobs in this current recession.\n  Millions of families have been tossed out of their employers' plans--\nfamilies who had health care, who felt secure, all of a sudden \nunderstand how broken the system really is and how few options they \nactually have today for affordable care. That is why we need health \ninsurance reform for Katerina and millions of Americans in similar \nsituations and the hundreds of millions of Americans who may switch \njobs or move or start small businesses or who just want more options \nfor high-quality affordable health care.\n  Mr. President, let me talk for a minute about how this bill will \nspecifically help Katerina and many others. Our plan sets up a market \nwhere people can shop for and purchase insurance, where insurance \ncompanies would have to compete for your business, and where people \nsuch as Katerina would be able to choose a plan that fits her family \nbest from among a range of options in an open marketplace.\n  It would inject competition into the insurance market, it will lower \ncosts, and it will give families, such as Katerina's, more choices. \nThat means instead of just having one choice when she is laid off, \nwhich was to purchase high-priced COBRA, Katerina will be able to \ncompare the price and performance of plans and make a decision for her \nfamily with the benefit of true options.\n  That will increase stability and keep insurance companies \naccountable. Never again will insurance companies be able to drop a \nfamily's plan simply because somebody got sick. No longer will losing \nyour job mean losing access to affordable coverage, and no longer will \npeople such as Katerina have to choose between food, clothing, and \nhealth care for herself and her child.\n  It will also keep families secure by ensuring that all insurance \nplans offer an adequate level of coverage, including free preventive \ncare that will keep them healthy and ensure that minor, inexpensive \nmedical issues can be treated before they become major, expensive \nmedical problems.\n  Our plan will increase options, enhance security and stability, and \nit will reduce costs for people such as Katerina by providing credits \nand premium assistance. So families will no longer have to worry about \ntheir coverage if they lose a job, switch jobs, move, or get sick.\n  Mr. President, that is what this plan is about. It is about Katerina, \nit is about her child, and it is about the millions of Americans in \nsimilar situations.\n  If the status quo wins out, things will only get worse. If some of my \ncolleagues continue to play politics with this issue, Katerina will \ncontinue to struggle.\n  If we continue to have delay and distraction and obstruction, \nfamilies will pay more for less, they will lose coverage, and they will \nbe denied treatment and continue to have to fight insurance company \nredtape to get the care they deserve.\n  That is what this is all about. I am going to continue to stand up \nand tell the stories of families and small business owners from \nWashington because they are counting on us to fix this broken system. I \nurge my colleagues to focus on their States' families and join with us \nto pass true health insurance reform.\n  Before I yield, I want to take this opportunity to make an additional \npoint. As everybody knows, we have been working incredibly demanding \nschedules in recent weeks. Senators have seen this floor at every \nconceivable hour--late at night, early in the morning, in the face of a \nblizzard. Far too frequently, we forget that every time we are here, \nthere are literally hundreds of staff forced to be here along with us. \nIn fact, they are often here long before we arrive and long after we \nleave. This body could not function without the tireless dedication of \nthese men and women.\n  Many of them are here now: the clerks, Parliamentarians, cloakroom\n\n[[Page S13751]]\n\nstaff, doorkeepers, Capitol Police officers, and the maintenance \nworkers. They work very long hours, nights, mornings, and weekends--\nwith no regard to a government closure, dangerous snowstorms, or the \nneed to complete their holiday shopping. If we are here, they are here. \nThey deserve our thanks.\n  I want to express my gratitude to every one of them and to my own \nstaff as well. It hasn't been an easy time. You should all know we are \ndeeply appreciative of your service.\n  I, for one, am strongly supportive of bringing this debate to a close \nso that each one of you can be home with your families enjoying some \nwell-deserved time off for the holidays.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/22/senate-section/article/S13751-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13751-S13778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FURTHER CHANGES TO S. CON. RES. 13 PURSUANT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 301(a) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the allocations of a committee or committees, \naggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in the resolution, \nand make adjustments to the pay-as-you-go scorecard, for legislation \nthat is deficit-neutral over 11 years, reduces excess cost growth in \nhealth care spending, is fiscally responsible over the long term, and \nfulfills at least one of eight other conditions listed in the reserve \nfund.\n  I have already made two adjustments pursuant to section 301(a). The \nfirst adjustment was on November 21, for S.A. 2786, the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute to H.R. 3590. The second adjustment was on December 1, for \nS.A. 2791, an amendment to S.A. 2786 to clarify provisions relating to \nfirst dollar coverage for preventive services for women.\n  The Senate today adopted S.A. 3276, an amendment to S.A. 2786 to \nimprove the bill. I find that in conjunction with S.A. 2786, as \nmodified, that this amendment also satisfies the conditions of the \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to transform and modernize American's \nhealth care system. Therefore, pursuant to section 301(a), I am further \nrevising the aggregates in the 2010 budget resolution, as well as the \nallocation to the Senate Finance Committee. Along with those \nadjustments, I have also adjusted the aggregates and committee \nallocation to reflect changes to the original score of S.A. 2786 as a \nresult of a provision included in H.R. 3326, the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act, 2010. That provision uses savings also counted in \nthe score of S.A. 2786. In total, as a result of Congress clearing H.R. \n3326 on December 19, the amount of savings in S.A. 2786 is $1 billion \nlower over the 2010-2014 period.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following \nrevisions to S. Con. Res. 13.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010--S. CON.

Mr. President, the urgent need for comprehensive reform of \nour health care system has not stopped opponents from launching \nspurious attacks. I understand that the junior Senator from Nevada \nrecently raised a constitutional point of order against the pending \nhealth care reform bill. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nI would like to respond to those who have called into question whether \nCongress has the authority under the Constitution to enact health \ninsurance reform legislation. The authority of Congress to act is well-\nestablished by the text and the spirit of the Constitution, by the \nlong-standing precedent established by our courts, by prior acts of \nCongress and by the history of American democracy. The legislative \nhistory of this important measure should leave no doubt with respect to \nthe constitutionality of our actions.\n  The Constitution of the United States begins with a preamble that \nsets forth the purposes for which ``We the People of the United \nStates'' ordained and established it. Among the six purposes set forth \nby the Founders was that the Constitution was established to ``promote \nthe general Welfare.'' It is hard to imagine an issue more fundamental \nto the general welfare of all Americans than their health.\n  The authority and responsibility for taking actions to further this \npurpose is vested in Congress by article I of the Constitution. In \nparticular article I, section 8, sets forth several of the core powers \nof Congress, including the ``general welfare clause,'' the ``commerce \nclause'' and the ``necessary and proper clause.'' These clauses form \nthe basis for Congress's power, and include authority to reform health \ncare by containing spiraling costs and ensuring its availability for \nall Americans. The necessary and proper clause of the Constitution \nprovides that ``The Congress shall have Power . . . To make all Laws \nwhich shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the \nforegoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in \nthe Government of the United States or in any Department or Officer \nthereof.''\n  Any serious questions about congressional power to take comprehensive \naction to build and secure the social safety net have been settled over \nthe past century. According to article I, section 8, ``The Congress \nshall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \nto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare \nof the United States.'' This clause has been the basis for actions by \nCongress to provide for Americans' social and economic security by \npassing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Those landmark laws \nprovide the well-established foundation on which Congress builds today \nby seeking to provide all Americans with access to quality, affordable \nhealth care.\n  The Supreme Court settled the debate on the constitutionality of \nSocial Security more than 70 years ago in three 1937 decisions. In one \nof those decisions, Helvering v. Davis, Justice Cardozo wrote that the \ndiscretion to determine whether a matter impacts the general welfare \n``is not confided in the courts'' but falls ``within the wide range of \ndiscretion permitted to the Congress.'' Turning then to the ``nation-\nwide calamity that began in 1929'' of unemployment spreading from State \nto State throughout the Nation, leaving older Americans without jobs \nand security, Justice Cardozo wrote of the Social Security Act: ``The \nhope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of \nthe poor house as well as from the haunting fear that\n\n[[Page S13752]]\n\nsuch a lot awaits them when journey's end is near.''\n  The Supreme Court reached its decisions upholding Social Security \nafter the first Justice Roberts--Justice Owen Roberts--in the exercise \nof good judgment and judicial restraint began voting to uphold the key \nNew Deal legislation. He was not alone. It was Chief Justice Hughes who \nwrote the Supreme Court's opinion in West Coast Hotel v. Parrish \nupholding minimum wage requirements as reasonable regulation. The \nSupreme Court also upheld a Federal farm bankruptcy law, railroad labor \nlegislation, a regulatory tax on firearms and the Wagner Act on labor \nrelations in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel \nCorporation. The Supreme Court abandoned its judicially created veto \nover congressional action with which it disagreed on policy grounds and \nrightfully deferred to Congress's constitutional authority.\n  Congress has woven America's social safety net over the last three \nscore and 12 years. Congress's authority to use its power and its \njudgment to promote the general welfare cannot now be in doubt. America \nand all Americans are the better for it. Growing old no longer means \ngrowing poor. Being older or poor no longer means being without medical \ncare. These developments are all due to congressional action.\n  These Supreme Court decisions and the principles underlying them are \nnot in question. As dean Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of \nCalifornia Irvine School of Law wrote in a recent op-ed in The Los \nAngeles Times: ``Congress has broad power to tax and spend for the \ngeneral welfare. In the last 70 years, no federal taxing or spending \nprogram has been declared to exceed the scope of Congress' power. The \nability in particular of Congress to tax people to spend money for \nhealth coverage has been long established with programs such as \nMedicare and Medicaid.'' I will ask that this article be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The right-wing opponents of health care reform are so intent on \npartisan warfare that they are even calling into question the \nconstitutionality of America's established social safety net. They \nwould leave American workers without the protections their lifetime of \nhard work have earned them. They would turn back the clock to the \nhardships of the Great Depression, and thrust modern American back into \nthe conditions of Dickens' novels. That is what some extremists will be \nurging another Justice Roberts--Chief Justice John Roberts--to do. That \npath should be rejected now, just as it was when another inspiring \nPresident led the effort to confront the economic challenges facing \nAmericans. To strike down principles that have been settled for nearly \nthree quarters of a century would be wrong and damaging to the Nation.\n  For months now, we have been debating whether or not to pass health \ncare reform. We can debate whether to control costs by having all \nAmericans be covered by health insurance. In fact, we have been having \nthat debate for months and months in this Congress, through extensive \npublic markups in two committees in the Senate, as well as in the House \nof Representatives, and now for weeks on the Senate floor. We have \nconsidered untold numbers of amendments in committees and several \nbefore the Senate. That is what Congress is supposed to do. We consider \nlegislation, debate it, vote on it and act in our best collective \njudgment to promote the general welfare. Some Senators will agree and \nsome will disagree, but it is a matter for the full Senate to decide. I \nwish we could do so by a majority but Senate Republicans abhor majority \nrule now that they are not in control. So it will take an extraordinary \nmajority for the Senate's will to be done.\n  Tomorrow, we will vote on a point of order challenging the pending \nbill's constitutionality. The fact that Senate Republicans disagree \nwith the majority's effort to help hardworking Americans obtain access \nto affordable health care does not make it unconstitutional. As Justice \nCardozo wrote in upholding Social Security, ``whether wisdom or \nunwisdom resides in the scheme of benefits set forth . . . it is not \nfor us to say. The answer to such inquiries must come from Congress, \nnot the courts.'' I agree. Justice Cardozo understood the separation of \npowers enshrined in the Constitution and the Supreme Court's precedent. \nIn 1803, our greatest Chief Justice, John Marshall, upheld the \nconstitutionality of the Judiciary Act in Stuart v. Laird noted that \n``there are no words in the Constitution to prohibit or restrain the \nexercise of legislation power.'' That is true here, where Congress is \nacting to provide for the general welfare of all Americans.\n  I believe that Congress can and should decide whether the problems of \nthe lack of availability and affordability of health care, and the \nrising health care costs that burden the American people, is a problem, \n``plainly national in area and dimensions,'' as Justice Cardozo wrote \nof the widespread crisis of unemployment and insecurity during the \nGreat Depression. I believe that it is right for this Congress to \ndetermine that it is in the general welfare of the Nation to ensure \nthat all Americans have access to affordable quality health care. But \nwhether other Senators agree or disagree with me, none should argue \nthat we should take steps that turn back to clock to the Great \nDepression when conservative activist judges prevented Congress from \nexercising its powers to make that determination. As Chief Justice \nMarshall wrote in his landmark decision in McCulloch v. Maryland: ``Let \nthe end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, \nand all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adopted to that \nend, which are not prohibited, but consistent with the letter and \nspirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.''\n  In seeking to discredit health care reform, the other side relies on \na resurrection of long-discredited legal doctrines used by courts a \ncentury ago to tie Congress's hands by substituting their own views of \nproperty to strike down laws such as those guaranteeing a minimum wage \nand outlawing child labor. They have to rely on such cases of unbridled \nconservative judicial activism as Lochner v. New York, Shechter Poultry \nCorporation v. United States, Reagan v. Farmers Loan and Trust and the \ninfamous Dred Scott case. Those dark days are long gone and better left \nbehind. The Constitution, Supreme Court precedent, our history and \ncongressional action all stand on the side of Congress's authority to \nenact health care legislation including health insurance reform.\n  Under article I, section 8, Congress has the power ``to regulate \nCommerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.'' Since at \nleast the time of the Great Depression and the New Deal, Congress has \nbeen understood and acknowledged by the Supreme Court to have power \npursuant to the commerce clause to regulate matters with a substantial \neffect on interstate commerce. The Supreme Court has long since upheld \nlaws like the Fair Labor Standards Act against commerce clause \nchallenges, ruling that Congress had the authority to outlaw child \nlabor. The days when women and children could not be protected, when \nthe public could not be protected from sick chickens infecting them, \nwhen farmers could not be protected and when any regulation that did \nnot guarantee profits to corporations are long past. The reach of \nCongress's commerce clause authority has been long established and well \nsettled.\n  Even recent decisions by a Supreme Court dominated by Republican-\nappointed justices have affirmed this rule of law. In 2005, the Supreme \nCourt ruled in Gonzales v. Raich that Congress had the power under the \ncommerce clause to prohibit the use of medical marijuana even though it \nwas grown and consumed at home, because of its impact on the national \nmarket for marijuana. Surely if that law passes constitutional muster, \nCongress's actions to regulate the health care market that makes up \none-sixth of the American economy meets the test of substantially \naffecting commerce. Conservatives cannot have it both ways. They cannot \nignore the settled meaning of the Constitution as well as the authority \nof the American people's elected representatives in Congress.\n  The regulation of health insurance clearly meets the test from Raich, \nwhether the activities ``taken in the aggregate, substantially affect \ninterstate commerce.'' Addressing these problems is at the core of \nCongress's powers under the commerce clause. In\n\n[[Page S13753]]\n\nfact, the Supreme Court expressly addressed this issue 65 years ago, \nruling in 1944 that insurance was interstate commerce and subject to \nFederal regulation. Congress responded to this decision in 1945 with \nthe McCarran-Ferguson Act, which gave insurance companies an exemption \nfrom antitrust laws unless Federal regulation was made explicit under \nFederal law. It is the immunity from Federal antitrust law enacted in \nMcCarran-Ferguson that I have been working to overcome with my Health \nInsurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2009 and the amendment \nI have sought to offer to the current health insurance reform \nlegislation. Why would this exemption have been necessary if insurance \nwas not interstate commerce? I strongly believe that the exemption in \nMcCarran-Ferguson is wrongheaded but would anyone seriously contend \nthat it is unconstitutional? Of course not. That is why I am working so \nhard to pass legislation to repeal it.\n  The legislation and amendment I have sponsored will prohibit the most \negregious anticompetitive conduct--price fixing, bid rigging and market \nallocations--conduct that harms consumers, raises health care costs, \nand for which there is no justification. Subjecting health and medical \nmalpractice insurance providers to the Federal antitrust laws will \nenable customers to feel confident that the price they are being quoted \nis the product of a fair marketplace. The lack of affordable health \ninsurance plagues families throughout our country, and my amendment \nwould take a step toward ensuring competition among health insurers and \nmedical malpractice insurers. The need for Congress to repeal the out \nof date Federal antitrust law exemption only further demonstrates the \ntremendous impact of health care on our economy and congressional power \nto act.\n  The third clause of article I, section 8, to which I have referred, \nis the necessary and proper clause, as a basis for congressional \naction. This clause gives Congress the power ``to make all Laws which \nshall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing \nPowers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the United \nStates.'' The Supreme Court settled the meaning of the necessary and \nproper clause 190 years ago in Justice Marshall landmark decision in \nMcCullough v. Maryland, during the dispute over the National Bank. \nJustice Marshall wrote that ``the clause is placed among the powers of \nCongress, not among the limitations on those powers.'' The necessary \nand proper clause goes hand in hand with the commerce clause to ensure \ncongressional authority to regulate activity with a significant \neconomic impact.\n  We face a health care crisis, with millions of Americans uninsured \nand with uncertainty and high costs for Americans who are insured. We \nneed to ensure that Americans not risk bankruptcy and disaster with \nevery illness. Americans who work hard their whole life should not be \nrobbed of their family's security because health care is too expensive. \nDuring the New Deal we charted a path for America where growing old did \nnot mean being poor, or being without health care. Americans should not \nlose their life savings because they have the misfortune of losing a \njob or getting sick. That is not America.\n  The success of the last century was the establishment of a social \nsafety net for which all Americans can be grateful and proud. Through \nSocial Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Congress established some of \nthe cornerstones of American security. They are within the \nconstitutional authority of the Congress just as health insurance \nreform is. No conservative activist court should overstep the \njudiciary's role by seeking to turn back the clock and deny a century \nof progress. The authority of Congress is well settled and well \nestablished by the Constitution, judicial precedent, and our history of \nlegislation promoting the general welfare and protecting the economic \nsecurity and health of Americans.\n  The cumulative economic effects on the Nation of the rising costs of \nhealth care are significant, with those costs making up a large \npercentage of our economy and with American businesses struggling to \nprovide benefits to their employees. As set forth in a paper by \nGeorgetown University and the O'Neill Institute for National and Global \nHealth Law, the requirement for individuals to purchase health \ninsurance would address the problem of free riders, millions of \nAmericans who refuse to buy health insurance and then rely on expensive \nemergency health care when faced with medical problems. This shifts the \ncosts of their health care to people who do have insurance, which in \nturn has a significant effect on the costs of insurance premiums for \ncovered Americans and on the economy as a whole. A requirement that all \nAmericans have health insurance--like requirements to be vaccinated or \nto have car insurance or to register for the draft or to pay taxes--is \nwithin congressional power if Congress determines it to be essential to \ncontrolling spiraling health care costs. Requiring that all Americans \nhave health insurance coverage, and preventing some from depending on \nexpensive emergency services in place of regular health care, can and \nwill help reduce the cost of health insurance premiums for those who \nalready have insurance.\n  Whether Senators agree or not on the necessity to reform our health \ncare system and health insurance, I trust that all Senators, \nRepublican, Democratic and Independent, agree that it is our \nresponsibility to act and within Congress's constitutional authority to \nlegislate for the general welfare of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Los Angeles Times op-ed to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Oct. 6, 2009]\n\n                  The Constitutionality of Healthcare\n\n                         (By Erwin Chemerinsky)\n\n       Are the healthcare bills pending in the House and Senate \n     unconstitutional?\n       That's what some of the bills' critics have alleged. Their \n     argument focuses on the fact that most of the major proposals \n     would require all Americans to obtain healthcare coverage or \n     pay a tax if they don't. Those too poor to afford insurance \n     would have their health coverage provided by the state.\n       Although the desirability of this approach can be debated, \n     it unquestionably would be constitutional.\n       Those who claim otherwise make two arguments. First, they \n     say the requirement is beyond the scope of Congress' powers. \n     And second, they say that people have a right to be uninsured \n     and that requiring them to buy health insurance violates \n     individual liberty. Neither argument has the slightest merit \n     from a constitutional perspective.\n       Congress has broad power to tax and spend for the general \n     welfare. In the last 70 years, no federal taxing or spending \n     program has been declared to exceed the scope of Congress' \n     power. The ability in particular of Congress to tax people to \n     spend money for health coverage has been long established \n     with programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n       Congress has every right to create either a broad new tax \n     to pay for a national healthcare program or to impose a tax \n     only on those who have no health insurance.\n       The reality is that virtually everyone will, at some point, \n     need medical care. And, if a person has certain kinds of \n     communicable diseases, the government will insist that he or \n     she be treated whether they are insured or not. A tax on the \n     uninsured is a way of paying for the costs of their likely \n     future medical care.\n       Another basis for the power of Congress to impose a health \n     insurance mandate is that the legislature is charged with \n     regulating commerce among the states. The Supreme Court has \n     held that this means Congress has the ability to regulate \n     activities that have a substantial effect on interstate \n     commerce. A few years ago, for example, the court held that \n     Congress could prohibit individuals from cultivating and \n     possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal \n     use because marijuana is bought and sold in interstate \n     commerce.\n       The relationship between healthcare coverage and the \n     national economy is even clearer. In 2007, healthcare \n     expenditures amounted to $2.2 trillion, or $7,421 a person, \n     and accounted for 16.2% of the gross domestic product.\n       The claim that individuals have a constitutional ``right'' \n     to not have health insurance is no stronger than the \n     objection that this would exceed Congress' powers. It is hard \n     to even articulate the constitutional right that would be \n     violated by requiring individuals to have health insurance or \n     pay a tax.\n       Since the 19th century, the Supreme Court has consistently \n     held that a tax cannot be challenged as an impermissible \n     taking of private property for public use without just \n     compensation. All taxes, of course, are a taking of private \n     property for public use, and a tax to pay for health \n     coverage--whether imposed on all Americans or just the \n     uninsured--is certainly something Congress could impose.\n       The claim that an insurance mandate would violate the due \n     process clause is also\n\n[[Page S13754]]\n\n     specious. Most states have a requirement for mandatory car \n     insurance, and every challenge to such mandates has been \n     rejected. More important, since 1937, the Supreme Court has \n     constantly held that government regulations of property and \n     the economy will be upheld as long as they are reasonable. \n     Virtually every economic regulation and tax has been found to \n     meet this requirement. A mandate for health coverage would \n     meet this standard, which is so deferential to the \n     government.\n       Finally, those who object to having health coverage on \n     freedom-of-religion grounds also have no case. The Supreme \n     Court has expressly rejected objections to paying Social \n     Security and other taxes on religious grounds. More \n     generally, the Supreme Court has ruled that individuals do \n     not have a right to an exemption from a general law on the \n     ground that it burdens their religion.\n       There is much to debate over healthcare reform and how to \n     achieve it. But those who object on constitutional grounds \n     are making a faulty argument that should have no place in the \n     debate over this important public issue.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment to \ncreate a medical insurance rate authority and rate review process that \nI filed to the Patient Care and Affordable Choice Act.\n  Unfortunately, because of the objections of one of my colleagues, my \namendment was not included in the final bill before us today.\n  I am profoundly disappointed. I would like to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss why I believe this proposal is so important and why, without \nit, we can expect to see skyrocketing health insurance premiums.\n  I am very concerned that health insurance companies will seek to \nexploit the time between passage of the bill, and 2014, when reforms \nare fully in place.\n  Credit card companies provide a useful example. Earlier this year, \nCongress approved major credit card reform legislation. However, the \nconsumer protections it contains will not be fully effective until \nFebruary 2010.\n  Credit card companies have taken full advantage of this interim \nperiod to raise rates, with many card interest rates increasing 20 \npercent over the last year.\n  I am very worried that health insurance companies will do the very \nsame thing. And I believe the rate authority amendment is essential to \nstopping them.\n  In some States, insurance commissioners have the authority to review \nrates and increases and block rates that are found to be unjustified. \nAccording to a 2008 Families USA report, 33 States have some form of a \nprior approval process for premium increases.\n  The same report describes several notable successes among States that \nuse this process, including . . . regulators in North Dakota were able \nto reduce 37 percent of the proposed rate increases filed by insurers. \nMaryland used their State laws to block a 46-percent premium increase \nafter a company charged artificially low rates for 2 years. The \ndecision was upheld in court. New Hampshire regulators were able to \nreduce a proposed 100 percent rate increase to 12.5 percent.\n  But in other States, including California, insurance commissioners do \nnot have this ability.\n  And Some states have laws like this on the books, but do not have \nsufficient resources to review all the rate changes that insurance \ncompanies propose.\n  Consumers deserve full protection from unfair rate increases, no \nmatter where they live.\n  The amendment I have proposed would ensure that all Americans have \nsome level of basic protection. The amendment will strengthen a \nprovision included in the underlying bill, which already requires \ninsurance companies to submit justifications and explain increases in \npremiums. They must submit these justifications to the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, and they must make these justifications \navailable on their Web site.\n  I believe we must do more.\n  The amendment asks the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners to produce a report detailing the rate review laws and \ncapabilities in all 50 States. The Secretary of HHS will then use these \nfindings to determine which States have the authority and capability to \nundertake sufficient rate reviews to protect consumers.\n  In States where insurance commissioners have authority to review \nrates, they will continue to do so.\n  In States without sufficient authority or resources, the Secretary of \nHHS will review rates and take any appropriate action to deny unfair \nrequests.\n  This could mean blocking unjustified rate increases, or requiring \nrebates, if an unfair increase is already in effect.\n  This will provide all American consumers with another layer of \nprotection from an unfair premium increase.\n  The amendment would also require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to establish a medical insurance rate authority as part of the \nprocess in the bill that enables her to monitor premium costs.\n  The rate authority would advise the Secretary on insurance rate \nreview and would be composed of seven officials that represent the full \nscope of the health care system including: at least two consumers; at \nleast one medical professional; and one representative of the medical \ninsurance industry.\n  The remaining members would be experts in health economics, actuarial \nscience, or other sectors of the health care system.\n  The rate authority will also issue an annual report, providing \nAmerican consumers with basic information about how insurance companies \nare behaving in the market. It will examine premium increases, by plan \nand by State, as well as medical loss ratios, reserves and solvency of \ncompanies, and other relevant behaviors.\n  This data will give consumers better information. But more \nimportantly, it will give the newly created insurance exchanges better \ninformation.\n  Under the amendment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and \nthe relevant insurance commissioner, will recommend to exchanges \nwhether a company should be permitted to participate in the exchanges.\n  So companies should be put on notice: unfair premium increases and \nother unfair behaviors will come with a price. Millions of Americans \nwill receive tax credits to purchase coverage in the exchange beginning \nin 2014. Insurance companies will need to demonstrate that they are \nworthy of participating in this new market, and receiving Federal money \nto cover uninsured Americans.\n  This concern about premium increases stems from the fact that we are \nthe only industrialized nation that relies heavily on a for-profit \nmedical insurance industry to provide basic health care. I believe, \nfundamentally, that all medical insurance should be not for profit.\n  The industry is focused on profits, not patients. And it is heavily \nconcentrated, leaving consumers with few alternatives when their \npremiums do increase.\n  As of 2007, just two carriers--WellPoint and UnitedHealth Group--had \ngained control of 36 percent of the national market for commercial \nhealth insurance.\n  Since 1998, there have been more than 400 mergers of health insurance \ncompanies, as larger carriers have purchased, absorbed, and enveloped \nsmaller competitors.\n  In 2004 and 2005 alone, this industry had 28 mergers, valued at more \nthan $53 billion. That is more merger activity in health insurance than \nin the 8 previous years combined.\n  Today, according to a study by the American Medical Association, more \nthan 94 percent of American health insurance markets are highly \nconcentrated, as characterized by U.S. Department of Justice \nguidelines. This means these companies could raise premiums or reduce \nbenefits with little fear that consumers will end their contracts and \nmove to a more competitive carrier.\n  In my State of California just two companies, WellPoint and Kaiser \nPermanente, control more than 58 percent of the market. In Los Angeles, \nthe top two carriers controlled 51 percent of the market.\n  Record levels of market concentration have helped generate a record \nlevel of profit increases.\n  Between 2000 and 2007, profits at 10 of the largest publicly traded \nhealth insurance companies soared 428 percent from--$2.4 billion in \n2000 to $12.9 billion in 2007. This is Health Care for America Now, \nPremiums Soaring in Consolidated Health Insurance Market, May 2009, \nciting U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n  The CEOs at these companies took in record earnings. In 2007, these \n10 CEOs\n\n[[Page S13755]]\n\nmade a combined $118.6 million. The CEO of CIGNA took home $25.8 \nmillion; The CEO of Aetna took home $23 million; The CEO of \nUnitedHealth took home $13.2 million; and the CEO of WellPoint took \nhome $9.1 million.\n  I am very concerned that this profit seeking behavior will only \nworsen, now that insurance companies know that health reform will \nchange their business model.\n  Insurers know that come 2014, they will be playing by new rules: No \ndiscriminating based on preexisting conditions. No cherry picking and \nchoosing to cover only the healthy. No charging women or older people \nastronomical rates. No dropping coverage once someone gets sick.\n  Insurers know these changes are coming. Listen to a comment made by \nMichael A. Turpin, a former senior executive for UnitedHealth. He is \nnow a top official at an insurance brokerage firm, and he said that \ninsurers were ``under so much pressure to post earnings, they're going \nto make hay while the sun is shining.''\n  ``Make hay while the sun is shining.'' That means these companies \nwill try to make as much money as they possibly can, for as long as \nthey can.\n  That is why a rate review amendment is so important.\n  Frankly, I wish the health reform bill before us would go further and \neliminate the for-profit health insurance industry.\n  But since this bill chooses to maintain a for-profit industry, we \nmust do the next best thing and ensure that it is thoroughly regulated. \nInsurance companies should not be able to take advantage of the fact \nthat affordable health care is a basic life need. In effect, they have \nthe power to increase their prices at will, knowing that people will \ncontinue to pay as long as they can afford to do so.\n  This amendment certainly will not fix all of the ills of a for-profit \ninsurance industry, but I believe it makes a needed improvement in the \nunderlying bill and will help protect consumers from unfair increases. \nWithout it, I worry that consumers in far too many States will see \nmajor premium increases.\n  I will continue to work to see that this amendment is included in the \nfinal version of health reform legislation. Without it, too many \nAmericans will still lack protection from unfair rate increases.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a support letter from \nCalifornia organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 17, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Re Support of amendment to HR. 3590 to improve rate review of \n         increases in health insurance premiums.\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: Thank you for your leadership in \n     advancing health reform this year. We, the undersigned \n     organizations, support a proposed amendment by Senators \n     Feinstein, Rockefeller and others that would provide greater \n     specificity in terms of rate review of increases in health \n     insurance premiums.\n       The proposed amendment:\n       Creates a rate review authority that could deny or modify \n     unjustified rate increases or order rebates to consumers,\n       Defines potentially unjustified rate increases as increases \n     which exceed market averages,\n       Gives priority to rate increases that impact large numbers \n     of consumers,\n       Creates market conduct studies of health insurance rate \n     increases,\n       Exclude from State Exchanges insurers that have a pattern \n     of excessive premium increase, low medical loss ratios or \n     other market conduct,\n       Allows a State to conduct the rate reviews.\n       We support the provisions of health reform which make \n     health insurance more affordable for individuals and \n     businesses. This amendment is consistent with the stated \n     intention of the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act'' and provides greater specificity to the provisions on \n     ``ensuring that consumers get value for their dollars.''\n       The proposed amendment prevents anticipatory price \n     increases by health insurers in advance of full \n     implementation of health reform. Scrutiny of rate increases \n     will have a deterrent effect on increases in premiums that \n     are out of line.\n       For these reasons, we support the proposed amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Angie Wei,\n       Legislative Director, California Labor Federation.\n     Marty Martinez,\n       Policy Director, California Pan-Ethnic Health Network.\n     Michael Russo,\n       Health Care Advocate and Staff Attorney, California Public \n     Research Interest Group (CALPIRG).\n     Sonya Vasquez,\n       Policy Director, Community Health Councils, Inc.\n     Gary Passmore,\n       Director, Congress of California Seniors.\n     Anthony Wright,\n       Executive Director, Health Access California.\n     Bill A. Lloyd,\n       Executive Director, Service Employees International Union \n     California State Council.\n     Rev. Lindi Ramsden,\n       Executive Director, Unitarian Universalist Legislative \n     Ministry Action Network--California.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several \nRepublican colleagues and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy for the \nnext hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Washington for \ncommending and complimenting the staff. That is a bipartisan sentiment \nfor this Christmas season. I am sure every Senator on the floor feels \nthe same way and expresses that appreciation to the hard-working staff.\n  I want to start off by saying there is still an opportunity for this \nbill to be amended to change some of the very harmful ways that this \nwill affect our people back home and, particularly, our State \ngovernments.\n  I was on the Senate floor several days ago pointing out the \nobjections that most of the State Governors have with regard to the \nMedicaid mandates. I want to read from a letter dated December 10, from \nmy Governor, Haley Barbour of Mississippi, who reminds Senators that:\n\n       This bill continues to place a huge unfunded mandate on \n     States, while harming our small businesses and seniors \n     through budget gimmicks and increased taxes.\n\n  And he says this:\n\n       If the current bill, which would expand Medicaid up to 133 \n     percent of the Federal poverty level, were enacted into law, \n     the number of Mississippians on Medicaid would increase to \n     1,037,606, or 1 in 3 citizens, in Mississippi. Over 10 years, \n     this bill would cost Mississippi taxpayers $1.3 billion.\n\n  I was on the Senate floor a few days ago also with this map, which \nshows in red the number of States that are facing this unfunded mandate \nbecause of the increased Federal mandate for Medicare coverage coming \nfrom this bill, should it be enacted into law. I was pointing out that \nonly the two States--Vermont and Massachusetts--because of a formula \nthat has been worked out, would be exempt. Every other State will have \nto come up with the extra money either through cutting education \nprograms, cutting mental health programs or other vital services or by \nraising taxes. They will have to come up with the extra money under \nthis legislation so that half of the people covered by this new act \nwill be covered by Medicaid.\n  I want to make an amendment to that chart today and add one other \nState. I think it has become quite a well-known fact that we need to \nput one other State up there in yellow, and that is the State of \nNebraska.\n  We know pursuant to an agreement that was made before Senator Nelson \nannounced his support as the 60th vote for cloture on this very \nimportant legislation, a deal was cut--the minority leader said a cheap \ndeal, and I agree--that the State of Nebraska would be exempt in \nperpetuity from its requirement to pay the State match. The Federal \nGovernment, according to this legislation that we will be asked to vote \non in the next 2 days, will pick up all of the extra expenditures for \nthe State of Nebraska.\n  The poverty level in Nebraska is not quite as bad. I don't know how \nthe powers that be felt they should or could justify this expenditure, \nbut I will tell you the people in the State of Mississippi are going to \nhave to come up\n\n[[Page S13756]]\n\nwith another $1.3 billion over the next 10 years to pay for what we are \ngoing to be required to do by Congress--in its wisdom.\n  How is it fair that one Senator from Nebraska goes behind closed \ndoors with the majority leader and cuts this deal so that his citizens \ndon't have to pay this extra tax, and they don't have to do without \nservices in other State programs to come up with the money? No one in \nthis building--nobody within the sound of my voice--can come in here \nand explain why that is fair.\n  The fact is, the majority leader needed that vote, and that was part \nof the deal that was cut. Now citizens in Arizona, citizens in Wyoming, \ncitizens in Mississippi, in Arkansas, and in Louisiana--we will have to \ncome up with the extra Federal tax money on our part, but the Federal \nGovernment can cover all of the additional costs--State and Federal--in \nNebraska.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, on that map, I wonder should \nthere not be a sticker for the State of Florida? According to a \npublished report by one of my favorite columnists, Dana Milbank, of the \nWashington Post:\n\n       Gator Aid: Senator Bill Nelson inserted a grandfather \n     clause that would allow Floridians to preserve their pricey \n     Medicare Advantage program.\n\n  So maybe we should have one of those stickers for Florida there. By \nthe way, that will cost my constituents more money because they will \nnot have that same deal. Should there be a sticker for Montana?\n  Again, according to Dana Milbank:\n\n       Handout Montana: Senator Max Baucus secured Medicare \n     coverage for anybody exposed to asbestos--as long as they \n     worked in a mine in Libby, Montana.\n\n  Should there be a sticker there?\n  Continuing, Dana Milbank says:\n\n       Iowa pork and Omaha Prime Cuts: Senator Tom Harkin won more \n     Medicare money for low-volume hospitals of the sort commonly \n     found in Iowa. . . .\n\n  Maybe there should be a sticker for that. I don't know if you have \nNorth Dakota in there. Dana Milbank says:\n\n       Meanwhile, Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, both \n     North Dakota Democrats, would enjoy a provision that would \n     bring higher Medicaid payments to hospitals and doctors in \n     ``frontier counties'' of states such as--let's see here--\n     North Dakota!\n\n  Should there be one for Hawaii? Mr. Milbank goes on to say:\n\n       Hawaii, with two Democratic senators, would get richer \n     payments to hospitals that treat many uninsured people.\n\n  Should there be a sticker there for Michigan? Mr. Milbank says:\n\n       Michigan, home of two other Democrats, would earn higher \n     Medicare payments for some reduced fees for Blue Cross/Blue \n     Shield. Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders held out for larger \n     Medicaid payments for his state. (neighboring Massachusetts \n     would get one, too).\n\n  I guess there are a number of States that maybe should have stickers \non them so that the American people can see where these special deals \nwere cut out, and the majority of the population of this country can \nsee where they were not. They are going to pay while those States pay \nless because of not just their location but because they happen to have \nbeen behind closed doors and cut special deals.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wonder if the Senator would yield briefly.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure. I ask that Senator Baucus be recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am pointing out, as the Senators know, for example, \nunder this legislation, the Federal Government pays all the costs of \neligible enrollees through 2016. In this legislation, we are talking \nabout the so-called expansion population. That is those between 100 \npercent of poverty on Medicaid and 133 percent of poverty, and under \nthe underlying statute----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does that mean all these States are being treated the \nsame?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In 2016, all States are treated the same.\n  Mr. McCAIN. This happens to be 2009. What happens between now and \n2016?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Beginning next year, when this goes into effect, 2010 \nthrough 2016, all States will get 100 percent payments for that \nexpansion coverage.\n  Mr. WICKER. What would happen, then, after 2016 under current \nlegislation?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Afterward, under current legislation--one sentence of \nbackground. Today, as the Senator well knows, different States receive \ndifferent Federal contributions to Medicaid. It varies according to \nStates. The average is about 57 percent Federal. The average for all \nStates on average is 57 percent of the cost of Medicaid is paid for----\n  Mr. McCAIN. If that is the case----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Let me finish.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If that is the case, we will be glad to have the same \nprovision inserted for the State of Arizona that was inserted for the \nState of Florida. You don't have a problem with that, do you?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Let me answer the question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Do you have a problem with that?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I can answer only one question at a time. The first \nquestion is from the Senator from Mississippi. Then, after 2017, all \nStates get 90 percent--we are talking about expansion of population.\n  Mr. WICKER. The Senator yielded to me the other day, and I appreciate \nthat. We have a number of Republicans who want to speak during our \nhour.\n  The fact is, after 2016, every State in red has to tax their own \ncitizens and pay their State share, except Vermont, Massachusetts, and \nNebraska. And I still challenge any colleague in this Senate to come \nbefore this body and say that is fair. I do not believe they will say \nthat is fair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My question to the Senator from Montana is this: Would \nthe Senator from Montana be willing to have the same provision that \nSenator Nelson, according to these reports, inserted, a grandfather \nclause that would allow Floridians to reserve their price in the \nMedicare Advantage Program? Would he accept a unanimous consent request \nright now that same provision apply to every State in America?\n  I ask unanimous consent that the same provision that was put in for \nthe State of Florida by Senator Nelson would apply to every State in \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, I think it would be highly \nimprudent for me not to object, so I will object to that request. I \nalso point out that on average, Uncle Sam pays 90 percent of the \nMedicaid payments for this expansion of population after the year 2016.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think the fact that an objection was heard resolves the \ncase. Those are comforting words on the part of the Senator from \nMontana, whom I appreciate, but the fact is, there are special deals \nfor special people. It is well known. It is very well known.\n  May I mention to my colleagues--sort of a personal privilege here--\nthe Senator from Louisiana came to the floor this morning and said:\n\n       Recently, just yesterday, Senator John McCain, our \n     colleague from Arizona, has claimed that the American people \n     are opposed to reform and he speaks about the will of the \n     majority. I would like to remind, respectfully, my colleague \n     from Arizona that the will of the majority spoke last year \n     when they elected President Obama to be President and they \n     decided not to elect him, and the President is carrying out \n     the will of the majority of the people to try to provide them \n     hope and opportunity.\n\n  I say in response to that, I really did not need to be reminded. I \nhad not forgotten. Sometimes I would very much like to. But I \nappreciate the reminder.\n  The fact is that the Senator from Louisiana and other Senators should \nknow that poll after poll, public opinion, partially because of what \nthe Senator from Mississippi is pointing out--the latest being ``U.S. \nVoters Oppose Health Care Plan by Wide Margin.'' A Quinnipiac poll \nfinds 3 to 1 that the plan should not pay for abortion. And it says \nAmerican voters mostly disapprove of the plan 53-36 and disapprove 56-\n38 percent President Obama's handling of the health care issue.\n  If I can remind my friend and colleague from Louisiana, I did carry \nher State.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator carried my State too.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the State of the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. If I may jump in here, probably like every Senator here, \nI read the newspapers back home every morning as I start my day. There \nwas an editorial in the Lincoln Journal Star on December 21 that speaks \nto this issue of special deals. I thought it\n\n[[Page S13757]]\n\nwas excellent. The Lincoln Journal Star has covered me for a long time. \nSometimes I agree with them, sometimes I do not. Sometimes they agree \nwith me, sometimes they do not. But I have always respected the work \nthey do.\n  Here is what they said in their editorial:\n\n       Since when has Nebraska become synonymous for cynical \n     ``what's in it for me''-type politics?\n       The term ``Cornhusker kickback'' is already a favorite of \n     television's talking heads.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       That's how the rest of the country sees [this] deal.\n\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       Under its provisions, the federal government would pay all \n     additional Medicaid costs for Nebraska ``in perpetuity.'' The \n     Congressional Budget Office has estimated the deal may be \n     worth $100 million over 10 years.\n\n  They go on to say I think in very powerful language:\n\n       The deal is the embodiment of what is wrong in Washington.\n       Instead of thoughtful, careful work on real problems, \n     Washington lawmakers cobble together special deals, dubious \n     financial accounting and experimentation on a grandiose \n     scale.\n\n  They devote a paragraph to the many special deals cut, and the \nSenator's chart illustrates one.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will----\n  Mr. JOHANNS. If I may finish, I say to Senator McCain, and then you \ncan ask me.\n  They say this:\n\n       It's time to push the reset button on health care reform.\n       The effort has gone awry.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. But also, doesn't this bring up a larger issue--I ask all \nmy colleagues to comment on this--whether our job here is to do \nwhatever we can to just simply help our State, even if it is at the \nexpense of other States, as the Senator from Mississippi pointed out, \nor is our title U.S. Senator, Arizona, Nebraska, Mississippi, et \ncetera? My title is not Arizona Senator, U.S.; it is U.S. Senator, \nArizona. So of course I am here to represent the people of my State. \nBut is a U.S. Senator's job to go out and do something which would then \nbe at the expense of the citizens of another State simply by virtue of \ntheir clout and influence? Is that what we were sent here by our \nconstituents to do?\n  Is it true what the majority leader said yesterday:\n\n       \"I don't know if there is a Senator that doesn't have \n     something in this bill that was important to them,'' Senate \n     Majority Leader Harry Reid reasoned when asked at a news \n     conference Monday about the cash-for-cloture accusation. \n     ``And if they don't have something important in it to them, \n     then it doesn't speak well of them.''\n\n  Does it speak well of us when we do something like the Senator from \nMississippi pointed out, that favors Libby, MT, and not the rest of the \ncountry, that helps the seniors in Medicare Advantage in Florida and \nnot in Arizona? Is that what we were sent here to do? That has never \nbeen my view of what our obligations to our citizens are, but also to \nthe citizens of this country.\n  I ask my colleagues to comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, here is what this has come to. In the next \n48 hours, this 2,400-some page bill is going to pass the Senate. But \nhow did we get there? Was it done the way things are usually done in \nthis body? Not at all. One party has been able to gather 60 votes for \nthis. Not one person from the other party is going to vote for it. How \ndid they get those 60 votes? Did they get it by arguing this out? They \ndid not do that. They have bluntly, boldly, and on the front of \nvirtually every newspaper in this country bought the votes to pass this \nbill, to get to the 60. They bought the last handful of votes, and they \ndid not even buy it with their money, they bought it with the American \npeople's money. Now, that is wrong.\n\n  The explanation I heard from the majority leader the other day is: \nWell, that is the way this is done. That may be the way this is done in \nbanana republics, that may be the way this is done in Third World \ncountries, but this is America. The American people are outraged over \nthis. The other party ought to be outraged.\n  I heard one Member quoted as saying: Well, I was too stupid to get \nany money for my State in there. I heard the majority leader say: You \nare not doing your job if you don't have something in there for you. \nWhere is the outrage from the other side, not only about the process \nbut how they are getting snookered by some other members of their \nparty? Where is the outrage?\n  I watched the debate on the other side and have seen Members come \ndown and say: The American people want this. Are they living in a cave? \nSure, there are a handful of American people who want this. Let me tell \nyou who does not. The U.S. Conference of Bishops does not want it. The \nNational Right to Life people do not want this. Not one Republican \nwants this. The Democrats do not want it.\n  Listen to what Howard Dean, the former leader of the Democratic \nParty, said:\n\n       At this point, the bill does more harm than good.\n\n  Ask any Democratic Governor in America. This bill transfers $25 \nbillion in costs in unfunded mandates to the Governors and to their \ntaxpayers. They have to come up with $25 billion. They don't want it.\n  I have stood here and listened to the other side say: This is \nwonderful for small business. Small business is going to come out so \nwell on this. Then why does the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness--small businesses--say:\n\n       The Senate bill fails small businesses.\n\n  The National Association of Wholesale Distributors. The Small \nBusiness Entrepreneurship Council says:\n\n       Small business group say Reid health bill more of the \n     same--more taxes, mandates, big spending, and nothing to help \n     lower insurance costs.\n\n  Associated Builders and Contractors is against it. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers is against it, the Independent Electrical \nContractors, the International Franchise Association. Even the labor \nunions have said: Don't tax our health care benefits. We agree with \nthem. We are on the side of the labor unions. We should not be taxing \nhealth care benefits.\n  But set all that stuff aside. These are all people who have an ax to \ngrind. The American people do not want this bill. These people who are \ncoming out here saying the American people want this bill, I don't know \nwhether they are not reading the newspapers, whether they are not \nreading their own e-mails at their office. The Quinnipiac poll that was \nout this morning, Tuesday through Sunday, says: 36 percent of the \nAmerican public support the health care spending bill; 53 percent \noppose. That is an 18-percent difference. Gallup says 61 percent of the \nAmerican people don't want this bill.\n  Stop coming out here saying the American people want this bill. The \nAmerican people do not want it. You want it, but the American people do \nnot want it. Leaders in your own party do not want it. The labor unions \ndo not want it. Nobody wants this thing, and most of all small business \ndoes not want this bill.\n  I have listened to anecdote after anecdote from the other side. There \nare some very touching stories, and everybody over here is empathetic \nwith them. But you don't legislate using anecdotes because you are only \nhearing one side of the story, you are not hearing all the facts \ndealing with the anecdotes, and to then pat this 2,400-page bill and \nsay this will solve that, that is not the way you legislate, and it is \ncertainly not the way you argue a point.\n  I heard the other side come out here and pat the bill and say: When \nwe pass this bill, 94 percent of American people will have insurance, \nwill be covered by health insurance. In court, they say you have to \ntell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and that is \nexactly why. You cannot pat this bill and say now 94 percent of the \nAmerican people are going to be covered.\n  Somebody listening to that will say: Gosh, what a wonderful bill. \nWhat is it going to cost? It costs $2.5 trillion to cover 94 percent of \nthe American people. But they don't say the bill only adds another 7 \npercent. The fact is, they don't tell you that 87 percent of Americans \nare already covered by some kind of health insurance. So don't say this \nis a grand and glorious victory because we are now going to cover 94 \npercent when 87 percent are already covered.\n  This is gimmickry at its worst, to tax for 4 years without giving any \nmajor benefits. Giving some minor benefits but holding off the major \nbenefits\n\n[[Page S13758]]\n\nuntil later is plain gimmickry. They say: Oh, look how wonderful this \nis. It is not going to add to the national deficits because we are \ngoing to collect taxes for 4 years, and only then are we going to start \nthe benefits.\n  What do we have here? When all is said and done and you strip it \naway, you have $2.5 trillion and 2,400 pages that most people do not \nunderstand, higher taxes, and higher insurance premiums.\n  I can give you one fact that is the best reason to vote against this \nbill; that is, it cuts $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare benefits. If you \nare a senior watching, $\\1/2\\ trillion of Medicare benefits is going to \ndisappear. I heard the President say and I heard my friends on the \nother side say: Look, if you like your program, if you like your \ninsurance plan, you are going to be able to keep it. Try to tell that \nto the people who are on Medicare Advantage. It is being stripped. It \nis being eliminated under this bill. Indeed, if you read the rules and \nregulations under this bill, the plan you have will not even exist when \nit is done.\n  You know, I have heard the other side say: Oh, you Republicans are \njust playing on fears of the American people. Let me tell you \nsomething. The American people are frightened. They are afraid. It \nisn't just this health care bill, they have sat here for the last year, \nand they have watched stimulus packages costing $1 trillion. They have \nwatched multibillion-dollar bailouts. They have seen buyouts. They have \nseen trillion-dollar deficits running up. They have seen the national \ndebt now running into the trillions. And, yes, they are afraid.\n  But it isn't us that is doing it to them, it is you that have done it \nto them. It is you that have committed the actions that have put the \nfear into the hearts of the American people. Don't do this. Stop this \nnonsense. You have the opportunity still to stop this. You can do it. \nThe American people don't want this. Stop the insanity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WICKER. I will say to my friend, I am afraid. I am afraid for my \ncountry. We are going to have a vote sometime between now and Christmas \nEve on raising the debt limit. It will just be a short-term thing. I \ndoubt if a single Republican will vote for that. Then we will have to \ncome back again in February and do the same thing.\n  The debt that is piling up on our country is something to be \nfrightened about. It is something we need to fight against and be \nresolute about. We are not shedding crocodile tears, but I am \nfrightened by this debt, and we should be, if we want our economy to \nstay strong. The fact we are adding $2.5 trillion in an entitlement \nprogram, which apparently the majority has the votes for, is simply \ngoing to add to this enormous debt.\n  So it is no wonder, when you add the Medicare cuts, the taxes that \nmost States are going to have to pay--unless they cut a special deal--\non top of the tremendous national debt that we are facing, the American \npeople are frightened. They have a right to be frightened and worried.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I don't know how many of my colleagues have seen the \neditorial in today's Investors Business Daily.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article to which I am going to refer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Louisiana Purchase and Omaha Stakes\n\n       Politics: Mary Landrieu's payoff was the new ``Louisiana \n     Purchase.'' Ben Nelson got Uncle Sam to pick up Nebraska's \n     future Medicaid tab. Maybe we should just put Senate votes up \n     on eBay.\n       Nelson, the 60th vote in the middle-of-the-night Senate \n     party line vote on health care reform, will go down in \n     American political history as the inventor of the permanent \n     earmark. His seemingly principled stand against including \n     federal funding for abortion evaporated like the morning dew \n     as he decided to take what was behind door No. 1.\n       The deal for Nelson includes special Medicaid funding for \n     Nebraska, along with Vermont and Massachusetts, which has a \n     special election to fill the seat of the late Sen. Ted \n     Kennedy coming up in January. Under the Senate bill every \n     state is equal, but some are more equal than others. The \n     other states and their taxpayers--that means you--will pick \n     up this tab.\n       This came just three days after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., \n     said on Neil Cavuto's Fox Business show that he was prepared \n     to vote against the bill after the recent decision to strip \n     the public option and the Medicare buy-in provision from the \n     legislation to get the vote of Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.\n       Nelson won a permanent exemption from the state share of \n     Medicaid expansion for Nebraska. Uncle Sam will take the hit \n     for 100% of the Medicaid expansion for Nebraska--forever. The \n     world's greatest deliberative body has now become the most \n     corrupt.\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) informed lawmakers \n     Sunday night that this section of the manager's amendment to \n     the Senate's health bill would cost $1.2 billion over 10 \n     years.\n       Nebraska actually receives the least of the three, some \n     $100 million over the first 10 years. Vermont will receive \n     $600 million over 10 years, while Massachusetts will get $500 \n     million.\n       Nelson, like most other senators, doesn't know what's \n     really in this bill or what it costs, except for the scoring \n     that involves comparing a decade of taxes with six or seven \n     years of ``benefits.''\n       This includes gutting Medicare by half a trillion dollars. \n     The abortion language he accepted may not survive conference \n     or the Stupak amendment supporters in the House. The Medicaid \n     bribe he accepted will.\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Boss Tweed of our \n     time, defended how this sausage was made. ``You'll find a \n     number of states that are treated differently than other \n     states. That's what legislating is all about. It's about \n     compromise,'' he said.\n       On the contrary, sir, it's about bribery--about what has \n     been dubbed the ``Cornhusker kickback,'' and about politics \n     done the ``Chicago Way.''\n       A $100 million item for construction of a university \n     hospital was inserted in the Senate health care bill at the \n     request of Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who faces a \n     difficult re-election campaign.\n       Presumably there's a wing where taxpayers can go to get \n     their wallets removed.\n       The Democrats insist that their Medicare cuts will not lead \n     to rationing. So why did, as HotAir.com reports, Sen. Bill \n     Nelson, D-Fla., insist on language that exempted three \n     heavily Democratic counties in his home state from the cuts? \n     If those massive cuts to the program won't hurt people on \n     Medicare Advantage, why did Nelson fight to get exemptions \n     for Palm Beach, Dade and Broward counties?\n       After all this wheeling and dealing, we will still have a \n     cost-raising tax-increasing, Frankenstein monster of a bill \n     hurriedly stitched together behind closed doors that will \n     lead to doctor shortages and rationed care.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The article is headlined: ``Louisiana Purchase and \nOmaha Stakes.'' The editorial says:\n\n       Politics: Mary Landrieu was the new ``Louisiana Purchase.'' \n     Ben Nelson got the federal government to pick up his state's \n     future Medicaid tab.\n\n  And the article continues:\n\n       Maybe we should just put Senate votes up on eBay. . . . \n     Nelson won a permanent exemption from the state share of \n     Medicaid expansion for Nebraska--forever. The world's \n     greatest deliberative body has now become the most corrupt.\n\n  So Uncle Sam is taking the hit for 100 percent of the Medicaid \nexpansion for Nebraska forever. That is what this says. It goes on to \nsay this is not what legislating is about; that this is not compromise, \nrather, it is about bribery.\n  Mr. President, this is horrible for us as a nation to have these \nthings written about this institution, when we should be way above any \nof these sorts of claims.\n  I look at that map that my colleague from Mississippi has up, with \njust Nebraska on there as the special deal, and I do not believe that \nis the way legislation should be written. We should be looking at ways \nto improve health care for all Americans, improve the quality, make it \nmore affordable, make it more available to people, and give them the \naccess they need.\n  I brought four amendments the other day, after Senator Reid brought \nhis massive amendment to the floor, and each was rejected. They were \nthings that would actually improve this bill and make it better for \nAmericans.\n  So I stand here, looking at this, and reading headline after headline \nand editorial after editorial about just how very bad is the way this \nbill is being pushed forward. We certainly wouldn't want any young \nchild to know how this is happening in their country, as we try to get \nthem involved in this process and learn and study and feel that maybe \nthey should become involved in this. This isn't what legislating in \nAmerica is all about. We are better than this.\n  If you have to do these sorts of things to get a 60th vote, then the \nbill isn't good enough to pass. If the ideas aren't good enough to get \nthe votes, then it shouldn't pass. In this country, we look for \nbipartisan solutions to the big issues of the day. That is what we did\n\n[[Page S13759]]\n\nin the Wyoming Legislature. Major issues passed with overwhelming \nnumbers. That is what has happened in this country throughout the \ncourse of history. The big bills have come forth with large numbers of \nsupporters, and that is how you get the country to follow you, not by \ntrying to force through a vote, buying a vote here and buying a vote \nthere to just squeak by with the minimum amount of support. That is not \nthe way to change policy that is going to affect everyone in the United \nStates personally and affect one-sixth of our economy. That is not the \nway to do it.\n  It has not been the way, it shouldn't be the way, and it should never \nbe the way again. I am looking for some Democrat to stand up and say: \nThis isn't the way, and I am going to not vote for this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. A Senator from Colorado came to the floor and proudly \nstated that he had not asked for anything or gotten anything, and I \nwill ask the Senator from Nebraska a question because his State seems \nto be at the center of a lot of attention. But, first of all, there is \na little booklet that is put out by the Government Printing Office that \ntalks about how our laws are made. We give it to our constituents and \nsend it to schools all over America. I have never seen anything in that \nlittle booklet--it is a very interesting booklet--that says you get \nbehind closed doors and you cut deals.\n  I know we are all a little cynical about politics and campaign \npromises, but the negotiating behind closed doors is especially so, \nparticularly after your President says during the campaign, time after \ntime: I am going to have all the negotiations around a big table. We \nwill have doctors and nurses, hospital administrators, insurance \ncompanies, drug companies, they will get a seat at the table. They just \nwould not be able to buy every chair. But what we will do, we will have \nnegotiations televised on C-SPAN so that people can see who is making \narguments on behalf of their constituents and who is making arguments \non behalf of the drug companies.\n  Of all people he recognized, the drug companies--who got the best \ndeal of all? PhRMA. Who has spent the most money lobbying? Who has \nspent the most money on advertising? PhRMA. Who is going to cost the \nAmerican consumer $100 billion, that could have been saved by the \nconsumer if we had been able to reimport prescription drugs?\n  But I would ask my friend from Nebraska because along with the \n``Louisiana purchase'' and probably the Florida deal this Nebraska deal \nhas probably gotten the most publicity and visibility. Maybe because it \nwas the 60th vote. I don't know if it is the biggest or not, in terms \nof money, because we will be finding deals in this 2,700-page bill for \nmonths. For months, we will be finding provisions, even though our \nstaffs have carefully read it. It is not 2,700 pages for nothing.\n  So I would ask the Senator from Nebraska: How does this go over in \nthe heartland of America? How do the people in Nebraska, who see that \nthey have gotten some kind of special deal, a special provision--\ncertainly reported as so in the media--that would come at the expense \nof other taxpayers in America? I am curious about the reaction the \nSenator from Nebraska gets.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. It doesn't go over. It just simply doesn't. In every way \npossible, over the last 4 or 5 days, I have been asked: Do you support \nthis special deal for Nebraska? I don't. I think it is wrong.\n  I could read through all the special deals because we have all got \nthe list--it is Florida, Louisiana, and Montana, and on and on and on. \nBut I came to the floor this morning and I asked unanimous consent that \nall the special deals be taken out, and I listed a long list of them. \nOf course, there was an objection to that request for unanimous \nconsent. Why? Why would we want to try to pass legislation with all of \nthis? It makes no sense to me.\n  But let me take a step back. We all remember a few months ago there \nwas a big story that Nevada was going to get a special Medicaid deal. \nIt was right about that time that we took a few days off. I went back \nhome, and I did townhall meetings, as I have done for years and years \nand years. But we really invested time and effort, and we identified \nsix principles of health care which are on my Web site for people to \nlook at. I literally had a PowerPoint presentation. I did four townhall \nmeetings--Carnie, Grand Island, Lexington, and Lincoln. I put up these \nprinciples.\n  One of the principles was no carve-out. No backroom deals. No special \ndeals. I presented that to the people who were at those townhall \nmeetings. I did tons of interviews. I explained why I felt the way I \ndid. People were so irate at the possibility that Nevada was going to \nget this special deal.\n  Since then, I think that has fallen by the wayside, but all these \nother things have come along. That is why I read the Lincoln Journal \nStar editorial. This is an editorial page that sometimes likes what I \nam doing and sometimes it does not. Over the years, they have not \nhesitated to take me to task. They looked at this and they said:\n\n       Since when has Nebraska become synonymous for cynical \n     ``what's in it for me''-type politics?\n\n  They said it is time to hit the reset button. We are not getting this \nright at all. We simply aren't getting it right. They talked about the \nissues of cost containment, they talked about the Actuary's report, \nwhich I had spent a little time talking to them about, and other folks \naround the State. After looking at all of that, they just said: Look, \nthis isn't going the way it needs to go for the American people.\n  Here is what I would say to all of my colleagues in the Senate. I \nlove my State. I love the people there. They are such honest, decent \npeople. In many parts of our State, people believe you seal a contract \nnot by putting things in writing but by shaking hands and giving your \nword. They don't want this kind of attention. They don't want to be on \nthe evening news every night with the talking heads talking about the \n``cornhusker kickback'' or whatever the latest terminology is. They \njust want to be treated fairly.\n  They asked me to come here and represent them as fervently as I can, \nto try to do all I can to get fair treatment for them. But not a single \nperson at any townhall I have ever had stood up and said: Mike, I \ndisagree with that principle. I want you to go back there and give me a \nspecial deal or get our State a special deal.\n  So I appreciate Senator McCain asking me the question. I feel very \nstrongly about this. I wish the other side would consider my request \nfor a unanimous consent agreement that just says: Time out, everybody. \nLet's pull out the special deals, whether it is Nebraska or Montana or \nwhatever. It doesn't matter to me. Let's pull those out and let's take \na step back and let's work for what Senator Risch talks about and the \nrest of us have talked about. We can get 80 votes on a health care \nreform bill. I guarantee you. But not on this bill.\n  Mr. WICKER. I would echo what the Senator from Nebraska has just \nsaid. I know my friend from Arizona has been one of the most outspoken \ncritics of special deals and special earmarks. This is not some \ncatchall appropriations bill to get us through the end of the year. \nThis is one of the most major pieces of legislation on which any Member \nof this Senate currently serving will ever vote. This is one-sixth of \nthe American economy, and the American people are learning about these \nspecial carve-outs where the citizens of one State will be treated \ndifferently not because of a formula, not because of the poverty level, \nbut because of political power.\n  It would just seem to me that one Member of the majority party, in \nthese next 2 days, might step forward and say: You are right, and I \nwill not be a party to this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me make one additional comment. I have seen reform go \nthrough the Congress of the United States. The first one I saw was when \nwe saved Social Security--a major reform of Social Security. There was \nno backroom dealing. It was a straightforward proposal as to how to fix \nSocial Security. We fixed welfare, it was welfare reform--again, open, \nhonest, bipartisan negotiations and bipartisan agreement. Welfare \nreform, Social Security reform, the efforts we made at tobacco reform, \nat campaign finance reform, at immigration reform and many others--the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Every reform I have ever been involved in has \nhad two major and sole components: No. 1, it is bipartisan; No. 2, \nthere were no special favors or deals cut, provisions in thousands of \npages of legislation.\n\n[[Page S13760]]\n\n  Again, we know where the train is headed. We know what is going to \nhappen a short time from now, but they will make history. You will make \nhistory. You will have rammed through ``reform'' on a strictly partisan \nbasis, without the participation of the other party, over the \nobjections of a majority of the American people, done in closed \nnegotiations, with results that are announced to the American people \nwithout debate or discussion and to this side without debate or \ndiscussion.\n  The American people do not like it. They do not like for us to do \nbusiness that way. I am sure this peaceful revolution that is going on \nout there already--because as the Senator from Idaho pointed out, \nbecause of the involvement of the car companies, the stimulus, the \nbonus, the generational theft we are committing, this, all on top of \nthat, is going to give great fuel to the fire that is already burning \nout there, where they want real change, real change which they were \npromised in the last Presidential campaign and certainly did not get.\n  Mr. RISCH. I say to Senator McCain, probably one of the great ironies \nof all this is going to be at 8 o'clock on December 24--when this bill \npasses with the 60 votes, all Democrats--immediately following that \nvote is going to be a vote, again all 60 Democrats and only Democrats, \nraising the national debt. What an irony, to put $2.5 trillion in \nspending of a new social entitlement program, adding it to the three \nalready huge entitlement programs that are in the process of \nbankrupting America, adding this to it and then turning right around \nand increasing the debt ceiling. When they increase it, it is going to \nbe--nobody knows exactly how much it is going to be, hundreds of \nbillions. But that is only in the last 2 months. They are going to have \nto come back again in February and increase the national debt ceiling \nagain. What irony.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Of course, this legislation turns everything we know \nabout budgeting on its head, although it has been done before and it \nhas been done by Republicans, to our shame. Today, if you go out and \nbuy an automobile, you can drive it for a year before you have to pay \nfor it. Under this bill, it is the opposite. You pay the taxes, you \nhave the reductions in benefits, and then 4 years later you start \nhaving whatever benefits would accrue from this legislation. So for 4 \nyears small businesspeople, people all over America, will see their \nhealth care costs increased before there is a single, tangible result \nfrom it--remarkable.\n  Mr. WICKER. The Senator mentioned the Florida carve-out. Perhaps I \nshould have it on my map. The reason I did not is it involves Medicare \nAdvantage and not Medicaid. The map was about Medicaid, but he makes a \ngood point about the Florida carve-out.\n  I had a discussion with some of the leadership on the Democratic side \non the floor of the Senate the other day about Medicare Advantage. The \nstrong assertion over on that side is, Medicare Advantage is not \nMedicare. As a matter of fact, some of the leadership in this very body \nsaid the booklet the Government puts out that says Medicare Advantage \nis part of Medicare should be changed. Those words should be stricken \nfrom the handout because it is not part of Medicare. The Web site the \nFederal Government has saying Medicare Advantage is part of Medicare, \nthat should be changed because it is just an insurance company \nmasquerading as Medicare.\n  Let me just take a second. This is Betty. Betty represents--she is \nfrom Louisiana. I don't know if she was one of the 60 percent of \nLouisianans who voted for Senator McCain in Louisiana, but she enjoys \nMedicare Advantage. She was told during the election that if you like \nyour coverage, under any plan that the Obama administration would \napprove, you get to keep that coverage. She gets hearing aids, vision \ncoverage, dental care, and she likes her Medicare Advantage.\n  If Betty is 1 of the 150,000 seniors in the State of Louisiana who \nenjoy this benefit, she is at risk of losing it. But if she happens to \nbe in the State of Florida, in any of these counties with the $100 \nmillion carve-out, she is fortunate enough to be able to keep her \nMedicare Advantage.\n  In other words, it may not be guaranteed, but she sure likes it. \nObviously, one of the Senators from Florida believes his constituents \nlike it--again, a carve-out so this nonguaranteed, non-Medicare benefit \nthat is not very good, they can keep it in Florida. That is in the bill \nand no one can deny that special treatment is given to that one State \nunder Medicare Advantage. Again, I challenge any American to come onto \nthe floor of this Senate and tell me how that is fair.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is not. There have been a number of references to \nour friend and colleague, the late Senator Ted Kennedy. Let's take a \nlook at the book his brother, John Kennedy, wrote, ``Profiles in \nCourage.'' As we have seen all this, it is time for one courageous \nDemocrat to stand and say: This is about our country. This is about our \ncountry, not about a kickback. This is about health care, not about a \nhand in the cookie jar.\n  That is what we need. We need one courageous Democrat to stand and \nsay: I don't want to be part of this editorial that talks about the \nLouisiana Purchase and Omaha Stakes. I don't want to be a part of this \nthat says this, the world's greatest deliberative body, has now become \ncorrupt. I don't want to be a part of this that says this is about \nbribery.\n  It needs one courageous Democrat, 1 out of 60, to stand and say: I am \ngoing to vote no; we need to back up; we need to think about this. We \nhave 100 Members of the Senate who want to reform health care in this \ncountry, who want to get the costs under control, who want to improve \nquality, who want to improve access--100 Senators want to do that. That \nis the goal of each and every one of us here.\n  We need one courageous Senator to say it is time, time now, to take a \nstep back, let us go home over Christmas, let us think about this, let \nus talk to our constituents at home, let us hear what they have to say \nabout this looking out for No. 1--$100 million. Dana Milbank's column \nin the Washington Post today, that is what we need now in the Senate. \nWe need the kind of courage John Kennedy wrote about in ``Profiles in \nCourage.''\n  Mr. RISCH. I say to Senator Barrasso, you know there are already some \ncourageous Democrats stepping up. I hope every Democrat on the other \nside calls their Governor and says: Governor, what do you think about \nthis? Help me out here. I am in caucus, they bought enough votes to get \nto the 60. But I have to tell you I don't like the way they did it, No. \n1; and, No. 2, what about the rest of us? We didn't get the $300 \nmillion. We didn't get the X number of million. Help me out, Governor. \nThey say they are going to shift $25 billion to the States that you are \ngoing to have to come up with. What do you think? Do you think I ought \nto vote for this--or maybe if one of us steps forward and says I am \ngoing to vote no and I want to set the reset button and I want to put \npeople back to the table and say let's do this right, we can do this \nright.\n  We are Americans. We know how to do this. We are the most innovative \npeople in the world. All we have to do is get together and do it. But \nto jam this down the throats of the American people--and make no doubt \nabout it, this is being jammed down the throats of the American people \non the eve of Christmas, in the middle of the night, in the face of \npoll after poll that says don't do this to us.\n  That is what is happening. There are courageous Democrats out there. \nNot one of them is sitting here.\n  Mr. WICKER. Let me tell my friend from Idaho about some courageous \nDemocrats. When the House version of this was being considered at the \nother end of this building, a number of Democrats stepped forward and \nsaid: I can't vote for this. It was very close. They have a huge \nmajority, 40 votes over there. As a matter of fact, one Member of the \nHouse today basically said: I can't take any more. He switched parties. \nA Member from Alabama is now joining the Republican conference. But \nthere are a number of loyal Democrats who have no intention of \nswitching parties and they have stepped forward and said: I can't vote \nfor it. Don't count me in on this.\n  Bart Stupak is a Representative, a courageous pro-life Representative \nfrom Michigan. He did vote for the bill. I do not impugn his motives. \nHe did what he thought was right. But before he voted for it, he made \nsure legislation was included in the House version to make sure the \nHyde language, which\n\n[[Page S13761]]\n\nhas been the law of the land for almost two decades, was included.\n  Here is what Representative Stupak said yesterday or the day before \nyesterday about this so-called pro-life compromise that was included in \nthe version we will have to vote on in the Senate. He said it is ``not \nacceptable . . . a dramatic shift in Federal policy that would allow \nthe Federal Government to subsidize insurance policies with abortion \ncoverage.''\n  That is a release actually on December 19.\n  I appreciate the courage of someone from a Democratic State, from a \ndistrict that has long been Democratic, who is a member--chairman of a \ncommittee and a member of the leadership over there--stepping forward \nand saying: I can't go this far. Unless this language is changed--and \nwe are told by Members of the Senate there better not be much of a \nconference. What we vote on, on Christmas Eve, it better sort of stay \nlike it is or it will not be passed by the Senate when it comes out of \nconference.\n  Bart Stupak is stepping forward and saying, if that is the case, then \nI am switching from a yes to a no. I appreciate that kind of courageous \nDemocrat.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I say, I appreciate the Senator from Mississippi \nbringing this important aspect to this issue and continuing to do so.\n  I would like to pick up on what Dr. Barrasso mentioned about the \nKennedy family. It is well known I had a very close relationship, \ndeveloped over the years, with Senator Ted Kennedy and that we worked \ntogether on a variety of issues. So there is a great irony in the \nconstant, over there on the other side of the aisle, references to \nSenator Kennedy, who always began legislation by getting bipartisan, by \ngetting Members of the other side of the aisle committed and working \ntogether--whether it be on immigration reform, whether it be on health \ncare reform, whether it be on one of the great achievements of \nPresident Bush 2, No Child Left Behind.\n  In other words, every dealing I ever had with Senator Kennedy was to \nreach out, establish a fundamental base for agreement, and then move \nforward with legislation in a bipartisan fashion, which I think was one \nof the major reasons why he had such an impressive legislative record.\n  How did the other side do it? Without a bit of serious negotiation, \nwithout bringing anyone on board before moving forward--no one--which \nends up, now, with a 60-to-40 vote, which is a pure partisan vote and \noutcome when there has never been, in history, a single reform that was \nnot bipartisan. That is why the American people are rejecting this. \nThat is why the American people are seeing through it. To hear the \nconstant refrain that the American people want this: Read any poll. It \nis just a matter of difference because the American people have figured \nthis out. It is going to be one of the great historic mistakes--not \nhistoric--but historic mistakes made by the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may say to my friend from Arizona, he is \nabsolutely right. I have had an opportunity to observe Senator Kennedy \nover the years. That is exactly the way he operated.\n  If I may, just to make a point with regard to the observation of the \nSenator from Mississippi about Congressman Stupak, as I understand it, \nCongressman Stupak was not asking for some special deal for Michigan in \nreturn for his vote. He was, rather, trying to establish a principle \nthat would apply to all Americans. Is that not the case?\n  Mr. WICKER. That is exactly correct. I commend my former House \ncolleague for taking that principled stand.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Could not be same thing be said for our colleague, \nSenator Lieberman from Connecticut? I am sorry he ended up voting for \nthis 2,700-page monstrosity, but you have to stay, as I understood his \nposition--and Senator McCain certainly knows him very well--his \nposition was, if the government goes into the insurance business, I \ncan't support this bill, not: I am open for business and what you can \nyou do for Connecticut.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There may be on the floor a unanimous consent request to \nremove the Nebraska Medicaid deal. I would hope, if there is any \nunanimous consent agreement at any time, that the whole bill will be \nfixed, which means every special provision would be removed, whether it \nbe from Nebraska or any other State. We still have the Louisiana \nPurchase of $300 million. We still have the Florida Medicare \ngrandfather clause, $25 to $30 billion. The list goes on and on. The \nConnecticut hospital--I guess it is the Connecticut hospital. It is \nalways in legislation, so you have to do research to see who qualifies. \nI would hope we could have, again, agreement that all these special \nprovisions that affect certain specific States would be removed as \nwell. That would go over rather well with the American people.\n  I want to say to my colleagues, thank you for your passion. I know a \nlot of people don't watch our proceedings on the floor. It has played a \nrole in educating the American people as to what we are facing. The \nmedia played a role, advocacy groups, grassroots organizations all over \nAmerica. But I have had the great privilege of engaging in these \ncolloquies with my colleagues. To me, it has been both helpful to my \nconstituents, and, frankly, it has also been helpful to me to work with \npeople who have been involved in these issues, former Governors and \nothers. We have made some kind of contribution, which I think is what \nwe are all sent here for.\n  Mr. WICKER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rockefeller). The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WICKER. Unless my colleagues want to join in, I thank them for \njoining us and certainly thank Senator McCain, one of the most \ndistinguished public servants, someone who sacrificed for his country \nand who has been on this floor hour after hour.\n  The bill we will be asked to vote for on Christmas Eve by the \nadministration's own Chief Actuary increases health care costs, \nthreatens access to care for seniors, forces people off their current \ncoverage, and actually increases the amount of the gross domestic \nproduct that will be spent on health care rather than decreasing it. \nThese are not statements I have made; these are assessments made by the \nChief Actuary for the Obama administration.\n  There is still time. Even if this bill passes, we will go home for \nChristmas, for the holidays. We will hear from our constituents. I hope \nwe listen to that over 60 percent of Americans who say: We advise you \nnot to vote for this legislation.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is time for a new chapter to be written in \n``Profiles in Courage.'' One of the Members of this body can be that \nprofile. All they have to do is stand up and say: No, I will not be \npart of what has been called corruption in the Senate. I will not be \npart of what has been called, in the editorials, bribery in the Senate. \nI will be that courageous person and vote no. It is time for a new \nchapter in ``Profiles in Courage.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair that the \nSenator from Mississippi had the floor.\n  Mr. WICKER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have several points to make. First, as a \nmatter of personal privilege, on behalf of the people of Libby, MT, the \nSenator from Arizona made it sound as if the folks in Libby were \ngetting some kind of a sweetheart deal. I wish the Senator would not \nleave so he can hear what is actually going on. I think the Senator \nfrom Arizona would agree with me that he would not want his \nconstituents to suffer an environmental calamity. He would not want his \nconstituents to not get some redress because of a declaration of public \nemergency due to contamination of asbestos. I assume the Senator from \nArizona would very much stand up for his constituents.\n  Let me explain. Congress passed a law in 1980 called CERCLA. That \nlegislation said that whenever there was a declaration of a public \nemergency because of contamination at a Superfund site, the government \nhas an opportunity to declare a public emergency and help those people \nget medical care because of contamination of asbestos; in this case \nespecially, something called tremolite, which causes even greater \ndamage than ordinary asbestos. I would assume the Senator from Arizona \nwould want his constituents to\n\n[[Page S13762]]\n\nget some help from contamination from asbestos.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I respond?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. All the Senator had to do was have it authorized, bring \nit up on the floor as an appropriation, and I am sure the Senator's \narguments would have been far more cogent than jamming it into a bill \nwhich has to do with health care reform, the policy of health care \nreform.\n  This legislation and this cause of the Senator from Montana has been \nturned back several times on other grounds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is health care. Reclaiming my right to the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am responding.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I reclaim my right to the floor because he doesn't want \nto deal in good faith with this issue.\n  My second point. It is disrespectful, it is unseemly for Senators in \nthis body to invoke the names of Ted Kennedy and Jack Kennedy in \nopposition to this bill. It is disrespectful and unseemly. I, frankly, \nam very much surprised that Senators would go to that level and invoke \nthe names of Ted Kennedy and Jack Kennedy in opposition to this \nlegislation. Talk about profiles in courage. I hear Senators on the \nother side say: Where is the courage of one Senator to stand up and \nvote against health care reform? That is what I keep hearing. Where is \nthe courage? Where is the courage of one Senator on the Democratic side \nto stand up and vote against health care reform?\n  Mr. President, I want to turn that around. ``Profiles in Courage''--\nJack Kennedy and Ted Kennedy were Senators who worked to try to find \nresolutions to agreements. They wanted to compromise. They wanted to \nwork together to get just results.\n  I ask, where is the Senator on that side of the aisle who has the \ncourage to break from their leadership, break from the partisanship \nthey are exercising on their side of the aisle to work together to pass \nhealth care reform? I ask, where is the courage? Where are the Senators \nwho have the courage on that side of the aisle to stand up and work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to get health care reform passed? Where?\n  We on this side reached out our hands for bipartisan agreement on \nhealth care reform, probably to a fault. I say ``to a fault'' because \nfor months and months this Senator, anyway, extended the hand to work \nwith other Senators on a bipartisan basis. I know the current occupant \nof the chair knows that. He watched this. He saw it happen in the \nFinance Committee.\n\n  Senator Grassley and I worked very hard to get Senators on both sides \nof the aisle to work to pass health care reform, very hard. Then after \na while we had to work toward another approach. The Group of 6--3 \nRepublicans, 3 Democrats--worked for months on a bipartisan basis to \nget health care reform passed. Do you know what happened? I watched it \nhappen. Those Senators in the room were acting in good faith. They were \nin good faith. They wanted to mutually work together to pass health \ncare reform. They asked good questions. Senator Enzi from Wyoming, for \nexample, asked very good questions. Senator Snowe asked very good \nquestions. Senator Grassley asked very good questions. We worked to get \nhealth care reform.\n  But do you know what happened? I could feel it happening. One by one \nby one, they started to drift away. They wanted to pass health care \nreform. They wanted to act in a bipartisan basis. But they were \npressured--pressured from their political party not to do it, not to do \nit, not to do it. Why were they pressured not to do it? Unfortunately, \nthey gave in to the pressure because their leadership wanted to make a \npolitical statement. One of the Senators on the floor here said: Let's \nmake health care Obama's Waterloo. They did not want to work with us, \nthat side of the aisle. They did not want to work with us because they \nthought it was better to make a political statement: Attack the bill, \nattack the bill, attack the bill, attack the bill in order to make \npolitical points for the 2010 election. That is what they were trying \nto do.\n  I ask, where is the courage? Where is the courage? Where is the \nRepublican Senator who will stand up and say: Boy, let's work together \nto pass health care reform. Where is the Senator who will stand up and \nsay: We want to work together to pass health care reform.\n  This Senator tried mightily to get bipartisan support. Ask Senator \nGrassley from Iowa, with whom I have been working for a long, long \ntime. They were pulled away. Senator Grassley--I don't want to speak \nfor him, but I know he wanted to get health care reform passed on a \nbipartisan basis. I know that is the case. Frankly, he got pressured, \npressured, and he just couldn't do it. I have the highest respect and \nregard for him, but he just couldn't do it.\n  Mr. WICKER. Will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WICKER. I think the Senator has really answered his own question. \nAs a matter of fact, Senator Grassley and Senator Enzi met for hours \nand hours, weeks upon weeks with my friend from Montana in good faith, \nhoping to come up with a program that could get that 80-vote support we \nusually get on matters of----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is how they started out, that is true.\n  Mr. WICKER. And then eventually, it dawned on them that my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle wanted to Europeanize the health care \nsystem of the United States of America.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reclaiming my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has the floor.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is not what happened. I was in the room constantly. \nI talked to those Senators many times. That is not what happened. I \nwill tell you what did happen. Your leadership pressured them, \npressured them, pressured them not to work together. There was no \nEuropean-style effort in that room. That is a totally untruthful \nstatement--a totally untruthful statement. None whatsoever. We are \npassing a bill here that is a uniquely American solution. It provides \ncompetition. It helps the doctor-patient relationship. That assertion \nof working toward a European solution is entirely untrue. It is \nentirely false.\n  The fact is, those Senators did not want to work with us. It is \nregrettable. It is highly regrettable. One of the biggest travesties \nhere is there was not a good-faith effort on that side of the aisle to \ncome up with a constructive, comprehensive alternative to the \nDemocratic version of health care reform. If there had been a \nconstructive, honest, alternative health care reform, we could have had \na really good debate. What is the better approach to solving the health \ncare problem? That did not ever happen. It did not ever happen at all. \nRather, they didn't have anything. They didn't have a health care bill. \nNone whatsoever.\n  The only one that came up a little bit was over in the House. Because \nof all the criticism about Republicans not having an alternative, \nfinally the Republicans in the House came up with an alternative. It \nwas very small. There wasn't much to it. To be honest, the CBO said it \nwould hardly increase any coverage whatsoever. It was not really a \ncomprehensive health care reform bill. And there has been none in the \nU.S. Senate on the Republican side, no alternative for a comprehensive \nhealth care reform bill.\n  I want the public to know we worked very hard to get a bipartisan \nbill. That side of the aisle started without working with us, but \ngradually they began to believe that politically they would have a \nbetter chance in the 2010 elections by just not working with us but \njust attack, attack, attack, attack, trying to score political points \nto defeat any honest effort to get health care reform.\n  I now yield such time as he would like to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Well, this has been quite an enlightening experience on the floor \nthis past 30 or 40 minutes. It shows how emotionally charged this body \nhas become over this issue and perhaps other issues as well. But the \nchallenge is, we are all entitled to our own opinions. We are just not \nentitled to our own set of facts.\n  I would like to take a moment to explain the so-called Medicaid fix \nfor the State of Nebraska. Now, it has been described as the ``Omaha \nStakes fix.'' I take issue--and I only wish my colleague from Nebraska \nhad stayed on\n\n[[Page S13763]]\n\nthe floor to hear this. I take issue with one of the premier businesses \nin the State of Nebraska used in a manner of derision to outline \nsomething that is factually incorrect on the basis of how they are \npresenting it.\n  You can twist and you can turn and you can try to distort what \nhappens, but it does not change the underlying facts. The underlying \nfacts are, this was pursued initially as an opt-in or opt-out for all \nStates. It was impossible to do that at the present time, and so as a \nmatter of fix, there was, in fact, the extension of the Federal dollars \nfrom the year 2017 on, well into the future, as a marker to lay down so \nthat every State could object to this manner of unfunded mandates.\n  As a Governor--and my colleague is a former Governor--we fought \nagainst Federal unfunded mandates. As a Senator back here, I have also \nfought against unfunded and underfunded Federal mandates. This was, in \nfact, exactly that. While we were not able to get in this legislation \nan actual opt-out or opt-in for a State-based decision, what we did get \nis at least a line, if you will, so that in the future other States are \ngoing to be able to come forward and say: Hey, either the Federal \nGovernment pays for that into the future or the State will have the \nopportunity to decide not to continue that so that we do not have an \nunfunded Federal mandate.\n  So I am surprised. I am shocked. Well, actually, I am not shocked. I \nam disappointed this would be used and misused in this fashion, not \nonly derisively against a great company in Nebraska--the Nebraska \nSteaks--I am also surprised my colleague would participate in a \ncolloquy that would use the name of that company in such a manner.\n  I am surprised this colloquy went on without understanding the facts \nof what this so-called carve-out--which is not a carve-out--truly \nconsisted of. There is no carve-out. Each State between now and 2017--\ntwo-thirds-plus of a decade--will have an opportunity to come back in \nand get this bill changed.\n  Governors asked for relief. As Governors, we asked for relief against \nthese continuing unfunded mandates. Time and time again, we fought \nagainst them. This was one more opportunity to fight. As a matter of \nfact, the Governor of Nebraska spotted this and wrote me a letter on \nDecember 16 and said, among other things:\n\n       The State of Nebraska cannot afford an unfunded mandate and \n     uncontrolled spending of this magnitude.\n\n  He goes on to say a number of other things about the bill. But he \nmakes the point that this is an unfunded Federal mandate and wanted me \nto do something about it.\n  So I sent him back a letter on the same date, saying:\n\n       Thank you. . . .\n       Please be advised that I have proposed that the Senate bill \n     be modified to include an ``opt-in'' mechanism to allow \n     states to avoid the issues you have raised. Under my \n     proposal, if Nebraska prefers not to opt in to a reformed \n     health care system, it would have that right.\n\n  My colleague and others know this is the case. They know this is the \ncase, but they choose to ignore it. They choose to ignore the facts.\n  On December 20, I again wrote to the Governor and shared with him my \nconcern about this unfunded mandate, and I pointed out that:\n\n       Within hours after the amendment was filed, [my colleague \n     from Nebraska] objected to the inclusion of these funds. As a \n     result, I am prepared to ask that this provision be removed \n     from the amendment in conference if it is [the Governor's] \n     desire.\n\n  I got a letter back on the day after, on December 21, talking about \nthis as a special deal. It is not a special deal for Nebraska. It is, \nin fact, an opportunity to get rid of an unfunded Federal mandate for \nall the States. Let me repeat that: for all the States. There is \nnothing special about it, and it is fair.\n  What we have done is we have drawn a line in the sand and said: This \nis unacceptable, and it is unacceptable for all States as well. I \ncannot believe that this sort of a situation would continue. There is \nno misunderstanding here. I think it is just an opportunity to mislead, \ndistort, and, unfortunately, confuse the American public all the more, \nand to use the State of Nebraska and the name of a good company for \npartisan political purposes on the other side of the aisle.\n  My colleagues know I am not a deeply partisan person and that I \nrarely come to the floor to speak, and that when I come to the floor, \nit is for something like this, to take exception with the misuse of \ninformation for partisan purposes. That is exactly what has been done \nwith this situation.\n  I am prepared to fight for the State of Nebraska, and I hope my \ncolleague is as well. Obviously, the Governor was prepared to fight for \nthe State of Nebraska by bringing it to my attention. But I am not \nprepared to fight to get a special deal for the State of Nebraska. I \ndid not, and I refuse to accept that kind of responsibility or that \nkind of a suggestion from anyone on that side of the aisle or anyone \nelse.\n  Then, as it relates to abortion, I think my colleagues know that we \nintroduced legislation that is comparable to the Stupak legislation in \nthe House dealing with barring the use of Federal funds for elective \nabortions. We introduced it over here, and it was bipartisan. It was \nNelson-Hatch-Casey, and it did not pass. So I began the process of \ntrying to find other solutions that I thought equally walled off the \nuse of Federal funds and made it clear that no Federal funds would be \nused.\n  Now, apparently I did not say ``mother may I'' in the process of \nwriting that language because others took issue with it, even though \nthey cannot constructively point out how it does not prohibit the use \nof Federal funds or wall off those funds or keep them totally \nsegregated. They just did not like the language.\n  Well, if in the conference the Stupak-Nelson-Hatch-Casey language \npasses, I will be happy, and so will Congressman Stupak, and so would, \nI would imagine, those who signed on to that legislation. It is \nunfortunate, though, to continue to distort and misrepresent what \nhappens in the body of the Senate. It is difficult enough to have \ncomity. It is difficult enough to have cooperation. It is difficult \nenough to have collegiality. When politics are put above policy and \nproductivity, this is what we get.\n  Mr. President, I am very disappointed, somewhat disillusioned, by the \nuse of this method and this approach that would undermine the good name \nof a company in Nebraska, as well as the name of the State of Nebraska, \nby associating it with something that has not been done, was not \nintended, and did not result.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, let me just express my thanks for those 17 \nminutes.\n  I would ask the Chair to please advise me when I have used 15 of \nthose minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, listening to the debate today reminds me \nof, among others, a famous quotation from Winston Churchill, who, I \nbelieve, said: ``The worst system devised by wit of man''--he was \ntalking about democracy. He said it was the worst form of government \ndevised by wit of man, and then he added ``except for all the rest.''\n  We like to sort of lecture the Iraqis and Afghanis on how to run a \ndemocracy, and we still struggle with it after more than 200 years. In \nthe 8 or 9 years I have been here, I have never seen us struggle as \nmuch as we have on the issue of health care. Part of the reason is \nbecause it is just enormously complex, and it is just confusing.\n  As to the people who are following the debate, if you listen to folks \non the political left, mostly in our party, what you hear is: No public \noption, no Medicare buy-in, we are not doing enough to make health care \naffordable. What you hear from the right, mostly on the other side of \nthe aisle, is, this is government run, this is government funded, this \nis a government takeover.\n  So you have the two extremes out here trying to take shots at one \nanother. Those of us in the middle are sort of collateral damage or \nroad kill. But at the end of the day, a lot of times when you find \nneither the left nor the right are entirely pleased with the outcome, \nsometimes that suggests that the outcome is not all that bad.\n\n[[Page S13764]]\n\n  I am not saying this is a perfect balance, but it is not a bad \nbalance. For those, especially in our party, who feel as though we \nshould have done more, I am sure in 1965, when Lyndon Johnson signed \ninto law the Medicare legislation, there were probably some who did not \nvote for it--and I am told it was mostly Democrats who voted for it, \nnot so much our Republican friends--but I am not sure how many \nDemocrats who voted for Medicare at the time said: It does not do \nenough for our senior citizens. It does not provide for hospice care. \nIt does not provide for home health care. It does not provide for \ndisability benefits for those who are under the age of 65. There is no \nprescription drug program. There is nothing for outpatient surgery. \nNone of those things were in the original Medicare legislation. Over \ntime, they have been added, and I think the Medicare legislation, the \nMedicare law, has been improved to make it a better program.\n  Now we face a day when the Medicare Program is literally running out \nof money. One of the less-told secrets in the legislation that is \nbefore us is that the life of the Medicare trust fund--life that has \nbeen down to about 7 or 8 years--I understand, thanks to the reforms \nthat are in this legislation, should be pretty much doubled. That is \nnot good enough, but we are going to stretch by about 100 percent the \nuseful remaining life of the Medicare Program.\n  Another fact that is sort of lost in all the debate, all the tumult, \nis what this does with respect to our budget deficits. I am told by--\nnot us, not Democrats or Republicans--the neutral Congressional Budget \nOffice, which is neither Democratic nor Republican--nonpartisan--that \nthe legislation, if we adopt it in its current form, will reduce the \ndeficit over the next 10 years by about $130 billion, and by as much as \nmaybe $1 trillion, $1.3 trillion in the second 10 years beyond that.\n  In terms of what is going to happen as to the cost of premiums, we \nare told, again, by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that \nrather than spiking premiums, we are actually going to see people get \nsomewhat better coverage for, frankly, not more money in terms of their \npremiums.\n  In terms of those of us who just love the health insurance we have--\nwe are delighted with the coverage and the amount we pay for it--I \nwould just remind all of us of a couple things: One, we have spent more \nmoney by far than any nation on Earth for health care--about 1\\1/2\\ \ntimes more than the next closest country. We do not get better results. \nIn many cases, we get worse results.\n  We have about 14,000 people who woke up with health care coverage who \nwill wake up tomorrow morning and they will not have it; they will have \nlost it. Over 40 million people in our country have no health care \ncoverage at all.\n  Finally, we have big companies such as GM and Chrysler that have gone \nbankrupt because they cannot compete with foreign competitors because \nof the price of our health care; and that is true with a lot of smaller \ncompanies as well.\n  The idea of doing nothing is, to my mind, not a very smart thing to \ndo. We have to do a number of things to accomplish three goals: No. 1, \nrein in the growth of health care costs. This idea of two, three times \nthe rate of inflation in the growth of health care costs is not \nsustainable. Frankly, if we do not rein in the growth of health care \ncosts, neither will be sustainable the coverage we extend to people who \ndo not have it today.\n  The third thing we try to work on in this legislation, to the extent \nwe can--a lot of interesting things are going on in the private sector, \nvery interesting things going on in the private sector, regarding how \nto instill personal responsibility in employees, and how to get better \ntransparency and better costs through the health care delivery system. \nThat is going to be a part of this as well. But we have to figure out a \nway to get better outcomes, and there are a lot of good examples for \ndoing that.\n  I want to take the remaining time I have today to just mention some \nthings that are in the legislation that I think make sense because they \nare based and founded on what works. And as an old Governor--and \nSenator Nelson has already spoken from Nebraska--we are used to \nfocusing on what works and trying to replicate what works, steal ideas \nfrom other States and try to work them in our own State. I want to \nmention a couple things we have taken that work. We are trying to grow \nthem and, in some cases, on a national level.\n  One of things Senator Baucus and his staff in the Finance Committee \nfocused on, I think, is maybe the best idea in the health care \nlegislation, something called an exchange.\n  When I was a naval flight officer, we used to go to the exchange on \nthe base which was a place to buy stuff. It was like a little \ndepartment store. The exchange in health care delivery, which will open \nin January 2014--I hope we can actually stand up the exchanges and open \nthe exchanges sooner--but that is going to be a place for people to go \nand buy health care coverage. When people do that, they will become \npart of a purchasing pool in their State or maybe in a couple of States \nto sort of band together and form a regional purchasing pool.\n\n  Why is a purchasing pool important? Well, because we are part of one, \nand we know that with 8 million people in our purchasing pool--Federal \nemployees, Federal retirees, all of our dependents--we get a lot of \ncompetition. A lot of private sector companies want to offer us \nproducts to choose from. We don't get cheap insurance, but we get \npretty good prices. With 8 million people in a purchasing pool, we \nreally drive down administrative costs to about 3 percent for every \npremium dollar. That is a lot lower than folks who try to go out and \nbuy it on their own in the open market. They may pay 33 percent of \ntheir premium dollar for their administrative costs. They are not \npaying 3 percent. We are going to try to replicate that. We do it in \nthe exchange.\n  There may be 50 exchanges throughout the country, some regional \nexchanges as well. So we do exchanges as well. When States create \ninterstate compacts across State lines, such as Delaware with New \nJersey or maybe Delaware and Maryland or Delaware and Pennsylvania, \nmaybe all four of us, insurance sold in any of those four States can be \nsold across State lines and introduce new competition, additional \ncompetition for business and for the folks looking for coverage for \nthose two or three or four States.\n  Another thing that works is the delivery system, delivery of health \ncare in outfits such as the Cleveland Clinic and the Mayo Clinic, \nGeisinger in Pennsylvania, not far from where we are in Delaware, \nIntermountain Health out in Utah, and Kaiser Permanente in California.\n  I actually went with Rachuel Russell, a member of my staff, to the \nCleveland Clinic about 3 months ago. What we found was the Cleveland \nClinic and the Mayo Clinic and Geisinger and all these others pretty \nmuch all have the same template. They focus on primary care. They focus \non prevention and wellness. They coordinate the care of folks who are \nreceiving treatment. All of their patients have electronic health \nrecords.\n  Medical malpractice coverage is provided by the entity itself, the \nMayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and all the docs are on salary. They \nhave gone after what we call not just defensive medicine but fee-for-\nservice, and they have done a very good job reducing the problems that \nflow out of fee-for-service which lead to more utilization and \nunnecessary utilization of time, tests, technology. They get better \noutcomes and they spend less money.\n  What we are trying to do with this legislation is to take those \nhealth care delivery ideas from those nonprofits and instill them into \nthe delivery of health care, particularly through Medicare but also in \nother ways too.\n  I like to shop for groceries. We have a bunch of good grocery stores \nin Delaware. One of the places I shop for groceries occasionally when I \nam in my State is a place called Safeway, in Dover. A guy named Steve \nBurd is the CEO of the company, and they have really helped inform our \ndecisionmaking in this debate in ways that are pretty remarkable by \nvirtue of the way they provide coverage to their employees. It is not \njust Safeway. It is not just Pitney Bowes. There are a number of \ncompanies that are figuring out how to get better results for less \nmoney, and we are borrowing some of their ideas.\n\n[[Page S13765]]\n\n  One of the ways we are borrowing is to say, how does Safeway \nprovide--literally flattening out for the last 4 or 5 years--health \ncare coverage for their employees? They haven't reduced their benefits. \nOne of the things they have done is to incentivize their employees, use \nfinancial incentives to get employees to--if they are overweight, to \ncontrol their weight, get their weight down, and if they do that, their \npayments are reduced. If they are smokers, they get rewarded for \nstopping smoking. If they have high cholesterol or high blood pressure, \nthey get rewarded by reduced premiums for reducing their cholesterol \nand blood pressure.\n  What we have done with our legislation--and I thank the chairman and \nmy colleagues for their support, Democratic and Republican, for \nsupporting an amendment by Senator Ensign and myself where employers \nwould be able to provide a 30-percent discount to employees who do the \nright thing for their own health. By doing that, they will reduce \nhealth care costs for not just their employer but for others in the \ngroup in which they are covered.\n  There is another piece in the legislation that really borrows from an \nidea that is popping up in a couple of cities and maybe a State or two \naround the country, and that is, Why don't we better inform people? We \nare interested in personal responsibility, people taking charge of \ntheir own health and reducing their health care liability. Why don't we \ndo a better job of ensuring that--when I go into a restaurant or \nanybody goes into a restaurant, we look at the menu board of a chain \nrestaurant and we know right then and there what the calories are in \nwhat we are drinking or eating, for an entree, for a salad or dessert. \nI know it right there by looking at the menu board if it is a chain \nrestaurant. If it is a menu, not a board, they have to have that \ninformation on the menu. They have to have on site additional \ninformation on 10 other items, including fats, trans fats, cholesterol, \nsodium, and on and on.\n  The idea is to make us better informed consumers. As we try to fight \nobesity in this country--about a third of our country is obese or \noverweight, and adults are worse than kids. Kids are catching up with \ntheir parents, unfortunately. That is one of the things that is in the \nlegislation. We call it the Lean Act. The idea is to try to provide \npersonal information so people can assume personal responsibility.\n  Speaking of what we should eat or not eat, I wish to mention \ndoughnuts, and I will do it in the context of something called the \ndoughnut hole. Folks who are Medicare eligible have probably heard this \nterm before because under the Medicare prescription drug program, when \npeople's out-of-pocket costs reach about--when their cost for \nmedicines, their prescription medicines, reach about $2,500, the first \n$2,500, Medicare pays 75 percent of the cost and the individual pays 25 \npercent of the cost. But once a person's prescription costs reach \n$2,500 up to about $5,500, for most people Medicare doesn't pay \nanything and the individual pays it all. That $2,500 to $5,500 gap is \ncalled the doughnut hole. It has nothing to do with doughnuts, but that \nis the name we have given to it.\n  In the legislation that is before us--again, I give a lot of credit \nto our chairman and others who have negotiated this--we are going to \nfill the doughnut hole. We are going to basically cover people who are \nin that gap of the $2,500 to $5,500 so that people will be able to \ncontinue to take the medicine they need to take. They won't stop. They \nwill have the availability to medicine.\n  They will also have access to something called primary care. I am at \nthe tender age of 62, and I think my Presiding Officer, also from \nDelaware, is just about the same age as I. When people in this country \nend up being old enough for Medicare, they get a one-time-only Medicare \nphysical. That is it--one time. If they live to be 105, they never get \nanother one, at least not paid for by Medicare.\n  In terms of borrowing good ideas from the nonprofits, the Cleveland \nClinics and the Mayo Clinics, we are going to say you get more than \njust one physical. You get it when you are 65 and 66 and 67 and 68, and \nif you live to be 105, God bless you, you will get it every year up \nuntil then; finding out what is right with people, what is wrong with \npeople, and what they need to do more of or less of. That is a smart \nidea, and it is part of the reforms in the legislation.\n  In terms of going back to medicine, we want to make sure people have \ngood access to primary care, annual physicals if they are on Medicare, \nso their doctor can find out what is wrong with them, if they need to \nexercise, stop smoking, control their weight, whatever that might be, \nbut also to learn if there are some medicines they ought to be taking, \nand second, to make sure they can afford them. Third, our legislation \nactually improves their lives in terms of if medicines are prescribed, \nthey will actually be taken and used the way they are prescribed.\n  There is a little piece in this legislation that Senator Ron Wyden \ndeserves a lot of credit for called personalized medicine. The idea is \nthat if there are certain people who, because of their genetic makeup, \nthe way God made them, they have a particular condition and the \nmedicine is not going to help them--if the same group of people have \nthe same problem--or if a different group of people have a different \ngenetic makeup and the medicine will help one group and not the other, \nwe want to make sure we spend the money on the folks who will be helped \nand not waste money on the folks who will never be helped because of \ntheir genetic makeup--literally, the way the Good Lord made them. That \nis called personalized medicine, and it is in this legislation. I think \nin the future it will be a very important addition.\n  Lastly, I want to build on a proposal offered again by Senator Baucus \nwith Senator Enzi, and the issue is defensive medicine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Thank you.\n  The issue is defensive medicine. The issue is medical malpractice. \nThere have been a couple of amendments offered by friends across the \naisle for us to try to deal with the incidence of medical malpractice \nlawsuits, the defensive medicine that sort of flows from there where \ndoctors prescribe really too many tests and too many procedures and \nmaybe too many of the wrong kinds of medicine just in an effort to \nreduce the likelihood they are going to be sued. What we have done here \nis to take an idea from the States.\n  The States have done some very interesting stuff with respect to \ntrying to make sure we reduce the incidence of medical malpractice \nlawsuits, that we reduce the incidence of defensive medicine, and we \nactually improve health care outcomes. We are going to take those \nideas, one called Sorry Works that they were using up in Michigan where \npeople have an opportunity--doctors have an opportunity to apologize \nand offer a financial settlement to people and patients who have been \nharmed by that doctor; an idea called panels of certification like we \nhave in Delaware where before I can sue my doctor I have to go before a \npanel to find out if my suit has any basis in fact. We are going to \ntake ideas like safe harbor. If a doctor does all the things by the \nbook, everything by the book, should that doctor receive some kind of \nexpectation that maybe they are safe from lawsuits or reduced exposures \nto lawsuits? We think there should be some of that. There is the idea \nof health courts, where there are folks on the court, like the \nbankruptcy courts, folks who are the experts, and before a suit can \nactually go into a court, that health court would actually sit in \ndetermination of whether a doctor or a hospital or a nurse has really \nmessed up. Those are all ideas that are being talked about, \nexperimented with.\n  We are going to make sure they are robustly tested. States are going \nto apply for grants to test those ideas and maybe others to accomplish \nthree things: one, reducing medical malpractice lawsuits; two, reducing \nthe incidence of defensive medicine; and three, and most importantly, \nimproving health care outcomes.\n  Those ideas build on what works. They are not Democratic ideas. They \nare not Republican ideas. I think they are just smart ideas for the \nmost part. They are ideas that, as time goes by, people will find out \nif they really do the trick in helping to rein in health care costs so \nthe coverage we extend can be sustained.\n  I will just close with this, if I could. For the folks in this \ncountry who are\n\n[[Page S13766]]\n\ntotally confused by all this, for the people who are scared that we are \ndoing something really foolish and it is going to be a disaster for our \ncountry, let me just say that when all the negative ads sort of stop \nbeing funded, when folks have actually had a chance to understand some \nof the things I have talked about here today and a lot of the aspects \nof the bill that really will improve outcomes, that really will rein in \nthe growth of cost, that really will extend coverage, I think they \nreally will be pleasantly surprised.\n  In closing, I am the guy who came here always believing that \nDemocrats and Republicans should work together. I know our chairman \ntried mightily in the Finance Committee to do that, and I commend him \nand others for their effort. When we come back, we can't have another \n12 months of this or 12 years of this. Our country is in trouble if \nthis is the way we are going to be doing business in the future. Our \ncountry is in trouble.\n  My hope is that we will get this done, we will get it behind us, we \nwill improve the bill in conference, and the President will provide a \nsignature for us, and we will go back to work on implementing this. \nJust like Medicare. Just like Medicare. The key isn't just to stop; the \nkey is to make it better and to build on this as a foundation. I am \ncommitted to doing that. I know my colleagues on this side of the aisle \nare committed to doing that. My hope and prayer is that our friends on \nthe other side will want to join us in that effort.\n  Again, I commend our chairman of the Finance Committee, our \nleadership, Senator Reid, and others. I commend my friend Olympia \nSnowe, who showed a lot of courage during the course of this debate in \ncommittee and here on the floor. She was under enormous pressure, as \nwere some of our Republican colleagues on the Finance Committee whom I \nam convinced would like to have been with us, and I believe we would \nhave had an even better bill if the pressure from within their own \nparty had allowed them to be more fully participative. But that wasn't \nthe case this time. It has to be the next.\n  On that happy note, I say to my colleagues, we will gather again \nafter the holidays and get this job done and look forward to working on \na host of other issues. None will be more important than this one. None \nwill be more important than this one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to begin by saying I agree with my \ncolleague from Delaware. This partisanship has to stop. It is just too \nmuch. It is ironic, it is bittersweet that we are reaching a high point \nbecause we are going to pass health care reform legislation, but we are \nreaching a low point, too, in terms of partisanship. It is very \nunfortunate. Many of us over the last several days have been scratching \nour heads just trying to figure out what we can do to avoid this next \nyear. Hope springs eternal.\n  I know this Senator and I know the occupant of the chair want to try \nto find ways for this body to be much more civil. We are not just \nblowing smoke here. We really mean it. I thank very much the Senator \nfrom Delaware for raising that point. It is needed, and I do think this \ncountry is in trouble if we don't find some solution to handle this \nexcessive partisanship which is certainly hurting our country.\n  On another matter, some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have asserted that the penalty that is proposed under the bill \nbefore us for failing to maintain health coverage is unconstitutional. \nOne Senator has raised a point of order--Senator Ensign--on that \nsubject, and that is now pending.\n  Those of us who voted to proceed to the health reform bill and who \nvoted for cloture on the substitute amendment take seriously our oath \nto defend the Constitution. Every Senator here takes that oath of \noffice very seriously.\n  We have seriously looked at this question as well and have concluded \nthat the penalty in the bill is constitutional.\n  Those who study constitutional law as a line of work have drawn that \nsame conclusion. Most legal scholars who have considered the question \nof a requirement for individuals to purchase health care coverage argue \nforcefully that the requirement is within Congress's power to regulate \ninterstate commerce.\n  Take Professor Erin Chemerinsky, a renowned constitutional law \nscholar, author of four popular treatises and casebooks on \nconstitutional law and the dean of the University of California Irvine \nSchool of Law. Professor Chemerinsky has gone so far as to say that \nthose arguing on the other side of the issue do not have ``the \nslightest merit from a constitutional perspective.''\n  In arguing that a requirement to have health care coverage falls \nwithin Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce, Professor \nChemerinsky compares health care reform to the case of Gonzales v. \nRaich--often cited by the other side. In that case, the Supreme Court \nheld that the Federal Government's commerce clause powers extend to the \ncultivation and possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal \nuse. Professor Chemerinsky notes that the relationship between health \ncare coverage and the national economy is even clearer than the \ncultivation and possession involved in Gonzalez v. Raich.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Professor Chemerinsky's \nLos Angeles Times article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Oct. 6, 2009]\n\n                  The Constitutionality of Healthcare\n\n                         (By Erwin Chemerinsky)\n\n       Are the healthcare bills pending in the House and Senate \n     unconstitutional?\n       That's what some of the bills' critics have alleged. Their \n     argument focuses on the fact that most of the major proposals \n     would require all Americans to obtain healthcare coverage or \n     pay a tax if they don't. Those too poor to afford insurance \n     would have their health coverage provided by the state.\n       Although the desirability of this approach can be debated, \n     it unquestionably would be constitutional.\n       Those who claim otherwise make two arguments. First, they \n     say the requirement is beyond the scope of Congress' powers. \n     And second, they say that people have a right to be uninsured \n     and that requiring them to buy health insurance violates \n     individual liberty. Neither argument has the slightest merit \n     from a constitutional perspective.\n       Congress has broad power to tax and spend for the general \n     welfare. In the last 70 years, no federal taxing or spending \n     program has been declared to exceed the scope of Congress' \n     power. The ability in particular of Congress to tax people to \n     spend money for health coverage has been long established \n     with programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n       Congress has every right to create either a broad new tax \n     to pay for a national healthcare program or to impose a tax \n     only on those who have no health insurance.\n       The reality is that virtually everyone will, at some point, \n     need medical care. And, if a person has certain kinds of \n     communicable diseases, the government will insist that he or \n     she be treated whether they are insured or not. A tax on the \n     uninsured is a way of paying for the costs of their likely \n     future medical care.\n       Another basis for the power of Congress to impose a health \n     insurance mandate is that the legislature is charged with \n     regulating commerce among the states. The Supreme Court has \n     held that this means Congress has the ability to regulate \n     activities that have a substantial effect on interstate \n     commerce. A few years ago, for example, the court held that \n     Congress could prohibit individuals from cultivating and \n     possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal \n     use because marijuana is bought and sold in interstate \n     commerce.\n       The relationship between healthcare coverage and the \n     national economy is even clearer. In 2007, healthcare \n     expenditures amounted to $2.2 trillion, or $7,421 a person, \n     and accounted for 16.2% of the gross domestic product.\n       The claim that individuals have a constitutional ``right'' \n     to not have health insurance is no stronger than the \n     objection that this would exceed Congress' powers. It is hard \n     to even articulate the constitutional right that would be \n     violated by requiring individuals to have health insurance or \n     pay a tax.\n       Since the 19th century, the Supreme Court has consistently \n     held that a tax cannot be challenged as an impermissible \n     taking of private property for public use without just \n     compensation. All taxes, of course, are a taking of private \n     property for public use, and a tax to pay for health \n     coverage--whether imposed on all Americans or just the \n     uninsured--is certainly something Congress could impose.\n       The claim that an insurance mandate would violate the due \n     process clause is also specious. Most states have a \n     requirement for mandatory car insurance, and every challenge \n     to such mandates has been rejected. More important, since \n     1937, the Supreme Court has constantly held that government\n\n[[Page S13767]]\n\n     regulations of property and the economy will be upheld as \n     long as they are reasonable. Virtually every economic \n     regulation and tax has been found to meet this requirement. A \n     mandate for health coverage would meet this standard, which \n     is so deferential to the government.\n       Finally, those who object to having health coverage on \n     freedom-of-religion grounds also have no case. The Supreme \n     Court has expressly rejected objections to paying Social \n     Security and other taxes on religious grounds. More \n     generally, the Supreme Court has ruled that individuals do \n     not have a right to an exemption from a general law on the \n     ground that it burdens their religion.\n       There is much to debate over healthcare reform and how to \n     achieve it. But those who object on constitutional grounds \n     are making a faulty argument that should have no place in the \n     debate over this important public issue.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as a second example, I refer my colleagues \nto an article by Mark Hall, a law professor at Wake Forest University. \nHis article is a comprehensive peer-reviewed analysis of the \nconstitutionality of a Federal individual responsibility requirement.\n  In this article, Professor Hall concludes that there are no plausible \n10th amendment or States' rights issues arising from the imposition by \nCongress of an individual responsibility to maintain health coverage.\n  Professor Hall notes further that health care and health insurance \nboth affect and are distributed through interstate commerce, and that \ngives Congress the power to legislate a coverage requirement using its \ncommerce clause powers.\n  Professor Hall notes that the Supreme Court indicated in its decision \nin U.S. v. Morrison and U.S. v. Lopez--two other cases relied on by the \nother side--that the noneconomic, criminal nature of the conduct in \nthose cases were central to the Court's decisions in those cases that \nthe government had not appropriately exercised power under the commerce \nclause.\n  Health insurance, on the other hand, does not deal with criminal \nconduct. Health insurance is commercial and economic in nature and, to \nreiterate, substantially affects interstate commerce.\n  Health insurance and health care services are a significant part of \nthe national economy. National health spending is 17.6 percent of the \neconomy, and it is projected to increase from $2.5 trillion in 2009 to \n$4.7 trillion in 2019.\n  Private health insurance spending is projected to be $854 billion in \n2009. It covers things such as medical supplies, drugs, and equipment \nthat are shipped in interstate commerce.\n  Health insurance is sold by national or regional health insurance \ncarriers. Thus, health insurance is sold in interstate commerce. As \nwell, claims payments flow through interstate commerce.\n  The individual responsibility requirements, together with other \nprovisions in the act, will add millions of new consumers to the health \ninsurance market, increasing the supply and demand for health care \nservices.\n  Under existing health and labor laws, the Federal Government has a \nsignificant role in regulating health insurance.\n  Other prominent legal scholars have also said that Congress has the \nconstitutional authority to impose a requirement on individuals to \nmaintain health coverage.\n  Jonathan Adler, a professor of law at Case Western Reserve University \nSchool of Law, stated:\n\n       In this case, the overall scheme would involve the \n     regulation of ``commerce'' as the Supreme Court has defined \n     it for several decades, as it would involve the regulation of \n     health care markets. And the success of such a regulatory \n     scheme would depend upon requiring all to participate.\n\n  Doug Kendall of the Constitutional Accountability Center similarly \nconcluded:\n\n       The fundamental point behind pushing people into the \n     private insurance market is to make sure that uninsured \n     individuals who can pay for health insurance don't impose \n     costs on other taxpayers.\n\n  Professor Michael Dorf of the Cornell University Law School also \nnoted:\n\n       [T]he individual mandate is ``plainly adapted'' to the \n     undoubtedly legitimate end of regulating the enormous and \n     enormously important health care sector of the national \n     economy. It is therefore constitutional.\n\n  Robert Shapiro, a professor of law at Emory University School of Law, \nstated:\n\n       When everyone thinks of the wisdom of an individual \n     mandate, or of health care reform generally, it would be \n     surprising if the Constitution prohibited a democratic \n     resolution of the issue. Happily, it does not.\n\n  Thus, Mr. President, the weight of authority is that health care and \ninsurance represent interstate commerce. The individual responsibility \nrequirement to maintain coverage would be within Congress's power to \nregulate interstate commerce.\n  Mr. President, in the last hour, several Senators on the other side \nlisted many organizations they claim oppose the bill before us. I will \nindicate many organizations that favor the health care reform bill.\n  I will begin with the American Medical Association. That is the major \ndoctors association that supports this legislation. In fact, the \nincoming president, the president-elect of AMA, at a press conference \nyesterday, made that statement very clear.\n  In addition, the American Heart Association supports the legislation. \nThey believe the many patient-centered provisions are a significant \nstep toward meaningful health care.\n  The American Hospital Association supports passage of the \nlegislation.\n  The American Cancer Society Action Network supports it.\n  The Federation of American Hospitals also supports it.\n  The National Puerto Rican Coalition supports this legislation.\n  Mr. President, it would be unfair to say that these are all totally \n100 percent endorsements. Rather, these are statements of support from \nthese organizations. Some totally support it, and some say there are \nvery good features in it. As far as I know, none of these groups \ntotally oppose this legislation. Some would like to see some changes, \nbut they favor the legislation.\n  The American Association of Retired People supports this legislation. \nThat is the largest seniors group. They think this is good--I am sure \nfor a lot of reasons, but it extends the solvency to the Medicare trust \nfund for another 5 years.\n  The Business Roundtable supports this legislation. They say:\n\n       On behalf of the members of Business Roundtable, I want to \n     commend you for your efforts to improve the health care \n     reform legislation currently being considered by the United \n     States Senate. The proposed legislation is a step toward our \n     shared goal of providing high quality, affordable health care \n     for all Americans. . . . As we understand it, the proposed \n     legislation now will include provisions to accelerate and \n     enhance the process for delivery reform for the Medicare \n     system. . . . It strengthens the match between the insurance \n     reforms and the individual obligation. . . . We will continue \n     to work with you, the Congress and the Administration to \n     ensure we achieve the goals we all set when this process \n     began.\n\n  The American Diabetes Association also supports this bill. They say \nit is ``long overdue improvements to our broken health care system.''\n\n  The Small Business Majority also believes the managers' amendment \n``includes new provisions essential for small business protection and \nsurvival.''\n  Doctors for America supports passage of this bill.\n  The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization strongly \nsupports this legislation. There has been confusion as to whether they \ndid. But they strongly support it, saying:\n\n       On behalf of hospice and palliative care providers and the \n     more than 1.5 million patients, and their families . . . \n     would like to express our strong support for the national \n     effort to enact health care reform. We acknowledge the \n     enormity and complexity . . . and we applaud your recognition \n     of the importance of various provisions. . . .\n\n  Families USA supports this legislation. I already mentioned AARP, \nwhich also supports it. Community Catalyst is another organization that \nsupports it. U.S. PIRG supports it. The Center for American Progress \nsupports it. Medco Health, Microsoft, a big company in the United \nStates, makes a strong statement approving the measure we are \nconsidering here.\n  Many organizations support this legislation. I am sure there are \nmore, but this is an example of a few.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S13768]]\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I commend the work of our Finance Committee \nchairman, Max Baucus, for so many things in this debate. First, for \nhelping us get health care legislation moving in 2009 and now at the \npoint of getting close to passing the bill. I am grateful for his \nleadership. There are some highlights of the bill I want to note in the \nremaining moments of our time.\n  First, there has been a lot of debate over the last couple of days \nand weeks--but even over months--about cost and care. Fortunately, we \nare able to report that with this bill coming out of the Senate, we \nwill have more care and less costs. The deficit will be cut by $132 \nbillion over 10 years as a result of this bill; $1.3 trillion will be \ncut in the deficit in the second decade.\n  It will provide coverage for 94 percent of the American people. This \nhas not been talked about much, but the bill is a net tax cut for the \nAmerican people. We are going to crack down on insurers' practices that \nhave gone on too long, were allowed to go on for too many years: ending \npreexisting condition discrimination, and discrimination based upon \ngender, providing protection from exorbitant out-of-pocket costs, \nsomething we hear about all the time.\n  Just with regard to older citizens across our country, one, the bill \nwill extend the solvency of Medicare; two, it makes prescription drugs \nmore affordable by filling the so-called doughnut hole and helping \npeople with those costs; cutting waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare; \nensuring Medicare funding to improving care for seniors not to \ninsurance companies.\n  Small businesses--if there was one sector of our economy we have \nheard from over and over about the crushing burden of health care \ncosts, it is small businesses. I know that tens of thousands of small \nbusinesses in Pennsylvania, for example, will benefit from this \nlegislation.\n  There are two points with regard to the bill and small business. \nFirst, the bill provides tax credits to small businesses to make \nemployee coverage more affordable.\n  Second, tax credits of up to 50 percent of premiums will be available \nto eligible firms that choose to offer coverage--a tremendous \nbreakthrough for people out there who are creating most of the jobs in \nPennsylvania and most of the jobs nationally.\n  One of the more unreported or underreported aspects of the bill is \nwhat happens immediately. A lot of folks say: We like your bill. We \nlike what is going to happen. But a lot of it won't take effect for at \nleast several years, until 2014.\n  A good part of the bill takes effect in 2010. A quick summary of \nthose provisions: First, it provides affordable coverage to the \nuninsured with preexisting conditions. If there is an insurance company \nthat excludes you because of a preexisting condition, you can go into a \nhigh-risk pool to get help right away.\n  It improves care to older citizens, as I mentioned, and lowers \nprescription drug costs.\n  It reduces costs for small businesses through tax credits.\n  Fourth, it extends coverage for young adults--young adults 25, 26 \nyears old, who may be living under difficult circumstances and don't \nhave insurance coverage. Preventive care--we preached and talked about \nthat for years, and we point to studies and good practices, but we have \nnever made it part of our overall health care bill. This bill does it.\n  We eliminate lifetime limits on the amount of coverage a person may \nreceive--a terrible problem for families. The message from our system \nhas been that we can cure you, but we have to limit the kind of care we \nare going to provide for you.\n  Three more points in this area: What are the immediate benefits in \n2010? It prohibits discrimination based upon salary, gender, or \nillness. We make insurance plans more transparent and competitive.\n  Finally--and this is a rather new change--it prohibits insurance \ncompanies from denying children coverage due to a preexisting \ncondition.\n  That has moved up in the bill, so to speak, to an immediate benefit \nfor children. So at least in the short term for children, there will be \nno more denying them coverage due to a preexisting condition--a \ntremendous breakthrough for a child, for his or her family, and for our \neconomy and for our health care system, to protect children in a very \nsubstantial way. Whether it is cutting the deficit, providing better \nquality of care, providing opportunities for great prevention which \nwill lead to a healthier outcome, protecting people so they do not have \nto go bankrupt to get the care they need, and especially for protecting \nolder citizens and children, this bill moves forward in a way we have \nnever had an opportunity to move our system forward in a very positive \nway.\n\n  I again commend Chairman Baucus on his work and our majority leader, \nHarry Reid, and all those who made it possible to move this bill \nforward and to have it passed through the Senate and move it to \nenactment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see no Senator seeking recognition. I \nask unanimous consent that the next block of time begin immediately.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee for his courtesy. I appreciate the opportunity to be \nhere.\n  I understand, Mr. President, I have a certain allotment of time. If I \ncan be notified when I have 2 minutes remaining, I would appreciate \nthat.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair is unaware of any \nrestrictions. There is 1 hour for the Senator's side.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. OK. If I can be notified when I have spoken for 20 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so notify the \nSenator.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about this health \ncare bill. I have spoken about it before. I feel obligated on behalf of \nmy State of Florida to explain why I, unfortunately, will not be able \nto support this bill on final passage. I think, in doing so, it is \nimportant to talk about why we are here and how we got here.\n  I am sure the American people think that in this process of debating \nhealth care over the past weeks and months, this has been a process \nwhere both sides, Republicans and Democrats, have worked together, sat \nin an open room and gave ideas back and forth; that there has been \ngive-and-take and compromise so that we could come to the plan that is \nbefore us today. I am sure the American people believe that amendments \nwere offered, that each Senator could come to the floor and offer \namendments and that his and her colleagues were allowed to hear about \nthose amendments and vote them up or down. I also believe the American \npeople think we do not just come to this Chamber and give monologs. \nThey probably think this room is not empty and that there are just two \nof my distinguished colleagues here but that we all sit here and listen \nto each others' arguments and decide what is best for the American \npeople.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the case with this bill. This bill was \ndesigned and crafted by the Democratic leadership, without the input of \nthe colleagues from this side of the aisle. There was no give-and-take. \nThere was no back-and-forth in a conference room with C-SPAN in the \nroom, as the President told us he would ensure when he ran for the \nOffice of the Presidency. And we did not have the opportunity to offer \namendments to make this bill better.\n  I know that seems hard to believe, that we would not have the ability \nto offer amendments to make this bill better, but I can prove it to \nyou.\n  I have an amendment at the desk. It is amendment No. 3225. What this \namendment does is it takes a piece of legislation I filed shortly after \ncoming to the Senate in September of this year--the legislation is \ncalled the Prevent Health Care Fraud Act of 2009. This legislation has \n11 cosponsors. It has bipartisan support.\n  What the bill does is basically three things:\n  First, it creates the chief health care fraud prevention officer of \nthe United States. It would be the No. 2 person at Health and Human \nServices. Their only job would be to ferret out health care fraud.\n\n[[Page S13769]]\n\n  Second, it would use and take a page from the private sector to go \nafter fraud. There is an industry out there right now that does an \nexcellent job of stopping fraud. That industry is about the same size \nas the health care industry. It is the credit card business. It is \nabout a $2 trillion business. Health care is about a $2 trillion \nbusiness. In health care and in Medicare alone, estimates are that $1 \nout of every $7 in Medicare is fraud. In the credit card business, it \nis pennies on the hundreds of dollars.\n  How does the credit card business do it? We have all had this \nexperience. You go to purchase something in a store, and when you \nleave, you get an e-mail or a phone call and your credit card company \nsays to you: Did you really mean to purchase that good or service? \nGuess what. If you say no, they don't pay. The way we do things in \nMedicare and Medicaid is we do pay-and-chase. We pay, and then when we \nthink there is fraud, we try to go after it.\n  This model stops the fraud before it starts. A group here in \nWashington, DC, has evaluated this legislation and says that it might \nsave as much as $20 billion a year in Medicare alone. We think there is \n$60 billion in fraud in Medicare--$1 out of every $7.\n  This proposal that we put forward also would require background \nchecks for every health care provider in America to make sure they are \nnot a criminal. Florida, my State, unfortunately is ground zero for \nhealth care fraud. We have the worst health care fraud in America. Just \nthis past weekend, and I sent this letter around to my colleagues--a \n$61 million Medicare fraud scheme out of Florida and some other States.\n  My bill, this proposal which has bipartisan support, could save $20 \nbillion a year. We have fashioned this bill into an amendment to this \nhealth care bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside to call up my amendment. It is amendment No. 3225.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, and I hope my colleague \nwill let me say a word or two in my reservation, the underlying bill, \nwhile certainly objective, was crafted with the guidance of CMS, the \nOffice of the Inspector General, HHS, and the Justice Department for \nstronger antifraud. It would give CMS new screening authority to \nprovide resources to CMS for new screening authority. It also limits \nproviders in other ways but more oversight when fraud is suspected, \nsuch as limiting durable medical equipment providers because we know it \nis fraught with fraud. We also require providers to have compliance \nprograms, make sure providers know the rules. There are increased \npenalties for fraudulent activity in the bill as well. Most \nimportantly, we will give CMS, HHS, OIJ, and DOJ more tools at their \ndisposal to preserve and protect the program's integrity. The bill does \na lot to protect fraud.\n  I might say, I know this is on his time, but this procedure has been \nunusual. I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair, as well as the \nindulgence of the Senator from Florida.\n  You will not believe the number of amendments that were offered on a \nbipartisan basis in the Finance Committee, as well as in the HELP \nCommittee. They were adopted in both committees. It was very \ntransparent, open, bipartisan. Unfortunately, by the time the bill got \nto the floor, it became apparent we were facing less than the nature of \nlegitimate amendments, more message amendments. So the majority leader \nresorted to a procedure to move this bill expeditiously.\n  I am taking advantage of the Senator's time to explain all this. That \nis not the proper procedure. There are strong antifraud provisions in \nthis legislation, and very respectfully I must object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee. Sure, there are things in this bill that he pointed \nout to go after fraud. But I would like to inform the Senate of a \nreport that came out evaluating this new bill, the managers' amendment.\n  I have a table which evaluates how much will be saved from the waste, \nfraud, and abuse provisions which are in this bill. It is $.9 billion. \nThe proposal that I have, one group--and, again, it is not the CBO--one \ngroup has said it might save $20 billion a year.\n  Putting aside our differences, I sure wish we could talk about my \namendment today, I say to my colleague. I hope we can revisit it after \nthis is over because we should be able to agree, and it does have \nbipartisan support. I wish we could amend the bill today. I hear the \nobjection, and I will move on. I hope we can talk about this.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Senator if he might yield using time on our \nside. I fully agree with the Senator. It is unfortunate we cannot \nproceed at this moment. But I pledge my support next year to work \naggressively with very strong oversight to boost our antifraud measures \neven more than they are in this bill.\n\n  There will be an awful lot of oversight necessary when the bill is \npassed to make sure all the provisions that are intended come true. In \nfact, we think we are working hard to get it passed; frankly, I think \nwe have to work harder next year to make sure the provisions work. I \npledge my support to work aggressively in that area.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I thank the chairman. I wish we could do it before we \nhad to rush to judgment on this bill. I wish we had more time. I wish \nwe did not have to be backed up against a wall before Christmas. I \nunderstand colleagues on the other side have a desire to get this bill \ndone. But it is my concern with this measure and with the other \nmeasures in the bill that we could have worked together.\n  Mr. President, I say to the chairman, I am new to the Chamber. But \nthis is not the way businesses work. It is not the way American \nfamilies work. It is not the way even State legislators work, which I \nhave experience with in Florida.\n  I wish we could have talked about that amendment and offered it. I \nwish my colleagues were here to debate it up or down. Let's talk about \nwhere we are instead. Let's talk about what this bill does and why I \ncannot, unfortunately, support it as a Senator from Florida.\n  We know this bill cuts Medicare by nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion. We know \nthis bill raises taxes by nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion. And we know it does \nnot accomplish the fundamental goal the President put forward when we \nembarked on this debate about health care reform.\n  The American people are beginning to realize and if they have not \nrealized yet will be shocked to hear that this bill is not going to cut \nthe cost of health care for people who have insurance already. That is \nthe very reason this debate was embarked upon, not just access for \npeople who do not have health care insurance but to bring the costs \ndown. Health care has gone up 130 percent in the past 10 years. This \nbill will not address that. In fact, estimates show that for some \nfolks, the cost of health care will go up.\n  There are basically five reasons why I cannot support this measure as \na Senator from Florida.\n  I am concerned, first of all, about access and quality of care for \nour seniors. When you take $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare, my fear is \nthat it is going to diminish the quality of care for seniors in \nFlorida.\n  It is said on the other side that we are not going to take away \nbenefits, that we are just going to take money away from providers. It \nwas said on the other side that the new insurance will take care of \nuncompensated care, so that the cuts to hospitals and to other \nproviders will not really hurt seniors in the end. I think that is a \ntremendously risky experiment.\n  I cannot believe, at the end of the day, when we pay providers less, \nit is not going to affect benefits. Right now, studies show that 24 \npercent of seniors on Medicare trying to find primary care physicians \ncannot find one. I get letters from seniors in Florida who say they \ncannot find a doctor who will take their Medicare. We know in Medicaid \nit is worse. We know in Medicaid that if you are just going into the \nprogram and trying to find a physician, almost 40 percent of the \nphysicians will not take you. In metropolitan areas for specialists, it \nis up to 50 percent who will not take Medicaid.\n  I fear that if we take nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion out of a program that \nis already in financial trouble, a program that in the next 7 years is \ngoing to be in serious financial trouble and not be able to\n\n[[Page S13770]]\n\nmeet its obligations, that it is going to hurt seniors.\n  I have heard this discussion about how we are prolonging the life of \nMedicare. The distinguished chairman just spoke about it. But when you \nlook at what the Actuary at HHS has said about that assumption, the \nassumption is that we are not going to restore the 21-percent decrease \nin physician payments which, of course, as soon as we get back in the \nnew year, we are going to have before us.\n  You cannot take money out of Medicare and pay for a new program and \nshore up Medicare. You do not need an actuary or an evaluation or an \nanalyst to tell you that. It is common sense. You cannot get blood from \na stone. If the doctor is not in, it is not health care reform.\n  I have received a letter, as many of my colleagues have, from an \norganization called 60 Plus which represents 5.5 million seniors. James \nMartin, the president of 60 Plus, writes:\n\n       Cutting half a trillion dollars from Medicare while adding \n     31 million more to the health care rolls is an outrage.\n       60 Plus strongly supports health care reform but first we \n     should do no harm to a system serving so many so well. . . . \n     Make incremental changes that do not bankrupt a system \n     already teetering on insolvency.\n\n  I want to talk a minute about Medicare Advantage. There are more \nFloridians in Medicare Advantage than any other State. A lot has been \nsaid about this program. We have had amendments to try to stop the \ncuts. Mr. President, 950,000 Floridians--Medicare Advantage is a great \nprogram, and people in Florida enjoy it. Seniors enjoy it because they \nget more than regular care; they get eye care, hearing care, wellness, \ndiabetic supplies, and other things that add to the quality of life of \nseniors and help their entire health care. These Medicare Advantage \nproviders are actually working hard to make sure their senior customers \nare happy, not a concept you hear a lot about when the government is in \ncharge.\n\n  There is a fix for Florida, as has been talked about, but I wish to \ntalk about what that fix is, as I understand it. It is an off-ramp. For \nthe rest of the country, it is going to be somewhat of an exit. For \nFlorida, it is an off-ramp.\n  First of all, we don't know what will happen in conference. The \nSenate cuts $120 billion; the House cuts $170 billion. I don't know if \nthe Florida fix will still be there. But in talking to experts and \nreading the bill myself--specifically around page 895 through about 901 \nof the original Reid bill--there is this grandfathering in for folks in \nFlorida, and other areas, but part of Florida is covered. Of the \n950,000 people, the experts think 150,000 to maybe as many as 250,000 \nwill not get this grandfathering in. They are going to get the cuts to \nMedicare Advantage. So this is not good for them. Then, for the others, \nsay, 700,000 people or so, every year, starting in 2013, their \nbenefits--or the payments to the providers for benefits--are going to \ndecline 5 percent a year. That is on pages 895 through 897. So it is an \noff-ramp. Every year, less payments. Every year, less benefits.\n  I talked to one provider down in Miami that many Senators in this \nChamber have visited. He runs a very successful Medicare Advantage \nProgram. He said these cuts would be devastating. So while it might not \nbe an exit for Florida right away, it is certainly going to be an off-\nramp that one day ends up being an exit.\n  Let's remember that many of the folks on the other side of the aisle \nwho are proposing these cuts to Medicare Advantage didn't vote for \nMedicare Advantage to start with. They don't like it. They don't like \nthe private sector being involved. They don't like these extra benefits \nbeing provided. It goes against what they philosophically believe. But \nI know Floridians like it. Because this bill cuts it, I can't be for \nit. No one can guarantee to me that in the next 10 years Medicare \nAdvantage in Florida will be as robust as it is today.\n  I am concerned also about the home health care payments. I am \nconcerned about what it is going to do to the small business home \nhealth care providers in Florida. I talked to the largest provider of \nhome health care services in Florida, and he said: We will be fine, but \nthe small businesses--the mom and pops who do this--will go out of \nbusiness. That is disconcerting in a State with 11\\1/2\\ percent \nunemployment.\n  The second reason I can't support this bill is this is going to have \na devastating effect on our State budget in Florida. We talked today to \nthe head of the Florida health care system, the Agency for Health Care \nAdministration, and these increases in Medicaid, raising Medicaid from \n100 percent of poverty to 133 percent, are going to cost Florida an \nestimated $3\\1/2\\ billion over the next 10 years. That is $3\\1/2\\ \nbillion Florida can't afford to pay.\n  Our budget has gone from $73 billion to $66 billion in a short period \nof time with the economic decline. Unlike this Chamber, which spends \nmoney it doesn't have, Florida has to balance its budget. So what \nhappens when you have less money? You have to cut programs. But when \nyou have a Federal mandate, you can't cut that. So what do you cut? You \ncut education and teachers. You cut law enforcement--not good for \nFlorida. This is a burden Florida can't afford to pay. That is why all \nthe Governors in the country--virtually Republican and Democratic \nalike--including our Governor, Charlie Crist, are against this unfunded \nmandate.\n  The third reason I can't support this bill is because it raises \ntaxes--$518 billion. What happens when the drug company that makes your \nmedicine or the medical device company that makes the lifesaving \nimplement for you gets taxed? They are going to pass it along to you. \nThey are going to put it right in the bill. That is the way it is going \nto work. That is why health care costs aren't going down for the 170 \nmillion Americans who have health insurance. In fact, for some, they \nare going to go up. That is not health care reform.\n  Fourth, this is a budget-busting bill. It is not deficit neutral. Let \nme explain why. You will hear reports this is going to cut more than \n$100 billion from the deficit over the next 10 years. Only in \nWashington, DC, could you come to this calculation. It is funny math. \nWe have this Congressional Budget Office, which is sort of the arbiter \nof all things financial here in Washington. You send them a proposal \nand they give you an answer. But it is not a thinking answer; it is an \nanalytical answer, and it gets gamed. What you send them determines \nwhat you get back. They only look at a 10-year period--what it is going \nto cost in the next 10 years. If you bring in more money than you spend \nin the next 10 years, then it will cut the budget. It will cut the \ndeficit. That is what they say back to you.\n  So what was done in this bill in order to get something that would \nfulfill the President's promise to be a budget cut or at least deficit \nneutral? We have 10 years of taxes and 6 years of benefits. Most of the \nbenefits don't start until 2014, yet the taxes start in 2 weeks--in \nJanuary. That is akin to you going to buy a home and saying: I am going \nto live here for 10 years, and they say: That is great, start paying \ntoday and you can move in in 2014.\n  It is funny math. This is a $2.5 trillion new entitlement program we \ncan't afford. We can't afford the programs we have, let alone the \nprograms the majority in this Chamber want. We have a $12 trillion \ndeficit. We have $30-some trillion in unfunded entitlement deficit. We \nhave hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt for every family in \nAmerica, and no plan to pay for it. We spend more than we take in. We \nspent $1.4 trillion--we have a $1.4 trillion deficit this year--just \nthe debt this year. That is more than the past 4 years combined.\n  The American people are on to this and they are angry about it and \nthey should be.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Fifth and finally, the reason I can't support this bill \nis it doesn't lower the cost of health insurance for Americans.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said the majority of Americans \nwould see the same increases as they currently get under the current \nsystem. For some people, individual policies, for example, they will \nreceive a 10- to 13-percent increase.\n  I am going to conclude by saying this, and this will probably be the \nfinal time I will speak before we have final passage on this bill. I \nlong for what could have been. We could have worked together. We could \nhave had an 80-vote bill. We could have had a bill that would say \ninsurance companies can't drop you if you are sick, insurance\n\n[[Page S13771]]\n\ncompanies can't deny you if you have a preexisting condition, insurance \ncompanies can compete across State lines, set up an exchange, give a \ntax credit to the American people, put money in their pocket, let them \nbe consumers who go out and buy health insurance and drive the cost \ndown because the market economy would, once again, work in health care.\n  This bill doesn't solve the problem. It perpetuates it and makes it \nworse. At the same time, it cuts health care for seniors and doesn't \nlower the cost of health insurance for most Americans. For more and \nmore seniors, the doctor will not be in. That is not reform. For those \nreasons, respectfully, for that lost opportunity, I will not be able to \nsupport this bill.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my friend and colleague from \nAlaska.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the very eloquent \nand articulate comments of my friend from Florida. We recognize that \nhis time in the Senate has been relatively short, but in terms of an \nindividual jumping in with both feet and embracing the challenges we \nclearly have in front of us and representing the constituents of the \nState of Florida in the manner he has, I think that deserves public \nrecognition, and I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  We have had occasion to talk about the similarities between Alaska \nand Florida. You might not think there would be much in relationship \nthere--my being from the North and the cold versus the sunny South in \nFlorida. But when it comes to our senior populations, this is where we \ntruly have a shared interest. Florida has probably the largest number \nof seniors per capita, and in my State of Alaska, we are the State that \nhas the fastest growing population of seniors per capita.\n\n  One might not think of Alaska as being a retirement haven, but more \nand more we are becoming so, and we share the same problems when it \ncomes to access. When you can't get in to see a provider, when that \ninsurance card is all we have given you, then we haven't done anything \nto provide for a level of care to improve the situation for the \nresidents of Florida or the residents of Alaska. So what we are doing \ntoday--as we move toward final passage on legislation that I would \nconcur with the Senator from Florida does not fix the problem--we are \nnot dealing with how we appropriately and adequately provide for access \nto quality health care. We have much work remaining before us.\n  We have had some time these past couple days--actually these past \ncouple weeks--as we have spent a considerable amount of time in our \noffices waiting for votes at 1 in the morning or votes at 7 o'clock in \nthe morning, and I have had a chance to go through some things on my \ndesk, but I have also had an opportunity to spend a lot of time \nchecking to see what people are saying when they are contacting our \noffice. The volume of correspondence, whether in e-mails or faxes or \nphone calls, coming in from Alaskans during this time has been \nabsolutely unprecedented.\n  I think, typically, in the legislative calendar about this time--\nseveral days before Christmas--you don't see constituents contacting \ntheir Senators and pounding the drum. Well, let me tell you, the people \nin Alaska are pounding the drum. In just the past 24 hours, we have \ngotten probably close to about 500 health care e-mails that have come \nin. Overwhelmingly these are e-mails from constituents saying: No, this \nis not good. You must do what you can to prevent this reform package, \nas you call it, from moving forward.\n  It seems the longer the people from Alaska, the longer the people \nfrom around this country have to look at what is contained in this \n2,000-plus page bill, the more they realize the negative impacts, the \nconsequences to them and their families and their businesses and they \nare no longer silent. I have had so many calls and letters coming from \npeople saying: I have never weighed in with you before, never weighed \nin with my delegation, but this is something I can't keep silent on.\n  When you look at some of the ones that have come in, these are just \ntoday's. This is one from a woman in Anchorage who says: Yesterday on \nthe TV news I heard about the sweetheart deal Senator Nelson made \nregarding the rest of us paying Nebraska's Medicare bill forever. To \nsay I am angry is putting it mildly.\n  There is a gentleman in Fairbanks who writes in: I am very skeptical \nabout this mandatory health insurance that apparently everyone will \nhave to buy in.\n  Here is one from a fellow in Anchorage also. He says: You are moving \na health care bill that can't be understood unless a person has a law \ndegree.\n  Another individual, and this is an interesting one. He and his family \napparently own four indoor tanning businesses in Alaska. We need to get \na little sunshine, even if it is not what God has provided us. But \nthese are good businesses, and he says: When did this go from a 5-\npercent tax increase for cosmetic surgery to 10 percent for indoor \ntanning anyway? And he adds: Adding another 10-percent tax hike on \nsmall businesses, like indoor tanning, will likely drive many families, \njust like mine, into bankruptcy.\n  I could go on and on in terms of the stacks of correspondence and \nphone calls we have gotten, but suffice it to say, the more people \nunderstand what is in this legislation, the greater their concerns are \nand the greater their outrage as they learn what is contained in it.\n  One of the things I learned just yesterday, which I don't think we \nhave gotten the focus or the attention on--and this is a concern that \nwas raised by the Anchorage homebuilders and the Alaska State Home \nBuilding Association. They have pointed out that as an industry, the \nhomebuilders industry, they are being unfairly singled out in this \nbill.\n  We have talked about the employer mandate that is contained in this \nlegislation, and that mandate applies to those businesses with 50 or \nmore employees. But there is a zing in this legislation to homebuilders \nwho are now responsible for providing federally approved health \nbenefits if they have five or more employees.\n\n  Look at what is going on throughout this country in terms of \nindustries that have taken a real hit with this economic downturn and \nthis recession. The homebuilding industry has suffered incredibly \nduring this downturn. On top of depressed house prices and increases in \nhome foreclosures, now we are now going to punish them with an employer \nmandate that treats them worse than any other employer. In other words, \nif you have five or more employees as a homebuilder, you need to know \nthat your industry is the one, the only one that will be subject to the \nemployer mandate of $750 per employee.\n  In Alaska, we checked to see how many individuals are homebuilders \nwithin the State. We have about 250 homebuilders in Alaska. But when \nyou look to see how many individuals they employ, that is about 3,078 \nemployees, it is about 12 employees to every builder. So the total \nhomebuilding industry that would be impacted is about 800 employers in \nmy State.\n  Yesterday, there was a letter sent to Members of the Senate. This is \nfrom the homebuilding industry as well as many other associated \nindustries--the air-conditioning contractors, the builders and \ncontractors, the electrical contractors. I wish to mention some of the \nstatements that are contained in this letter. Again, it is written \nyesterday. They say:\n\n       We are writing to express our strong opposition to language \n     contained in the managers' amendment which excludes the \n     construction industry from the small business exemption \n     contained in the bill. The fact that the managers' amendment \n     was made public less than 2 days before the first vote on the \n     matter has increased the difficulty of playing a constructive \n     role in the legislative process.\n\n  I will take a little detour from the letter. This is part of the \nproblem. You have these organizations and groups, and there is a list \nof about a dozen of them here, that have signed on to this letter. They \nhad literally hours before we were forced to vote on the managers' \namendment. They did not know what was in the bill and how it impacted \nthem. They go on to say:\n\n       The managers' amendment singles out the construction \n     industry by altering the exemption so it applies only to \n     firms with fewer than 5 employees. This is an unprecedented \n     assault on our industry. It is unreasonable to presume that \n     small business owners can bear\n\n[[Page S13772]]\n\n     the increased costs of these new benefits simply because \n     Congress mandates that they do so.\n\n  They go on to conclude in the letter:\n\n       We are unaware of any data or evidence that suggests that \n     the needs and struggles of a construction contractor with \n     fewer than 50 employees are so different from those of small \n     business owners in other industries, and absent such \n     convincing evidence, we are left to assume that this specific \n     provision is merely a political payoff to satisfy the desires \n     of a small constituency.\n\n  Those are some pretty strong words there toward the end. But it does \ncause you to wonder why, in this legislation, we are going to require \nthat businesses--only businesses in excess of 50 employees are going to \nbe subject to this mandate. Why this unprecedented assault on the \nhomebuilders? I don't get it. But what it does cause me to get is that \nthere is a heck of a lot more out there that, the more we read it, the \nmore we sit down and we connect the dots, the more we realize this fish \nwe have set out on the front porch is going to continue to stink.\n  It stuns me. We have the homebuilders up in Alaska who are beside \nthemselves, saying: Can you take a look at this and let me know how the \nSenators feel. What are you going to do about this, Lisa, is the \nquestion I have received.\n  This is something we all have to reckon with.\n  Madam President, at the conclusion of my remarks, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the letter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I am going to speak a little bit about how aspects of \nthis legislation have impact specifically on my State. As a rural \nState, sometimes the impacts we see are different than you have in more \nurban States. Our geography is different, our lack of providers, our \nhigh senior population, our extremely expensive costs, there are a lot \nof dynamics at play that cause real issues and real concerns.\n  There have been many words that have been exchanged on this floor \nabout what this bill doesn't do or what it does do. I find it helpful \nto go to the experts, the think tank in my State, and ask them flat \nout. We have an institution at the University of Alaska called the \nInstitute of Social Economic Research. I take what they have to say \nvery seriously.\n  I also take very seriously what our Congressional Budget Office has \nto say, what the CMS Actuary has to say, because, as my colleague from \nFlorida pointed out, these are the independent arbiters. These are the \nguys whose job it is to work the numbers. I would like to discuss some \nof the findings from the University of Alaska and also try to inject a \nlittle bit of common sense into the debate as to what it means for \nAlaska, how it increases their premiums, how it raises that cost curve \non the Federal health care expenses, the taxes on small businesses for \nthe individuals, the families, the health benefits of the police, the \nfirefighters, other public protective service people who put their \nlives on the line for so many. These are the things about which, \nunfortunately, we might not be getting the full picture.\n  Our colleagues on the other side have claimed that health care \ncoverage will be expanded. Again, let's go to our nonpartisan \nentities--the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation. The average \npremium per person, if you purchase in the individual market, is going \nto be 10 to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the average premium under \ncurrent law. That tells you if these Federal scorekeepers are correct, \nyour premiums are going to go up under this health bill if you buy \ninsurance yourself.\n  In Alaska, according to ISER--again, the Institute for Social and \nEconomic Research--you have about 28,000 Alaskans who would pay 12 \npercent more for their premiums. It is going to cost an individual in \nmy State an extra $1,100 per year and a family in my State nearly \n$3,000 more per year for the coverage by 2016.\n  Again, you have to ask the question: Is health care expanding? This \nbill forces you to purchase federally approved health care; otherwise, \nyou have to pay the penalty of $750 or 2 percent of your income if you \nearn more than $37,500.\n  If you look at Alaska's population, this is going to bring in more \nthan 50 percent of Alaska's population who are going to be penalized if \nthey fail to have health insurance. Again, you ask the question: Is \nhealth care coverage going to be expanded?\n  Since the law we are advancing is going to require that you buy \nfederally approved health insurance, and then we are going to penalize \nyou if you do not buy it, then what you have is the heavy hand of the \nFederal Government that forces you to buy health insurance, which is \ngoing to cost about 12 percent more once this bill is enacted--12 \npercent more than it would today.\n  The Democrats will also talk about the hidden tax on families and how \nthat will go away because once this bill passes, under this bill, \neveryone is going to have coverage. Alaskans and all Americans who do \nnot get federally approved health insurance that the Federal Government \nis going to require that you have, they are going to be fined $750, 2 \npercent of your taxable income, and what the Democrats will not tell \nyou when they say health care coverage is going to be expanded or the \nhidden tax is going to go away is, those with income greater than \n$37,500--again, affecting over 50 percent of the people in my State--\nare going to be taxed a full 2 percent of their household income, once \nthe bill is fully phased in, if they do not get health insurance. It is \nthis penalty that is going to raise $15 billion to help pay for this \nbill. This is how we are paying for the bill.\n  CBO and CMS told us the taxes on medical devices--whether they are \ntongue depressors or x-rays or blood sugar meters--these are going to \nbe passed on to the individuals so you are going to be taxed for vital \nmedications and other health products. The question you then have to \nask yourself: OK, so do these hidden costs actually go away?\n  I suppose they do because they are no longer hidden. What we will \nhave done is we will have raised your premiums, we will have increased \nthe penalties on those earning more than $37,500 who did not buy into \nhealth insurance, and we will have taxed your tongue depressors and x-\nrays to pay for the bill.\n  In addition, the smallest of the small businesses are going to be \ntaxed if they do not provide insurance for their employees, and \nindividuals and couples earning over $200,000, they are going to be \npenalized because they are the higher income earners.\n  The Democrats are also telling you that as Medicare patients, they \nare going to get some good, positive things. They will get free \npreventive services. This is good. This is absolutely great. We should \nbe encouraging preventive services.\n  But as my colleague from Florida was explaining, as I mentioned, \nafter this bill passes, are any of the 13--I think we are down to only \n12 now--primary care doctors in Alaska, in the Anchorage area anyway, \naccepting new Medicare patients? We are saying we are going to provide \nthis service to you at no cost. But, again, if you can't get anybody \nwho will take you as a patient, how are we helping you? We have heard \nfrom a doctor in Anchorage. In fact, I have an opinion piece that was \npublished just this week in the Anchorage Daily News. She indicates she \nis dropping out of Medicare and she is doing it because of this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, Dec. 18, 2009]\n\n           OPINION: Doctors and Patients, Not Feds, Know Best\n\n                         (By Ilona Farr, M.D.)\n\n       I have made the heart-wrenching decision as a physician to \n     opt out of Medicare. I do so after working with Sen. Stevens, \n     Sen. Murkowski and Rep. Young for a decade in hopes we could \n     ensure seniors would be able to continue to receive medical \n     services in Alaska.\n       On a visit costing $115, Medicare pays $40, secondary \n     insurance pays $7, and the rest--$68--is a loss, not a tax \n     write-off. It takes six insurance paying patient visits to \n     offset losses from one Medicare or Medicaid patient.\n       The House health care bills, HR3590/HR3962, increase the \n     number of people not paying their share of the costs and will \n     lead doctors to opt out of Medicare or retire early.\n       Anchorage has 75 family physicians, down from 180. \n     Physician shortages like these are\n\n[[Page S13773]]\n\n     caused by government interference in the free market. \n     Government artificially keeps reimbursement rates low, \n     forcing other patients, and insurance companies, to pick up \n     the additional costs. Family practice residencies are filled \n     with foreign medical graduates because of high costs (more \n     than $200,000) associated with medical school. Low physician \n     reimbursement rates make it difficult to repay loans.\n       Medicare and Medicaid auditors are paid on commission, can \n     fine us $2,000 to $50,000 for one charting mistake or billing \n     error, and then extrapolate this over the practice and drive \n     us out of business . . . all for one minor mistake. There is \n     fraud, but this system that penalizes us severely for simple \n     errors is untenable.\n       In these bills malpractice reform is restricted, health \n     savings accounts (which help reduce costs and fraud) are \n     essentially eliminated, and taxes and fees on insurance and \n     medical services are increased. There are no Medicare/\n     Medicaid rate, rule, or audit reforms, or tax write-offs for \n     business losses.\n       One section in Sen. Harry Reid's bill says Medicare will no \n     longer pay for home health services, durable medical goods, \n     and possibly labs, X-rays, prescriptions or other services \n     written by providers who have opted out of Medicare. Many \n     talented physicians have had to opt out of Medicare (and by \n     this law must opt out of Medicaid and the military's Tricare \n     also) to stay in business. People will no longer be able to \n     see these physicians because of government financial \n     restrictions or will be forced to pay all medical bills \n     associated with these visits themselves.\n       Bills under consideration cut Medicare spending by $460 \n     billion, raise fees on medical services, increase physicians' \n     administrative burdens, promote electronic medical records \n     with mandated reporting of outcomes data, and increase \n     business costs so it will be impossible for small practices \n     to survive.\n       My decision to withdraw from Medicare was also precipitated \n     by U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's recommendation that \n     breast cancer screening mammograms should only be done on \n     women between age 50 and 74. Approximately 48 percent of my \n     patients with breast cancer developed it before age 50. Up to \n     1.2 percent of my practice, mostly young mothers, could have \n     died if this were a national guideline.\n       The Senate bill has this task force and other committees \n     determining what tests will be covered for patients. I am \n     concerned that penalties may be imposed on insurance \n     companies, and maybe providers, for going against these \n     guidelines. The Hippocratic Oath compels us to protect the \n     health of all humans throughout life, and many provisions in \n     these health care bills would cause us to violate that oath.\n       Physicians and patients (not government) should decide the \n     best, most cost-effective medical treatment for patients. \n     Government should not dictate to insurance companies or \n     providers which tests can or cannot be covered. Medicine is \n     changing too rapidly for guidelines to be made at a national \n     level.\n       I have worked in government medical facilities and in \n     private practice for the last 26 years. Physicians provide \n     timelier, less costly and more patient-oriented care if not \n     overseen by hordes of non-producing government \n     administrators.\n       I am in favor of reform, but current bills before Congress \n     will collapse our health care system and work against the \n     freedoms we are guaranteed under the Constitution. Government \n     should not be allowed to force people to purchase health \n     insurance, mandate what health care services you are allowed, \n     or increase our taxes astronomically to support a huge \n     government health care bureaucracy that will bankrupt us as \n     individuals and as a nation.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. It is no secret, in my State of Alaska and in far too \nmany States around this country, we do not have enough providers that \nwill take these individuals. ISER has said seniors in low payment \nMedicare States will be forced to wait in line. Alaska is one of two \nStates--we are, I think, second to last in terms of Medicare payments \nand where we stack up in relation to the reimbursement. ISER goes on to \nstate:\n\n       Independent of the doc fix, in Alaska the remainder of \n     seniors are at risk of long lines to see a primary care \n     doctor and overflowing to community health center and \n     hospital emergency rooms where existing capacity is highly \n     likely to be quickly overwhelmed and long wait times become \n     increasingly common.\n\n  ISER has also said that additional new insured patients are going to \nhurt Medicare beneficiaries, and they state:\n\n       Federal healthcare reform applied to Alaska likely will \n     exacerbate an already very challenging situation for Alaska's \n     seniors as baby boomers age into Medicare and finding \n     themselves waiting in line behind a rapidly expanding line of \n     better paying private plans.\n\n  We are told 5 years from now our Medicare population is going to \nincrease by 50 percent. We cannot accommodate those who are Medicare-\neligible now. Our boom is not sustainable.\n  The CMS Actuary has said:\n\n       The Reid bill reduces payments to health care providers, \n     which is unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent basis. As \n     a result, providers could find it difficult to remain \n     profitable and absent legislative intervention, might end \n     their participation in the Medicare program.\n\n  It is happening. Doctors, providers, physicians are making those \ndecisions as we speak. They are opting out. So this is not some \ntheoretical approach to the problem. This is happening.\n  Madam President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 minutes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. If I may ask my colleague from Kansas, do I understand \nthe Senator is seeking about 10 minutes?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I want to speak about small \nbusinesses because we have all been talking about the impact to small \nbusinesses. Under this bill, as we know, small businesses are going to \nbe penalized $750 per employee if even one of their employees seeks \ngovernmental health care through Medicaid or through Federal subsidies. \nSo if you have 50 or more employees, you can be expected to pay fines \nin an amount of $750 per employee, which amounts to over $37,000 or \n$3,000 for that individual employee.\n  I think we need to put it into perspective in terms of who these \nbusinesses are. These are the solo-practitioners, like the one-lawyer \noffice or the small doctor's office. If these individuals purchase \nhealth care in the individual market, they are going to see their \npremiums go up an extra $1,160 per year for a family--nearly $3,000 \nmore in 2016.\n  Alaska is defined as a high-cost State. If you are a small business \nthat can afford to pay good health and dental benefits for your \nemployees and those benefits amount to $8,500 per individual or $23,000 \nper family, in a high-cost State such as Alaska, you look to be hit \nwith a 40-percent excise tax because you basically want to provide your \nemployees with good benefits.\n  Again, according to ISER:\n\n       Alaska is a high cost state and thus, roughly 50 percent of \n     health plans in Alaska will be subject to the tax by 2016, \n     compared to only 19 percent average in the Lower 48.\n\n  Again, by 2016, 50 percent of the plans in my State will be subject \nto this 40-percent excise tax.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter we \nreceived from the municipality of Anchorage, Police and Fire Retiree \nMedical Trust.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Municipality of Anchorage, Police & Fire Retiree Medical \n           Trust,\n                                                December 15, 2009.\n\n\n                       Plan Administrator Report\n\n       At the November 24, 2009 PFRMT board meeting I brought to \n     your attention a health care bill, HR 3590as--Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act, being considered in the \n     US Senate that contains provisions that if implement into law \n     would require that the Municipality of Anchorage (MOA) and \n     the Trust to make changes to their current business \n     practices. S 1796--America's Healthy Future Act of 2009 also \n     contains these changes and could become effective January 1, \n     2010.\n       Three provisions in the bill that are of particular concern \n     are:\n       1. Inclusion of health care benefits as taxable income to \n     employees. Not only will this increase the employee's taxable \n     income but the MOA's payroll taxes will also increase.\n       SEC. 9002. INCLUSION OF COST OF EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH \n     COVERAGE ON W-2. (p. 1996)\n       (b) EFFECTIVE DATE--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2010.\n       2. Taxation of MOA health care plans. This tax will be \n     imposed on the employer. The current MOA health plan design \n     is apt to be considered to have an ``excess benefit''. This \n     would make it subject to a 40% excise tax. There is also an \n     aggregation rule for the value of employee coverage with \n     multiple employers or retiree medical (example, veterans and \n     rehired police officers and fire fighters). If a retiree \n     would purchase MOA Health Insurance that is considered \n     excessive, the 40% excise tax would be incurred by the \n     general fund of the Medical Trust. One may argue that the tax \n     is a tax to the employer. The argument can also be made that \n     the Trust is an integral part of the Municipality. This was a \n     conclusion determined in IRS PLR-06164-96. Thus the tax would \n     be payable from the Trust general fund assets.\n       SEC. 9001. EXCISE TAX ON HIGH COST EMPLOYER-SPONSORED \n     HEALTH COVERAGE.

Under \n     the rules of this bill, these reimbursements would no longer \n     be allowed. This is a reduction in employee benefits. It is \n     also likely to encourage an increase the utilization of more \n     expensive non-OTC prescriptions, as they are a covered \n     expense.\n       SEC. 9003. DISTRIBUTIONS FOR MEDICINE QUALIFIED ONLY IF FOR \n     PRESCRIBED DRUG OR INSULIN. (p. 1997)\n       This bill contains expenses that should be considered and \n     planned for accordingly. A December 2009 press release from \n     Mercer, an HR consultancy stated,\n       Nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of employers in a recent \n     survey by Mercer say they would cut health benefits to avoid \n     paying an excise tax included in the Senate's Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act, unveiled November 18. \n     Mercer estimates that one in five employers offer health \n     coverage that would be deemed ``too generous'' and thus be \n     subject to the Act's 40 percent non-deductible tax on the \n     excess value.\n       Two letters have been sent to the MOA informing them of \n     these matters. The dates of these letters were November 25 \n     and December 5, 2009. Since then, Larry Baker, Senior Policy \n     Advisor, in the Mayor's Office informed me that the MOA's \n     benefit consultant, The Wilson Agency, affirmed that the \n     current MOA health plans are going to be subject to the 40% \n     excise tax. They are contacting Senator Begich but beyond \n     that he did not specify what the course of action was going \n     to be.\n       I recommend two points of action. Bring the PFRMT \n     membership up to date of this situation. And contact Senator \n     Begich to inform him of the negative impact that these bills \n     will have on our retired police officers' and fire fighters' \n     medical benefit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lorne Bretz,\n                                               Plan Administrator.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. The city of Anchorage is the largest city in Alaska. \nWe received this letter last week. In the letter, they cite \nspecifically three provisions in the bill that are of particular \nconcern--No. 1, inclusion of health care benefits as taxable income to \nemployees.\n  It states:\n\n       Not only will this increase the employee's taxable income \n     but the [Municipality of Anchorage's] payroll tax will also \n     increase.\n\n  The second point is the taxation of the municipality's health care \nplans.\n\n       This tax will be imposed on the employer. The current \n     [municipality] health plan design is apt to be considered to \n     have ``an excess benefit.'' This would make it subject to a \n     40% excise tax.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       There is also an aggregation rule for the value of employee \n     coverage with multiple employers or retiree medical. If a \n     retiree would purchase [the municipality's] Health Insurance \n     that is considered excessive, the 40% excise tax would be \n     incurred.\n       One may argue that the tax is a tax to the employer. The \n     argument can also be made that the Trust is an integral part \n     of the Municipality. Thus the tax would be payable from the \n     Trust general fund assets.\n\n  Their third point is:\n\n       Current municipal employees are able to be reimbursed tax \n     free from money they have placed in their flexible spending \n     account for over the counter medicine. Retired police \n     officers and firefighters also currently are allowed this \n     reimbursement as part of their medical benefit. Under the \n     rules of this bill, these reimbursements would no longer be \n     allowed. This is a reduction in employee benefits. It is also \n     likely to encourage an increase [in] the utilization of more \n     expensive non-OTC prescriptions, as they are a covered \n     expense.\n\n  There are about 400 members that are part of the Police and Fire \nRetiree Medical Trust. When they find out, as I am sure they will, that \nessentially they are going to be taxed on their plan--I think most of \nthese firefighters and police officers don't view themselves as having \naccess to a Cadillac plan. They are just firefighters and police \nofficers. But this is coming from their trust fund, expressing great \nconcern over what we have in front of us.\n  I have mentioned that we have received a copy of an opinion piece \nfrom a primary care provider in Anchorage who has outlined why she is \nopting out of the Medicare system in Alaska.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have her letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, Dec. 18, 2009]\n\n           Opinion: Doctors and Patients, Not Feds, Know Best\n\n                         (By Ilona Farr, M.D.)\n\n       I have made the heart-wrenching decision as a physician to \n     opt out of Medicare. I do so after working with Sen. Stevens, \n     Sen. Murkowski and Rep. Young for a decade in hopes we could \n     ensure seniors would be able to continue to receive medical \n     services in Alaska.\n       On a visit costing $115, Medicare pays $40, secondary \n     insurance pays $7, and the rest--$68--is a loss, not a tax \n     write-off. It takes six insurance paying patient visits to \n     offset losses from one Medicare or Medicaid patient.\n       The House health care bills, HR3590/HR3962, increase the \n     number of people not paying their share of the costs and will \n     lead doctors to opt out of Medicare or retire early.\n       Anchorage has 75 family physicians, down from 180. \n     Physician shortages like these are caused by government \n     interference in the free market. Government artificially \n     keeps reimbursement rates low, forcing other patients, and \n     insurance companies, to pick up the additional costs. Family \n     practice residencies are filled with foreign medical \n     graduates because of high costs (more than $200,000) \n     associated with medical school. Low physician reimbursement \n     rates make it difficult to repay loans.\n       Medicare and Medicaid auditors are paid on commission, can \n     fine us $2,000 to $50,000 for one charting mistake or billing \n     error, and then extrapolate this over the practice and drive \n     us out of business . . . all for one minor mistake. There is \n     fraud, but this system that penalizes us severely for simple \n     errors is untenable.\n       In these bills malpractice reform is restricted, health \n     savings accounts (which help reduce costs and fraud) are \n     essentially eliminated, and taxes and fees on insurance and \n     medical services are increased. There are no Medicare/\n     Medicaid rate, rule, or audit reforms, or tax write-offs for \n     business losses.\n       One section in Sen. Harry Reid's bill says Medicare will no \n     longer pay for home health services, durable medical goods, \n     and possibly labs, X-rays, prescriptions or other services \n     written by providers who have opted out of Medicare. Many \n     talented physicians have had to opt out of Medicare (and by \n     this law must opt out of Medicaid and the military's Tricare \n     also) to stay in business. People will no longer be able to \n     see these physicians because of government financial \n     restrictions or will be forced to pay all medical bills \n     associated with these visits themselves.\n       Bills under consideration cut Medicare spending by $460 \n     billion, raise fees on medical services, increase physicians' \n     administrative burdens, promote electronic medical records \n     with mandated reporting of outcomes data, and increase \n     business costs so it will be impossible for small practices \n     to survive.\n       My decision to withdraw from Medicare was also precipitated \n     by U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's recommendation that \n     breast cancer screening mammograms should only be done on \n     women between age 50 and 74. Approximately 48 percent of my \n     patients with breast cancer developed it before age 50. Up to \n     1.2 percent of my practice, mostly young mothers, could have \n     died if this were a national guideline.\n       The Senate bill has this task force and other committees \n     determining what tests will be covered for patients. I am \n     concerned that penalties may be imposed on insurance \n     companies, and maybe providers, for going against these \n     guidelines. The Hippocratic Oath compels us to protect the \n     health of all humans throughout life, and many provisions in \n     these health care bills would cause us to violate that oath.\n       Physicians and patients (not government) should decide the \n     best, most cost-effective medical treatment for patients. \n     Government should not dictate to insurance companies or \n     providers which tests can or cannot be covered. Medicine is \n     changing too rapidly for guidelines to be made at a national \n     level.\n       I have worked in government medical facilities and in \n     private practice for the last 26 years. Physicians provide \n     timelier, less costly and more patient-oriented care if not \n     overseen by hordes of non-producing government \n     administrators.\n       I am in favor of reform, but current bills before Congress \n     will collapse our health care system and work against the \n     freedoms we are guaranteed under the Constitution. Government \n     should not be allowed to force people to purchase health \n     insurance, mandate what health care services you are allowed, \n     or increase our taxes astronomically to support a huge \n     government health care bureaucracy that will bankrupt us as \n     individuals and as a nation.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. One of the things we don't have in this legislation is \na provision that relates to medical malpractice. It has been stated \nthat, in Alaska, you tried medical malpractice reform and we haven't \nseen the positive impacts.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement \nfrom the Alaska State Medical Association, along with an article that \nwas published in Alaska Medicine in September of 2009 entitled \n``Malpractice Relief, Lower Premiums, Tort Reform Add to Alaska's \nAppeal.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13775]]\n\n         Alaska Physicians' Group: Senator Erred on Tort Reform\n\n       Anchorage, Alaska (Dec. 21, 2009)--The Alaska State Medical \n     Association (ASMA), which represents physicians throughout \n     Alaska and is primarily concerned with the health of all \n     Alaskans, is taking issue with Sen. Mark Begich's stance on \n     medical liability reform.\n       In an interview with Fox News on Dec. 7, 2009, Alaska's \n     junior senator opined that tort reform in his home state has \n     not worked. ASMA asserts that Begich did not accurately \n     portray the facts in that nationally broadcast interview and \n     that medical liability reform in Alaska serves as a shining \n     example for the other 49 states.\n       ``Alaska's physicians have worked hard for at least the \n     last 35 years to achieve meaningful and equitable liability \n     reform measures,'' ASMA President Brion J. Beerle, MD, wrote \n     today in a letter to Sen. Begich. ``Those efforts have \n     resulted in a stable marketplace for insurers that provide \n     medical professional liability coverage to Alaska's \n     physicians at rates that are competitive.''\n       More than 90% of medical liability coverage in Alaska is \n     provided by two, not-for-profit insurers--MIEC and NORCAL--\n     that are owned by their policyholders (mutual insurers) and \n     overseen by boards of governors, all of whom are physicians, \n     with representation on those boards by Alaska physicians.\n       ``The cumulative result of the Alaska physicians'' advocacy \n     has been a success for physicians and their patients,'' \n     Beerle wrote. ``For example, according to the Medical \n     Liability Monitor Survey, 2008 premiums paid by Alaska's \n     internists average just 24% of those paid by the interests in \n     the five most expensive states; general surgeons pay about \n     25%; and obstetricians/gynecologists pay about 31%. According \n     to that same 2008 survey, the premiums for those same \n     specialties are in the lowest quartile of all states plus the \n     District of Columbia.\n       ``MIEC also has returned excess earnings to its \n     policyholders in 16 of the last 19 years; and NORCAL \n     policyholders received dividends in 12 of the last 18 years. \n     MIEC has, in addition, reduced its rates by 5% in 2009 and \n     also for 2010,'' the ASMA president added.\n       Writing on behalf of the association he leads, Beerle noted \n     that because of tort reform, premiums Alaska's physicians pay \n     for liability coverage is generally not significant in the \n     cost of operating a medical practice.\n       ``The factor that does have a material effect is the cost \n     of practicing defensive medicine,'' he wrote.\n       The American Medical Association has estimated that the \n     annual cost of the practice of defensive medicine in the \n     United States ranges from $99 billion to $179 billion.\n       ``Until medical liability reforms similar to those enacted \n     in Alaska are adopted nationwide, the additional costs of the \n     practice of defensive medicine will continue to be a driver \n     in the cost of health care in Alaska and throughout the \n     country,'' Beerle concluded.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From Alaska Medicine, Sept. 2009]\n\n                           Malpractice Relief\n\n                   (By Andrew Firth and Roger Holmes)\n\n       It is seemingly a universal truth that wherever one \n     practices in the United States, malpractice insurance costs \n     too much. But in Alaska, the average medical malpractice \n     premiums are lower than at least 35 other states, a national \n     survey shows.\n       Physicians in Alaska pay much less than their colleagues in \n     the nation's five most costly states, according to the \n     Medical Liability Monitor Survey, 2008. Premiums paid by \n     Alaska's internists average 24 percent of those paid by \n     internists in the five highest states; surgeons here pay \n     roughly 25 percent, and obstetrician/gynecologists pay about \n     31 percent. (The top five states vary by specialty.) Some of \n     the difference in cost may be societal, but part of it has to \n     do with the tort reforms that have passed, or not passed, in \n     each state.\n       In Alaska, our history is similar to many states where the \n     costs are lower. It's a state with an active medical society \n     (the Alaska State Medical Association), an engaged \n     membership, a broad coalition of providers and an enlightened \n     legislative body that recognizes the connection between \n     malpractice costs and access to care.\n       In 1975, Alaskan physicians suddenly were confronted with a \n     disappearing market for medical malpractice insurance. The \n     Legislature stepped in and created the Medical Indemnity \n     Corporation of Alaska (MICA), a quasi-state agency funded \n     with state money but run by a private board of directors \n     appointed by the governor. At the same time, the Legislature \n     modified the law governing medical malpractice claims. Among \n     the key changes:\n       The burden of proof was codified, making it clear that a \n     practitioner could only be judged against those in the same \n     field or specialty.\n       Res ipso loquitur, a legal doctrine that switched the \n     burden of proof to the health-care provider in certain \n     instances, was abolished.\n       The law required that juries be told that injury alone does \n     not raise a presumption of negligence or misconduct.\n       Plaintiffs were prohibited from filing inflammatory \n     pleadings asking for millions of dollars.\n       The law of informed consent was codified.\n       The law prohibited claims that a health-care provider had \n     orally agreed to achieve a specific medical result.\n       Plaintiffs were prohibited from obtaining a recovery for \n     sums that had been paid by collateral sources, except for a \n     select few federal programs that must, by law, seek \n     reimbursement.\n       During the 1970s and '80s physicians encountered rising and \n     falling malpractice costs as the insurance cycle reacted to \n     changing claim experience in Alaska and elsewhere, \n     culminating in the departure of several medical professional \n     liability (MPL) insurers in the late 1990s.\n       In the mid-1990s, the Alaska State Medical Association and \n     several MPL insurers joined with the Alaska State Hospital \n     and Nursing Home Association, Providence Hospital and the \n     business community to press for additional tort reforms. The \n     result was the 1997 Tort Reform Act.\n       Among its achievements was a cap on non-economic damages of \n     $400,000 except in cases of severe disfigurement or severe \n     permanent impairment, in which the cap rises to $1 million.\n       Punitive damages were limited, and the standards for \n     awarding them were tightened. Prejudgment interest was tied \n     to the federal discount rate--Alaska's current rate is 3.25 \n     percent. Joint and several liability was abolished in favor \n     of comparative fault, in which each party is responsible only \n     for its percentage share of the total fault. And parties were \n     prohibited from using experts in medical malpractice cases \n     unless the expert is licensed, trained and experienced in the \n     same discipline or school of practice as the physician and \n     certified by a recognized board.\n       A coalition called Alaskans for Access to Health Care--\n     comprising ASMA, Alaska Physicians & Surgeons, the hospital \n     association and Providence--went back to the Legislature in \n     2005 and argued for an even lower non-economic damage cap for \n     health-care providers. The result was a limit of $250,000 in \n     all cases except when damages are awarded for wrongful death \n     or a severe permanent physical impairment that is more that \n     70 percent disabling. For those, the limit is $400,000.\n       Since then, Alaska has enjoyed a stable malpractice \n     climate, with both of its major insurance carriers reducing \n     rates and/or returning profits through dividend \n     distributions.\n       The caps make a big difference. For example, NORCAL Mutual, \n     which writes policies in Alaska and California, also does \n     business in Rhode Island, which does not limit non-economic \n     damages in malpractice cases.\n       ``Most rates for physicians with at least three years' \n     practice experience (mature rates) in Rhode Island are at \n     least double the mature rates for physicians in Alaska,'' \n     NORCAL Marketing and Communications Manager Brent Samodurov \n     wrote in an e-mail to Alaska Medicine. ``For several medical \n     specialties NORCAL Mutual's rates for Rhode Island are nearly \n     triple those for Alaska.''\n\n\n                              MPL carriers\n\n       There are two major MPL insurers in Alaska: MIEC and \n     NORCAL. Both companies are owned by their policyholders \n     (mutual insurers) and are overseen by a board of governors \n     consisting of physicians.\n       MIEC came to Alaska in 1978 and is sponsored by ASMA. \n     NORCAL became active in 1991 after it purchased MICA.\n       According to data published by the National Association of \n     Insurance Commissioners, MIEC wrote 69.7 percent of all \n     medical malpractice premiums for physicians in the state \n     during 2008 and NORCAL wrote 23.4 percent. Ten other carriers \n     shared the remaining 6.9 percent of the market.\n       Typical of these types of policyholder-owned companies, \n     both MIEC and NORCAL have a long history of returning profits \n     to policyholders through dividend distributions:\n       NORCAL's Alaska clients have received dividends in 12 of \n     the past 18 years, the most recent amounting to 12 percent of \n     each eligible policyholder's premium as of Sept. 30, 2008, \n     according to Samodurov. He noted: ``Dividends declared are \n     directly related to the company's loss experience in each \n     state.''\n       MIEC has a similar record of returning profits to its \n     Alaska members. MIEC policyholders have received dividends in \n     16 of the past 19 years in amounts that average 28.8 percent \n     of basic premiums (for $1 million/$3 million limits) in each \n     one of the past 19 years.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. The bottom line is from the Alaska State Medical \nAssociation:\n\n       The cumulative result of Alaska physicians' advocacy has \n     been a success for physicians and their patients.\n\n  Again, we have seen the positive impact in Alaska because of the laws \nwe have passed. It is unfortunate that we didn't take that opportunity \nas we dealt with health care reform these past many months.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                December 21, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to express our strong \n     opposition to language contained in the Manager's Amendment \n     to H.R. 3590, which excludes the construction industry from \n     the small business exemption contained in the bill. We regret \n     that this is our first opportunity to address this issue, \n     though the\n\n[[Page S13776]]\n\n     fact that the Manager's Amendment was made public less than \n     two days before the first vote on the matter has increased \n     the difficulty of playing a constructive role in the \n     legislative process.\n       In recognition of the negative impact that a mandate to \n     provide health insurance will have on employers, H.R. 3590 \n     exempts employers with fewer than 50 employees from the fines \n     levied on those who cannot afford to provide their employees \n     with the federal minimum standard of health insurance. \n     However, the Manager's Amendment singles out the construction \n     industry by altering the exemption so that it applies to only \n     those firms with fewer than 5 employees.\n       This narrowly focused provision is an unprecedented assault \n     on our industry, and the men and women who every day make the \n     bold decision to strike out on their own by starting a \n     business. Our members' benefit packages reflect the reality \n     of their business models, and they proudly offer the best \n     health insurance coverage that they can afford. It is \n     unreasonable to presume that small business owners can bear \n     the increased cost of these new benefits simply because \n     Congress mandates that they do so.\n       In the real world, where the rhetoric surrounding this \n     legislation will meet the stark reality of the employer \n     struggling to make payroll, this special interest carve out \n     is simply another bill to pay in an industry that, with an \n     unemployment rate exceeding 18% and more than $200 billion in \n     economic activity lost in the past year, already is \n     struggling to survive.\n       And, we would be remiss if we failed to question the \n     justification for singling out the construction industry to \n     bear such a burden. We are unaware of any data or evidence \n     that suggests that the needs and struggles of a construction \n     contractor with fewer than 50 employees are so different from \n     those of small business owners in other industries, and \n     absent such convincing evidence, we are left to assume that \n     this specific provision is merely a political payoff to \n     satisfy the desires of a small constituency.\n       As Congress moves forward in the legislative process for \n     H.R. 3590, we strongly encourage you to address this onerous \n     provision that needlessly singles out small construction \n     industry employers.\n           Sincerely,\n       Air Conditioning Contractors of America, American Institute \n     of Architects, Associated Builders and Contractors, \n     Associated Equipment Distributors, Associated General \n     Contractors, Association of Equipment Manufacturers, \n     Independent Electrical Contractors, National Association of \n     Home Builders.

The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I am glad to join my colleagues in \ntalking about the health care bill. If you looked in the New York Times \ntoday, there was a full-page ad describing the bill. I am putting it up \nhere, the same thing that was in the New York Times today. It starts \nwith the question, I want to receive care from my doctor. This, on one \npage, puts the 2,600 pages in kind of what you are going to see with \nthis bill. It is convoluted. It is difficult. It is expensive. This is \nwhat you are going to get. This was in the New York Times today. This \nis where I sit or this is what is going to happen to me in this overall \nsystem. It is no wonder the American public doesn't want this. They are \nnot excited about this. They are not excited about what it is going to \ndo to the budget--$2.5 trillion. That is about $700 million a day, if \nyou are counting in millions a day as one way to look at it.\n  There are some interesting things hidden within the bill. One of the \nthings I want to point out is the transfer of wealth from young people \nto old. One of the things that has really bugged me about what we have \ndone in so many of the government systems here--it has been a wealth \ntransfer from younger people to older.\n  Several of my children are students and working part-time jobs, and \nthey are paying payroll taxes. They say: What is this payroll tax going \nto? I say: Well, talk to your grandparents and tell them to say thank \nyou to you. These are funds collected that are going to pay for their \nretirement funds. They do, and the grandparents say thank you. But it \ndoesn't seem to be satisfying to them because they are saying: Why \naren't I putting this in something I am saving money for me so that I \ncan have something later on instead of this sort of, OK, I am paying \nand they are getting. What is going to be there when I get there?\n  That sort of wealth transfer from young people to old people \ncontinues in this bill. Look at this wealth transfer. Younger workers \nwill pay more for health insurance premiums so that older workers can \npay less. Their cost at age 25 will go up 25 percent for health \ninsurance premiums. If you are 64, it will go down 20 percent for \nhealth care. This is another one of the wealth transfers that take \nplace. It isn't right. It is taking from the kids. It is taking from \nthe grandkids. It should not be continued. It is continued in this \nbill.\n  You can look at it another way: Subsidies in this bill go \ndisproportionately to older Americans. Average subsidies for the 55-\nyear-olds are nearly 10 times that of a 25-year-old. A 25-year-old gets \na subsidy of $458, a 55-year-old gets a subsidy of $4,427--another \nwealth transfer from younger to older.\n  Then you can look at the claims in this bill that there are going to \nbe tax cuts for the middle class. That is if you are in the lucky \ngroup. For every low-to-middle-income family with a tax cut, three low-\nto-middle-income families have a tax increase in this bill by the \nstructure of this bill, by this structure, this convoluted, difficult-\nto-navigate, hard-to-understand, expensive, $2.5 trillion structure.\n  That is where we stand. Likely to pass this body and then go to the \nHouse of Representatives where there is a major issue that is still \nbrewing, difficult, and must be dealt with, and that is the issue of \npublic funding of abortion that is in this bill.\n  If you want to cut some of the cost out of this thing, why don't you \ntake some of those expenses out of this. That would be one way to cut \nback some of the expenses. But in the House bill, they included Stupak \nlanguage which continued the Hyde tradition and law of the land that \nthe government will not pay for abortions other than cases of rape, \nincest, and life of the mother. Except now buried in the Senate bill, \nin the Reid amendment, is the public funding of abortion, which we \nhaven't done for years.\n  Yesterday I talked to both Congressman Stupak and Senator Nelson. \nThey both agree that the Stupak language is far superior. It doesn't \npublicly fund abortions, whereas what is in this bill now does. You \ndon't need to take my word. Here is what others have said. The U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops, who want a health care bill but are \nopposed to the public funding of abortion and opposed to abortion, say:\n\n       The bill is morally unacceptable unless and until it \n     complies with longstanding current laws on abortion funding \n     such as the Hyde amendment.\n\n  We voted on this floor for the Nelson-Hatch amendment which is now \nnot in the bill.\n  You don't have to take that. You can take Bart Stupak, Democrat from \nMichigan, who voted for the bill in the House. He says:\n\n       It is now not acceptable. A dramatic shift in Federal \n     policy that would allow the Federal Government to subsidize \n     insurance policies with abortion coverage.\n\n  The American public doesn't want that either. The latest poll of \nDecember 22 shows that 72 percent of Americans oppose using any public \nmoney in the health care overhaul to pay for abortion, including 54 \npercent of Democrats and 74 percent of Independents. That is where they \nare. That is where the public is.\n  National Right to Life, which is the gold standard on standing up for \nlife, says:\n\n       The Reid managers amendment requires that all enrollees in \n     an abortion covering plan make a separate payment into an \n     account that will pay for abortions. The bill also contains \n     language that is intended to prevent or discourage any \n     insurer from explaining what this surcharge is to be used \n     for. Moreover, there is nothing in the language to suggest \n     that payment of the abortion charge is optional for any \n     enrollee.\n\n  This base bill has another thing in it: It takes the individual opt-\nout and moves to it a State opt-out. So while let's say Kansas may opt \nout of the abortion funding in the bill, they still have to pay their \ntaxes that go to another State to pay for abortions there which are \nequally offensive to my people or other States that don't want to see \nthis funding take place.\n  It doesn't address the issue of having preventive services include \nabortion. There was discussion that we are not going to include \npreventive services in it, but that is not in the language. There was \ndiscussion. We tried an amendment. That is not there. It can still be \ndefined. Now it may ultimately\n\n[[Page S13777]]\n\nunwind the entire bill based upon the funding of abortion that is in \nthe Senate bill. It will be up to House Members, a number of whom are \nvery concerned and quite fired up about this particular piece, to take \nthis out. I know Congressman Stupak is working to do that, wants to see \nthat done, agrees with Senator Nelson that his language is far \nsuperior, actually does that. It is supported by the Catholic Bishops, \nthe National Right to Life, and other pro-life groups that say the way \nto go is the Stupak language.\n  It is not what is in the Senate bill. The Senate bill will actually \nfund abortions. Then we go through the specifics, as I have in here, of \nthe various places that it has. I met with Senator Nelson about those \nspecifics. I have addressed a number of those concerns. I know he \ncontinues to work on it, but at the end of the day this is one of those \nbabies you cannot split. You need to have the Stupak language in this \nbill. I am afraid at the end of the day that is not going to be in \nthere. I know Congressman Stupak is pushing very hard for its \ninclusion, and I wish him all the best.\n  If this legislation passes this body, it is going to be up to the \nHouse of Representatives to put in that Stupak language. And they can \ndo it. It is my hope they will do it. I do not think the overall bill \nshould be passed, but certainly you should not have this piece of \nfunding in this bill, in breaking the longstanding work we have had in \nthe Hyde agreement, in the Hyde language.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President. How much time do we have \nremaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, in that concluding minute, what I \nwould like to briefly speak about is the overall process.\n  I think there are people in this body who did not want to include \nthings such as abortion funding in the bill. But when you operate in a \nclosed process like this, these sorts of things end up happening \nbecause the people who work on these issues are excluded. I certainly \nwas not consulted. I am not saying anyone said: Well, look, we are not \ngoing to get your vote anyway, so we do not need to have it. But if you \ndo not want to have abortion funding in it, one should look past that \nand say: Let's get the people who understand and work on this issue--\nand we agree, we should not have it in there; that is what President \nObama said; it should not be in there--and let's see what language \npasses by their muster.\n  That was not done. Unfortunately, that is part of what has happened \nin this process. I think it is tragic that it has happened that way in \nthis process. I think it is wrong. I think it builds a bill that then \npeople are not satisfied with, and certainly a process they do not \nagree with that takes place in this overall bill.\n  It is still not too late. There is still time to address these \nissues, now that we have the bill to be able to look at. If people of \ngood faith on the other side want to get these addressed, there are \nways, and we have the language on how to address it. It is called the \nStupak language. It has already passed the House of Representatives. It \nis called the Nelson-Hatch amendment that was debated here, although it \nwas not passed. We can do that. It is important that it get done.\n  This bill is not supported by the American public, and particularly \nthis funding piece that is so offensive to so many Americans. We can \ndebate about abortion, but the government should not be funding it, and \nthat is agreed to by over 70 percent of the American public.\n  I just ask my colleagues on the other side, as you move on forward \nwith this--if this bill passes here--take this piece out. We know what \nlanguage is agreed to and works. This piece can be taken out. It can be \ntaken out yet. And I think the whole bill may unwind if it is not taken \nout--unwind because of a number of Democrats who voted for the bill on \nthe House side who want the Stupak language, and they do not want the \ninferior language that was put in on the Senate side that will actually \nallow and start the funding of abortion, that we have not done for 30 \nyears.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, My Friend, Senator Casey, just a few \nmoments ago repeated the frequent claim made by members on the other \nside of the aisle that the health care bill provides a $40 billion net \ntax cut.\n  As I demonstrated in a speech earlier today, this claim is inaccurate \nand does nothing to address the fact that millions of middle-class \nAmericans will see a tax increase.\n  I have consistently given my Democratic friends credit for providing \na significant benefit to help people buy insurance.\n  This beneficiary class, however, is small.\n  At the same time there are 78 million individuals, families, and \nsingle parents who will see a tax increase.\n  Seventy-three million of them are below $200,000.\n  It is only because the subsidy for this small group is so large--and \nrefundable--that there is a net tax benefit.\n  For example, the average subsidy is close to $8,000. Around 13.2 \nmillion individuals and families receive this subsidy.\n  But the data also shows that there is a group of 73 million middle-\nclass Americans who will pay on average $710 more in taxes.\n  My Democratic colleagues want to say that since the cost of providing \nan average tax benefit of $8,000 to 13.2 million individuals and \nfamilies is greater than the revenue raised by raising the taxes on 73 \nmillion individuals and families by $710 there is a net tax decrease.\n  The truth is individuals who are seeing a tax increase are not \nactually benefiting from the very large subsidy. This is because, in \ngeneral, this group isn't even eligible for the subsidy.\n  It comes back to this: a small group of Americans benefit under this \nbill. Another group of Americans pay higher taxes. These Americans \ninclude middle-income individuals and families.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to speak on my amendment to the \nReid health care bill that would add an expedited judicial review \nprovision to the legislation. It would provide a mechanism for the \ncourts expeditiously to handle any future constitutional challenges to \nthis legislation.\n  Make no mistake. I strongly oppose this Federal takeover of our \nhealth care system. I do so for a host of important and serious policy \nreasons. I believe it is bad for our country, but I also oppose it \nbecause I believe some of its core provisions are unconstitutional, \nundermining the Constitution and the liberty that it makes possible.\n  I have argued for months that the constitutional problems with this \nlegislation include the requirement that individuals obtain a certain \nlevel of health insurance and the differential State-by-State taxation \nof high cost insurance plans. Other scholars and commentators have \nargued that restrictions on the ability of insurance providers to make \nrisk-adjusted decisions about coverage and premiums amount to a taking \nof private property in violation of the fifth amendment. Others have \nsaid that requiring States to pass legislation creating health benefit \nexchanges exceeds Congress's power in our Federal-State system.\n  I do not necessarily believe that each of these constitutional \narguments is as substantive or as persuasive as the next. Some may \nagree with this one or that one, all of them, or none at all. These and \nother arguments, however, are real, substantive, and many of them are \nas yet untested by the courts because this legislation goes so far \nbeyond anything the Federal Government has ever attempted. These and \nother issues very well may be the basis for litigation against this \nlegislation. Therefore, I think it is in everyone's interest to provide \na mechanism for future constitutional challenges to be handled \nexpeditiously by the courts.\n  The supporters of this legislation, those who are so confident that \nno conceivable constitutional argument has any merit whatsoever, should \nbe the strongest supporters of this amendment. More than anyone, they \nwould want to eliminate as quickly as possible anything that could \ndelay or prevent full implementation of this legislation. Frankly, I am \nsurprised that they are not the ones offering this amendment and I hope \nthey will support it.\n  Madam President, I now wish to speak about my amendment No. 3294. My \namendment would ensure that all Americans would be able to keep the \nhealth care coverage they already have.\n\n[[Page S13778]]\n\n  My amendment is simple. If adopted, it would ensure that the \nimplementation of the Democrat's health care bill shall be conditioned \non the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifying to Congress \nthat this legislation would not cause more than 1,000,000 Americans to \nsee higher premiums as compared to projections under current law.\n  This amendment would ensure that this $2.5 trillion tax-and-spend \nbill would not go into effect if the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices finds that it would actually raise health insurance premiums \nfor more than 1 million Americans compared to projections under current \nlaw contrary to the promise made by President Obama that health care \nreform would result in average savings of $2,500 per family.\n  One of the major reasons for enacting health care reform is to ensure \nthat we control rising health care costs that continue to put \nincreasing pressure on American families and small businesses. However, \naccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the premiums \nunder this bill would actually rise for Americans purchasing insurance \non their own by as much as 13 percent and will continue to rise at \ndouble the rate of inflation for both the small group and large group \nmarkets.\n  Spending $2.5 trillion of hard-earned taxpayer dollars on a system \nthat already spends almost $2.2 trillion a year without any impact on \ncontrolling health care premiums should be unacceptable to every \nAmerican.\n  Madam President, I also wish to speak to my amendment No. 3296 to \nH.R. 3590, the health care reform legislation. This amendment isn't \ncomplicated. It would prevent the provisions of the bill from taking \neffect in the event that it imposes unfunded mandates on the States. As \nwe all know, this legislation imposes significant new burdens on the \nStates and the proposed funding for this program is, in some cases, \nlikely to fall short. Simply put, the Congress should not impose upon \nthe States new Federal policy requirements without ensuring they are \nadequately reimbursed. In the event that Congress does not provide full \nfunding for these programs, my amendment would ensure that none of the \nnew mandates will be binding on the States.\n\n\n                    medicaid pharmacy reimbursement\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I would like to engage my colleague, the distinguished \nSenate Finance Committee chairman, in a short colloquy regarding the \nMedicaid pharmacy reimbursement provisions in the Senate health care \nreform bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would be happy to engage Senator Lincoln in a colloquy. \nI commend her for all her leadership over the years on this issue, \nbecause she recognizes that it is important to reimburse pharmacies \nadequately for the generic medications they dispense to Medicaid \npatients. In rural States like ours, Medicaid patients need access to \ntheir community pharmacies to obtain their medications. Sometimes \ncommunity pharmacies are the only health care providers for many miles. \nSo, it is important that we permanently fix in this health care reform \nbill the problems for pharmacies caused by the severe reimbursement \ncuts from the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my colleague and agree with him. That is why I \nask him the purpose behind the language in the bill that would \nestablish the Federal upper limit for generics at no less than 175 \npercent of the weighted-average average manufacturer price. I know this \namount is less than the chairman originally proposed in the Medicaid \nFair Drug Payment Act from last Congress, which I cosponsored. However, \nin what cases would it be the intent of the intent of the chairman that \nthe Federal upper limit would be set at more than 175 percent? I am \nparticularly concerned about my small independent pharmacies in \nArkansas that fill a significant number of Medicaid prescriptions. \nWould it be the intent to set a higher rate for these pharmacies? Would \nit be the intent to set a higher rate for generics that might be in \nshort supply or for which there are availability problems to encourage \nmore manufacturers to make them?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would say to my colleague that the language indicating \nthat the Secretary could set the Federal upper limit at no less than \n175 percent the weighted average average manufacturer price could be \nused in those types of circumstances. It would give the Secretary \nflexibility to set the Federal upper limits in cases where there is a \nneed to provide states with a higher match in order to assure that \nappropriate payment is made to pharmacies to encourage the use of \ngeneric drugs.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the chairman for his insights into this \nprovision and his work on behalf of our Nation's community pharmacies.\n\n\n                      WISCONSIN'S MEDICAID PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise to discuss language in the Reid \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 3590 that would have a dramatic effect on \nWisconsin's Medicaid Program. I would like to converse about this with \ntwo of my distinguished colleagues--the other Senator from my home \nState of Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, and Senator Baucus, chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee.\n  I commend Senator Baucus's long and hard work in crafting this \nhistorical piece of legislation, and today, I seek clarification of one \npiece of this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I also seek clarification of this piece of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, specifically in section 2001, \nregarding the definition of individuals that would be considered newly \neligible under Medicaid.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. I would be pleased to enter into a \ncolloquy with the Senators from Wisconsin on this subject.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator. Section 2001 of the legislation \ndescribes which individuals in each State will be deemed ``newly \neligible'' for Medicaid. It is my understanding that the Federal \nGovernment will provide 100 percent of the funds to cover this group of \nnewly eligibles from 2014 to 2016 and that States will be provided with \ntheir current law FMAP rates, which are below 100 percent, for \nindividuals already covered. Is this correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator for the question. Yes, that is \ncorrect, and it is my understanding of the legislation as well.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator. As the Senator knows, to be \nconsidered ``newly eligible'' under this bill, individuals must not be \neligible under the State plan or under a waiver of the plan for full \nbenefits or for benchmark coverage as described in section 1937 of the \nSocial Security Act. Two of the benefits that must be incorporated into \nbenchmark coverage under section 1937 of the Social Security Act are \nmental health and substance use disorder services, and prescription \ndrug coverage. If these two benefits are not offered at all, then the \ncoverage will not count as benchmark coverage.\n  Mr. KOHL. As my two colleagues are aware, Wisconsin currently \nprovides coverage for a number of individuals under a Medicaid waiver, \nbut this coverage does not meet the requirements for benchmark or \nbenchmark-equivalent coverage under the Social Security Act. The \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Federal agency that \noversees Medicaid, has confirmed this for us. Senator Feingold and I \nunderstand that, because of this, the individuals in Wisconsin who do \nnot receive benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage will be \nconsidered newly eligible, and therefore Wisconsin will receive 100 \npercent Federal funds for those individuals in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Is \nthis the Senator's understanding of the legislation as well?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/22/senate-section/article/S13778-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13778-S13779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE EXEMPTION\n\n  Mr. CASEY. May I ask the Senator from Iowa to yield for a question \nabout the managers' amendment, amendment 3276, to amendment 2786 to \nH.R. 3590?\n  Mr. HARKIN: Of course.\n  Mr. CASEY. Chairman Harkin, the managers' amendment includes a \nreligious conscience exemption from the individual requirement to \nmaintain minimum essential coverage in section 1501. Is it the intent \nof the managers that this exemption apply to an individual who is a \nmember of recognized religious sect described in Internal Revenue Code \nsection 1402(g) regardless of employment status?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, the intent of the religious exemption is to focus on \nan individual who is a member of a religious\n\n[[Page S13779]]\n\nsect described in 1402(g) and who is an adherent of the teachings of \nthat sect notwithstanding his or her employment status.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the chairman. So, for example, an Amish person \nworking in a factory or store for a non-Amish employer and meeting the \n1402(g) requirements would not be required to obtain insurance coverage \nagainst his or her religious convictions?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is correct. The managers' amendment creates a \nclear bright line exemption for individuals described in 1402(g). This \nreligious conscience exemption applies whether one is unemployed, a \nself-employed Amish person, an Amish person working for an Amish \nemployer, or an Amish person working for a non-Amish employer.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Senator for that clarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to take a few minutes, if I may, \nthis evening to speak about what this health care bill means to my \nconstituents in Connecticut. I say to the Presiding Officer, the \nbenefits to our States are very similar in many ways, but, obviously, \nwe like to point out what this particularly means in our own respective \njurisdictions that we represent.\n  But before doing so, I want to take a few minutes, if I could, \nbecause, again, tomorrow will be a short day, and then there are the \nvotes, apparently, that we are going to have Thursday, and then we will \nbe leaving the Senate for a number of weeks before we return in mid-\nJanuary, and it might not be possible tomorrow or in the very early \nhours of Christmas Eve to say a special thanks to the people who work \nwith our offices in this Chamber, both on the minority side and the \nmajority side, who rarely get the kind of recognition they deserve.\n  I have tried periodically over the years to make sure that as to the \nconsideration of every major bill we talk about the staff and what they \nhave done. So I want to take a couple minutes and identify people with \nwhom I have worked. This not an inclusive list. There are many more \npeople who work for individual Senators who have done outstanding work. \nOur floor staff here, both on the majority side and the minority side, \ndo a remarkable job and have great patience with all of us. I am very \ngrateful to them, as well as for the jobs they perform.\n  I want to take a few minutes and recognize the people I have worked \nvery closely with over the last--well, intensely--over the last almost \nyear now on this issue.\n  Certainly in Senator Reid's office, the majority leader's office, \nKate Leone, Carolyn Gluck, Jacqueline Lampert and Randy Devalk deserve \na great deal of credit. All of us know them and how much they have been \ninvolved in this issue.\n  And for those of us who serve in our caucus, we have listened to Kate \nLeone on numerous occasions go over the details of these bills, answer \nthe questions Members have raised about the importance of the \nlegislation. So to the members of Senator Reid's staff--and, obviously, \nthere are a lot more people in his office who deserve recognition--but \nI want to particularly recognize these four individuals with whom we \nhave worked very closely.\n  Senator Kennedy, as we all know, was such a lion of this institution \nand cared so deeply about this issue. Over the years, he attracted some \nwonderful people to work with him, as he fought year in and year out to \nbring us to the moment we are about to enjoy; and that is, to see some \nnational health care legislation adopted for the very first time.\n  Michael Myers had worked on this issue for a number of years for \nSenator Kennedy, and still is here working with Senator Harkin now as \npart of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  Mark Childress, again, worked for the majority leader, worked for Tom \nDaschle, has worked for others in this body, and has just done a \nfantastic job. He stayed on at my request and the request of Leader \nReid to help us work on this issue. He was involved with the White \nHouse as well, and really understood the substance of this bill as well \nas the political navigation that was necessary to bring us to this \nmoment.\n  I thank Pam Smith as well for her fine work for Senator Harkin. \nJenelle Krishnamoorthy made a wonderful contribution. She worked \nclosely with Senator Harkin, and I want to thank her. Connie Garner was \nresponsible, for many years, working on the CLASS Act, which is a part \nof our bill. Portia Wu and David Bowen did a remarkable job. John \nMcDonough and Topher Spiro, as well, are individuals who certainly made \na significant contribution to our product her.\n  Senator Baucus's staff: Liz Fowler, Bill Dauster, Russ Sullivan, \nCathy Koch, Yvette Fontenot, David Schwartz, Neleen Eisinger, Chris \nDawe, Shawn Bishop, and Kelly Whitener--I want to thank them for their \nefforts as well.\n  Again, we could give separate remarks about each of these individuals \nand their contributions.\n  In my office, again, like others, I have been blessed with some \nwonderful people. Jim Fenton is my legislative director and has done a \nterrific job. Tamar Magarik Haro, who is sitting with me on the floor \nthis evening--I know we are not supposed to recognize people other than \nMembers--along with Jeremy Sharp, they have just done a wonderful, \nwonderful job, and I know all of my colleagues have gotten to know both \nof them because of their work.\n  Monica Feit, Joe Caldwell, Bryan DeAngelis, Andy Barr, Lia Lopez, \nDaniel Barlava, and Rachael Holt all have made wonderful contributions \nas well.\n  Senate legislative counsel, with special thanks to Bill Baird, who \nwas present throughout the entire HELP Committee consideration, has \ngone way above and beyond. And legislative counsel never gets the kind \nof recognition they deserve.\n  They do a tremendous job in drafting the actual legislation. Once \nthese ideas are developed, then they require legislative language to be \nwritten.\n  From the administration, Nancy Ann DeParle, whom all of us have \ngotten to know very well; Jeanne Lambrew--I\n\n[[Page S13780]]\n\nwant to give a special thanks to Jeanne. She has been just incredible \nin terms of her encyclopedic knowledge of the issues, working very \nclosely with our staffs. Again, individuals who may not be well known \nto the public, but when this bill becomes law, these are the \nindividuals who deserve special credit for their tremendous work.\n  Mike Hash, Lauren Aronson, Secretary Sebelius, Kathleen Sebelius, who \nleft the governorship of Kansas to come here to be head of the Health \nand Human Services agency and has done a magnificent job in her new \ncapacity; Jim Messina, who worked with Max Baucus for years up here and \nhas been the Deputy Chief of Staff at the White House and has done a \ntremendous job. Phil Schilliro and Shawn Maher both worked to represent \nthe administration and their Legislative Affairs Office and they do a \ngreat job; Dana Singiser as well, for her work.\n  We will make this list available for the Record. I wanted to thank \nthese individuals again for their fine work.\n  I wish to speak, if I can today, not in my capacity as a senior \nmember of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee nor in \nmy capacity as one of the coauthors of the underlying legislation, but \nrather in my capacity, as I said at the outset, as a Senator \nrepresenting 3.5 million residents of the State of Connecticut. Our \nneighboring State, my good friend and colleague, the Senator from New \nHampshire, the Presiding Officer, represents New England.\n  If you travel my State, you will meet some of the world's most \ntalented and dedicated health care professionals. You will tour some of \nthe Nation's finest hospitals where patients get world-class treatment. \nBut you will also hear some heartbreaking stories from people in my \nState who come from middle-class families who have lost everything--\ntheir homes, their life's savings, their hope for the future--just \nbecause someone in their family got sick. They needed special care. You \nwill meet hard-working men and women who have seen their insurance \npremiums skyrocket over the last decade from around $6,000 for a family \nof four to over $12,000 annually for that same family, and they wonder \nhow much longer they will be able to continue to afford the coverage \nthey have. You will meet small business owners facing an impossible \nchoice between cutting off health care benefits to their employees or \nlaying off those workers.\n  I have talked specifically about constituents of mine, small \nbusinesspeople who literally have been faced with that choice or who \nhave had employees who dreaded having to leave the job they had because \nthere were no health care benefits. They took reductions in pay because \nthey just couldn't stay given the health conditions of their family. \nHaving to leave a job they had for 20 years or more to find new work \nwhere there was health care coverage; leaving a job they loved for less \npay because they weren't able to get that health care coverage--not \nbecause their employer didn't want to give it to them but because that \nsmall employer just could not afford to do so and stay in business. \nEven those who are healthy in my State, who have insurance, there is \nthat worry as well.\n  What I have described is not an irrational fear they have that \nsomeone in their family will lose their job that provides the coverage \nas I just described, worrying about that child who may develop an \nillness not covered by their policies, or worrying about no matter how \nmuch they pay in premiums their insurance doesn't allow them to be sure \nof anything at all.\n  The residents of my State understand the status quo is no longer \nsustainable because the so-called status quo threatens the basic \neconomic security of every family in my State, as it does across this \ncountry. They and their fellow Americans in all 50 States sent us here \nto take action, and it is action that we shall take.\n  When this bill becomes law, the people of my State will begin to reap \nthe benefits right away. One in four of my constituents have high blood \npressure. One in four teens suffers from diabetes in Connecticut. \nToday, insurance companies can use these preexisting conditions, along \nwith many others, as an excuse to deny these people coverage. \nImmediately, young people in our State and across the country will be \nprotected against these preexisting conditions to receive the coverage \nthey need. Beginning 90 days after this bill becomes law, every \nuninsured resident of my State who has been denied coverage because of \na preexisting condition will be able to find the affordable coverage \nthey need to treat that condition.\n  Small businesses make up more than three and four businesses in the \nState of Connecticut, but today only one-half of them are able to offer \nhealth benefits to their workers. Beginning in 2010, next year, some \n37,000 small businesses in my State, as well as others across the \nnation, will be eligible for tax credits to make those benefits more \naffordable. A 50-percent tax break, $40 billion in this bill, is \nprovided specifically for that purpose: to assist the 37,000 small \nbusinesses in Connecticut, and others across the country, to get a tax \ncredit, as much as 50 percent, to allow them to defer or reduce the \ncost of health insurance for their employees.\n  Small business owners throughout Connecticut have experienced \npersistent annual increases in premiums. In recent years--and this is \ntrue across the country, but certainly true in my State--it is not \nuncommon for small business owners to be told they have to pay 20 \npercent or more for the same insurance they had the previous year.\n  So the bill we are about to pass will empower the State insurance \nexchanges such as the one we will have in Connecticut in 2014 to deny \ninsurers access to the exchange if they engage in consumer price \ngouging in the next few years. That is going to be critically \nimportant. For the more than half million seniors in Connecticut, this \nbill protects Medicare, keeping it solid into the future. Nearly \n100,000 seniors in my State hit what is called the doughnut hole in the \nprescription drug benefit area, costing them an average of more than \n$4,000 annually.\n  This bill we are about to adopt takes the first critical step toward \nclosing that doughnut hole, and Connecticut seniors should know that I \nand Chairman Baucus, along with majority leader Harry Reid, have \ncommitted to completing that job in conference, and we will do so.\n  Meanwhile, in Connecticut, seniors will see their Medicare premiums \ngo down. They will see major improvements in the quality of care they \nreceive, resulting in as many as 29,000 hospital readmissions being \nprevented. In my State of Connecticut, 3 in 10 Connecticut residents \nhave not had a colorectal cancer screening.\n  One in six women over the age of 50 have not had a mammogram in the \npast 2 years. These are important screenings. They and other wellness \nprograms will be provided at no cost to people in my State as well as \nothers across the country. Beginning in 2011, seniors will be able to \nget a free annual checkup so they can stay well instead of simply \nreceiving care when they get sick. That annual free checkup can make \nsuch a difference. I am a living example of that where--because under \nour health care plan, I can have a free medical checkup once a year. As \na result of that, I discovered that I had prostate cancer, and what a \ndifference that made to be able to discover that, to get through the \nsurgery, and to know that I have a bright future ahead of me, not one \nthat I would discover later on when the kind of surgery I received \nmight have been worthless and pointless.\n  So these are the kinds of annual physicals Members of Congress get \nunder our health care plans, and our fellow citizens ought to be able \nto as well, particularly our seniors.\n  In addition, there are some 255,000 Connecticut residents between the \nages of 55 and 64 who will need home health services after they turn 65 \nbecause of an illness or an injury. These services, whether they \ninvolve installing a handicap shower or hiring a home health care aide, \nwill help these older Americans live in their homes in dignity and with \nindependence. But today these services are not always covered by \nMedicare or private insurance. Rather than having to impoverish \nthemselves so they can qualify for Medicaid by transferring all of \ntheir wealth and assets to a family member or rely on the full-time \nhelp of loved ones, these seniors will be able to take advantage of a \nnew voluntary program called the CLASS Act--authored by Senator Kennedy \nyears ago and which is now a part of this bill--that will provide a \ncash\n\n[[Page S13781]]\n\nbenefit to be used on these services and supports, totally paid for by \nthe individual themselves. Not a nickel, not a penny of Federal money \nis in that program. It is totally based on the contribution that people \nmake to that program.\n  So when I hear people talk about this as if it was some great robbery \nfrom the Federal Treasury, it doesn't involve the Federal Treasury at \nall. As the bill takes effect, the health insurance exchanges are set \nup and health insurance will become a buyer's market for people in my \nState as well. More than 350,000 Connecticut residents who today do not \nhave insurance will finally have affordable options to choose from. \nNearly a quarter of a million people in my State would be eligible for \npremium credits to help take care of the cost of insurance. That \ndoesn't go into effect until 2014, but in 2010, next year, insurance \ncompanies will be prohibited from imposing lifetime caps on the amount \nof care you can receive.\n  Insurance companies will be prohibited next year from taking away \nyour coverage, and they will be prohibited from discriminating based on \ngender or income in the year 2014. The insurance industry will be \nforced to spend more of your premium dollars on your health care, not \non bureaucrats hired to come up with reasons to deny you the care you \nneed. This is called the so-called medical loss ratios which require \nthat resources be spent on patient care and needs of the policyholder \nrather than on profits or administrative costs.\n  The industry will also be required to offer an appeal if your claim \nis denied, and each State will set up its own independent appeals \nprocess to keep the industry honest. Next year the industry will be \nforced to provide more details about their policies so that you can \nshop for health insurance the same way you shop for anything else, \narmed with enough information to be a smart consumer.\n  All of these insurance items will take effect at least by 2014, many \nof them next year, as I have just mentioned.\n\n  It is not just consumers who will benefit. Connecticut's 15,000 \nphysicians will also benefit. Today these physicians spend, on average, \n140 hours and $68,000 every year just dealing with bureaucrats at the \nhealth insurance companies. Let me repeat that: 140 hours and roughly \n$68,000 every year just dealing with bureaucrats at the insurance \ncompanies. That is 2.1 million hours and $1 billion in costs overall, \ntime and money wasted in my State alone. That is going to end.\n  This bill cuts down on bureaucratic redtape and needless paperwork. \nDoctors will be able to spend their time caring for patients, not \nfighting with the insurance industry. Meanwhile, more than 5,000 \nConnecticut primary care physicians will qualify for the new 5- to 10-\npercent payment bonus. That happens next year in 2010. New programs \nwill incentivize many more young doctors to stay in primary care, which \nwe all know is critically important.\n  Today, 9 percent of Connecticut residents can't access a primary care \nphysician because there aren't enough doctors to go around. This bill \nmakes an investment in our medical workforce and a $10 billion \ninvestment in community health centers and the National Health Service \nCorps, which begins taking effect immediately in 2010. It will be \nphased in over 5 years. That is going to expand dramatically the \navailability of patient care with our community health care system.\n  As more uninsured people gain coverage, Connecticut will no longer \nhave to subsidize the $383 million it spends in uncompensated care our \nproviders deliver each year--important at a time when my State is \nalready, like every State--almost every State--in serious budget \ntrouble.\n  I have just recited a long list of statistics showing how my State \nwill benefit from this bill--in many instances, benefit immediately. \nSome will take a little longer, but many of these provisions go into \neffect in the next year. More important than any statistic will be what \nyou will see when you tour my State, or any other State for that \nmatter, after this bill takes effect--or more accurately, what you will \nnot see. You will not see 100 people losing their insurance, their \nhealth insurance every single day, finding themselves cast into \nuncertainty and fear--100 people every day--that will no longer be the \ncase. You will not see families paying an extra $1,100 a year in health \ninsurance premiums, the so-called hidden tax paid by everyone with \ninsurance as a result of the nearly 50 million uninsured Americans. You \nwill not see seniors facing the loss of their Medicare benefits because \noverpayments to private insurance companies have rendered the program \ninsolvent. You will not see parents laying awake at night praying that \ntheir child's cough goes away because they can't afford to take him or \nher to see a doctor. You will not see people losing their homes, their \nlife's savings, losing their economic security, all because they got \nsick or a child or a spouse did. You will not see people dying, as \n45,000 do every year in our country, because they couldn't afford \naccess to the health care system.\n  So as a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, and a close and dear friend of our departed colleague, \nSenator Ted Kennedy, who led this fight for so long, it will be my \nhonor--a deep honor indeed, one of the highest honors I would have had \nin the 30 years I have served here--to cast a vote in favor of this \nlandmark legislation.\n  As one of two Senators whose job it is to look out for the people of \nmy home State of Connecticut, supporting this bill is nothing short of \nmy duty, and I intend to fulfill it with great pride at 8 a.m. on \nChristmas Eve. What better gift could I give to my folks at home than \nto cast my vote as 1 of 100 in this body for health care reform in our \nNation, so long overdue, so long waited for. And on this Christmas Eve \nit will become an accomplished feat of the U.S. Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there were a number of other people I wished \nto mention. I will not go through the list of all the staff involved in \nthis effort in the Senate. I am sure I would miss some people. It is a \nlengthy list of those who played such an important role. I was fearful \nI wouldn't have a chance between now and the actual vote on Thursday \nmorning, Christmas Eve, to express my deep gratitude as one Member who \nbenefited tremendously from the participation of my staff, two of whom \nare seated with me this evening. I know that is probably a violation of \nSenate rules to recognize them, but I want my constituents at home and \nthe American public to know how many dedicated people there are whose \nnames they never know, faces they will never see.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of staff be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                  reid\n\n       Kate Leone, Carolyn Gluck, ard Randy DeValk.\n\n\n                             Harkin/Kennedy\n\n       Michael Myers, Mark Childress, Pam Smith, Jenelle \n     Krishnamoorthy, Connie Garner, Portia Wu, David Bowen, John \n     McDonough, Topher Spiro, Stacey Sachs, Tom Kraus, Terri \n     Roney, Craig Martinez, Taryn Morrissey, Andrea Harris, Sara \n     Selgrade, Lee Perselay, Caya Lewis, Stephanie Hammonds, \n     Andrew Garrett, Joe Hutter, Lauren McFerran, Jeff Teitz, Kate \n     Cyrul, Dan Goldberg, Caroline Fichtenberg, Bill McConagha, \n     Lory Yudin, and Evan Griffis.\n\n\n                                 Baucus\n\n       Liz Fowler, Bill Dauster, Russ Sullivan, Cathy Koch, Yvette \n     Fontenot, David Schwartz, Neleen Eisinger, Chris Dawe, Shawn \n     Bishop, Kelly Whitener, Tony Clapsis, Diedra Henry-Spires, \n     Tom Reeder, Bridget Mallon, Tiffany Smith, and Catherine \n     Dratz.\n\n\n                                  Dodd\n\n       Jim Fenton, Tamar Magarik Haro, Jeremy Sharp, Monica Feit, \n     Joe Caldwell, Bryan DeAngelis, Andy Barr, Lia Lopez, Daniel \n     Barlava, and Rachael Holt.\n\n       Senate Legislative Counsel, with special thanks to Bill \n     Baird, who, along with Stacy Kern-Scheerer, was present \n     throughout the entire HELP Committee and has gone above and \n     beyond.\n\n\n                          Obama Administration\n\n       NancyAnn DeParle, Jeanne Lambrew, Mike Hash, Lauren \n     Aronson, Secretary\n\n[[Page S13782]]\n\n     Sebelius, Jim Messina, Phil Schilliro, Shawn Maher, and Dana \n     Singiser.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me say this to the minority staff as \nwell. While we have disagreed, and while they didn't vote for the bill, \nthere are people I admire immensely on the minority staff. On our \ncommittee, there were wonderful suggestions and contributions that came \nfrom the Republican side of the aisle. While they didn't support the \nbill, I think they made it a better bill because of their \ncontributions. I want to add their names as well. Mike Enzi of Wyoming, \nthe ranking member--and I worked with every Republican minority member \nof the HELP Committee--offered amendments that were included. While \nthey may not want to admit it or acknowledge it, they made a \ncontribution to this bill that makes it stronger and a better piece of \nlegislation. I add their names as well for their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/22/senate-section/article/S13782-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

SOULIOTIS\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I know all my colleagues share an \nindebtedness to the many staff members who work so (skillfully and) \ntirelessly behind the scenes each day. They assist us in serving the \npublic and responding to the needs of our constituents. Today, I am \nhonored to pay particular tribute to the contributions of one truly \noutstanding member of the Senate staff. She will retire at the end of \nthis session of Congress after 47 years of impressive service to the \ncitizens of Massachusetts.\n  Barbara Souliotis worked on Senator Edward M. Kennedy's first \ncampaign for the Senate in 1962. She was the first employee in Senator \nKennedy s office in November of that year And from the moment he joined \nthis body until the end of his life, Barbara served as a member of his \nstaff and for the last 23 years, she was the State director of his \nBoston office.\n  ``Barbs'' recalls that on her first day at work here in Washington, \nshe spilled a glass of Coca Cola on Senator Kennedy. When she started \nto apologize, he smiled his iconic smile and said ``Barbara, you and I \nare going to get along just fine.''\n  And they did. She served him brilliantly throughout his entire Senate \ncareer--the only member to run the full race as a ``staffer'', though \nmany of us have reported back in whenever Barbara sent out the call.\n  Senator Kennedy considered ``Barbs'' to be his most indispensable \nassistant. If anyone ever had a question relating to the Massachusetts \npeople whom he loved, he would inevitably ask; ``Have you checked with \nBarbs?'' I know how proud Ted would be that this tribute honoring \nBarbara's extraordinary example of public service to our Senate, our \nCommonwealth and our country is taking place this day.\n  I first met Barbara Souliotis when I joined Senator Kennedy's staff \nin 1969-40 years ago. I could see right away that behind Barbara's \nmodest demeanor was a remarkable woman who would never let Senator \nKennedy down. Why?\n  Because she had learned that his values and his commitment to making \na positive difference in peoples lives was the very reason she wanted \nto work for him in the first place. As I have thought about public \nservice through the years, it has become clear that the best of our \nNation was built on the labors of loyalty and love of unsung public \nheroines like Barbara Souliotis.\n  It was once said that ``Loyalty means nothing unless it has at its \nheart--the absolute principle of self sacrifice''. If that is the \nstandard of loyalty, I can tell you this,--there is no more loyal \nUnited States Senate staffer than Senator Kennedy's own ``Barbara \nSouliotis''.\n  She embodies the admirable quality of loyalty no matter the \ncircumstances. Barbs planned to retire years ago, but her loyalty to \nSenator Kennedy and her leadership position on his staff kept her with \nhim to the end. Just as she had throughout his storied career, she \nworked unfailingly for Senator Kennedy through the difficult months of \nhis illness and during his final days.\n  After Senator Kennedy passed away in August, Barbara continued her \nremarkable life's work of service as the director of my Boston office. \nThis woman I had known as a colleague came, once again, to the aid of a \nfriend. As one who was appointed to, among other things, continue \nconstituent services for the people of Massachusetts, I knew I could \nkeep that pledge--because Barbara Souliotis volunteered to stay on to \nlead the Kennedy team during these last few months.\n  Barb's loyalty, integrity and commitment are legendary. She is the \ntrue noble public servant, the tireless and compassionate friend, the \nunassuming aid to all around her.\n  If public service is Barb's vocation, sports is her avocation. There \nis no more avid fan of the Boston Red Sox, the Boston Bruins, the \nBoston Celtics, and the New England Patriots than Barbara Souliotis.\n  And she's also an outstanding golfer who plays without a handicap and \nwho has at least one hole-in-one on her score card. In Massachusetts, \nsports and politics are our passion. And Barbs has scored literally \nthousands of holes-in-one for the constituents of Massachusetts. A \nlifelong resident of Haverhill, she has travelled tens of thousands of \nmiles through the years serving the people of our Commonwealth.\n  In acknowledging Barbara's years of All-Star service to Senator \nKennedy for 47 years and to me for these few important and historic \nmonths, I add my own personal heartfelt thanks to her, especially for \nthe blessings of her friendship, support, and counsel over the many \ndecades, and I wish her a well-deserved happy and healthy retirement in \nthe many years to come. Thank you, Barbs. We love you. Hit 'em long and \nhit 'em straight!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/22/senate-section/article/S13782-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13782-S13783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF ERROLL SOUTHERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is only fitting that during this \ntravel-heavy holiday season, we urge our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle to work with us in confirming the nomination of Erroll \nSouthers as Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security \nAdministration.\n  The Transportation Security Administration is tasked with ensuring \nthe security and safety of travelers using our transportation network. \nMost often associated with security at airports, TSA responsibilities \nalso include highway, rail, port, bus, and mass transit security. The \nagency grew out of the aftermath of 9/11, a somber reminder of the need \nfor vigilant attention to transportation security.\n  Erroll Southers is the chief of homeland security and intelligence \nfor the Los Angeles International Airport police force. He is ready for \nthis job. He has nearly three decades working in public safety, \nhomeland security, and intelligence. Chief Southers has worked as a \nSanta Monica police officer, special agent for the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, and as a top officer with the Los Angeles International \nAirport, assisting in the management of the largest U.S. airport police \nforce.\n  Unfortunately, without Chief Southers in the position he has been \nnominated to, TSA is without the leadership necessary to move forward. \nThe President nominated Chief Southers in September, and the nomination \nhas been reported favorably to the Senate by both the Homeland Security \nand Commerce Committees, it is being held up by Senate Republicans.\n  At the same time Senate Republicans are insisting on expanding the \nrole and responsibility of TSA by requiring guns to be allowed on \nAmtrak, they block and delay the permanent leadership necessary to \nimplement these new policies.\n  And what is the justification for delaying Chief Southers' \nconfirmation? It is not his qualifications, his past actions or \nexperience. These are generally accepted to be outstanding. No, it is \ninstead an unreasonable demand that he predetermine if TSA employees \nshould be allowed to form unions. Instead of bending to political \npressure, Chief Southers has taken the stance that this decision should \nbe made with the input of all stakeholders, using\n\n[[Page S13783]]\n\ngood information, to find the best solution that does not jeopardize \nsafety and security.\n  The Senate must move past these disagreements and provide the \nadministration with the leadership agencies need to implement \ncongressionally mandated duties. Chief Southers is an excellent \ncandidate to lead the Transportation Security Administration, and he \nshould be in place at the agency today. In the midst of the heaviest \ntravel period of the year, it is irresponsible that the Senate has left \nthis post unfilled. I urge my colleagues to support the confirmation of \nChief Southers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/22/senate-section/article/S13783-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13783-S13784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BIODIESEL TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the biodiesel tax credit will expire on \nDecember 31, 2009. I am speaking today to set the record straight about \nwhy the biodiesel tax credit will not be extended before the end of the \nyear.\n  Some have suggested that Republicans are to blame for not getting the \nbiodiesel tax credit extended before the end of the year. This is \nsimply inaccurate.\n  The bottom line is that the Senate Democratic leadership decided they \nwere going to attach the tax extender package to a controversial estate \ntax bill in an attempt to get moderate Democrats and Republicans to \nvote for an estate tax bill that does not provide sufficient estate tax \nrelief.\n  If the Senate Democratic leadership had not chosen to hold the tax \nextender package hostage in an attempt to force moderate Democrats and \nRepublicans to vote for an estate tax bill that lacks support, the tax \nextender package would have easily passed separately.\n  The tax extenders bill could have passed as a stand-alone bill easily \nat any time during this whole year. In fact, the Senate Democratic \nleadership could simply bring up a noncontroversial version of the tax \nextenders bill and pass it by unanimous consent like we have done in \nthe past. We wouldn't even need to be talking about the tax extenders \npackage in relation to the Department of Defense funding bill.\n  However, because the Senate Democratic leadership failed to act on \nthe tax extenders package this entire year, one of the only legislative \nvehicles left to pass the tax extenders package was the Department of \nDefense funding bill.\n  Instead of just adding to the Defense bill a noncontroversial tax \nextenders package that both Republicans and Democrats could agree on, \nthe Senate Democratic leadership instead decided that they would also \ntry to attach the controversial estate tax bill and a controversial \nincrease in the debt limit.\n  They could have instead just included a noncontroversial tax \nextenders package with the Defense bill, and it would have easily \npassed. Again, they did not do this because they wanted to use the tax \nextenders package as leverage to get moderate Democrats and Republicans \nto vote for an estate tax bill that lacks support.\n  It is also worth noting that there are 60 Senators that caucus with \nthe Democrats, so they can pass anything if they vote together. It \nrings hollow to place the blame on Republicans for failing to enact the \ntax extenders package before the end of the year when the Democrats \nhold a supermajority of 60 Senators, an overwhelming majority in the \nHouse, and the Presidency.\n  The House, waiting until the last month of the year, finally passed a \ntax extenders bill. However, the House usually passes an extenders bill \nprior to the last month of the year.\n  For example, in 2008 the House passed a tax extenders bill on \nSeptember 26, 2008, and in 2007 the House passed a tax extenders bill \non November 9, 2007. This year, the House passed an extenders bill that \nthey knew the Senate would not accept. And then they left town for the \nyear. This is called a dump and run.\n  The House dumped a tax extenders bill that they knew the Senate would \nnot agree to, and left town before the Senate could have any chance to \nnegotiate a tax extenders bill that both the House and Senate could \nagree to.\n  The House also had a choice to make regarding whether they wanted to \npass a tax extenders bill this year by simply attaching a \nnoncontroversial version of the tax extenders bill, which both the \nHouse and Senate could agree on, to the House Department of Defense \nbill, without attaching either the controversial estate tax bill or the \nincrease of the debt limit on the Defense bill. However, the House \nchose not to do so.\n  Therefore, this should set the record straight. The Democratic \nleadership in the House and the Senate, and not Republicans, are \nresponsible for the failure to pass a tax extenders bill before the end \nof this year.\n  This failure has very serious consequences to the U.S. biodiesel \nindustry, which will grind to a halt as of January 1, 2010. I remind my \ncolleagues of the economic challenges faced by this industry. In 2008, \nthe biodiesel industry supported more than 52,000 green jobs.\n  Because of the downturn in the economy, the biodiesel industry has \nalready lost 29,000 green jobs in 2009. The industry is poised to lose \nanother 23,000 jobs if nothing is done on the tax incentive or \nregulatory delays at the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  So where are these jobs? Some might think they are all in the \nMidwest, but they are not. These green jobs are in 44 of the 50 States. \nI would like to list the 13 largest biodiesel-producing States in the \ncountry.\n  There are 24 facilities in Texas. There are 15 facilities in Iowa. \nThere are 6 facilities in Illinois and 6 in Missouri. There are 4 \nfacilities in Washington. Ohio has 11 facilities. There are 5 \nfacilities in Indiana. There are 3 facilities each in Mississippi and \nSouth Carolina. There are 7 facilities in Pennsylvania and 4 in \nArkansas. New Jersey has 2 facilities. There is 1 facility in North \nDakota.\n  Only 6 of the 50 States do not have some biodiesel production. They \nare Alaska, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Wyoming. The \nother 44 States have some biodiesel presence.\n  So workers in 44 States will be negatively affected by the inaction \nof this Congress to extend the tax credit.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. On November 25, I received a \nletter from the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association.\n  The letter outlined the economic and job ramifications of allowing \nthe tax credit to expire, even if it is a short-term expiration. I \nwould like to read directly from that letter.\n  It states in part:\n\n       Simply put, if the biodiesel tax incentive is allowed to \n     expire--even for a brief period of time--the Iowa biodiesel \n     industry will cease production and many plants will likely \n     not reopen under current ownership.\n       If the biodiesel tax incentive expires, biodiesel blends \n     will be priced out of the marketplace and our customers--the \n     oil companies--will stop purchasing biodiesel. In reality, we \n     already cannot book any first quarter sales for next year.\n       No retroactive action on the tax credit sometime next year \n     will undo the harm caused by the lost sales and shuttered \n     plants over the holidays.\n       Quite frankly, the biodiesel industry is facing shutdowns \n     that would certainly lead to a much longer--and unpaid--\n     Christmas break than anticipated for the hundreds of workers \n     at Iowa biodiesel plants.\n       But there are long-term impacts potentially even more far-\n     reaching. After more than a year of mainly breakeven or \n     negative margins, most of Iowa's biodiesel plants simply do \n     not have the cash reserves to withstand even a two or three \n     month shutdown.\n       So, even if the biodiesel blenders' tax credit is \n     retroactively enacted, several of Iowa's biodiesel plants are \n     unlikely to reopen under the current local-ownership. Please \n     do not let the Iowa-owned biodiesel industry disappear on \n     your watch.\n\n  I would ask unanimous consent that the entire letter from the Iowa \nRenewable Fuels Association to which I referred be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The dire situation reflected in this letter applies to all 173 \nbiodiesel plants around the country. The expiration of this tax credit \non December 31, 2009, will affect all 23,000 workers in this green \nenergy sector.\n  It is unfortunate that we have to be faced with the loss of 23,000 \ngreen jobs because of inaction on the extension of the biodiesel tax \ncredit. I hope this explanation makes clear who is responsible for this \nterrible situation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13784]]\n\n                             Iowa Renewable Fuels Association,\n\n                                                November 25, 2009.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: First, thank you for taking the time \n     to meet with Iowa Renewable Fuels Association members on \n     November 17, 2009. At that meeting, we discussed the absolute \n     necessity of extending the biodiesel blenders' tax credit \n     prior to the end of this year. With this letter, we want to \n     reinforce the economic and job ramifications of allowing the \n     tax credit to expire--even for a couple of months.\n       As a longtime supporter of Iowa biodiesel, you know that \n     the biodiesel tax incentive, which allows blenders to claim a \n     $1 excise tax credit for each gallon of biodiesel blended \n     with diesel, is set to expire on December 31, 2009. Simply \n     put, if the biodiesel tax incentive is allowed to expire--\n     even for a brief period of time--the Iowa biodiesel industry \n     will cease production and many plants will likely not reopen \n     under current ownership.\n       With the tax credit, biodiesel blends are very competitive \n     in today's marketplace. However, if the biodiesel tax \n     incentive expires, biodiesel blends will be priced out of the \n     marketplace and our customers--the oil companies--will stop \n     purchasing biodiesel. In reality, we already cannot book any \n     first quarter sales for next year. Therefore, biodiesel \n     plants are unable to purchase feedstocks for the beginning of \n     2010 because there is no guarantee that a market for \n     biodiesel will exist come January 1, 2010. As a result, many \n     plants will likely begin to stop operations in mid-December.\n       No ``retroactive'' action on the tax credit sometime next \n     year will undo the harm caused by the lost sales and \n     shuttered plants over the holidays. Quite frankly, the \n     biodiesel industry is facing shutdowns that would certainly \n     lead to a much longer--and unpaid--Christmas break than \n     anticipated for the hundreds of workers at Iowa biodiesel \n     plants.\n       That is a prospect that any industry hopes to avoid. But \n     there are long-term impacts potentially even more far-\n     reaching. While 2009 has been a rough economic year for many \n     industries, the biodiesel industry has been hit harder than \n     most. In fact, of Iowa's fifteen biodiesel refineries, only \n     nine are currently operating--and most of those at a severely \n     reduced capacity. After more than a year of mainly breakeven \n     or negative margins, most of Iowa's biodiesel plants simply \n     do not have the cash reserves to withstand even a two or \n     three month shutdown.\n       So even if the biodiesel blenders' tax credit is \n     retroactively enacted, several of Iowa's biodiesel plants are \n     unlikely to reopen under the current local-ownership. In \n     fact, if recent history from the ethanol industry is any \n     indication, Big Oil companies may swoop in, buy the closed \n     plants for pennies on the dollar and then reopen them as part \n     of their multi-national, vertically-integrated business plan. \n     While this would be better than having the doors of these \n     plants closed for good, keeping these plants in the hands of \n     Iowa investors provides the most benefits to the local \n     communities.\n       During our meeting, there was discussion of using a tax \n     extenders package or estate tax bill as a vehicle to extend \n     the biodiesel tax credit this year. That type of decision is \n     best left to you--we just know the extension needs to happen \n     this year. We have also increasingly heard of the need for a \n     ``jobs bill'' this year in response to U.S. unemployment \n     surpassing ten percent. We urge you to consider the extension \n     of the tax credit as part of any ``jobs bill'' that Congress \n     may consider. After all, extending the tax credit--something \n     most people believe will happen ``eventually''--is an easy \n     way to maintain hundreds of jobs in Iowa and thousands around \n     the country. Failure to extend the biodiesel tax credit will \n     undoubtedly add to the jobless rolls.\n       We thank you for your support of the Iowa biodiesel \n     industry, and we encourage you to do all you can to ensure \n     that the biodiesel tax incentive is extended as soon as \n     possible. We are not trying to be alarmist. Rather, we want \n     you to have a clear picture of the prospects facing the Iowa \n     biodiesel industry as the tax credit expiration comes closer \n     each day. Please do not let the Iowa-owned biodiesel industry \n     disappear on your watch.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Monte Shaw,\n     Executive Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/22/senate-section/article/S13784-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THANKING STAFF\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes \nin the midst of this debate to acknowledge some individuals who work \nfor us here in the Senate. As chairman of the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations subcommittee that funds these agencies, I have had the \nopportunity to get to know these staffs and have a good understanding \nof the work they do for us here in the Senate. These folks work \ntirelessly behind the scenes at all times to keep this institution \nrunning safe and sound under any circumstances.\n  We have been in session every weekend since Thanksgiving, including \nduring the largest December snowstorm in Washington's history, and we \nhave worked uninterrupted thanks to the dedication and hard work of \nthese individuals. It is easy to take for granted the hard work they \nperform on a daily basis--and we often do, but today, on behalf of the \nentire Senate I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to all of them.\n  I want to start by thanking the U.S. Capitol Police Force, led by \nChief Philip Morse and Assistant Chief Dan Nichols. This force of 1800 \nofficers put their lives on the line every day to protect us and this \ninstitution, and they have all worked a tremendous amount of overtime \nlately. I want to particularly mention the terrific work of Inspector \nSandra Coffman and her staff in the Capitol Division for all the extra \nhours they have worked in securing and protecting the Capitol and the \nChamber. They have gone above and beyond their normal duty, and we are \nextremely grateful for their dedication to our safety and protection.\n  Next I want to thank the staff of the Senate Sergeant at Arms, led by \nSergeant at Arms Terry Gainer and Deputy Sergeant at Arms Drew \nWillison. The SAA staff of nearly 900 people includes the doorkeepers \nwho have worked nonstop through the last month keeping access to the \nSenate available for staff and visitors who have traveled to Washington \nto witness this historic debate firsthand. They have kept our computer \nsystems and overstretched telephone systems running, kept the mail \nmoving, and the recording studio functioning, not to mention the \nfacilities staff who have kept the Capitol Building clean and warm, \nreplenishing wood for the fireplaces nonstop.\n  I want to thank the staff of the Architect of the Capitol, led by \nActing Architect Stephen Ayers, and the many, many folks who have \nworked around the clock from Ted Bechtel and the Capitol Grounds crew \nwho have been removing snow from the road, sidewalks, and parking lots \nof the Capitol Complex, to Robin Morey and his staff who have kept the \nSenate buildings clean and warm throughout these long, long weeks. I \ntruly appreciate the extra hours of work provided by these individuals.\n  I want to thank the Secretary of the Senate, Nancy Erickson, and her \nstaff, including the legislative clerks, the bill clerks, the enrolling \nclerks, the executive clerks, Parliamentarians, official reporters of \ndebates, captioning services, journal clerks, and the staff of the \nDaily Digest. These folks have been here around the clock, under some \nvery tiring circumstances, to deliver the services that are needed to \nkeep this institution running.\n  Last but not least, I want to thank Lula Davis and David Schiappa, \nour floor leaders, for their tireless guidance in keeping us--the \nMembers--where we need to be when we need to be there. We are in your \ndebt.\n  Mr. President, I have undoubtedly left out many people in the Senate \nwho deserve to be thanked, and I hope they know who they are and how \nmuch we appreciate them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/22/senate-section/article/S13784-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13784-S13785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH.

A bill to provide funding for summer and year-round youth \njobs and training programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2923\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Youth Jobs Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUMMER AND YEAR-ROUND YOUTH JOBS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a $1,500,000,000 investment in summer and year-round \n     employment for youth, through the program supported under \n     this section, can create up to 450,000 temporary jobs and \n     meaningful work experiences for economically disadvantaged \n     youth and stimulate local economies;\n       (2) there is a serious and growing need for employment \n     opportunities for economically disadvantaged youth (including \n     young adults), as demonstrated by statistics from the Bureau \n     of Labor Statistics stating that, in November 2009--\n       (A) the unemployment rate increased to 10 percent, as \n     compared to 6.8 percent in November 2008;\n       (B) the unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds rose to \n     26.7 percent, as compared to 20.4 percent in November 2008; \n     and\n       (C) the unemployment rate for African-American 16- to 19-\n     year-olds increased to 49.4 percent, as compared to 32.2 \n     percent in November 2008;\n       (3) research from Northwestern University has shown that \n     every $1 a youth earns has an accelerator effect of $3 on the \n     local economy;\n       (4) summer and year-round jobs for youth help supplement \n     the income of families living in poverty;\n       (5) summer and year-round jobs for youth provide valuable \n     work experience for economically disadvantaged youth;\n       (6) often, a summer or year-round job provided under the \n     Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is an economically \n     disadvantaged youth's introduction to the world of work;\n       (7) according to the Center for Labor Market Studies at \n     Northeastern University, early work experience is a very \n     powerful predictor of success and earnings in the labor \n     market, and early work experience raises earnings over a \n     lifetime by 10 to 20 percent;\n       (8) participation in a youth jobs program can contribute to \n     a reduction in criminal and high-risk behavior for youth; and\n       (9)(A) youth jobs programs benefit both youth and \n     communities when designed around principles that promote \n     mutually beneficial programs;\n       (B) youth benefit from jobs that provide them with work \n     readiness skills and that help them make the connection \n     between responsibility on the job and success in adulthood; \n     and\n       (C) communities benefit when youth are engaged \n     productively, providing much-needed services that meet real \n     community needs.\n       (b) References.--\n       (1) Certificate; credential.--In subsection (d), references \n     to the terms ``certificate'' and ``credential'' have the \n     meanings prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.\n       (2) Youth-related references.--In this Act, and in the \n     provisions referred to in subsections (c) and (d) for \n     purposes of this Act--\n       (A) a reference to a youth refers to an individual who is \n     not younger than age 14 and not older than age 24, and meets \n     any other requirements for that type of youth; and\n       (B) a reference to a youth activity refers to an activity \n     covered in subsection (d)(1) that is carried out for a youth \n     described in subparagraph (A).\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Labor for youth \n     activities under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 \n     U.S.C. 2801 et seq.), $1,500,000,000, which shall be \n     available for the period of January 1, 2010 through June 30, \n     2011, under the conditions described in subsection (d).\n       (d) Conditions.--\n       (1) Use of funds.--The funds made available under \n     subsection (c) shall be used for youth jobs and training \n     programs, to provide opportunities referred to in \n     subparagraphs (C), (D), (E), and (F) of section 129(c)(2) of \n     such Act (29 U.S.C. 2854(c)(2)) and, as appropriate, \n     opportunities referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (G) of \n     such section, except that no such funds shall be spent on \n     unpaid work experiences and the opportunities may include \n     learning described in paragraph (3)(B).\n       (2) Limitation.--Such funds shall be distributed in \n     accordance with sections 127 and 128 of such Act (29 U.S.C. \n     2852, 2853), except that no portion of such funds shall be \n     reserved to carry out 128(a) or 169 of such Act (29 U.S.C. \n     2853(a), 2914).\n       (3) Priority.--In using funds made available under \n     subsection (c), a local area (as defined in section 101 of \n     such Act (29 U.S.C. 2801))--\n       (A) shall give priority to providing--\n       (i) work experiences in viable, emerging, or demand \n     industries, or work experiences in the public or nonprofit \n     sector that fulfill a community need; and\n       (ii) job referral services for youth to work experiences \n     described in clause (i) in the private sector, for which the \n     employer involved agrees to pay the wages and benefits, \n     consistent with Federal and State child labor laws; and\n       (B) may give priority to providing--\n       (i) work experiences combined with linkages to academic and \n     occupational learning, so that the experiences and learning \n     provide opportunities for youth to earn a short-term \n     certificate or credential that has value in the labor market; \n     and\n       (ii) work experiences combined with learning that are \n     designed to encourage and maximize the likelihood of a \n     participant's return to, or completion of, a program of study \n     leading to a recognized secondary or postsecondary degree, \n     certificate, or credential.\n       (4) Measure of effectiveness.--The effectiveness of the \n     activities carried out with such funds shall be measured, \n     under section\n\n[[Page S13787]]\n\n     136 of such Act (29 U.S.C. 2871), only with performance \n     measures based on the core indicators of performance \n     described in section 136(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) of such Act (29 \n     U.S.C. 2871(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I)), applied to all youth served \n     through the activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. \n        Sessions):\n  S. 2924. A bill to reauthorize the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, in \nthe wake of its Centennial, and its programs and activities; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation \nto reauthorize the Department of Justice grant program for Boys & Girls \nClubs. I thank Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl and Senator Sessions for \njoining me in this effort.\n  I have partnered with Senator Hatch for many years on issues \nconcerning the Boys & Girls Clubs, and this bipartisan bill shows the \ncommitment of both Democrats and Republicans to the good work done by \nBoys & Girls Clubs across the Nation.\n  Children are the future of our country, and we have a responsibility \nto make sure they are safe and secure. I know firsthand how well Boys & \nGirls Clubs work, and the real impact they have in our communities. In \nmy home State of Vermont, we are fortunate to have 6 Boys & Girls Clubs \noperating in 25 locations. These clubs serve more than 14,000 youth in \nthe State. I often hear from parents, educators, law enforcement \nofficers and others in Vermont about just how successful these Clubs \nare, and how they inspire youth to reach their full potential.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have \npushed for more Federal funding for Boys & Girls Clubs. This year, I \nrecommended additional funding for youth mentoring programs, so that \nyouth-serving organizations like the Boys & Girls Clubs of America are \nable to continue making a substantial and real difference in the lives \nof vulnerable children. I was pleased that Congress included $100 \nmillion for competitive youth mentoring grants in the recently passed \nconsolidated appropriations bill.\n  The current recession has hit many organizations around the country, \nthreatening their financial health, and the Boys & Girls Clubs are no \ndifferent. At the same time, participation in these clubs has never \nbeen higher, and it continues to increase. I believe funding is well \nspent at the community level, however, where the positive impact on our \nyouth is felt most directly.\n  In the 108th Congress, Senator Hatch and I worked together to pass a \nbill to reauthorize and extend the programs of the Boys & Girls Clubs \nof America through fiscal year 2009. Due in part to the support of \nCongress, there now exist over 4,300 Boys & Girls Clubs in all 50 \nstates, serving more than 4.8 million young people. The bill we \nintroduce today will help us continue to support these important \nprograms by authorizing Justice Department grants through 2015.\n  We need safe havens where our youth--the future of our country--can \nlearn and grow up free from the influences of drugs, gangs and crime. \nThat is why Boys & Girls Clubs are so important to our children.\n  I hope all Senators will support this bipartisan bill to provide \nFederal support for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Our greatest \nresponsibility is to our children, and supporting Boys & Girls Clubs is \njust one way in which we can show our commitment to their future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimour consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2924\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a grant program to benefit victims of \nsex trafficking, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, to introduce the Trafficking \nDeterrence and Victims Support Act of 2009.\n  This bill addresses a serious problem that is modern day slavery, \npure and simple--human sex trafficking. You could almost call it a war, \nwhere all too often, children are the casualties.\n  The statistics on minors involved in sex trafficking are shocking. \nExperts estimate that over 100,000 children in the U.S. are at risk for \nprostitution. The average age of entry into prostitution is 12. The \nchildren at greatest risk of becoming involved in sex trafficking are \nwhat they call ``repeat runaways''--kids who have run away over and \nover again. They need help right away if they are going to avoid being \ncaught by pimps. One third of run-away children are lured into \nprostitution within 48 hours of leaving home and 75 percent of minors \ncaught in this web of prostitution have a pimp.\n  This problem is on the rise because criminal gang members are \nincreasingly turning to pimping. Gang members have discovered that they \nare less likely to get prosecuted for trafficking a person than \ntrafficking drugs. While drugs can only be sold once, a pimp can sell a \nperson over and over. It is just as lucrative. A pimp can make $200,000 \na year on one trafficking victim.\n  This situation is horrifying and totally unacceptable. The bill I am \nintroducing today will bring a smart strategy that will give some teeth \nto the efforts law enforcement across the country have made to combat \nsex trafficking. It will give them additional resources they need to \nlock up pimps and sex traffickers. It will also help victims break away \nfrom their abusers and get the treatment and services they need to take \ntheir lives back.\n  Let us be absolutely clear about this--the pimps who prey upon \nvulnerable young people are criminals, and they should be put behind \nbars. The young women, girls, and sometimes boys who are trafficked are \nnot criminals--they are victims of crime. They don't need to be \nprosecuted. They need all the help they can get to escape the clutches \nof pimps.\n  Unfortunately, until now, the government has been a step behind. \nRight now, it is very difficult for law enforcement officers and \nprosecutors to build criminal cases and crack down on pimps. The \nTrafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act would change that.\n  Here is how it would work: The bill would establish a pilot project \nof 6 block grants in locations in different regions of the country with \nsignificant sex trafficking activity. The block grants would be awarded \nby the Department of Justice to State or local government applicants \nthat have developed a workable, comprehensive plan to combat sex \ntrafficking. The grants would require a comprehensive, multi-\ndisciplinary approach to addressing trafficking problems. Applicants \nfor the grants would have to demonstrate they can work together with \nlocal, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and \nsocial service providers to achieve the goals the bill would set out \nfor them.\n  Government agencies that get the grants would be required to create \nshelters where trafficking victims would be safe from their pimps, and \nwhere they could start getting treatment for the trauma they have \nsuffered. The shelters would provide counseling, legal services, and \nmental and physical health services, including treatment for substance \nabuse, sexual abuse, and trauma-informed care. The shelters would also \nprovide food, clothing, and other necessities, as well as education and \ntraining to help victims get their lives on track.\n  It is going to take this kind of comprehensive plan to finally turn \nthe tables on pimps who, right now, just wait for their victims to be \nreleased from jail so they can put them back out on the streets to make \nmoney for them. Once those girls are out, they don't come back to \ntestify against their pimps--they're just gone.\n  This bill fixes that problem by giving the young victims a safe \nhaven. It is only by addressing the needs of these victims that law \nenforcement officers will be able to work with them to build criminal \ncases against their pimps. The block grants will also provide for \nspecialized training for law enforcement officers and prosecutors to \nhelp them learn how to handle trafficking victims and build trafficking \ncases.\n  This bill would also strengthen reporting requirements for runaway or \nmissing children, and authorize funding to the FBI to enhance the \nNational Crime Information Center, NCIC, database, which is where \nmissing child reports are filed. This would give law enforcement \nofficers better information on the children at greatest risk of being \nlured in to sex trafficking by being able to show a tally of how many \ntimes a child has run away, and can flag them as ``repeat runaways'' \nwho are at high risk of being lured into prostitution.\n  Sex trafficking is a complex issue that requires the comprehensive, \nwrap-around approach that this bill would deliver. As daunting as this \nproblem is, there are bright examples of how to address the challenge, \nsuch as the achievements of Sergeant Byron Fassett of the Dallas Police \nDepartment. Just listening to Sergeant Fassett, who spoke at a recent \ncongressional briefing that I hosted, is an education in how to do this \nright. The lessons he has learned in over 20 years of combating sex \ntrafficking are a primer for how to get victims out of the clutches of \npimps and build cases to put pimps away. Sergeant Fassett is not the \nonly officer out there who's attacking this challenge the right way. In \nmy home town of Portland, the officers on the human trafficking task \nforce are doing excellent work. But right now, they simply don't have \nthe resources to crack this problem. The Trafficking Deterrence and \nVictims Support Act would deliver the training and resources they need.\n  I want to also thank the many individuals and organizations who \nattended the briefing and participated in efforts to craft this \nlegislation. I particularly want to acknowledge the Polaris Project and \nthe National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, for their \ninstrumental roles in this effort.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Cornyn and other colleagues to \nmove this important legislation forward. There are children out on the \nstreets tonight who shouldn't have to wait for the help this bill can \ngive. Let us end this appalling war on those kids. Let us give them the \nhelp they need by passing this piece of legislation with all the speed \npossible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2925\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Trafficking Deterrence and \n     Victims Support Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Human trafficking is modern day slavery. It is the \n     fastest-growing, and second largest, criminal enterprise in \n     the world. Human trafficking generates an estimated profit of \n     $32,000,000,000 per year, world wide.\n       (2) In the United States, human trafficking is an \n     increasing problem. This criminal enterprise includes \n     citizens of the United States, many of them children, who are \n     forced into prostitution, and foreigners brought into the \n     country, often under false pretenses, who are coerced into \n     forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation.\n       (3) Sex trafficking is one of the most lucrative areas of \n     human trafficking. Criminal gang members in the United States \n     are increasingly involved in recruiting young\n\n[[Page S13789]]\n\n     women and girls into sex trafficking. Interviews with gang \n     members indicate that the gang members regard working as an \n     individual who solicits customers for a prostitute (commonly \n     known as a ``pimp'') to being as lucrative as trafficking in \n     drugs, but with a much lower chance of being criminally \n     convicted.\n       (4) Minors in the United States are highly vulnerable for \n     sexual exploitation and sex trafficking. As many as 2,800,000 \n     children live on the streets. Of the estimated 1,600,000 \n     children who run away each year, 77 percent return home \n     within 1 week. However, 33 percent of children who run away \n     are lured into prostitution within 48 hours of leaving home.\n       (5) National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, \n     Runaway and Throwaway Children, the definitive study of \n     episodes of missing children, found that of the children who \n     are victims of non-family abduction, runaway or throwaway \n     children, the police are alerted by family or guardians in \n     only 21 percent of the cases. In 79 percent of cases there is \n     no report and no police involvement, and therefore no \n     official attempt to find the child.\n       (6) In 2007, the Administration of Children and Families, \n     Department of Health and Human Services, reported to the \n     Federal Government 265,000 cases of serious physical, sexual, \n     or psychological abuse of children.\n       (7) Experts estimate that over 100,000 children in the \n     United States are at risk for prostitution.\n       (8) Children who have run away from home are at a high risk \n     of becoming involved in sex trafficking. Children who have \n     run away multiple times are at much higher risk of not \n     returning home and of engaging in prostitution.\n       (9) The vast majority of children involved in sex \n     trafficking have suffered previous sexual or physical abuse, \n     live in poverty, or have no stable home or family life. These \n     children require a comprehensive framework of specialized \n     treatment and mental health counseling that addresses post-\n     traumatic stress, depression, and sexual exploitation.\n       (10) The average age of entry into prostitution is 12. \n     Seventy-five percent of minors engaged in prostitution have a \n     pimp. A pimp can earn $200,000 per year prostituting 1 \n     trafficking victim.\n       (11) Sex trafficking is a complex and varied criminal \n     problem that requires a multi-disciplinary, cooperative \n     solution. Reducing trafficking will require the government to \n     address victims, pimps, and johns; and to provide training \n     specific to sex trafficking for law enforcement officers and \n     prosecutors, and child welfare, public health, and other \n     social service providers. A good model for this type of \n     approach is the Internet Crimes Against Children task force \n     program.\n       (12) Human trafficking is a criminal enterprise that \n     imposes significant costs on the economy of the United \n     States. Government and non-profit resources used to address \n     trafficking include those of law enforcement, the judicial \n     and penal systems, and social service providers. Without a \n     range of appropriate treatments to help trafficking victims \n     overcome the trauma they have experienced, victims will \n     continue to be involved in crime, unable to support \n     themselves, and continue to require government resources \n     rather than being productive contributors to the legitimate \n     economy.\n       (13) Many domestic minor sex trafficking victims are \n     younger than 18 years old and are below the age of consent. \n     Because trafficking victims have been forced to engage in \n     prostitution rather than willfully to committing a crime, \n     these victims should not be charged as criminal defendants. \n     Instead, these victims of trafficking should have access to \n     treatment and services to help them escape and overcome being \n     sexually exploited, and should also be allowed to seek \n     appropriate remuneration from crime victims' compensation \n     funds.\n       (14) The State of New York has adopted a safe harbor law \n     that establishes a presumption a minor charged with a \n     prostitution offense is a severely trafficked person. This \n     law allows the child to avoid criminal charges of \n     prostitution and instead be considered a ``person in need of \n     supervision.'' The statute also provides support and services \n     to sexually exploited youth who are under the age of 18 years \n     old. These services include safe houses, crisis intervention \n     programs, community-based programs, and law-enforcement \n     training to help officers identify sexually exploited youth.\n       (15) Sex trafficking is not a problem that occurs only in \n     urban settings. This crime exists also in rural areas and on \n     Indian reservations. Efforts to address sex trafficking \n     should include partnerships with organizations that seek to \n     address the needs of such under-served communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Attorney General should implement changes to the \n     National Crime Information Center database in order to ensure \n     that--\n       (A) a child entered into the database will be automatically \n     designated as an endangered juvenile if the child has been \n     reported missing not less than 3 times in a 1 year period;\n       (B) the database be programmed to cross-reference newly \n     entered reports with historical records already in the \n     database; and\n       (C) the database be programmed to include a visual cue on \n     the record of a child designated as an endangered juvenile in \n     order to assist law enforcement officers in recognizing the \n     child and providing the child with appropriate care and \n     services; and\n       (2) funds awarded under subpart 1 of part E of title I of \n     the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 \n     U.S.C. 3750 et seq.) (commonly known as Byrne Grants) should \n     be used to provide programs relating to sex trafficking \n     education, training, deterrence, and prevention.\n\n     SEC. 4.
