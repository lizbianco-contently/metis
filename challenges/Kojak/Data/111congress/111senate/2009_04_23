Madam President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 56, \nthe nomination of Thomas L. Strickland to be Assistant Secretary for \nFish and Wildlife; that the nomination be confirmed and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that no further motions be in order; \nthat any statements relating to this nomination be printed in the \nRecord; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, let me say to my good \nfriend the majority leader, there is at least one Member on my side who \nis not yet prepared to clear this matter. Therefore, I must, for the \nmoment, object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we understood that the ranking member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee--the committee that reported \nthis--was the individual holding this up, so I talked to Senator \nInhofe.\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\nWe had a good conversation. I called him back and he said he had no \nproblem with Mr. Strickland. Obviously, this has been rolling around \nand somebody else has put a snag on it.\n  I would now ask my friend, the Republican leader, if I ask unanimous \nconsent for 4 hours of debate on this individual, would there be an \nobjection to this?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would say to my friend, the \nmajority leader, that I am not able, at this particular time, to enter \ninto an agreement on this nomination.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that is very unfortunate, but I \nunderstand.\n  I now ask unanimous consent, as in executive session, that at a time \nto be determined by the majority leader, following consultation with \nthe Republican leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider Calendar No. 62, the nomination of Kathleen Sebelius to be \nSecretary of Health and Human Services; that there be 5 hours of debate \nwith respect to this nomination, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the leaders or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to a vote on \nconfirmation of Kathleen Sebelius; that upon confirmation, the normal \nprocedure of the Senate be followed and that following that we resume \nlegislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, this \nnomination came out of committee yesterday. It was fairly contentious. \nIt was not a party-line vote, but a number of Members on my side \nopposed the nomination. So at least for today, I am not able to enter \ninto a consent agreement on a time specific to consider the nomination \nof Governor Sebelius. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we need not quibble on the time. It came \nout Tuesday or Wednesday, and I understand people may want to look at \nthis more closely. That is fine. It appears to me it wouldn't do me any \ngood or the Senate any good to ask for more time at this time. No \nmatter what time I set aside, the Republican leader couldn't agree now?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend, the majority leader, I \ncannot today agree to a time specific for consideration of this \nnomination.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have another individual who we feel \nshould be approved, David Hayes, to be Deputy Secretary of the \nInterior. I would ask my friend, the Republican leader, if we suggested \n3 hours of debate under the conditions I outlined for the other two, is \nthe Republican leader in a position to agree to have this nomination?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would say to my good friend, the \nmajority leader, not at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4604-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Throughout the week, \nLouisville, Lexington, and other communities in Kentucky and the Nation \nhave held events to commemorate this solemn occasion.\n  As we remember the terrible sufferings of the Jewish people and all \nothers who have suffered and who continue to suffer at the hands of \nhatred and intolerance, we spread one of the most enduring lessons of \nthe Holocaust--that evil exists in the world and it is the \nresponsibility of free and just nations to protect the innocent by \nspeaking for all those who cannot speak for themselves.\n  The theme of the 2009 Days of Remembrance is ``Never Again: What You \nDo Matters.'' Those words should serve as a reminder to all of us that \nanti-Semitism and other forms of religious hatred are as real today as \nthey were in the middle of the last century and that the best way to \nhonor the victims of the Holocaust is for us to work toward building a \nmore hopeful and a more peaceful world.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4604-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 386, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 386) to improve enforcement of mortgage fraud, \n     securities fraud, financial institution fraud, and other \n     frauds related to federal assistance and relief programs, for \n     the recovery of funds lost to these frauds, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 984, to increase funding for certain HUD \n     programs to assist individuals to better withstand the \n     current mortgage crisis.\n       Inhofe amendment No. 996 (to amendment No. 984), to amend \n     title 4, United States Code, to declare English as the \n     national language of the Government of the United States.\n       Vitter amendment No. 991, to authorize and remove \n     impediments to the repayment of funds received under the \n     Troubled Asset Relief Program.\n       Boxer amendment No. 1000, to authorize monies for the \n     special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief \n     Program to audit and investigate recipients of nonrecourse \n     Federal loans under the Public Private Investment Program and \n     the Term Asset Loan Facility.\n       Kyl amendment No. 986, to limit the amount that may be \n     deducted from proceeds due to the United States under the \n     False Claims Act for purposes of compensating private \n     intervenors to the greater of $50,000,000 or 300 percent of \n     the expenses and cost of the intervenor.\n       Coburn amendment No. 982, to authorize the use of TARP \n     funds to cover the costs of the bill.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is considering S. 386, \nto which six amendments are pending.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, yesterday, when we were finally allowed to proceed \nto the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, we began making real \nprogress. Ten amendments were offered during the course of the day, \nfour amendments were adopted, and six remain pending. I believe, had we \nnot stopped voting at 5 o'clock, we could have finished the bill and \npassed it last night. As things stand, we hope to dispose of the six \nremaining amendments through the course of this morning. We should \ncomplete Senate consideration of the bill without further delay.\n  I should note that the number of Senators who have cosponsored this \nbill continue to grow--now at 17 Senators. Most of the Senators who \noffered amendments yesterday praised the underlying bill. I think we \nhave only one pending amendment that regards the underlying bill; only \none that actually directly relates to it. Senator Grassley will speak \nto that amendment. Most of the amendments that have been offered, \nalmost all the remaining amendments pending, aren't within the \njurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, they are within the \njurisdiction of the Banking Committee, and I look forward to the \nleadership of that committee--the committee of jurisdiction--with \nrespect to guidance on those amendments.\n  In my view, it would have been better if Senators had withheld their \namendments and waited to offer them on the housing and banking \nlegislation that is going to be considered next week by the Senate. \nThen you would have at least had a bill that was relevant to the \namendments. But, of course, every Senator can do whatever he or she \nwants to. Now, the banking/housing amendments that have been added to \nthis Judiciary bill will complicate passage and enactment of what \neveryone agrees is needed--the fraud enforcement legislation. I think \nthat is unfortunate.\n  Among the examples are amendments affecting the use of TARP funds.\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\nModifying the Troubled Asset Relief Program is a complicated matter. I \nwish it were not complicating this bill. I have no problem with such \namendments being on a bill that actually relates to TARP, but this one \ndoes not. Indeed, in the 6 weeks, the month and a half since the fraud \nenforcement bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee, my staff and \nI reached out to Senators and no one raised these TARP issues. Had \nthey, we would have engaged with Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby and \ntried to work them out as best we could in the proper setting.\n\n  The Obama administration has reformed the TARP process. It is doing \nits best to get a handle on the use of these funds. I intend to look to \ntheir views and to those of Chairman Dodd, but I believe complicating \npassage of this fraud enforcement bill with those issues is not \nhelpful. Nonetheless, we will do what we have to in order to complete \nthis process.\n  The Obama administration's Statement of Administration Policy \nexpresses their strong support for enactment of the underlying fraud \nenforcement bill. They note:\n\n       Its provisions would provide Federal investigators and \n     prosecutors with significant new criminal and civil tools and \n     resources that would assist in holding accountable those who \n     committed financial fraud.\n\n  To give an idea, the Justice Department, the FBI, the Secret Service, \nthe Special Inspector General for the TARP, law enforcement officers, \ngood government advocates--all support the underlying bill. The New \nYork Times wrote last weekend:\n\n       Senators should not be asking if the expenditure on fraud \n     enforcement called for in this bill is affordable, but \n     whether it is enough.\n\n  Fraud has damaged our economy. It has wrecked the lives and life \nsavings of thousands of hardworking Americans. That is why this bill \nshould not be complicated with a lot of extraneous material that is not \nin the jurisdiction of this bill. We have people around this country \nfacing economic crises. They are preyed upon by some of these mortgage \nfraud groups. They promise to help them out of any kind of a mortgage \ndifficulty they have and then they steal their retirement accounts. \nThey steal the money they may have saved for their children to go to \ncollege. They steal the equity in their homes. Then they disappear, so \npeople are left with no homes, no equity, no retirement accounts. If \nthey saved money for their children to go to college, there is no money \nthere, and the people who have committed the fraud get away.\n  On those occasions when sometimes they are chased down, they may \nactually face a fine. But if they have stolen $200 million and get a \n$10 million fine--big deal. It is the cost of doing business. But if we \nhave very tough legislation that allows the Justice Department and \nothers to go in right at the get-go, to be able to go in and go after \nthese people and make it very clear: If you are involved in this kind \nof fraud, if you are involved in this kind of theft, you are not going \nto get a fine, you are going to go to prison, then they are going to \npay attention.\n  I can tell you from my own experience as a prosecutor, I know fines \nin this kind of fraud situation do not serve as much of a deterrent. \nBut if we are able to send in the police to arrest these people, and \nthey know they are going to spend years behind bars, then they start \npaying attention. That is the only thing that really does it, and that \nis the only thing that is going to protect these Americans, American \ntaxpayers, honest, hardworking men and women--the only thing that is \ngoing to protect them from losing everything they have in a downturn in \nthe economy.\n  We should pass this bill without further delay. We should move to the \ntask of helping law enforcement find and hold accountable those who \nengage in such fraudulent conduct. This should be fairly easy. We can \npass this bill and say: We are against crime, we are against fraud, we \nwant the good guys to win, we want the bad guys to go to jail. It is as \nsimple as that. That is why there are Republicans and Democrats who \nsupport this--across the political spectrum.\n  Strengthening fraud enforcement is a key priority for President \nObama. During the campaign the President promised to ``crack down on \nmortgage fraud professionals found guilty of fraud by increasing \nenforcement and creating new criminal penalties.''\n  The President made good in his promise in his budget, calling on FBI \nagents ``to investigate mortgage fraud and white collar crime,'' and \nmore Federal prosecutors and civil attorneys ``to protect investors, \nthe market, and the Federal Government's investment of resources in the \nfinancial crisis, and the American public.''\n  As taxpayers, we all have a stake in this. If these people are able \nto get away with their fraud, if they are able to get away with \nsiphoning off this money, we taxpayers pay the bill in the long run. \nThose who are hit with the fraud pay far more than that. They may pay \nwith their life savings, with their homes, with everything they have \never worked for.\n  This bipartisan Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act is a chance to \nauthorize the necessary additional resources to detect, fight, and \ndeter fraud that robs the American people and the American taxpayers of \ntheir funds. Investing resources in detecting and deterring fraud \nyields dividends for the American people. That is what this bill would \ndo, and we should pass it without further delay.\n  I want my colleagues to know, at some point, if people are not here \nto offer amendments, we will call up and vote on the amendments that \nare pending and then go to final passage. I know the Democratic and \nRepublican leaders talked about a budget matter that has to come up \nthat will probably take us into the evening. I am trying to save the \ntime of all Senators, so I urge Senators to come because at some point \neverything that is pending is going to be called up and is going to be \nvoted on up or down. I would at least like to have the Senators on the \nfloor who are sponsoring them. Then we will go to final passage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1002\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 1002 to the bill be brought up and made pending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1002.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, on October 7, 2008, Congress passed the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program as part of the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act--or TARP--and allocated $700 billion for the purchase \nof toxic assets from banks with the goal of restoring liquidity to the \nfinancial sector and restarting the flow of credit in our markets.\n  The Department of Treasury, without consultation from Congress, \nchanged the purpose of the TARP and began injecting capital into \nfinancial institutions through a program called the Capital Purchase \nProgram rather than purchasing toxic assets.\n  Financial lending was not increased with the implementation of CPP, \nand the expenditure of $218 billion of TARP funds disputes the goal of \nthe program. Those receiving funding through the CPP are now faced with \nadditional restrictions related to accepting that funding.\n  A number of community banks and large financial institutions have \nexpressed their desire to return their CPP funds to the Department of \nTreasury, and Treasury has begun the process of accepting receipt of \nthose funds. However, because of the financial stress test Treasury is \ncurrently conducting, it is possible that Treasury will restrict banks \nfrom returning funds they received from the CPP.\n  In his testimony before the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel on \nApril 21, 2009, earlier this week, Secretary Geithner stated that \nTreasury estimates $134.6 billion of TARP funds are still available. \nWhat is important about that figure is he includes $25 billion which \nthey expect to receive back from banks under CPP. Geithner also stated \nthat he believed $25 billion is a conservative number, and private \nanalysts predict more will be returned.\n  Section 120 of the Emergency Stabilization Act terminated the \nauthority for TARP funds on December 31, 2009, and the Secretary can \nrequest an extension to the deadline not later than 2 years after \nenactment. Keep in mind that this restriction only applies to \nTreasury's issuance of new loans and does not cover the reuse of \npreviously issued assistance that was returned to the Treasury.\n  Essentially, to summarize what my amendment does, it requires \nTreasury to use any of the funds that are recovered through TARP to \nreduce the national debt. Basically, this amendment prevents the \nTreasury from reallocating money for other purposes. The amendment \nestablishes the public debt reduction payment account and requires \nTreasury to deposit any amounts received from repayment of financial \nassistance through TARP into this account. The Secretary of the \nTreasury must use the money in the public debt reduction payment \naccount to pay, redeem, or buy any Government obligation included in \nthe public debt. The obligations paid, redeemed, or bought are canceled \nand cannot be reissued. In addition, the statutory debt limit is \nautomatically reduced by any amount equal to funds that are deposited \nin this account.\n  I think the amendment is very straightforward, and it really is \ndirected at ensuring that the taxpayer dollars that were allocated for \nthe TARP program, which, as I said before, was about $700 billion last \nfall, much of which has been expended but much of which now is in the \nprocess of being repaid, assuming, again, the mechanism is put in place \nto allow the Treasury to take receipt of funds that banks wish to \nrepay, TARP funds which they wish to repay--with that money coming into \nthe Treasury--and as I said before, Secretary Geithner earlier this \nweek indicated that it would probably be about $25 billion, at least \nthat we know of now, and there are predictions that it could be much \nmore, that money comes back into the Treasury and could be recycled, \nreused--what we want to do and what my amendment does is it ensures \nthat those TARP funds that are repaid by banks actually go to reduce \nthe public debt.\n  We know we have incurred an enormous amount of debt. In fact, the \ninspector general, Neil Barofsky, stated in his quarterly report to \nCongress that 12 separate programs are being funded under TARP, \ninvolving up to $3 trillion of Government and public funds. Amazingly, \nthat is equivalent to the size of the entire Federal budget. This is \ncertainly not what I believe Congress intended or was told, for that \nmatter, the funding would be used for. So Congress needs to have a role \nin this. If the administration wants additional authority under TARP, \nthey should come here. Congress retains, under the Constitution, the \npower of the purse.\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\n  What this amendment simply does is directs those funds that come back \nin as a result of repayments by banks of TARP funds into the Federal \nTreasury, that those funds go toward reducing the Federal debt, which, \nas we all know, based on the budget that was passed a couple of weeks \nago, is going to double in 5 years and triple in 10, at a rate of $1 \ntrillion a year. The average deficit over the next 10 years, by the end \nof the 10-year period, will amount to $17 trillion. The very least we \ncan do for the taxpayers of this country is ensure that TARP funds that \nare repaid by banks, the taxpayer dollars that were extended to help \nrecapitalize the banks, when those are no longer necessary and banks \ngive that money back to the Treasury, Treasury receives that, that \nthose funds not be recycled, reused, go to some discretionary program \nto fund other programs of Government, but that they be used to reduce \nthe Federal debt. I believe the taxpayers deserve that. This amendment, \nNo. 1002, would do that. So I would hope my colleagues will support it \nand, in my view, make it very clear that tax dollars expended under \nTARP, when repaid, are going to go to debt reduction and not be used \nfor some other Federal Government program.\n  That is what the amendment does. I would urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank my friend from South Dakota for \nhis courtesy in talking to me first about the amendment. As I pointed \nout to him, these are matters before the Banking Committee. The \nJudiciary Committee has really got nothing to do with it, the same as \nmany of these. I will wait for Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby to \nrespond; I will not.\n  I am going to make a unanimous consent request. I have notified both \nsides of this. There is a Boxer-Snowe amendment No. 1000. I ask \nunanimous consent that at 10:50--I realize it is going to be objected \nto, but I am trying to save both Republicans and Democrats from being \nhere until 2 o'clock tomorrow morning because of the bill that comes up \nafter this. I ask unanimous consent--and if this is objected to, I will \nrepeat the request later on--that at 10:50 the pending business be set \naside, the Boxer-Snowe amendment No. 1000 be brought up, there be 8 \nminutes of debate evenly divided before a vote, and that it then be in \norder to go to a rollcall vote on the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have been advised that there would be an objection \nbecause they have not heard from the Banking Committee, from Senator \nDodd and Senator Shelby. I would urge them to come to the floor so we \ncan move forward, as most of the amendments pending or about to be \npending have absolutely nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the \nJudiciary Committee, have nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the \nbill on the floor, have everything to do with a bill that is coming up \nnext week from the Banking Committee. So I would urge the Banking \nCommittee to come to the floor and speak to the amendments that are all \nwithin the jurisdiction of their committee.\n  I mention this because if we don't, the other alternative is to \naccept everything and go immediately to final passage. I don't think \nthat would be responsible because then the fraud bill that virtually \neverybody in this body, Republicans and Democrats, supports is going to \ndie because it won't go past the other body. I realize every Senator \nhas a right to offer any amendment he or she wants, but at some point \nwe have to be realistic. If we are against the people who are \ncommitting fraud on the American taxpayers, something for which all of \nus have made speeches that we are in favor of stopping them--newspapers \nfrom the right to the left have editorialized in favor of stopping \nthem--let's be honest and actually pass a bill that does it. The \nmessage amendments should wait until an appropriate bill that has \nsomething to do with them.\n  I am also trying to help Senators. We are going to complete this bill \nbefore we go to budget matters. We can complete it easily by noon. As \nSenators know, I have supported Republican amendments that came up \nyesterday. They have all been accepted, including an amendment by \nSenator Grassley and myself. But we want to complete this legislation. \nI am perfectly willing to stay here all night long to finish this and \nthe budget. But every hour we take on this is an hour longer on the \nbudget. It is somewhat frustrating that Senators who have a concern \ncan't find time to show up on the floor. Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle don't have time to show up on the floor on a bill which we \nwere notified 3 weeks ago was going to be on the floor at this time. I \nurge them to do so. Because as soon as these amendments are disposed of \none way or the other, we will go to final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate the observations of the Senator from Vermont. \nIt is a bill that is broadly supported. I understand the objection he \nwill raise with respect to his committee's jurisdiction and what the \nbill covers.\n  With regard to my amendment, there is a connection between the \nunderlying bill and what we are trying to accomplish. I previously \nreferenced the inspector general's report about 12 separate programs \nbeing funded under TARP that involve up to $3 trillion in government \nand public funds. Bear in mind, this report spans 247 pages. In that \nreport, it says the very character of the bailout program makes it \n``inherently vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse, including \nsignificant issues related to conflicts of interest facing fund \nmanagers, collusion between participants, and vulnerabilities to money \nlaundering.''\n  I believe this amendment is related to the underlying bill which \ndeals with fraud recovery. The inspector general's report bears that \nout.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, while the Senator from South Dakota is in \nthe Chamber, if I may ask him a question, we also have amendment No. \n982 offered by Senator Coburn which allows the unused TARP funds to pay \nfor the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. I ask the Senator if the \nCoburn amendment and his amendment are mutually exclusive?\n  Mr. THUNE. In response, Madam President, to the Senator from Vermont, \nmy amendment would prevent funds from being reused, recycled, that were \ndirected to debt reduction. I guess my short answer, without having \nreviewed the Coburn amendment carefully, would be, I suspect, that they \nare probably mutually exclusive.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator. I have read it carefully, and that \nwas my conclusion. This is a matter more in line with the Banking \nCommittee, and I will let them speak to it. This is unprecedented, that \nwe have amendments on bills, whether this one or others, that are \nmutually exclusive. I did note that. I thank my friend from South \nDakota for his comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 994\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up amendment No. 994.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 994.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of Troubled Asset Relief Program funds \n       for the purchase of common stock, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITATION ON USE OF TARP FUNDS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on and after \n     April 22, 2009, no funds made available to carry out the \n     Troubled Asset Relief Program may be used for the acquisition \n     of ownership of the common stock of any financial institution \n     assisted under title I of the Emergency Economic \n     Stabilization Act of 2008, either directly or through a \n     conversion of preferred stock or future direct capital \n     purchases.\n\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, our economy has shed 3.3 million jobs in \nthe last 5 months. The Dow Jones is down 25 percent since September. \nWhen the bank bailout or TARP was conceived, it was conceived, \nironically, to save the market. We had been told by both President Bush \nand President Obama that we needed this massive spending in order to \nget the financial markets working again and the economy moving. It has \nbeen 6 months since Congress gave away $700 billion to the Bush \nadministration with essentially no strings attached. The Obama \nadministration has, unfortunately, continued conducting massive and \nrisky experiments in central planning since taking control of the TARP \nin January. We need to remember that we have yet to use this money the \nway it was promised.\n  We were told, when this money was requested during the last months of \nthe Bush administration, that if we didn't have all this money to buy \nthe toxic assets, the world financial market would collapse. I am \nafraid we were not told the truth. Clearly, the world financial market \ndid not collapse, although it continues to have trouble. But we did not \nbuy up any of the toxic assets, and the world financial market didn't \ncollapse. The Bush administration--and now the Obama administration--\nset about figuring out different ways to use the money rather than \nadmitting the ideas they had were not right.\n  Sixteen of the 19 banks that received the largest amounts of this \nTARP money are loaning less now than they did when the money was \nprovided. We received a report this week that the design of the TARP \nwas ripe for corruption, waste, and fraud. There are already a number \nof cases in the media that this is happening. Yet we continue to toy \nwith this money in ways that are unprecedented. Now the Obama \nadministration has announced President Obama is going to use the money \nin a totally different way. We need to look at what they are proposing.\n  What our economy needs now more than anything else is certainty, \ncertainty that the Government will not undo contracts retroactively, \nwhich we are talking about doing here, certainty that spending will be \nbrought under control to avoid future tax increases and runaway \ninflation, and certainty that failure will not be rewarded by a \ngovernment bailout. Of course, there has been anything but certainty \nfrom our Government in the last several months. Government intervention \nhas become the norm rather than the exception.\n  Now we understand the Treasury Department has concocted a new scheme \nto convert these loans, which are preferred stock in certain banks, \ninto common equity in order to increase those banks' capital. This is \nonly a paper change. We move it from a debt to an asset, and we say we \nhave done something. The problem is, when the Government has common \nstock in banks, it owns banks. It would likely have positions on the \nboard. The taxpayer, who is making this money available, is at risk. If \na bank goes under, the common stock is gone. So we are taking what was \nsome security for taxpayers and shifting it to another place. We are \ncrossing a dangerous line where the Government owns and controls banks \nand insurance companies, auto companies, a line we have never crossed \nbefore as a country, a country based on free markets, not central \nplanning by government.\n  The American people are starting to send us a signal that they are \nconcerned, alarmed by the amount of spending, all these bailouts, the \nrewarding of failure, the debt we are creating. We saw about a million \nAmericans last week in numerous tea parties across the country take to \nthe streets, hold up their signs, express to their elected officials \nthat we need to stop this out-of-control spending and waste going on in \nWashington. Loaning banks money temporarily is one thing. It is \nsomething I oppose because I have seen government operate long enough \nto know that it can't do it effectively. It can't do it without waste \nand fraud and corruption.\n  Our own Treasury Department has now told us that. We can't put this \nmuch money out there without bad things happening. We need to let the \nmarket work. If we have banks that are too sick to succeed, then we \nneed to allow them to fail while we protect the depositors in that \nbank.\n  The amendment I offer focuses attention on the idea of government \nowning banks. It is pretty simple. It would prohibit the Government \nfrom converting TARP loans to common stock. We have heard of other \namendments that would allow banks to give this money back and allow the \nmoney to go to paying down debt. This is not a slush fund that we \ncreated for politicians to play with, to scheme in different ways on \nhow we could come up with new ways to spend money we don't have. It is \nall borrowed money. If it is not needed the way it was intended, it \nneeds to come back to the taxpayer rather than what is happening now. \nThe idea that we are going to have the Federal Government actually own \nstock in banks, insurance companies, and other private companies is an \nidea we need to stay away from.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will support this amendment that simply \nprohibits our Government from converting what was supposed to be loans, \nwhat was promised to be loans, what was promised to be used to buy bad \nassets so banks could loan again, it would prohibit this money from \nbeing used for common stock and ownership in the banking system.\n  I thank the Chair for the time and encourage my colleagues to support \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman giving me this \ntime to offer this amendment. We have adopted an Isakson amendment. We \nhave a McCain-Dorgan amendment. This is a similar amendment, but I \nthink it gets to the root of the problem. It does not cost very much, \nand it actually will tell us something we need to know.\n  The underlying assumption with the bill is that fraud is the primary, \nif not the sole, cause of this crisis. That may be true. We do not know \nthat. But what we do not know is how much we as Members of Congress \nplayed and the extent to which we played a role in helping create this \ncrisis. This is a fairly straightforward amendment that asks the IG to \ncome give us information so we get the answers to the question about \nour own role in the evolution of the problems we find today.\n  What we do know is the GSEs undertook an unprecedented assumption of \nsubprime and all-day loans, and those need to be investigated--the \nextent of them, the amount. We also know they invested more than $1 \ntrillion in those loans. But what we do not know is the volume, the \ntiming. What we do not know is the impact of the significant amount of \nlobbying by these GSEs and what effect that had on policies and \nprocedures both within the administration and the Congress.\n  For example, when did Freddie and Fannie begin to purchase large \nquantities of subprime and all-day loans? In what years were those \ntypes of purchases the highest? To what extent were these purchases \ninduced by congressional action or executive order? To what extent were \nthose purchases induced by the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment affordable housing regulations issued in 1995? What actions \nby Fannie and Freddie contributed to the overvaluation of mortgage-\nbacked securities?\n  The amendment also looks to the possibility that congressional action \ncould have contributed to the risky changes in behavior of Fannie and \nFreddie. What we know is, between the 2000 and 2008 election cycles, \nGSEs and their employees contributed more than $14.6 million to the \nfunds of both Senators and representatives. We also know Fannie spent \n$79.5 million in that period and Freddie spent $94.9 million in that \nperiod on lobbying Congress. Mr. President, $170 million was spent \nlobbying Congress making them the 20th and 13th largest lobbying \nspenders in the country.\n  This amendment will assure and ensure that some of the toughest \nquestions are asked regarding the GSEs'--Fannie Mae's and Freddie \nMac's--special relationships with Congress and whether any conflict \ncreated by those relationships influenced the GSEs' behavior, \nespecially to the taxpayers' detriment.\n  It requires the inspector general to study what political \ncontributions were made, what lobbying expenditures were made, what \ncontributions were made to any other lobbying organization.\n  It is a compromise step. It is something we already have the people \nin place for. It is something they have the access to the numbers for. \nWe ought to be able to get that.\n  We have a mess. Usually, as a physician when I have a mess, I start \nthinking back: What did I do before? And what caused part of the mess? \nWhere was I wrong in my diagnosis of the signs, symptoms, and history? \nAnd then what do I do about it?\n  If we do not look through the IG at these things, then it is highly \nunlikely--no matter how many commissions we put together because \ncommissions are going to ask for this anyway--but we are going to ask \nfor it as a special report from the IG under this amendment.\n  There are a lot of additional considerations, and I will not take \ntime on the floor at this time to do that. But if you want to have a \ntransparent Congress, this is the first question we have to ask: How \nmuch were we involved? How effective were the lobbying efforts to \nchange things that were detrimental? Maybe they were positive. But the \nfact is, we ought to know those things.\n  The idea is we will be transparent with the American people, both in \nterms of the lobbying efforts, the contributions they made, and the \ntiming--not just for Congress but also the executive branch; where we \nlook at the actions of both of those--so the American people can see \nthe culpability. Where is it? I happen to believe it is right here in \nthis body, us. We allowed this to happen. I think the onus of the blame \nneeds to be here rather than pointing at other people.\n  That is not to distract from the idea that we ought to go after \nfraud. But the biggest fraud is to deny the fact that we had some \nculpability, and this amendment is designed to measure how much \nculpability we had by using the IG, the inspector general, to tell us \nthis very specific information.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I was distracted in another conversation. \nSenator Coburn left the floor. I wished to speak to him about his \namendment because it appears to have already been covered in the \nIsakson-Conrad amendment. I would like to ask if he also feels that \nway. I would hope he might come back to the floor so we could discuss \nthat.\n  I also wish to notify the other side I am about to renew my unanimous \nconsent request for a vote on the Boxer amendment. I will not until \nthey have time to talk to the Republican side. There is no Republican \non the floor right now. But in a few minutes, I will renew my request \nfor a rollcall vote on that amendment.\n  In the meantime, Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 986, 987, 988, and 989\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I have an amendment pending--I believe the \nnumber is amendment No. 989--and I wish to speak to that amendment and \nthree other amendments which differ only in the amount of a cap on \nrecoveries. The amendments pending are amendments Nos. 989, 988, and \n987. Madam President, 986 is the pending amendment. So we will get this \nstraightened out.\n  Let me speak to the issue first generally, and then I will engage my \ncolleague in a couple of unanimous consent requests that may resolve \nthe issue. If not, then we can vote on the final one.\n  The point of these amendments is to limit the amount that can be \ndeducted from the money that is due to the Government under the False \nClaims Act as compensation for what are called private realtors. A \nprivate realtor is a whistleblower or an investigator who goes to court \nwith evidence that the Government has been defrauded and is entitled to \nmoney under the False Claims Act. In order to encourage these private \nparties to come forward, the False Claims Act not only entitles these \nprivate realtors to recover from the defendant their costs and expenses \nfor investigating and pressing the claims but also allows the private \nrealtor to receive a portion of the proceeds due to the United States.\n  I think we would all agree it is right and proper that the private \nrealtors be compensated for exposing incidents for which the Federal \nGovernment has been defrauded. Such actions have saved the Government \nbillions of dollars over the years.\n  Unfortunately, the formula for compensating private realtors uses a \npercentage range to award a portion of the Government's recovery to the \nrealtor. The law allows the private realtor to collect up to 30 percent \nof the proceeds that are due to the Government.\n  Now, when this formula was first set back in 1986, I don't think any \nof us contemplated that the massive billion-dollar recoveries we have \nseen today would allow this kind of recovery to the private parties as \nwell. So although\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\nI think we all agree whistleblowers deserve to be compensated when they \nsave the Government money, I would also think we could agree there has \nto be some limit; that they don't deserve to be grossly \novercompensated, especially when that compensation comes at the expense \nof the Federal Treasury.\n  Let me note a few cases. I will put this entire statement in the \nRecord which has a lot of other cases as well, but my colleagues will \nget the idea from just a few that I will mention.\n  Private realtors shared $95 million as their share of a $559 million \ncivil settlement paid to the United States by TAP Pharmaceutical \nProducts. Private realtors shared $78 million as their share of a $438 \nmillion Federal settlement paid to the United States by Eli Lilly. A \nprivate realtor will receive $47.8 million as his share of a recently \nannounced $325 million settlement paid to the Government by Northrop. \nAnother will share $46.4 million as their share of a $375 million \nsettlement paid to the United States by Cephelon. There are several \nmore of these cases, all in the $30-, $40-, $50 million range, for \npayments that have been made to the Government as a result of this law.\n  The point is, when they are sharing in that much of the proceeds, \nthey are denying the taxpayers the benefit of the False Claims Act \nwhich was, of course, intended to benefit the Treasury and not to \nsignificantly benefit these private realtors.\n  So, again, it is fair to generously compensate them when they help \nexpose malfeasance that has cost the Federal Government money. We want \nthem to receive an incentive to blow the whistle on fraud or \ncorruption. However, the amounts I have described--$95 million in just \none case, for example--are wildly in excess of what is necessary to \nspur such whistleblowing. These amounts all come at the expense of the \nTreasury.\n  Let me indicate the kind of savings the Government could achieve \nunder this amendment.\n  The first request I will make today would cap the private realtor \nrecovery at either $5 million or 300 percent of the expenses and costs \nin investigating and proving fraud against the Government. In other \nwords, it is sort of a triple damages: for the amount of money they put \ninto it, there is, in effect, a 400-percent recovery; they get 100 \npercent of their expenses, plus another 300 percent above that. It \nseems to me this provides more than adequate incentive for the \nwhistleblowers who become aware of fraud and therefore expose it.\n  In the eight cases I have described in my statement, five of which I \nmentioned, private realtors received more than $427 million at the \nexpense of the Government. When just one case awards the private \nrealtors $95 million, the numbers add up pretty quickly. So under this \nrequest I will make in just a moment, these same private realtors would \nstill have received a grand total of at least $40 million from the \nGovernment. Under my amendment, the Government would have been able to \nkeep an additional $387 million. So think about it. This amendment \nwould have saved the Government $387 million.\n  So let me conclude at this point. I have been advised there are very \nfew law firms--but some law firms--that specialize in these cases. \nObviously, they are fighting the amendment because quite a little \ncottage industry has grown. But I would note to my colleagues if my \nrecommendation is not accepted--if my colleagues conclude that $5 \nmillion is not enough for the Government to pay a whistleblower--then \nwhat I would suggest is we make that amount higher, and I will offer \nsubsequent requests to support a higher amount.\n  I wish to note as well there will inevitably be new cases in which \noutsized awards are paid at the expense of the Government's recovery. \nFor example, just last week, a False Claims Act suit against Quest \nDiagnostics resulted in a $302 million recovery for the Federal \nGovernment, but out of that amount, the Government was forced to pay \n$45 million to the private realtor. Had my amendment been law, the \nprivate realtor would still have received at least $5 million for \nexposing the fraud, but the Treasury would have received, and therefore \nsaved, an additional $40 million.\n  So let me ask, rather than having a vote on each of these four \namendments--and I have discussed this with the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and we have had a genial discussion; and I suspect \nI know, at least the first couple of times, the fate of my unanimous \nconsent requests. Nonetheless, amendment No. 989 would provide a $5 \nmillion cap.\n  I would therefore ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 989 be \nconsidered and that the Senate be on record as supporting amendment No. \n989 with the $5 million cap.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will object, and I will just take a \nmoment to explain.\n  First off, I would note, as he typically does, the Senator from \nArizona came and talked to me before and was very straightforward with \nwhat he was going to do.\n  This talks about recoveries available under the False Claims Act. I \nthink the Senate expert on the False Claims Act is Senator Grassley, a \nsenior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Grassley \nopposes this, as do I. I know there are going to be other amounts the \ndistinguished Republican leader is going to bring up, but my reason in \nopposing them--and he has explained each one of them to me ahead of \ntime, so there is no surprise--but I will oppose them because I believe \nwithout whistleblowers, a lot of these billions of dollars in fraud \nthat have been found wouldn't have been found. Without the \nwhistleblowers, the Government--the American taxpayers--wouldn't \nrecover so much.\n  The False Claims Act--and, again, Senator Grassley and others were \nthe leaders in putting that together--has brought back more than $22 \nbillion into the U.S. Treasury.\n  Now, it has a balanced approach in providing incentives for said \nwhistleblowers. They share in such recoveries if it is warranted and if \nit is approved by the judge. A judge has to approve it. It has worked \nout very well. Rather than there being an arbitrary cap, I would rather \nleave it to the judge to make the determination. Simply saying, well, \nwe will limit it to three times the cost, then I worry about seeing a \npadding of expenses. I think it is very well balanced the way it is, \nincluding having a judge make the final decision.\n\n  I think one of the things we all agree upon--I am sure the Senator \nfrom Arizona and I agree--is that we have to find fraud, we have to \nroot it out, and we have to bring those who commit fraud to justice. \nWhat I am thinking about, as Senator Grassley has pointed out in the \npast, as have I, we have to give an incentive to the whistleblowers to \nbring the case. After all, we have seen all too often a whistleblower \nwill alert us to the fraud, and the first thing that happens is they \nlose their job. They often risk retaliation. In fact, if they are \nturning in their coworkers or their supervisors and bringing out the \nfraud, this could be life-altering. It could actually change their \nprofessional career, often for the worse. They are looked at as the bad \nguys, but they are not the bad guys; they are the good guys. We ought \nto reward them.\n  I will vote against it in this case. I object to considering it. I \nknow the Senator from Arizona is going to have further amendments, but \nI just want him to know--and I want my colleagues to know what I have \ntold him privately. I commend him for--as we have always done in cases \nwe have had--talking to me ahead of time, as I have with him when I \nhave had amendments or matters that may involve him.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The request has been made. Is \nthere objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the points made by the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee. There does need to be a reward, and there \nis some subjective judgment in what kind of a cap is appropriate for \nthe reasons that he pointed out. As a result, reasonable people could \ndiffer as to whether a $5 million cap would be too much.\n  For that reason, I indicated if the chairman thought it was too much, \nI would suggest doubling the amount to a $10 million cap which might be \nappropriate. That is actually encompassed in amendment No. 988.\n\n[[Page S4611]]\n\n  So at this time I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 988 be \nconsidered pending and be adopted by unanimous consent, setting a $10 \nmillion cap on these recoveries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I indicated to my friend earlier, I \nwould object to that, and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The minority whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as I said, I think it is going to be a little \nharder to object to a $20 million cap, but at this time let me ask--\nagain, this is subjective. How much of a reward is enough to cause \npeople to come forward? Given that we have this cottage industry of \nfirms that has found they can make a lot of money on these cases, it \nseems to me there is adequate reward for whistleblowers who usually--\nand I am sure the chairman would agree--usually come forward simply \nbecause they see something that is wrong and they have the moral \ncourage to come forward and say: We don't think this practice is right. \nAnd they usually don't do it for the financial reward. The law firms \nthat are involved do very well out of this.\n  So my last unanimous consent request would be to consider amendment \nNo. 987 as pending, which would set a $20 million cap on these awards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I hate to \ntry to fix something that I don't think is broken. The False Claims Act \nhas worked very well for the U.S. taxpayers. It has worked well. I know \nthe Senator from Iowa worked so hard in putting this together in the \nfirst place. It has brought more than $22 billion back into the \nTreasury. The awards to whistleblowers have to be approved by a judge. \nI don't want to fix something that is not broken, so, therefore, I will \nobject, and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The minority whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, finally, amendment No. 986, which is pending, \nsets a $50 million cap.\n  I certainly agree with the chairman that you don't want to fix \nsomething that is not broken. I submit that back in 1986, a long time \nago, these multibillion-dollar awards were not contemplated, and times \nhave changed. In the 20 or 30 years' passage of time, we have seen this \ncottage industry of litigation grow, when the kinds of awards that can \nbe recovered--for example, a $97 million award--are simply beyond the \npale. They were not contemplated. So it is broken to the extent that we \nhave no upper limit in a case such as that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 986\n\n  Therefore, I call up amendment 986, which is pending, and I request \nthe yeas and nays on that amendment. If the chairman wishes to respond, \nI will withhold calling for the vote until he has responded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator ask for the regular order on \nhis amendment?\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nwishes to speak on this amendment, and we will soon have a rollcall \nvote. I ask the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Iowa if we \ncould withhold for 2 minutes in order for the Senator from Wisconsin to \nspeak on an amendment of his, and then we will go back to the amendment \nof the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 990\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 990.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 990.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect older Americans from misleading and fraudulent \n marketing practices, with the goal of increasing retirement security)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. GRANTS TO STATES FOR ENHANCED PROTECTION OF SENIORS \n                   FROM BEING MISLEAD BY FALSE DESIGNATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) many seniors are targeted by salespersons and advisers \n     using misleading certifications and professional \n     designations;\n       (2) many certifications and professional designations used \n     by salespersons and advisers represent limited training or \n     expertise, and may in fact be of no value with respect to \n     advising seniors on financial and estate planning matters, \n     and far too often, such designations are obtained simply by \n     attending a weekend seminar and passing an open book, \n     multiple choice test;\n       (3) many seniors have lost their life savings because \n     salespersons and advisers holding a misleading designation \n     have steered them toward products that were unsuitable for \n     them, given their retirement needs and life expectancies;\n       (4) seniors have a right to clearly know whether they are \n     working with a qualified adviser who understands the products \n     and is working in their best interest or a self-interested \n     salesperson or adviser advocating particular products; and\n       (5) many existing State laws and enforcement measures \n     addressing the use of certifications, professional \n     designations, and suitability standards in selling financial \n     products to seniors are inadequate to protect senior \n     investors from salespersons and advisers using such \n     designations.\n       (b) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``misleading designation''--\n       (A) means the use of a purported certification, \n     professional designation, or other credential, that indicates \n     or implies that a salesperson or adviser has special \n     certification or training in advising or servicing seniors; \n     and\n       (B) does not include any legitimate certification, \n     professional designation, license, or other credential, if--\n       (i) it has been offered by an academic institution having \n     regional accreditation; or\n       (ii) it meets the standards for certifications, licenses, \n     and professional designations outlined by the North American \n     Securities Administrators Association (in this section \n     referred to as the ``NASAA'') Model Rule on the Use of \n     Senior-Specific Certifications and Professional Designations, \n     or it was issued by or obtained from any State;\n       (2) the term ``financial product'' means securities, \n     insurance products (including insurance products which pay a \n     return, whether fixed or variable), and bank and loan \n     products;\n       (3) the term ``misleading or fraudulent marketing'' means \n     the use of a misleading designation in selling or advising a \n     senior in the sale of a financial product;\n       (4) the term ``senior'' means any individual who has \n     attained the age of 62 or older; and\n       (5) the term ``State'' means each of the 50 States, the \n     District of Columbia, and the unincorporated territories of \n     Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n       (c) Grant Program.--The Attorney General of the United \n     States (in this section referred to as the ``Attorney \n     General'')--\n       (1) shall establish a program in accordance with this \n     section to provide grants to States--\n       (A) to investigate and prosecute misleading and fraudulent \n     marketing practices;

Mr. President, I speak today in support of an amendment \nthat would protect older Americans from unscrupulous financial \nadvisers.\n  In these tough economic times, seniors are discovering that their \nlife savings have lost so much value they may not be able to fund their \nretirement. Desperate for advice, they look toward investment advisers \nfor strategies to ride out this economic storm. Unfortunately, we have \nlearned that some are placing their trust in so-called ``senior \ninvestment advisers,'' who in many cases are one step above scam \nartists. These individuals often have limited or no education or \ntraining though they claim titles with legitimate-sounding names.\n  We know that an attorney must go to school for 3 years and pass a \nState bar exam. A CPA must have a college degree, an additional year of \nstudy, and must pass a national exam. Neither can offer their \nprofessional services without those credentials. Seniors should be able \nto trust the people who invest their money. They should not be worried \nthat the title after their adviser's name is scarcely more than a \nmarketing ploy.\n  This amendment would create a new grant program to assist States in \ntheir efforts to protect seniors from misleading financial adviser \ndesignations by encouraging them to adopt provisions outlined in the \nNorth American Securities Administrators Association's and the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners' model rules on the use of \nsenior designations.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the first point I wish to make is that \nwith the false claims provisions in the Leahy-Grassley bill, which \ndeals with other provisions as well, but the False Claims Act is \nessential to accomplishing the overall purposes of the bill, along with \nother tools to do it--to get rid of fraud. We are trying to just, in \nthis bill, in a very rifle shot way, correct some court opinions that \nhave been detrimental and weaken the False Claims Act. That is all we \nare trying to accomplish in this bill that deals with bigger things as \nwell.\n  What Senator Kyl is bringing up is a legitimate subject of discussion \nbecause it has been brought up at other times since passage of the \nFalse Claims Act 22 years ago. I don't say it is not legitimate to \ndiscuss it. But there is broader false claims legislation in the \nJudiciary, and it ought to be discussed at a time when we have hearings \non this subject. There have been no hearings on this.\n  These amendments should be reviewed by the full committee under the \nregular order process. That is the first point I wish to make to \nSenator Kyl about why not to consider this amendment right now.\n  The second one is the point he made on how big of an award is big \nenough to incentivize people to turn in fraud.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe Kyl amendment, now pending, occur at 11:45 but that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided immediately preceding the vote. First, I make \nthat request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that there not \nbe any amendments to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the second point I wish to make before I \nget to my formal remarks is on the question the Senator from Arizona \nraised about how big of an incentive is enough to get reported. That is \na legitimate question.\n  Here is my experience with 22 years of the False Claims Act, dealing \nwith whistleblowers, Government agencies listening to whistleblowers or \nnot, the Justice Department taking a case or not taking a case, or \nwhether the whistleblower initiates the case on their own. What I have \nfound is that the False Claims Act does not come up early in anybody's \nthought process--about initiating a thought process that there might be \nfraud out there and somebody ought to be investigating and get to the \nbottom of it. Usually,\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\nthe whistleblower has ample evidence of that or they wouldn't be doing \nit in the first place. They jeopardize their profession and their job \nin Government. That isn't right, but whistleblowers who want to do the \npatriotic thing actually jeopardize their professional future. What I \nhave found is they don't even know about the False Claims Act or about \ngetting a percentage of it. They don't even know about whistleblower \nprotection laws. They want to do the patriotic thing. They want to \nreport fraud.\n  So to talk about the award being the incentive to come forward, I \ndon't want to say that in some cases that may not be the case, but in \nmost cases these are patriotic people knowing about the fraudulent use \nof taxpayer money, they think it is wrong and ought to stop, and they \nthink it ought to stop within the agency. They don't get anywhere with \nthe agency, so they come to other people, and eventually along the \nline, probably, somebody says: You need to take this to court, and you \ncan get something out of this if you win and if you have a case. \nProbably the majority of them don't win. So they get nothing out of it. \nBut they are trying to be patriotic citizens.\n  I think that bringing up the issue of how much of an award is big \nenough to get this information out should not even be a part of the \ndebate. It is still something because we are talking about taxpayer \nmoney and what is an incentive to do this, but it ought to be discussed \nin a thoughtful way, not on an amendment to a bill that is trying to \ncorrect a few bad court decisions to get the False Claims Act back to \nits original purpose.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont for letting me cooperate with him on \nthis issue. The Senator from Vermont also recognizes that the False \nClaims Act is a very useful tool against fraud, which is the overall \npurpose of the rest of Senator Leahy's and my bill.\n  The other thing you have to remember is that this has brought in $22 \nbillion. Senator Leahy made that very clear. There are so many court \ncases I can tell you about where the Government, through the Justice \nDepartment, came in and tried to belittle the whistleblower, the \nclaimant, to reduce, or even eliminate, any access to an award; how \nmany times judges have had to berate people in the Justice Department. \nI am not talking about Presidents Obama, Bush, Reagan, Bush 1, or \nClinton; I am talking about several of them where you wouldn't even \nhave a case--in other words, saying to the prosecutor and the Justice \nDepartment: Do you realize you would not even have had a case without \nthis patriotic whistleblower coming forward?\n  More recently, there has been a case where the Justice Department \nasked not to proceed forward. The judge stepped in and said: We are \ngoing to go forward; there is something wrong here, and we are going to \nget to the bottom of it.\n  So we have $22 billion back because of patriotic Americans. Do you \nknow what. Just because the False Claims Act has been out there, it has \nbeen a preventive to fraud, like all the other tools Senator Leahy has \nin this bill that will not only help with prosecution, but the \npossibility of prosecution is going to be a preventive factor.\n  So I feel strongly that if the issue of an award limit comes up, it \nought to be discussed thoroughly and thoughtfully in a tool--the False \nClaims Act--which has proven its worth by $22 billion and a lot of \nunknown preventable fraud out there. We ought to think through it \nthoughtfully.\n  I want this amendment defeated. The False Claims Act is the No. 1 \ntool for recovering taxpayer dollars lost to waste, fraud, and abuse. \nWhistleblowers who bring fraud cases on behalf of the Government, known \nas qui tam relators, often risk everything to uncover truth.\n  Currently, the False Claims Act provides a reward to whistleblowers \nwho come forward with good-faith allegations of fraud, waste, or abuse \nof Government dollars.\n  They are allowed to file a lawsuit on behalf of the Federal \nGovernment, and the case remains under judicial seal in Federal court. \nThe Justice Department then decides to join a case or not join a case. \nIf the Justice Department joins a case and the case is successful, a \nwhistleblower can recover 15 to 25 percent of the funds recovered. If \nthe Justice Department does not join--then it is going to be a much \nmore difficult process for the whistleblower and his or her counsel--\nthe whistleblower can go forward with the case and if they are \nsuccessful, they can recover more, somewhere between 25 and 30 percent, \ndepending upon the judge.\n  While some are arguing that this represents a windfall for \nwhistleblowers, the statistics paint a different picture.\n  In fact, in cases where the Department of Justice joins the \nwhistleblower, the average share for the whistleblower is not 25 \npercent or 30 percent, it is 16 percent. Compare that 16 percent with \nthe percentage it takes to administer Government generally, throughout \nGovernment--about 12 percent. Do you, Mr. President, think there are \nenough people in the Justice Department, enough FBI people to know \nwhere all the skeletons are buried, where all the frauds are being \ncommitted? No. This average award is not too far out of line with the \naverage administrative costs of Government.\n  There have been 6,197 qui tam complaints filed since 1986 which have \nresulted in $13.7 billion in recoveries to the Federal Government. That \naverages about $2.2 million recovered for complaint filed.\n  In these 6,197 cases, the Government has paid qui tam whistleblowers \n$2.2 billion in awards. That means the average share award for a qui \ntam whistleblower is about $350,000. This is hardly a windfall that one \nwould seek, particularly if one is ruining their professional career by \nbeing a whistleblower, coming forth to do what is patriotic, to do what \nis right. It is, in fact, an incentive that helps fuel complaints \ncoming in.\n  However, if we start adding new caps to the already existing \nwhistleblower caps, we could reduce the incentive for whistleblowers to \nproceed through the cases--or coming forward in the first place--that \nwould help us then recover billions of dollars.\n  I wish to share the story of Tina Gonter who was a qui tam \nwhistleblower who testified before the Judiciary Committee last year. \nMs. Gonter worked closely with the Government and went undercover at \nthe company for months collecting documents and evidence of a fraud \nagainst the Navy. She even wore a wire for the Federal agents of the \nDefense Department.\n  Ultimately, a couple of individuals went to jail as a result of Ms. \nGonter's work. But the Government refused to sue the contractor for \nfraud. Believe that, the Government refused to sue with obvious \nevidence. Ms. Gonter filed a false claims case against the company, and \nit was not joined by our own Justice Department. The judge in that case \neven scolded the Justice Department and the Navy for not joining the \ncase.\n  Ultimately, Ms. Gonter prevailed, and the contractor paid over $13 \nmillion to the Federal Government. Ms. Gonter received a share of that \nmoney, but had she not brought this case, the Justice Department and \nthe Defense Department would have been satisfied with simply putting \ntwo people in jail and allowing the contractor to walk away with the \nmoney it received for providing fraudulent product to the Navy. And it \nis not just a case of fraudulent product to the Navy. It is a serious \nsafety matter for the people in the military who put their lives on the \nline in the defense of our freedom.\n  That is only one example out of 6,197 that the False Claims Act \nprovides power to get fraudulent activity under control. It is a check \non the power of the Government bureaucracy to look the other way--that \nis what the Justice Department did in this case--and pretend that fraud \ndid not happen on their watch. However, it is fueled by courageous \nwhistleblowers, such as Tina Gonter, and without sufficient financial \nincentives to come forward and fight these cases for 5 to 10 years they \ncan take in court, we may lose this valuable tool against fraud.\n  It is about recovering money, taxpayers' money. I find it ironic--I \nhope people are listening now because there is a conflict here between \nmaybe people on my side of the aisle who think this is a good idea--I \nfind it very ironic that those outside groups supporting this amendment \nwere in staunch opposition to the idea of the Senate imposing any caps \non executive compensation at companies receiving bailout funds. Now \ninstead, they want to cap\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\nthe recovery of good-faith whistleblowers to come forward with claims \nof fraud at companies that are ripping off American taxpayers.\n  The False Claims Act works and will continue to work if we do not cut \nthe incentives for relators to go to court. The law already has a cap \nfor whistleblower recoveries. I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment which is based on a couple of extreme examples from outlier \ncases that are not the norm.\n  We have $22 billion coming in under this act. Early on, we fought the \ndefense industry to get this bill passed, and the defense industry \ntried to gut it after it was passed. When they could not because they \ndid not have the proper prestige, they came to the American hospital \nindustry to fight a front for them. That did not happen. I don't know \nexactly what groups are out there now backing all this. But when are \nyou ever going to realize that in this country, the taxpayers deserve \nsome respect? And if there is fraud in your industry, it is no holds \nbarred on the recovery and the preventing of fraud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the senior Senator from New \nYork has an amendment. While the senior Senator from Iowa is on the \nfloor, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the Senator from \nNew York to bring up his amendment--that the pending amendment be set \naside for 5 minutes--speak on it, and if there are no objections to it, \nit then be accepted, and we go back to the Kyl amendment so as not to \ninterfere with the unanimous consent agreement to have a vote on the \nKyl amendment at 11:45 a.m. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator repeat \nthe unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I can get the attention of the senior Republican, my \nrequest is that the Senator from New York be allowed to bring up his \namendment for 5 minutes, and at the conclusion of the 5 minutes, unless \nmore time is requested by unanimous consent, that the matter, if it can \nbe disposed of, be disposed of, but in any event, at the end of that \ntime, we go back to the Kyl amendment on which there is a unanimous \nconsent agreement for a rollcall vote at a quarter of 12.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, can I modify the request that I be \nrecognized to call up an amendment, not to have action on it, call up \nan amendment, spend 5 minutes on it following the Senator from New York \nto get my amendment pending?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I so modify it. That would still leave the amount of time \nSenator Kyl has requested prior to a vote on his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1006\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank you for recognizing me. I thank \nour chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, and one of our \nsenior Republican Members, Senator Grassley, for not only managing this \nbill but for introducing it. I am a cosponsor of the underlying bill, \nthe Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, because it provides much needed \ntools to go after fraudsters, crooks, and thieves, and other common \ncriminals who have taken advantage of a bad economy to rob unsuspecting \nAmericans of their savings.\n  I thank Senators Leahy, Grassley, Kaufman, and Specter, and all the \nother cosponsors of the bill for their hard work and making sure we \nfinally do something about financial crime.\n  From the beginning, however, I have been of the view that there was \none major omission--a glaring omission--from this bill. The bill would \nauthorize $165 million a year for the Department of Justice, including \n$75 million more for FBI agents, as well as money for prosecutors and \nfraud lawyers.\n  That is all to the good. It would also provide $30 million to the \nPostal Inspection Service, $30 million to the IG of the Department of \nHUD, $20 million for the Secret Service, all to investigate financial \nand mortgage fraud. But if one reads the list, one thing is missing, \nand that is the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Thanks to the hard work of many, including my cosponsor of this \namendment, Senator Shelby, and Senator Grassley, the lead Republican \nsponsor of the bill, we have come up with a compromise provision. \nInitially, on the amendment we were going to offer, Senator Grassley \nraised some very valid points, and we have been working in the last 2 \ndays to come to an agreement, and I am proud to say we have.\n  This amendment provides $20 million for SEC enforcement. It would \nalso give an additional $1 million to the SEC's Office of Inspector \nGeneral. I am pleased to have played a role in putting together this \npackage which will ultimately benefit the American public through safer \nmarkets and better policing of our financial system.\n  The authorization to the SEC is necessary for fighting exactly the \nkind of fraud that is covered by this bill. Leaving the SEC out of this \nbill is a little like fighting a war without the marines. The SEC is \noften the first line of enforcement before the criminal authorities get \ninvolved.\n  The SEC staffing decreased by 10 percent from 2005 to 2007. The \nagency has only begun to recover from these decreases. It is \nunderstaffed by more than 115 employees.\n  Shockingly, the SEC's technology budget, the budget that determines \nthe agency's ability to analyze what went wrong in the markets and who \ncaused it, is still only 50 percent of what it was in 2005.\n  We need to pass this bill now, and we need to adopt this amendment \nnow. Literally, every day there is a new story about a new fraud that \nrobbed guileless consumers of millions, sometimes billions, of dollars. \nOur authorizations for prosecutions after the S crisis, which I \nplayed a role in when I was in the House of Representatives, resulted \nfrom around 600 convictions and $130 million in ordered restitution \nbetween 1991 and 1995.\n  So far, even while the FBI is working on 2,000 mortgage fraud cases \nand while the SEC has opened more than three dozen investigations into \nsubprime-backed securities, we have not provided law enforcement with \nthe additional funds to put the bad guys before the courts and in jail, \neven though white-collar enforcement by the Federal Government has been \ndangerously depleted.\n  I want to point perhaps to one of the most high profile fraud cases \nin the history of our country--a case that was not brought soon \nenough--to explain why the SEC needs help, even though it also deserves \ncriticism and even outrage for their previous actions. This is, of \ncourse, the case of Bernard Madoff and the tens of billions of dollars \nhe stole from sophisticated and unsophisticated investors alike.\n  We don't know all the facts yet, but all signs point to some kind of \ndereliction of duty at the SEC. When we find out what went so horribly \nwrong, we will figure out how to fix it. But this much we know: The SEC \nreceives hundreds of thousands of tips a year about investment fraud. \nWe don't know why the SEC didn't catch on to the complaints of at least \none brave whistleblower, Harry Markopolos, and none of us here would \never excuse it. We can acknowledge, though, that the SEC does not have \nsufficient technical and human resources to assess sophisticated \ntrading patterns, complex financial instruments, and risk factors in \nthe marketplace. When a complaint comes in, even a detailed complaint, \nsuch as the one received from Mr. Markopolos, they did not effectively \ntriage it.\n\n  The SEC's budget has barely kept up with inflation and cost of living \nadjustments. It is not clear whether budget cuts caused them to let \nMadoff fall through the cracks, but certainly budget increases wisely \nspent--and I have faith that the new Chair will certainly do that--will \nhelp prevent future Madoffs from happening.\n  One of the things the SEC wants to do with the money we provide here \nis to hire people with specialized industry skills, develop systems for \nnationwide data centers----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. One of the things the SEC wants to do with this money is \nto hire people with specialized industry skills, develop systems for \nnationwide\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\ndata searches based on tips and complaints, and include their risk \nmodeling involving market data and intelligence.\n  It is incredible the chief regulator of the most sophisticated \neconomy in the world does not have this capability. Let's help get the \nright cops on Wall Street and then get them the resources they need to \nfight crime. Everyone has to do more with less these days, but I am not \nin favor of less resulting in letting bad guys go free.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Grassley. As I said, the compromise we \nhave come up with I think is fair because it both beefs up the SEC and \ndeals with Senator Grassley's concerns related to the inspector \ngeneral. I hope that at some point--we are still awaiting a letter from \nthe SEC--we can ask unanimous consent to move this amendment forward. \nIt has bipartisan support.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. \n     Shelby, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Graham, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1006.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered \nas read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide additional funding to the SEC to use in \n                        enforcement proceedings)\n\n       At the appropriate place in section 3, insert the \n     following:\n       (--) Additional Appropriations for the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission.--\n       (1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission, $20,000,000 for each \n     of the fiscal years 2010 and 2011 for investigations and \n     enforcement proceedings involving financial institutions, \n     including financial institutions to which this Act and \n     amendments made by this Act apply.\n       (2) Inspector general.--There is authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Securities and Exchange Commission, \n     $1,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2011 for the \n     salaries and expenses of the Office of the Inspector General \n     of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, are we now back on the Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are, but the Senator from Nevada is to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Before that happens, I thank the Senator from New York and \nthe Senator from Iowa. They have been meeting with me and my staff for \nweeks on this amendment. I am glad they were able to reach agreement on \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, I call for regular order with regard to the \nBoxer amendment, and that I be allowed to call up a second-degree \namendment, No. 1003.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Wait a minute. Reserving the right to object, would the \nSenator repeat that? That is not my understanding of what he was to do. \nWould the Senator repeat the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. For the Chamber's edification, I have an amendment filed \nas a first-degree and I also have a second-degree. I was going to call \nup the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That was not my understanding of what the Senator was \nasking, so I would object.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1004\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and I call up amendment No. 1004, which is the \nfirst-degree amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, it \nis my understanding that we now have about 7 minutes or 8 minutes. Then \nwe will go off this and go back to the Kyl amendment. I want to protect \nthe Senator from Arizona on his amendment. Even though it is one I \ndisagree with, I want to protect his right to have that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1004.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To impose certain requirements on public-private investment \n                 fund programs, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. PUBLIC-PRIVATE INVESTMENT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Any program established by the Secretary \n     of the Treasury or the Board of Directors of the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corporation that does any of the following \n     shall meet the requirements of subsection (b):\n       (1) Creates a public-private investment fund.\n       (2) Makes available any funds from the Troubled Asset \n     Relief Program established under title I of the Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (12 U.S.C. 5211 et seq.) \n     or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for--\n       (A) a public-private investment fund; or\n       (B) a loan to a private investor to fund the purchase of a \n     mortgage-backed security or an asset-backed security.\n       (3) Employs or contracts with a private sector partner to \n     manage assets for a public-private investment program.\n       (4) Guarantees any debt or asset for purposes of a public-\n     private investment program.\n       (b) Requirements.--Any program described in subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (1) impose strict conflict of interest rules on managers of \n     public-private investment funds that--\n       (A) specifically describe the extent, if any, to which such \n     managers may--\n       (i) invest the assets of a public-private investment fund \n     in assets that are held or managed by such managers or the \n     clients of such managers; and\n       (ii) conduct transactions involving a public-private \n     investment fund and an entity in which such manager or a \n     client of such manager has invested;\n       (B) take into consideration that there is a trade off \n     between hiring a manager with significant experience as an \n     asset manager that has complex conflicts of interest, and \n     hiring a manager with less expertise that has no conflicts of \n     interest; and\n       (C) acknowledge that the types of entities that are \n     permitted to make investment decisions for a public-private \n     investment fund may need to be limited to mitigate conflicts \n     of interest;\n       (2) require the disclosure of information regarding \n     participation in and management of public-private investment \n     funds, including any transaction undertaken in a public-\n     private investment fund;\n       (3) require each public-private investment fund to make a \n     certified report to the Secretary of the Treasury that \n     describes each transaction of such fund and the current value \n     of any assets held by such fund, which report shall be \n     publicly disclosed by the Secretary of the Treasury;\n       (4) require each manager of a public-private investment \n     fund to report to the Secretary of the Treasury any holding \n     or transaction by such manager or a client of such manager in \n     the same type of asset that is held by the public-private \n     investment fund;\n       (5) allow the Special Inspector General of the Troubled \n     Asset Relief Program, access to all books and records of a \n     public-private investment fund;\n       (6) require each manager of a public-private investment \n     fund to retain all books, documents, and records relating to \n     such public-private investment fund, including electronic \n     messages;\n       (7) allow the Special Inspector General of the Troubled \n     Asset Relief Program, the Secretary of the Treasury, and any \n     other Federal agency with oversight responsibilities access \n     to--\n       (A) the books, documents, records, and employees of each \n     manager of a public-private investment fund; and\n       (B) the books, documents, and records of each private \n     investor in a public-private investment fund that relate to \n     the public-private investment fund;\n       (8) require each manager of a public-private investment \n     fund to give such public-private investment fund terms that \n     are at least as favorable as those given to any other person \n     for whom such manager manages a fund;\n       (9) require each manager of a public-private investment \n     fund to acknowledge a fiduciary duty to the public and \n     private investors in such fund;\n       (10) require each manager of a public-private investment \n     fund to develop a robust ethics policy that includes methods \n     to ensure compliance with such policy;\n       (11) require stringent investor screening procedures for \n     public-private investment funds that include know your \n     customer requirements at least as rigorous as those of a \n     commercial bank or retail brokerage operation;\n       (12) require each manager of a public-private investment \n     fund to identify for the Secretary of the Treasury each \n     beneficial owner of a private interest in such fund; and\n       (13) require the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that \n     all investors in a public-private investment fund are \n     legitimate.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 45 days after the date of the \n     establishment of a program\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n\n     described in subsection (a), the Special Inspector General of \n     the Troubled Asset Relief Program shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the implementation of this section.\n       (d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``public-private \n     investment fund'' means a financial vehicle that is--\n       (1) established by the Federal Government to purchase pools \n     of loans, securities, or assets from a financial institution \n     described in section 101(a)(1) of the Emergency Economic \n     Stabilization Act of 2008 (12 U.S.C. 5211(a)(1)); and\n       (2) funded by a combination of cash or equity from private \n     investors and funds provided by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, taxpayers and politicians alike have been \ntoo long in the dark about how the Treasury has been implementing this \nso-called TARP program--or as most people in the country know it, the \nbank bailout program. The President has proposed and Treasury Secretary \nGeithner has proposed a new toxic asset plan that could put hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of the taxpayers' money at risk, so we need to do \nthis right.\n  The special inspector general for TARP has stated that this new toxic \nasset buy-back program--called the Public-Private Investment Program--\nis ``inherently vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse.'' The special \nIG's report outlined a number of good recommendations that are \nnecessary to protect the taxpayers and to ensure the integrity of this \nnew program.\n  My amendment would simply require that the Treasury Department \nimplement the recommendations from this special inspector general \nbefore allocating money under this new program known as the Public-\nPrivate Investment Program.\n  These requirements include, very simply, No. 1, imposing strict \nconflict of interest rules to prevent PPIP fund managers from \ninappropriately using the program to benefit themselves or their \nclients. Common sense. Makes sense. No. 2, mandate complete \ntransparency of this program, including public disclosure of all \ntransactions and the current valuation of all assets. And No. 3, \nrequiring that the fund managers who manage this program have stringent \ninvestor screening procedures, at least as rigorous as typical know-\nyour-customer procedures found at commercial banks or retail brokerage \nfirms to ensure investors are legitimate.\n  Let's put these safeguards in place. These are common sense. We are \nall talking about a bill in front of us that eliminates fraud and \nabuse. Well, there is no bigger program that we have right now than the \nTARP program. We need to eliminate fraud and abuse. And when the \nspecial inspector general has said this new program is ripe with fraud \nand abuse, we ought to protect the taxpayers.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment so that the Treasury \nDepartment fulfills President Obama's promise of bringing in \ntransparency and open government. That is what he promised upon coming \nin. This particular amendment will help ensure that the American people \nhave transparency and that their interests are protected, especially \ntheir dollars are protected with this new program that literally could \nrun into the hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this amendment. Hopefully, we won't get blocked \non having a vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I assume the Banking Committee will talk \nabout the amendment of the Senator from Nevada.\n  If I could have the attention of the Senator from Nevada, if his \nstaff would allow me to have the attention of the Senator from Nevada \nfor a moment, I realize we are merely constitutional impediments to the \nstaff. I hate to interfere.\n  Again, this is one of a series of amendments that is not at all \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. I find it an \ninteresting amendment, but it is within the jurisdiction of the Banking \nCommittee. I was hoping, since there is going to be a banking bill next \nweek, that some of these banking amendments would actually go on the \nBanking bill and have Judiciary amendments on the Judiciary bill. And I \nwould assume that the discussion will be carried out by Senators Dodd \nand Shelby of the Banking Committee, in that there is no relationship \nat all to the Judiciary Committee bill.\n  I would add to that, of course, that the Senator from Nevada has an \nabsolute right to bring up anything. Someone can bring up something on \nagriculture and price supports, I suppose. But I wish we could keep it \nto Judiciary matters.\n  Mr. President, am I correct we are now back on the Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. ENSIGN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I withhold that request for the Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1000\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call for regular order on the Boxer \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thought the Kyl amendment was pending by \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Kyl amendment was pending, but the Senator \nhas called for regular order.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1003 to Amendment No. 1000\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call up as my second-degree amendment \nNo. 1003.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I call up amendment No. 1003.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. Will the \nSenator give up the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1003 to amendment No. 1000.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To impose certain requirements on public-private investment \n                 fund programs, and for other purposes)\n\n       After page 2, line 20, add the following:\n       (f) Public-Private Investment Program.--\n       (1) In general.--Any program established by the Secretary \n     of the Treasury or the Board of Directors of the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corporation that does any of the following \n     shall meet the requirements of paragraph (2):\n       (A) Creates a public-private investment fund.\n       (B) Makes available any funds from the Troubled Asset \n     Relief Program established under title I of the Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (12 U.S.C. 5211 et seq.) \n     or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for--\n       (i) a public-private investment fund; or\n       (ii) a loan to a private investor to fund the purchase of a \n     mortgage-backed security or an asset-backed security.\n       (C) Employs or contracts with a private sector partner to \n     manage assets for a public-private investment program.\n       (D) Guarantees any debt or asset for purposes of a public-\n     private investment program.\n       (2) Requirements.--Any program described in paragraph (1) \n     shall--\n       (A) impose strict conflict of interest rules on managers of \n     public-private investment funds that--\n       (i) specifically describe the extent, if any, to which such \n     managers may--\n\n       (I) invest the assets of a public-private investment fund \n     in assets that are held or managed by such managers or the \n     clients of such managers;

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 986\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Arizona \nand I have 2 minutes equally divided between us before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I know Senator Kyl is on the way. I will say what I said \nbefore, when he was standing on the floor. I, along with Senator \nGrassley, strongly oppose his amendment because the False Claims Act is \nso well put together, has a balanced approach of providing incentives \nfor whistleblowers, and has recovered more than $22 billion for the \nTreasury. That is why Senator Grassley and I oppose the amendment by \nthe Senator from Arizona. Awards to whistleblowers have to be approved \nby judges, so there is a mechanism to handle excessive awards.\n  When we have something like the False Claims Act that is working as \nwell as it is--as I said, it is one of the few things that has made \nmoney for the Federal Government. So far it has made $22 billion for \nthe U.S. taxpayers. I hate to interfere with something that is working.\n  My time is up. The Senator from Arizona is on the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to provide a \nlimitation of $50 million for the recovery of the whistleblowers who \nbring actions that result in recovery for the Government of money that \notherwise would have been lost due to fraud. There needs to be a \nreward, and most of these whistleblowers, frankly, are not looking for \nmoney. But it seems to me, from 1986 when we did this, we never \ncontemplated these multibillion-dollar settlements or awards, and to \nprovide up to 30 percent of that to the people who bring the action is \ntoo much. We could save the Federal Government a lot of money if we put \nin a modest limitation. I would argue a $50 million award per case is a \npretty liberal award. My amendment would cap the award at $50 million, \nand I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to point out, as I did in \nmy debate, that we have a much larger False Claims Act bill pending in \nthe Judiciary Committee. I think what the Senator from Arizona brought \nup is a legitimate subject for discussion, but it ought to be discussed \nin the wider global issue of the False Claims Act and not in a fraud \nbill where we are just trying to make some very short changes in the \nFalse Claims Act.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been previously ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from New Jersey \n(Mr. Lautenberg), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the \nSenator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Alexander) and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. \nRoberts).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted: ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 31, nays 61, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 162 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--31\n\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--61\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Alexander\n     Durbin\n     Kennedy\n     Lautenberg\n     Lieberman\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, on vote No. 162, I was unavoidably \ndetained due to my representation of the Senate at the annual Day of \nRemembrance Ceremony.\n  Had I been present for the vote, I would have voted ``nay'' on Kyl \namendment No. 986 to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S4618]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I will.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized following the \nremarks of the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a moment, \nthis bill would have been easily finished last night, but I understand, \nunder the Senate schedule, we were unable to continue at that time. I \nhope we will finish soon so that we don't have to spend a great deal \nmore time. We have had a large number of amendments that are basically \nBanking Committee amendments, and other committees, not the Judiciary \nCommittee. We should come back to realizing that this is a Judiciary \nbill. Every one of us says we are against those who are stealing life \nsavings and money set aside for kids' colleges and stealing people's \nhomes. We all say we would love to put them in jail. We will not do it \nuntil we get the bill through.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. DODD. I will.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to call up an \namendment following the remarks of Senators Dodd and Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of \n2009 comes out of the Judiciary Committee. Senators Leahy and Grassley \nand their colleagues have worked hard to put together a strong \nbipartisan bill to deal with fraud. In fact, I am told that for every \ndollar we invest in this effort, there is roughly $15 that would accrue \nto the benefit of American taxpayers. I commend them for their efforts \non this important piece of legislation.\n  However, this Judiciary Committee bill is sort of turning into a \nBanking Committee bill as most of the amendments being offered are \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I understand the \nappetite of my colleagues to address some of these questions. Some of \nthem are very good ideas, ones that I will mention in a moment and that \nI can support. Others are very complicated and have are technical \nissues, but they also could do great damage to the effort we are all \nprincipally engaged in and desirous of achieving, and that is to \nrestore confidence and optimism in order to get our economic system \nback on its feet.\n  I thought it might be valuable, as chairman of the Banking Committee, \nto run through the amendments that affect the jurisdiction of the \nBanking Committee and to share some of my observations on ones I would \nbe willing to support, which means we could possibly have voice votes \non them and accept them as part of this bill, and others which are of \nconcern to me and which I would oppose for reasons I will briefly \nexplain.\n  On a positive note, Senator Coburn has offered amendment No. 983. \nThis amendment would require the examination of what happened with the \nGSEs, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Banks.\n  Yesterday, we adopted a proposal, offered by Senators Isakson, \nConrad, and myself, to establish a commission to examine thoroughly how \nwe got into the situation we find ourselves in. There has been a debate \nabout whether we ought to do that with an outside commission or within \nthe Congress. There is a legitimate debate about that. My colleague \nfrom North Dakota proposed a select committee, which was adopted last \nevening. Whether we adopt the select committee approach or an outside \ncommission, in either case, the GSEs would be a part of that \nexamination.\n  I make the case that the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma may \nbe duplicative or unnecessary. But rather than have an extended debate \nabout that, I recommend we accept the amendment. The issues surrounding \nthe GSEs are clearly going to be a part of the look-back. So rather \nthan have extended debate about that, let's just accept the amendment \nand move on. Then the commission or the select committee can make those \nspecific determinations. I urge that a voice vote be acceptable on that \nissue.\n  Senator Kohl has offered amendment No. 990. That amendment is \ndesigned to offer additional protections to older Americans from \nmisleading and fraudulent marketing practices within the financial \narea. I commend my colleague for his amendment. We all know elderly \nAmericans are some of the most--if not the most--vulnerable to the \nmarketing scams that go on, either through direct mail operations or \ntelemarketing operations. People who are alone and vulnerable in many \nways are incredibly susceptible to some egregious marketing techniques. \nThe Senator has offered an amendment that would provide additional \nsecurity for those in retirement, and we can all applaud him for that \neffort. The amendment has been endorsed by the North American \nSecurities Administrators, financial planners, the Consumer Federation \nof America, and many others. I commend Senator Kohl for that amendment \nand again urge my colleagues to accept it, if that is acceptable to the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Senator Schumer has offered amendment No. 1006 which would add $20 \nmillion of authorization to the Securities and Exchange Commission in \nfunding for 2010 and 2011. All of us can appreciate the need for \nadditional support for the Enforcement Division. Americans are \npainfully aware of the Madoff scandal as well as the Stanford Ponzi \nschemes. We have had these agencies before our Banking Committee with \nhearings on how that happened, whether or not people were doing their \njobs. Senator Schumer has suggested we provide additional resources.\n  Earlier this year, I requested, along with members of my committee, a \nbillion dollars a year for the SEC in 2010, a level which we still will \nnot reach with this additional $20 million. Many of us agree that the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission has to have the tools and the staff \nto do the job. There are an awful lot of scams going on. We don't want \nto hear about Americans being victimized by them any longer. While \nthere is no guarantee that with additional resources and personnel we \nwill stop all of them, we certainly know that with additional resources \nand tools, we can minimize the problems that emerged with the Madoff \nand Stanford scandals. Senator Schumer has offered a very good \namendment, and I urge that it be accepted.\n  Those three amendments are ones we can accept, and hopefully we will \nin order to assist our colleague from Vermont and others in moving this \nbill along.\n  Let me mention a couple of amendments with which I have some \ndifficulty.\n  First, the Coburn amendment No. 982. This amendment would authorize \nthe use of TARP funds to cover the cost of this bill. I have many \nproblems with this amendment. First, there is a point of order against \nthis amendment. But aside from the point of order, the purpose of TARP, \nwhich Congress passed last year, was to provide assistance to unlock \nour frozen financial markets in order to provide credit for small \nbusinesses; to purchase securities backed by loans from small \nbusinesses; to provide capital to banks so they can continue to make \nloans, although not many of them are doing so, but that was the idea \nbehind the program; and to fund the Making Home Affordable Programs, \nwhich modifies mortgage loans, either reducing principal or interest, \nso that we can mitigate the 10,000 people a day who are entering into \nforeclosure and for whom modifying those loans is critically important. \nIf we start going around and deciding we will use TARP funds for every \nidea and every bill that comes to the floor we will deprive the \nTreasury and others of the tools necessary to get our economy moving \nagain. If we start spreading TARP resources in areas that have little \nor nothing to do with the underlying economic crisis we will be taking \na step in the wrong direction. I urge my colleagues to vote against \namendment No. 982 for those reasons. If we start down this path, it \nwill be more and more difficult to get our economy back on its feet \nagain. I know that many of my colleagues disagreed with the TARP, but \nthat is what Congress adopted. There were those who objected to using \nTARP money for the auto industry and believed that was wrong. There may \nbe other areas where some have disagreed with the use of\n\n[[Page S4619]]\n\nTARP funds. But to have it become a funding mechanism for every bill \nthat comes along would undermine the very purpose of those programs.\n  The next two amendments I urge my colleagues to pay attention to and \nI believe are matters of concern are the amendments from our colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Vitter, No. 991, and Senator DeMint from South \nCarolina, amendment No. 994. Let me explain both of the amendments and \nwhy I have concerns about each of them.\n  The Vitter amendment has to do with the issue of warrants. It is a \ncomplicated subject matter, but let me briefly explain it. What would \nbe the effect of this amendment? This amendment is basically a favor to \nbanks and minimizes help for taxpayers. That is what it comes down to. \nThis amendment would take away the discretion of regulators and the \nTreasury to impose additional capital requirements or any other \nrequirements on a TARP recipient that could benefit taxpayers or \nprotect the financial system. Under this amendment, the financial \ninstitutions would have the discretion to act on their own in areas \nwhere they currently can not. It is quite clear that when they receive, \nin many cases, billions of dollars in taxpayer money to shore up their \nposition, to salvage these institutions, that to then turn around and \nallow them unilaterally to make decisions which could harm the taxpayer \nand cause even further delay of financial system recovery is exactly \nthe wrong direction in which we ought to be going.\n  The amendment would allow the TARP recipient, rather than Treasury, \nto determine when its warrants would be repurchased. The amendment \nwould not permit Treasury's discretion to determine when warrants may \nbe executed and would allow the recipient to indefinitely defer \nexercise of the warrants. In addition, it could harm the taxpayers by \neliminating the requirement that Treasury pay market price for these \nwarrants.\n  So under this amendment, we are reducing the power of the regulators \nat the very critical moment we want them to exercise that influence \nrather than allow the recipients themselves to allow what is in their \nbest interest. They are the ones who have received billions of taxpayer \nmoney. It seems to me having a leash on all that and allowing the best \ndecision to be made on behalf of the overall economy is what we ought \nto be doing.\n  The amendment would empower the banks, which may act in their \nindividual interests--and I understand that--but having received so \nmuch taxpayer money, it seems to me we ought to make sure we are not \ngoing to allow that unilateral self-interest to trump the interests of \nthe larger concern; and that is the American taxpayer and the overall \nrestoration of our economic well-being.\n  So I say respectfully to my colleague, and a member of our committee, \nSenator Vitter, this amendment, I think no matter how good his \nintentions, may actually do a lot more damage and harm if it were to be \nadopted at this critical moment when we see that glimmer of light that \nour economy is beginning to show some signs of recovery. This amendment \ncould set us back at the very moment we may be heading in the right \ndirection.\n  The last amendment I will address at this moment is one offered by \nour colleague from South Carolina, Senator DeMint. I am not in any way \ndisparaging the intentions of my colleagues here. I have great respect \nfor all whom I serve with, and their intentions, I am sure, are \nmotivated by their own framework of how they see these issues. But this \namendment concerns me as well in a similar vein. It is a different \nsubject matter, but a similar approach.\n  Here is what I mean by that. The DeMint amendment also allows a lot \nof discretion to be left in the hands of the financial institutions, \nthe institutions which have received, of course, tremendous support \nfrom the American taxpayer. This amendment would deprive the Treasury \nof the ability to convert preferred stock to common stock. That \nconversion could allow banks to basically shore up their balance \nsheets. That is what some are considering to do. This would limit their \nability to do that. It would say you could not do that. You could not \nhave that kind of conversion.\n  If we limit that ability to make that kind of a discretionary \ndecision, then this could mean that more small business lending would \nbe curtailed, more mortgage lending would be curtailed, more lending \nfor commercial real estate, all of which may be absolutely critical in \nthe coming weeks.\n  Preferred stock does not increase bank capital in a similar manner as \ncommon shares do. The Senator's amendment could lead to the very real \nconsequence that lending is constricted significantly more than we see \ncurrently. That would mean more businesses closing for lack of capital, \nwhich means more job losses across our country. It means more \nforeclosures of homes. Madam President, as I mentioned earlier, 10,000 \nhomes a day is a staggering number already. I cannot imagine watching \nthat number increase further. Yet the adoption of that amendment could \nachieve that result. It could also mean foreclosed homes staying on the \nmarket longer, another result that we do not want to see.\n  In short, the amendment means a lot more economic hardship. Some TARP \nrecipients may not be able to pay a dividend in connection with \npreferred shares. It would be counterproductive to deprive the Treasury \nof their discretion to convert its preferred shares to common shares \nunder those circumstances. At a very time you want to shore up balance \nsheets by allowing for that conversion, this amendment would prohibit \nthat conversion. It seems to me to constrict that kind of action is \nexactly the wrong direction to be going in at this very moment. The \nGovernment's upside potential could be much greater with common shares \nin some instances, and to deny the ability of our Treasury and others \nto make that kind of conversion I think could be harmful.\n  Allowing conversion from preferred shares to common shares would \npermit the Treasury to provide additional flexibility and assistance to \nfinancial institutions and, maybe most importantly, would limit the use \nof additional taxpayer funds. Let me emphasize that point. I think we \nare all painfully aware that with about $100 billion left of TARP \nfunds, if you restrict the ability to move from preferred shares to \ncommon shares, you increase the likelihood of having to come back here. \nI do not know of a single Member of this body who welcomes coming back \nhere seeking additional TARP funds. That may very well occur, but it \nwill occur a lot more rapidly if you adopt the DeMint amendment.\n  So while, again, I respect my colleague from South Carolina, a member \nof our committee--and I do not question at all his motivations in all \nof this--I say in this case as well, as with the Vitter amendment, you \nare restricting the ability of the people we have charged with managing \nthis. If we end up having Congress--535 Members of Congress--deciding \non a daily basis how to micromanage this program, and with all due \nrespect to my colleagues, this is above our pay grade in many ways. We \nin Congress do a lot of things well. Micromanaging this program, such \nas these two amendments suggest, I think sends us in the wrong \ndirection.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to please look \nat these two amendments and understand the potential danger were they \nto be adopted. It would certainly curtail our ability, in my view, to \nengage in exactly the activities that need to be at the top of our \nagenda: loosening up that credit market; getting a hold of the \nforeclosure issue, and trying to go in the opposite direction of where \nit is going today; making it possible for small businesses to get back \non their feet; and allowing banks to start lending again in this \ncountry. If you adopt these two amendments you achieve the opposite \nresult.\n  So I urge, on both the Vitter amendment and the DeMint amendment, \nthey be rejected. And for the reasons I offered on, the second Coburn \namendment, that are that we cannot turn the TARP program into a slush \nfund for every program that comes through here, as it was specifically \ndesigned to deal with the economic crisis, and that ought to be the \npurpose for which these funds are used. I urge my colleagues to reject \nthat amendment as well.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, has had his bill turn into a Banking Committee bill with all \nof these\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\namendments. So I felt obligated in some sense to come over and share \nwith my colleagues at least my observations on these amendments: the \nones I think we can accept--and I applaud my colleagues who have \noffered amendments that I think are significant and can contribute; \neven the first Coburn amendment, which I disagree with because you do \nnot need it as a result of the earlier amendments which we adopted \ncover the issues of his amendment. But I think all of us recognize that \nthe GSES issues have to be part of that look-back, so I would find it \ndifficult to oppose his amendment. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport that amendment, along with the Kohl amendment and the Schumer \namendment that have been offered.\n  With that, I see my colleagues from North Dakota and Utah who are \nanxious to speak. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut. I \nalso thank my colleague from Utah for his forbearance so that I might \nmake a few comments. I appreciate the courtesy of Senator Hatch.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my statement be printed \nin the morning business section of today's Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DORGAN are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1007\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and I call up amendment No. 1007.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1007.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the Department of Labor from expending Federal \n      funds to withdraw a rule pertaining to the filing by labor \n   organizations of an annual financial report required by the Labor-\n            Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959)\n\n       At the end, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TRANSPARENCY IN ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The American workers who contribute union dues deserve \n     to have transparency and accountability in the management of \n     their unions.\n       (2) Since 2001, investigations of union fraud have resulted \n     in more than 1,000 indictments, 929 convictions, and \n     restitution in excess of $93,000,000.\n       (3) A new rule (referred to in this subsection as the \n     ``transparency rule'') to require union management to \n     disclose more information about sales and purchases of \n     assets, and disbursements to officers and employees, among \n     other things, was set to take effect on April 21, 2009, after \n     a previous delay affording reporting entities more time to \n     prepare to comply.\n       (4) The Obama Administration has set a goal for itself to \n     be the most open and transparent administration in the \n     history of the Nation.\n       (5) On April 21, 2009, the Department of Labor issued--\n       (A) a final rule providing for a further delay of the \n     transparency rule; and\n       (B) a proposed rule to withdraw the transparency rule.\n       (6) The transparency rule would have been a key tool in the \n     battle against fraud, discouraging embezzlement of the money \n     of union members and making money harder to hide, and would \n     have provided great sunlight and transparency to allow \n     members to know how their dues were being spent.\n       (7) The Department of Labor's actions are in direct \n     contradiction to everything the Obama Administration purports \n     to stand for.\n       (b) Prohibition.--The Secretary of Labor may not expend \n     Federal funds to withdraw the rule issued by the Secretary of \n     Labor entitled ``Labor Organization Annual Financial \n     Reports'', 74 Fed. Reg. 3678 (January 21, 2009).\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to propose an amendment that will \nensure transparency and prevent egregious cases of fraud against \nAmerican workers. My amendment is very simple, and I think it is \ncompelling. All it does is prevent the administration from rescinding \ncurrent regulations that require transparency in the way that union \nmanagement chooses to spend the hard-earned dues collected from their \nmembers. This amendment is specifically directed at preventing the \nweakening of the Department of Labor's Office of Labor-Management \nStandards--or OLMS it is called--which is the sole Federal agency \ntasked with protecting the interests of American workers who pay union \ndues.\n  Under current Federal law, the OLMS requires financial reporting that \nensures the transparency of how labor union management spends labor \nunion dues in the area of compensation of labor leaders, the purchasing \nof union assets, and additional information regarding various union \nreceipts. This law requires union leaders to disclose how members' \nmoney is spent and provides protection from fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  Public opinion and our Nation's dire economic conditions have driven \nus to require banks, corporations, and even Presidential \nadministrations to do business in the light of day--in full \ntransparency. Therefore, the same expectation of transparency should \napply to labor unions. The previous administration took steps to do \nthat in 2003 by updating reporting requirements and forms. These \nupdates allowed the electronic filing of disclosures on the Internet. \nThe Office of Labor-Management Standards--OLMS--was about to implement \na second update that would require information about compensation to \nunion officers. This revision also would have required the disclosure \nof transactions involving union assets.\n  Unfortunately, as was reported this year in the April 21 Federal \nRegister, the Labor Department and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis have \ndelayed the effective date of these revisions. Furthermore, on this \nsame date, the Labor Department has published a notice that seeks to \nwithdraw the rule entirely. By doing this, Secretary Solis has \neffectively neutralized OLMS in its mission to ensure the transparency \nin the way labor unions spend the hard-earned money of their Members. \nIronically, this is being done by an administration that has told the \nAmerican public that transparency and change has returned to \nWashington. It would appear to me that the Labor Department did not get \nthat memo. I feel confident President Obama would be on my side on \nthis, that he would want the transparency. It is in the best interests \nof union workers. It protects them from fraud. It protects their dues \nas they put them in there. Unions can run the unions just as businesses \nrun businesses, but they ought to do it honestly. That is why these \nregulations are so important. That is why this amendment is so \nimportant.\n  There should not be any debate as to the effectiveness of the OLMS. \nFrom 2001 through 2007, OLMS investigations resulted in 1,000 \nindictments. The Office of Labor-Management Standards fraud \ninvestigations between 2001 and 2007 resulted in 1,000 indictments and \nconvictions of 929 of those indicted. The funds recovered that were \nillegally taken amounted to $93 million. Think about that: $93 million \nin restitution was paid back to the victims of those crimes. I am sure \nI need not remind any Member of this body that union dues are seldom \nvoluntarily given. Men and women who join these unions are often \ncompelled to pay as part of their employment agreement. Union funds are \nalso comprised of pension funds, which have occasionally been targeted \nby organized crime and used to underwrite mob activities. I know. I was \na member of the AFL-CIO. I went through a formal apprenticeship. I paid \ndues, and I became a journeyman metal lather, a skilled trade, back in \nthose years when I was working in construction.\n  Union funds, as I say, are also comprised of pension funds, which \nsometimes are targeted by organized crime and used to underwrite mob \nactivities. When I was chairman of the Labor Committee, we did a lot to \ntry and overcome these things, but it has never been done better than \nbetween 2001 and 2007. From October 2000 through May 2007, in the State \nof New York alone, the OLMS conducted 334 audits and obtained 87 \nindictments, resulting in 82 convictions. That is a high constriction \nrate, showing this is not some little itty, bitty problem. This, in \nturn, resulted in the recovery and restitution of $39.6 million. In \nIllinois, the OLMS indicted 44 persons in connection with fraudulent \nactivity involving union funds, resulting in 42 convictions.\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\nThese are statistics we can all be proud of. OLMS investigations \nproduced 1,000 indictments and obtained 929 constrictions--a 92.9-\npercent conviction rate.\n  We are debating legislation that provides more investigators and \nremedies to prevent fraud and enforce Federal laws. The OLMS enforces \nthe Labor Management Reporting Disclosure Act, a bipartisan law with \nroots back to another former Senator who was young, inspiring, and went \non to become President: John F. Kennedy. It was then-Senator Kennedy \nwho inserted into this act the union members' bill of rights. It is the \nunion members who are entitled to transparency. The whole world is \nentitled to transparency in these instances as well. It is the mission \nof the OLMS to ensure that union business is conducted in the light of \nday, with its members'--and that is plural--interests at heart.\n  It is for this reason that I have risen to propose this amendment and \nI ask my colleagues for their support and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second at this time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, then I will ask for the yeas and nays at the \nappropriate time.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the call of \nthe quorum be terminated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in a quorum call.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? This time there \nis a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the majority leader for his kindness and, of \ncourse, we are willing to have this come up whenever the majority \nleader and the minority leader determine.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1006\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment No. 1006 be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on this issue?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1006) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I wish to note to the body that this is \nthe SEC amendment that adds $20 million for new SEC staff and \ninvestigators and another $1 million for the IG within the SEC. This \nwas the one part of this very fine piece of legislation that wasn't \nincluded. Of course, if you are looking at financial fraud--the kind \nBernie Madoff and so many others did--beefing up the SEC and making \nsure they are much tougher and more focused, as the technology parts of \nthis amendment will allow, is what we need.\n  Senator Grassley wanted to make sure the SEC avoided past mistakes \nunder its old leadership and made some very useful suggestions. That is \nwhy the SEC wasn't included originally. We agreed on those. I wish to \nthank him, Senator Leahy, as well as Senator Shelby, who has been my \ncosponsor for passing this legislation.\n  I also wish to thank our new chair at the SEC, Chair Schapiro. Mary \nSchapiro is a breath of fresh air within the SEC. She is trying to \nshake it up and focus on the kinds of mistakes we have seen in the past \nwhere the whistleblower came before the SEC and gave them the goods on \nMadoff and they passed it by. It won't happen again. This amendment \nshould help make that happen and strengthen this fine legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Executive Power\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \nup to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have sought recognition to introduce three bills \nrelating to limiting Executive power. Because of the past period of \ntime since 9/11, we have seen enormous expansion of Executive power. We \nhave seen the President, during President George W. Bush's \nadministration, use signing statements extensively. We have seen \nPresident Obama use a signing statement already in his short tenure, \nwhich, in effect, nullifies what the Congress has done.\n  The Constitution is plain that there is a presentment of legislation \nto the President and he either signs it or vetoes it. What we have \nfound is that Presidents are now cherry-picking the parts they like and \nthe parts they don't like. So I am submitting legislation on \nPresidential signing statements.\n  The second issue of concern involves the immunity for the telephone \ncompanies which would deprive Federal jurisdiction for some 40 cases. I \nbelieve telephone companies have been good citizens in providing very \nimportant information. I believe there is a way to maintain the \njurisdiction of the Federal courts and still not subject the telephone \ncompanies to litigation or possible damages by having the Government \nsubstituted as the party defendant. I am introducing legislation on \nthat subject.\n\n  Third, I am introducing legislation that would establish a \nrequirement that the Supreme Court of the United States take \njurisdiction on all appeals involving the terrorist surveillance \nprogram. That program has caused a great deal of controversy because of \nthe issue as to whether the President has authority under article II to \nignore the explicit provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct. The terrorist surveillance program, was declared unconstitutional \nby a Federal court in Detroit. An appeal taken to the Sixth Circuit was \ndismissed for reasons of lack of standing. The forceful dissenting \nopinion in that case showed that there was sufficient basis for \nstanding--a very flexible judicial doctrine.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States denied certiorari, so at this \npoint, we don't know whether the President's exercise of authority \nthere under article II of the Constitution is correct. Certainly, if \nthe President has that constitutional authority, it supercedes the \nstatute. But that is a matter which should have been decided a long \ntime ago by the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has avoided moving \non that subject.\n  Today, I have an article I have offered on executive power. It \nappears today in the New York review of books, where I outline my \nintent to introduce these pieces of legislation. The article comes from \na longer floor statement I had prepared. It has been reduced somewhat \nin size.\n  In the 7\\1/2\\ years since September 11, the United States has \nwitnessed one of the greatest expansions of executive authority in its \nhistory, in derogation of the constitutionally mandated separation of \npowers. President Obama, as only the third sitting senator to be \nelected president in American history, and the first since John F. \nKennedy, may be more likely to respect the separation of powers than \nPresident Bush was. But rather than put my faith in any president to \nrestrain the executive branch, I intend to take several concrete steps, \nwhich I hope the new President will support.\n  First, I intend to introduce legislation that will mandate Supreme \nCourt review of lower court decisions in suits brought by the ACLU and \nothers that challenge the constitutionality of the warrantless \nwiretapping program authorized by President Bush after September 11. \nWhile the Supreme Court generally exercises discretion as to whether it \nwill review a case, there are precedents for Congress to direct Supreme \nCourt review on constitutional issues--including the statutes \nforbidding flag burning and requiring Congress to abide by Federal \nemployment laws--and I will follow those.\n  Second, I will reintroduce legislation to keep the courts open to \nsuits filed against several major telephone companies that allegedly \nfacilitated the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program. \nAlthough Congress granted immunity to the telephone companies in July \n2008, this\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\nissue may yet be successfully revisited since the courts have not yet \nruled on the legality of the immunity provision. My legislation would \nsubstitute the government as defendant in place of the telephone \ncompanies. This would allow the cases to go forward, with the \ngovernment footing the bill for any damages awarded.\n  Further, I will reintroduce my legislation from 2006 and 2007--the \nPresidential Signing Statements Act--to prohibit courts from relying \non, or deferring to, Presidential signing statements when determining \nthe meaning of any act of Congress. These statements, sometimes issued \nwhen the President signs a bill into law, have too often been used to \nundermine congressional intent. Earlier versions of my legislation went \nnowhere because of the obvious impossibility of obtaining two-thirds \nmajorities in each House to override an expected veto by President \nBush. Nevertheless, in the new Congress, my legislation has a better \nchance of mustering a majority vote and being signed into law by \nPresident Obama.\n  To understand why these steps are so important, one must appreciate \nan imbalance in our ``checks and balances'' that has become \nincreasingly evident in recent years. I witnessed firsthand, during \nmany of the battles over administration policy since September 11, how \ndifficult it can be for Congress and the courts to rally their members \nagainst an overzealous executive.\n\n\n               The Terrorist Surveillance Program--Act I\n\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 2005 to 2007, I \nled the effort to reauthorize and improve the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act, \nwhich was originally set to expire at the end of 2005. Indeed, after \nintensive bipartisan negotiations, the Judiciary Committee succeeded--\nto the surprise of most observers--in approving a revised bill by \nunanimous vote. The full Senate then approved the bill by unanimous \nconsent, but the conference report negotiated with the House of \nRepresentatives faced stiffer opposition. Nevertheless, after days of \nfloor debate, I awoke on December 16, 2005, fully expecting to finish \nSenate action on the long-delayed reauthorization.\n  So, I was startled--really shocked--to read the lead story in the New \nYork Times that morning, titled ``Bush Lets US Spy on Callers Without \nCourts,'' which revealed that our intelligence agencies had been \nengaged in warrantless wiretapping since shortly after September 11, in \nflat violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--FISA--of \n1978. This is James Risen and Eric Lichtblau, ``Bush Lets U.S. Spy on \nCallers Without Courts,'' the New York Times, December 16, 2005. The \nnews caused the Senate to delay passage of the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization for months. Senator Charles Schumer expressed the \nsentiments of many: ``I went to bed last night unsure of how to vote on \nthis legislation. . . . Today's revelation that the Government listened \nin on thousands of phone conversations without getting a warrant is \nshocking and has greatly influenced my vote.'' More importantly, the \ndisclosure in the Times launched a fierce debate about the extent of \nPresidential authority in the war on terror that has yet to be fully \nresolved.\n  That day, I assured my colleagues the reports would be a ``matter for \noversight by the Judiciary Committee . . . a very high priority item.'' \nWhen Congress reconvened in January 2006, I made good on my promise: I \nheld multiple hearings into the program the Times revealed, later \ndubbed the Terrorist Surveillance Program. As acknowledged by President \nBush, this highly classified program launched in the weeks after \nSeptember 11 purported to authorize the National Security Agency to \nintercept phone calls between terror suspects overseas and persons \ninside the United States. Critics like me argued that the President's \nprogram violated FISA. After all, the law declared the procedures set \nup by FISA to be the ``exclusive means'' by which such surveillance of \ntelephone calls and other communications could be conducted. FISA also \nmade criminal all domestic electronic surveillance designed to obtain \nforeign intelligence ``except as authorized by statute.'' Although the \nlaw defined limited exceptions in emergencies, reports in the press \nmade it clear that none of them applied to the warrantless wiretapping \nthat was done in the Terrorist Surveillance Program.\n\n  I recognized that, as administration supporters argued, the President \nmight have inherent power to disregard FISA and to conduct unfettered \nforeign intelligence surveillance under article II of the Constitution, \nthe section that defines his authority as Commander in Chief. I was \nnot, however, sympathetic to the administration's further argument that \nCongress had implicitly authorized the President to carry out programs \nsuch as the Terrorist Surveillance Program when it authorized the use \nof military force against terrorists in September 2001.\n  I was also convinced that President Bush's failure to notify Congress \nof the secret program violated provisions of the National Security Act \nof 1947. That statute requires the President to ``ensure that the \ncongressional intelligence committees are kept fully and currently \ninformed of the intelligence activities of the United States.'' But the \nadministration informed only eight legislators of the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program: the chairman and ranking members of the Senate \nand House Intelligence Committees, and the two top leaders in the \nmajority and minority of both Houses, leaving out both me and Senator \nPatrick Leahy as chair and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \ndespite the fact that when FISA was enacted in 1978, it went through \nboth the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. While the law \nexplicitly permits notice to this limited ``Gang of 8'' for certain \ncovert operations--such as efforts to influence political conditions \nabroad without disclosing the U.S. role--the Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram did not fit this exception.\n  Indeed, those notified were very uneasy about the arrangement. \nSenator Jay Rockefeller, then ranking member on the Intelligence \nCommittee, sent a secret handwritten letter to the Vice President \nsaying the administration's surveillance activities ``raised profound \noversight issues'' on which, owing to the arrangement, Rockefeller \ncould not ``consult staff or counsel.'' A sealed copy of the letter had \nto be stored in a classified Senate area for over 2 years until \nknowledge of the Terrorist Surveillance Program became public. Once the \nstory broke, Representative Jane Harman, who as ranking member of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee was another Gang of 8 member, informed \nPresident Bush that she believed ``the practice of briefing only \ncertain Members of the intelligence committees violates the specific \nrequirements of the National Security Act of 1947.''\n  I raised this issue in a January 24, 2006, letter sent to Attorney \nGeneral Alberto Gonzales in advance of the first Judiciary Committee \nhearing on the Terrorist Surveillance Program. Gonzales replied:\n\n       ``It has for decades been the practice of both Democratic \n     and Republican administrations to inform only the Chair and \n     Ranking Members of the intelligence committees about certain \n     exceptionally sensitive matters.\n\n  The attorney general added that, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service, the leaders of the intelligence committees had \nacquiesced in this practice. In my view, Gonzales's argument could \nappeal only to those unacquainted with the ways the executive branch \nhas, in practice, dealt with the intelligence committees. \nAdministrations of both parties have sometimes told the chair and \nranking member that they have important information to disclose, but \ninsisted that they will reveal this information only to some group \nwithin the committee and the top congressional leadership, such as the \n``Gang of 8.'' In many cases, the offer is accepted as the only way of \ngetting the information--at least in a timely manner.\n  To the extent the administration relied on such precedents to justify \nnotifying only the ``Gang of 8,'' it should have informed me and \nSenator Leahy as well. Indeed, administration officials briefed both of \nus on the Terrorist Surveillance Program when they later sought \ncomprehensive FISA reform. It is quite glaring, then, that they \nneglected to brief us in 2005, even as we were considering \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, which was central to the \nadministration's counterterrorism efforts.\n  In the spring of 2006, new allegations about the government's \nsurveillance\n\n[[Page S4623]]\n\nactivities surfaced--not at congressional hearings, but again through \nleaks to the press. On May 11, 2006, USA Today reported that the \nNational Security Agency had been ``secretly collecting the phone call \nrecords of tens of millions of Americans, using data provided by AT, \nVerizon and BellSouth.'' This is Leslie Cauley, ``NSA Has Massive \nDatabase of American's Phone Calls,'' USA Today, June 11, 2006. \nAlthough the records reportedly included only data like telephone \nnumbers, rather than the contents of calls, the revelations stirred new \ncontroversy.\n  One month later, on June 22, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that AT \nhad changed its privacy policy to make customer data a ``business \nrecord the company owns,'' one that ``can be disclosed to [the] \ngovernment. . . .'' This is Associated Press, AT Says it Can Disclose \nAccount Data on Net, TV Clients, Chicago Sun Times, June 22, 2006, at \n25. I was very interested in the legal basis for this assertion of \nownership and what relationship it had, if any, to the reported \ndisclosures of communications data to the government. As luck would \nhave it, that very day, the Judiciary Committee's Antitrust \nSubcommittee was holding an unrelated hearing on the proposed merger of \nAT and BellSouth, featuring the firms' respective CEOs, Edward \nWhitacre Jr. and Duane Ackerman. I could not let the presence of these \nCEOs pass without confronting them on the surveillance program.\n\n  I asked Mr. Whitacre whether his ``company provide[d] information to \nthe Federal Government.'' He kept repeating that they ``follow the \nlaw''--a comment that I told him was ``contemptuous of this \ncommittee,'' because I was asking a factual question and he was \noffering a legal conclusion. Mr. Whitacre defended his answer on the \ngrounds that he had spoken to a number of attorneys who advised him he \ncould say nothing more.\n  The episode did not go unnoticed. For example, under the headline \n``Privacy flap engulfs hearing,'' the Atlanta Journal-Constitution \ndetailed that ``a Senate hearing Thursday intended to explore the \nconsumer impact of a proposed AT merger instead turned into \na contentious face-off over phone privacy.'' (see Marilyn Geewax, AT \nBellsouth Merger; Privacy Flap Engulfs Hearing; Panel Wonders About Use \nof Phone Records, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 23, 2006, at 4G.\n  In truth, the matter merited its own hearing, but my efforts to hold \none were thwarted by Vice President Cheney. Soon after the story broke, \nI announced my intention to schedule a hearing with the CEOs of the \nnamed carriers. I planned to either subpoena the companies or arrange a \nhearing closed to the public, which the telephone companies had agreed \nto attend without receiving a subpoena. Unfortunately, Vice President \nCheney went behind my back to persuade all of the other Republicans on \nthe committee not to support the subpoena and to boycott the session I \nhad called to discuss a possible private hearing. In the face of this \nopposition, I had little choice but to agree to a proposal by Senator \nOrrin Hatch for a brief delay to give him an opportunity to solicit the \nadministration's views on my bill to permit court oversight of the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program. When I announced this course of action \nat the executive session, a highly contentious debate ensued.\n  Senator Leahy, long at odds with the Vice President, opined that \nsince we were not going to ``find out independently'' what the \ngovernment sought from the telecoms and instead wait ``for Dick Cheney \nto tell us what we should know'' that we might as well ``just recess \nfor the rest of the year.'' On the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein \nreported that she would not vote for the subpoenas because the \n``telephone companies who are trying to be a good citizen should not be \nheld out to dry.'' As a member of both the Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittees, she added that ``it is very difficult for this committee to \nlegislate without knowing the program'' and therefore the Intelligence \nCommittee was the appropriate venue for legislation on the matter. \nSenator Dick Durbin, noting the absence of many Republicans, \ncomplained, ``I thought there would be a conversation about this, but \napparently there will not be.'' He continued that the ``fortitude and \nstrength [I] had shown in this committee, leading up through the month \nof May has ended in a June swoon.''\n  When this uncomfortable meeting--and the accompanying slings--\nconcluded, I drafted what I refer to as a ``lawyer's letter'' to the \nVice President. I wrote:\n\n       I was surprised, to say the least, that you sought to \n     influence, really determine, the action of the Committee \n     without calling me first, or at least calling me at some \n     point. This was especially perplexing since we both attended \n     the Republican Senators caucus lunch yesterday and I walked \n     directly in front of you on at least two occasions en route \n     from the buffet to my table.\n\n  I concluded with a solemn warning:\n\n       If an accommodation cannot be reached with the \n     administration, the Judiciary Committee will consider \n     confronting the issue with subpoenas and enforcement.\n\n  This spat proved great fodder for the editors. The lurid details were \nsplashed across the pages of national newspapers around the country. \nThe Los Angeles Times confided that the ``unusually public rupture \nbetween a senior GOP lawmaker and the White House'' provided ``a rare \npublic glimpse of the tactics employed by a vice president who prefers \nto operate behind the scenes.'' It said I ``lashed out'' in a letter in \nan ``unusually harsh attack.'' This is Gregg Miller, Specter Says \nCheney Tried to Derail Hearings, Los Angeles Times, June 8, 2006, at \nA6. The front page headline of The Hill screamed ``Specter Rebukes \nCheney,'' and the Washington Post averred that the ``simmering \ntensions'' over the ``administrations tight-lipped position on the \nprograms'' had finally ``boiled over.'' see Alexander Bolton, Specter \nRebukes Cheney, The Hill, June 8, 2006, at 1; Michael A. Fletcher, \nCheney Plays Down Dispute With Specter, Washington Post, June 9, 2006, \nat A4.\n  Someone in Cheney's office must have been up all night, because I had \nmy reply by mid-morning the next day. The White House, he said, was \nwilling to negotiate in good faith. Extensive discussions culminated \nwith a compromise bill and a July 11, 2006, meeting with President Bush \nin the Oval Office. The President agreed to submit the surveillance \nprogram to judicial review, but was insistent that the Senate not alter \nthe agreed-upon terms. Usually, after securing such an agreement, one \nwalks out of the Oval Office to the cameras and advertises it, but I \nchose to make the announcement at the committee's next executive \nsession on July 13.\n  My bill of 2006 to expand and revise FISA gave jurisdiction to the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court--the Intelligence Court--which \nwas set up by the original FISA law to rule on surveillance requests by \nFederal agencies--to review the legality of the Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram. Determining the constitutionality of the program would turn \nupon submissions to the Intelligence Court by the attorney general \nabout its function and procedures, with particular attention to \nsafeguards to ensure that the Terrorist Surveillance Program targeted \nsuspected terrorists and not innocent Americans. The bill further \nrequired the attorney general to inform the House and Senate \nIntelligence Committees of all surveillance programs and created a new \ncriminal offense for misuse of intercepted information. In return, the \ngovernment was given additional flexibility with respect to the \nissuance and duration of emergency warrants. And in a nod to the \nadministration, the bill also acknowledged that the president, as \ncommander in chief, retains certain authority inherent in article II of \nthe Constitution, although it left decisions about the scope of that \nauthority to the courts.\n  Some complained that I had ``sold out'' in making this deal. See, \ne.g., Jonathan Mahler, After the Imperial Presidency, N.Y. Times, \nNovember 9, 2008, Magazine, at MM42. These critics fail to appreciate \nthe disadvantage Congress faces in resisting expansions of executive \npower. The Terrorist Surveillance Program was put into effect when \nPresident Bush signed a secret order in 2001. He did not need to hold \nany hearings or convince any colleagues. Vice President Cheney could \nrely on the fractious nature of the Senate, and the great influence of \nthe executive, to easily kill the prospects for my planned subpoenas of \nthe telephone companies. The administration's damage control, like the \ninitial action, was\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\nswift and unilateral. By contrast, on the legislative side, we could \nnot begin to act until we established a factual record through a series \nof hearings and secured consensus on a path forward.\n  As committee chairman, I was battered by Senators on both sides in my \nefforts for oversight. On the right, there were members who touted \nArticle II and party loyalty. They were inclined, at a minimum, to \naccept the strained arguments that the Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force had authorized the Terrorist Surveillance Program, and \nthat the failure to notify the full intelligence committees did not \nactually violate the National Security Act. On the left, there was \ngenuine outrage at some administration tactics, but they were also in \nno hurry for compromise, no matter how favorable the terms. They were \nvery cognizant of the fact that the longer they let the friction \nbetween the branches drag on, the worse it looked for Republicans and \nthe better for them and their allies. For example, as the New York Sun \nreported in June 2006, ``[f]ear of government excess in the war on \nterror ha[d] driven membership rolls'' in the ACLU ``to more than \n550,000 from less than 300,000,'' and the group's fundraising had \n``surged.'' See Josh Gerstein, For ACLU's Anthony Romero, These Should \nBe Best Times, New York Sun, June 27, 2006.\n  Ultimately, the Judiciary Committee approved my FISA reform bill on \nSeptember 13, 2006, but in contrast to the bipartisan vote on the \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization a year earlier, there was a 10-8 party-line \nvote. A final vote on the Senate floor was never taken, largely because \nthe House had settled on a different approach to the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program that did not authorize court review of the \nprogram. Once again, the inherent constraints on the bicameral \nlegislative branch served to benefit the executive, as the President's \nsurveillance program continued unabated throughout our internal \ndebates.\n  The courts fared no better at reining in the Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram. In August 2006, Judge Anna Diggs Taylor of the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Michigan issued an opinion in ACLU v. \nNSA, finding the program unconstitutional. Almost a year later, in July \n2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit overturned her \ndecision. On a 2-1 vote, it declined to rule on the legality of the \nprogram, finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit. \nThe Supreme Court then declined to hear the case, even though the \ndoctrine of standing has enough flexibility for the Court to have \nacted. My bill to mandate Supreme Court review of this and other cases \ntherefore seems all the more necessary to resolve the question.\n  With the Supreme Court abstaining, another lone district judge took a \nstand. In In re National Security Agency Telecommunications Records \nLitigation, Chief Judge Vaughn Walker in the Northern District of \nCalifornia considered a case brought by an Islamic charity that claims \nto have been a subject of the surveillance program. In a 56-page \nopinion he wrote:\n\n  Congress appears clearly to have intended to--and did--establish the \nexclusive means for foreign intelligence surveillance activities to be \nconducted. Whatever power the executive may otherwise have had in this \nregard, FISA limits the power of the executive branch to conduct such \nactivities.\n\n  As detailed further below, the hurdles faced by the few judges \nwilling to examine the Terrorist Surveillance Program, and the snails' \npace of appellate review, make my bill to mandate Supreme Court review \nof this and other cases all the more necessary to resolve the question.\n\n\n  Shortcomings of the Legislative and Judicial Branches as Checks on \n                            Executive Power.\n\n  The courts, including the Supreme Court, have admittedly been more \neffective than Congress in restraining executive excesses, but both \nhave been too slow. This failure is exemplified by the judicial and \nlegislative efforts to address the administration's treatment of \ndetainees in the war on terror.\n  In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, decided on June 28, 2004, nearly 3 years after \nSeptember 11, the Supreme Court ruled that a U.S. citizen being held as \nan enemy combatant must be given an opportunity to contest the factual \nbasis for his detention before a neutral magistrate. In a stern rebuke \nof executive overreaching, Justice O'Connor's opinion declared, ``We \nhave long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for \nthe president when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' \nThe same day, the Court held in Rasul v. Bush that detainees at \nGuantanamo Bay were entitled to challenge their detention by filing \nhabeas corpus petitions--the time honored legal action used to contest \nthe basis for government confinement. Two years later, on June 29, \n2006, the Court announced in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the President \ncould not conduct military commission trials under procedures that had \nnot been authorized by Congress and that failed to satisfy the \nobligations of the Geneva Conventions' Common article III and the \nUniform Code of Military Justice.\n  Instead of fully embracing these decisions, however, Congress \nresponded with the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military Commissions \nAct of 2006, both of which eliminated detainees' right to habeas corpus \nreview on grounds that foreign terrorist suspects did not have the same \nrights as others in U.S. custody.\n  During debate on the Military Commissions Act, I offered an amendment \nthat would have guaranteed habeas corpus for detainees. In the face of \nsharp criticism from my own party, I argued that I was not speaking \n``in favor of enemy combatants.'' Rather, I was ``trying to establish . \n. . a course of judicial procedure'' to determine whether the accused \nwere in fact enemy combatants. I pointed out that my fight to preserve \nhabeas rights was, in essence, a struggle to defend ``the jurisdiction \nof the federal courts to maintain the rule of law.'' I concluded with a \nplea for the Senate not to deny ``the habeas corpus right which would \ntake us back some 900 years and deny the fundamental principle of the \nMagna Charta imposed on King John at Runnymede.'' Despite these \nentreaties, my amendment narrowly lost on a 48-51 vote.\n\n  I had lost the battle, but was not prepared to surrender. On January \n18, 2007, Attorney General Gonzales testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee and argued that proposals to restore habeas corpus, such as a \nbill Senator Leahy and I had introduced, were ``ill-advised and frankly \ndefy common sense.'' I was astounded at his claim that ``there is no \nexpress grant of habeas in the Constitution.'' I asked him: ``The \nconstitution says you can't take it away except in case of rebellion or \ninvasion. Doesn't that mean you have the right of habeas corpus unless \nthere is an invasion or rebellion?'' He replied, ``The constitution \ndoes not say every individual in the United States or every citizen is \nhereby granted or assured the right to habeas. . . . It simply says the \nright of habeas corpus shall not be suspended.'' I protested, ``You may \nbe treading on your interdiction and violating common sense, Mr. \nAttorney General.''\n  This exchange received notice in a number of papers, as my position \ngained momentum. The Detroit Free Press, for example, editorialized:\n\n       The moment when Alberto Gonzales proved he was just wrong \n     for the job of U.S. attorney general came . . . after Sen. \n     Arlen Specter, R-Pa., asked him about the constitutional \n     guarantee of criminal due process, known as habeas corpus.\n\n  See Editorial, Gonzales Twisted Rule of Law Too Well, Detroit Free \nPress, August 28, 2007.\n  That September, I made a second attempt to restore habeas corpus \njurisdiction with an amendment to the Defense Department's \nauthorization bill. This time, a majority of Senators voted for it, \nincluding seven Republicans. Unfortunately, the 56-43 majority was \ninsufficient because, in the face of a filibuster threat, Senate \nprocedure required sixty votes to pass. Ironically, a procedural tool \nthat protects Senate minorities had become a shield for the executive \nbranch.\n  Thus, yet again, it was left to the Supreme Court to beat back the \nencroachment of executive power, which it finally did on June 12, 2008. \nIn Boumediene v. Bush, the Court held that detainees held at Guantanamo \nBay ``are entitled to the privilege of habeas corpus to challenge the \nlegality of their detention.'' Because the Combatant Status Review \nTribunals established by the Defense Department in 2004, following the \nHamdi and Rasul decisions, and the limited procedural review permitted \nbefore the DC Circuit\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\nfailed to constitute an adequate and effective substitute for habeas \ncorpus, the Court held that the Military Commissions Act had effected \n``an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.''\n  As satisfying as it was to be vindicated, I was frustrated that \nCongress had left the task of reining in the executive to slow-paced \nand incomplete judicial review. While the Boumediene decision ensured \nhabeas rights for detainees, it took 7 years; and even then the Court \nalmost failed to take on the case. All along, the Court's rulings were \npiecemeal and avoided taking strong stands on controversial \nconstitutional questions. The result was a protracted process that \ndelayed justice for detainees and left important areas of \nconstitutional law murky.\n  Indeed, the Supreme Court actually denied Boumediene's initial \npetition for review on April 2, 2007. Then, on June 29, in a highly \nunusual move, the Court reconsidered and agreed to hear the case. The \njustices gave no reason for the reversal, but some speculate that they \nwere moved by intervening disclosures concerning the military \ncommissions. In particular, a military officer and lawyer who had been \ninvolved in overseeing the tribunals said that the process was flawed \nand that prosecutors had been pressured to label detainees as enemy \ncombatants.\n  As much time as it took in these cases, at least the Supreme Court \neventually ruled on the merits in Boumediene. The same cannot be said \nfor Supreme Court review, or even substantive appellate review, of \nPresident Bush's warrantless wiretapping program. Thus far, only \nindividual judges in the district courts of Michigan and California \nhave been willing to take a strong stand on the Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram.\n  Like many in the legislature, it appears the courts are reluctant to \nact. They do not want the responsibility. Only after significant time \nhas passed, and it is relatively safe, do they finally consider such \nissues on the merits. I have proposed legislation in the past to \nrequire expedited review of certain important cases, including the \nchallenges by civil liberties organizations and other plaintiffs to the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program, and I will do so again in the new \nCongress.\n\n\n                           Signing Statements\n\n  Even where Congress manages to negotiate its internal checks and to \nact decisively against expansions of executive power, presidents have \nused signing statements that override the legislative language and defy \ncongressional intent.\n\n  There was an explosion in the use of signing statements during the \nBush administration. The Boston Globe reported in 2006 that President \nBush ``has used signing statements to claim the authority to disobey \nmore than 750 statutes--more laws than all previous presidents \ncombined.'' This is Charlie Savage, In Proposed Iran Deal, Bush Might \nHave to Waive Law: '05 Statute Forbids Providing Reactor, Boston Globe, \nJune 8, 2006.\n  Two prominent examples make the point. As detailed earlier, I \nspearheaded the delicate negotiations on the PATRIOT Act \nReauthorization which included months of painstaking efforts to balance \nnational security and civil liberties, disrupted by the dramatic \ndisclosure of the Terrorist Surveillance Program. The final version of \nthe bill to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act featured a carefully crafted \ncompromise, which was necessary to secure its passage in 2006. Among \nother things, it included several oversight provisions designed to \nensure that the FBI did not abuse special terrorism-related powers \npermitting it to make secret demands for business records. President \nBush signed the measure into law, only to enter a signing statement \ninsisting that he could withhold from Congress any information required \nby the oversight provisions if he decided that disclosure would \n``impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative process \nof the executive, or the performance of the executive's constitutional \nduties.''\n  The second example arose in 2005. Congress overwhelmingly passed \nSenator John McCain's amendment to ban all U.S. personnel from \ninflicting ``cruel, inhuman or degrading'' treatment on any prisoner \nheld by the United States. There was no ambiguity in Congress's intent; \nin fact, the Senate approved the proposal 90-9. However, after signing \nthe bill into law, the President quietly issued a signing statement \nasserting that his administration would construe it ``in a manner \nconsistent with the constitutional authority of the President to \nsupervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and \nconsistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power.''\n  Many understood this signing statement to undermine the legislation. \nIn a January 4, 2006, article titled ``Bush Could Bypass New Torture \nBan: Waiver Right Is Reserved,'' the Boston Globe cited an anonymous \n``senior administration official,'' according to whom ``the president \nintended to reserve the right to use harsher methods in special \nsituations involving national security.''\n  These signing statements are outrageous, intruding on the \nConstitution's delegation of ``all legislative powers'' to Congress, \nbut it is even more outrageous that Congress has done nothing to \nprotect its constitutional powers. The legislation I introduced in 2006 \nwould have given Congress standing to challenge the constitutionality \nof these signing statements, but has until now failed to muster the \nveto-proof majority it would surely require. The executive branch \noperates free of such internal dissent. Although John McCain promised \nto drop signing statements altogether, Barack Obama, while deploring \nBush's practice, said during the campaign that ``no one doubts that it \nis appropriate to use signing statements to protect a president's \nconstitutional prerogatives.''\n  Here again, the President does not need to convince any colleagues to \nissue a signing statement, he needs only put pen to paper. Indeed, 2 \ndays after criticizing President Bush's signing statements, President \nObama issued one of his own regarding the Omnibus Appropriations Act of \n2009. Citing among others his ``commander in chief'' and ``foreign \naffairs'' powers, he refused to be bound by at least 11 specific \nprovisions of the bill including one longstanding rider to \nappropriations bills designed to aid congressional oversight. As I told \nthe Wall Street Journal, ``We're having a repeat of what Democrats \nbitterly complained about under President Bush,'' and if President \nObama ``wants to pick a fight, Congress has plenty of authority to \nretaliate.''\n\n\n               The Terrorist Surveillance Program--Act II\n\n  Many of the issues surrounding the Terrorist Surveillance Program and \nexecutive authority resurfaced in 2008. FISA reform legislation, which \nbegan making its way through the Senate in February of last year, \nincluded a controversial provision giving retroactive immunity to the \ntelecommunications companies for their alleged cooperation with the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program.\n  Throughout, my chief concern was to keep the way to the courts open \nas a means to check executive excesses. I offered an amendment, both in \ncommittee and on the floor, to substitute the U.S. Government for the \ntelephone companies facing lawsuits related to the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program. Instead of immunity, my amendment would have put \nthe government in the place of the companies, so the cases could go \nforward without posing a legal threat to the companies themselves.\n  When this proposal was defeated, I proposed yet another amendment, \nwhich would have required a federal district court to determine that \nthe surveillance itself was constitutional before granting immunity. I \nalso cosponsored an amendment that would have delayed the retroactive \nimmunity for the telephone companies until a mandatory inspector \ngeneral's report on the Terrorist Surveillance Program had been issued.\n  I tried to impress upon my colleagues the importance of our actions:\n\n       We are dealing here with a matter that is of historic \n     importance. I believe that years from now, historians will \n     look back on this period from 9/11 to the present as the \n     greatest expansion of Executive authority in history--\n     unchecked expansion of authority . . . The Supreme Court of \n     the United States has gone absent without leave on the issue, \n     in my legal opinion. When the Detroit Federal judge found the \n     terrorist surveillance program unconstitutional, it was \n     [reversed] by the Sixth Circuit on a 2-to-1 opinion on \n     grounds of lack of standing. Then the Supreme Court refused \n     to review the case. But\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\n     the very formidable dissenting opinion laid out all of the \n     grounds where there was ample basis to grant standing. Now we \n     have Chief Judge Walker declaring the act unconstitutional. \n     The Congress ought to let the courts fulfill their \n     constitutional function. . . . Although I am prepared to \n     stomach this bill, if I must, I am not yet ready to concede \n     that the debate is over. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, \n     I don't believe it is too late to make this bill better.\n\n  The date was July 7 and the Senate had just returned from recess, \nwhich allowed me to close with a flourish:\n\n       Perhaps the Fourth of July holiday will inspire the Senate \n     to exercise its independence from the executive branch now \n     that we have returned to Washington.\n\n  Despite my fight to keep the courts open, in the end all my \namendments were defeated. Nevertheless, as I said I would, I ultimately \nvoted for the FISA reform bill. I chose not to reject the entire \npackage--which had the support of nearly seventy senators, including \nboth presidential candidates--not only because my classified briefings \non the surveillance program convinced me of its value, but also because \nof the important oversight provisions it imposed on future surveillance \nprograms.\n  The FISA reform bill required prior court review of the government's \nprocedures for surveillance of foreign targets, except in exigent \ncircumstances. It also required that the Intelligence Court determine \nwhether procedures for foreign targeting satisfy fourth amendment \nprotections against unreasonable searches. In addition, before \nmonitoring U.S. citizens outside the country, it required \nindividualized court orders based on probable cause. Finally, the bill \nmandated a comprehensive review of the Terrorist Surveillance Program \nby several inspectors general. Indeed, the final bill had many elements \nin common with my earliest efforts to place the Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram under FISA--it just took years to get there. And Congress and \nthe courts may yet need to correct its flaws.\n\n\n                         A Plan for the Future\n\n  These experiences have crystallized for me the need for Congress and \nthe courts to reassert themselves in our system of checks and balances. \nThe bills I have outlined are important steps in that process. Equally \nimportant is vigorous congressional oversight of the executive branch. \nThis oversight must extend well beyond the national security arena, \nespecially as we cede more and more authority over our economy to \ngovernment officials.''\n  As for curbing executive branch excesses from within, I hope \nPresident Obama lives up to his campaign promise of change. His recent \nsigning statements have not been encouraging. Adding to the feeling of \ndeja vu is the Washington Post's report that the new administration has \nreasserted the ``state secrets'' privilege to block lawsuits \nchallenging controversial policies like warrantless wiretapping: \n``Obama has not only maintained the Bush administration approach, but \n[in one such case] the dispute has intensified.'' Government lawyers \nare now asserting that the trial court lacks authority to compel \ndisclosure of secret documents, and ``warning'' that the government \nmight ``spirit away'' the material before the court can release it to \nthe litigants. This is Carrie Johnson, ``Handling of `State Secrets' at \nIssue: Like Predecessor, New Justice Dept. Claiming Privilege,'' The \nWashington Post, March 25, 2009. As the article notes, I have \nreintroduced legislation this year with Senators Leahy and Kennedy to \nreform the state secrets privilege. I doubt that the Democratic \nmajority, which was so eager to decry expansions of executive authority \nunder President Bush, will still be as interested in the problem with a \nDemocratic president in office. I will continue the fight whatever \nhappens.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of \nS. 875, S. 876 and S. 877 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nOklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas be given 5 minutes as in morning business and then that \nwe return to me and go back on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Nearly half a million Arkansans \nare uninsured, including 66,000 Arkansas children. The cost in both \nhuman and financial terms is felt by everybody. That is why, during \nthis work period, I traveled the State on a 2-week tour to ``take the \npulse'' of Arkansans and of health care in our communities and across \nour State. I met with patients, providers, advocacy groups, and all of \nthe other health care professionals in every corner of our State. We \ndiscussed the challenges we face delivering and accessing quality and \naffordable health care in rural Arkansas. It was a wonderful tour, very \nopen. People were frustrated, concerned, and they had good ideas. They \nwere very much interested in being able to help us in Washington move \nforward on this issue. I felt as if the will, and certainly the desire, \nwas there among Arkansans to fix this problem.\n  My first stop was in Clinton, AR, located in Van Buren County, where \n26 percent of the residents there are uninsured, and many are on \nMedicare or Medicaid. A local pharmacist raised concerns with the \nburden of paperwork, regulations, and fees required by CMS for \npharmacists to supply medical equipment and supplies. A nurse \npractitioner talked about ways to fill gaps in our primary care \nworkforce and how it was in areas like that. Others stressed the need \nto address the preventive health needs in our State, such as smoking \ncessation and prevention of obesity and related health conditions.\n  Next, I went to Augusta, AR, in our row cropland, and I heard from \nArkansans who said that high-deductible plans are not meeting their \nneeds. As a result, these patients often miss out on very important \nprimary and preventive care because they cannot afford their plans' \nexpensive copays and deductibles; therefore, they end up being more \ncostly to the system without that preventive or primary care because \nthey end up in more acute-care situations.\n  In Lake Village, AR, on the eastern side of the State, people talked \nabout the need to improve dental coverage within Medicare and in \nprivate insurance. I also heard from veterans who are forced to drive \nlong distances to receive care and expressed the real need for more \nrural VA clinics and not only how much better quality of life it would \nprovide them but the cost savings it could provide as well to the VA \nand the whole implementation of health care delivery to our veterans.\n  Across the State in Nashville, AR, I spoke with a provider about the \ndifficulty in recruiting specialists in rural Arkansas. Health \ntechnologies, such as remote patient monitoring and mobile imaging, may \nhelp to provide special access to those rural areas, where it may not \nbe efficient for each rural community to have a multitude of \nspecialists located in their communities. At least they can serve there \nand provide their services with equipment that is much needed.\n  My final stop was in Springdale, northwest Arkansas, close to the \nOklahoma border. I heard from seniors who have had trouble finding a \nprovider that will accept Medicare.\n  We must build our primary care workforce and address reimbursement \ninequities in these rural areas in order to help Arkansans on Medicare \ngain access to the care they need. We had a long discussion about the \nneed for more primary care professionals, physicians, and certainly the \nfact that it is not just the reimbursement, it is also the quality of \nlife in these rural areas. Making sure we can grow our own primary care \nphysicians in these rural areas does an awful lot in making sure we \nhave those providers in the areas who can serve those individuals.\n  In all of these places, good Arkansas neighbors working to take care \nof their neighbors were always present, whether it was community health \ncenters, which are working desperately hard to use the money from the \nrecovery package to increase their ability to cover more of the \nuninsured, or whether it was the nonprofits or religious-based\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\nclinics that were doing a tremendous job partnering with our hospitals \nto keep people out of the emergency room and getting some of their lab \nwork done by the hospitals but still being able to provide care in \nthose clinics.\n  So all in all, it was a great opportunity for me. I love traveling \nArkansas anyway, visiting with the great people in our State, but it \nreally showed the concerns we talk about here in Washington, and you \nget to see them face to face.\n  I think these stories help illustrate how critical it is for \nresidents of Arkansas and other rural areas to have easy, affordable \naccess to health care. I was grateful to meet with so many Arkansans \nand to be able to share their stories with my colleagues here, and as \nwe move forward in this debate, it makes a big difference. My staff was \nthere, as always, because there are so many issues. Sometimes people \ndon't know where to go. Having our staff be able to talk to them and \ndirect them in those ways is very valuable. Remembering the educational \ncomponent in health care and how we make sure information is going to \nbe available to people is a critical part of it.\n  This week, in the Senate Finance Committee, we launched its first of \nthree roundtable discussions in advance of drafting a health care bill. \nI strongly believe Congress must craft health reform legislation that \nlowers costs, improves quality, and provides access to coverage for all \nAmericans. I compliment Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley for the \ngreat way they have approached this--last year having multiple hearings \nand coming again this year with more hearings and a roundtable \nsituation. We had a summit last summer. These things have been very \nbeneficial to the debate in a bipartisan way.\n  From my seat on the Senate Finance Committee, I will work to ensure \nwe have guaranteed coverage for people with preexisting conditions; \ncontinuity of coverage for people between jobs, which we see oftentimes \nand particularly in this economic setting; maintain affordability for \npeople who are privately insured; and have Medicaid eligibility for \nevery uninsured American living in poverty.\n  Mr. President, one of the things I noticed that was so positive out \nthere with Arkansans is that, although they are frustrated and \nconcerned about where we are going and what we are going to do, their \nwill to do this now is there. The American people feel it is a must-do \nsituation for us in this economy for the quality of life we want to \nhave. I think that in this body we have an opportunity not only to do \nit but to do it correctly.\n  We are very proud of the incredible medical professionals who are in \nthis country, folks such as my colleague from Oklahoma, who is \ntremendous in his own profession as a physician. We are proud of that. \nWe want to make sure we correct the insufficiencies for those \nindividuals and be able to provide the services at a cost people can \nafford and have an accessibility that leaves nobody out, whether you \nlive in a major city or in a rural area. I believe this is one of the \nmost urgent issues facing our Nation, and it is time for action. We \nneed to move forward on health care reform.\n  I very much appreciate the opportunity I have had to visit with \nArkansans. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Finance \nCommittee in a bipartisan way to move the health care reform initiative \nforward, and also with the rest of the Senators here, to come up with a \nproposal the American people will be proud of. They know it won't be a \nwork of art, necessarily, but a work in progress as we move ourselves \nfrom a health care system that has been focused on acute care into \nsomething that is certainly more focused on chronic conditions, \nmultiple chronic conditions, and making sure we make those manageable \nusing preventive health care and certainly the primary care that will \nkeep us healthier longer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                              Trade Policy\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I have heard lots of discussion in the \nnewspapers in the last 48 hours or so, that there is a move afoot to \nbegin to continue to bring legislation to the House and Senate floors \nto continue Bush trade policy. There have been statements by some in \nboth parties that we might consider passing the trade agreement, the \nso-called free trade agreement with Panama, the free trade agreement \nwith Colombia, and the free trade agreement with South Korea.\n  I think that is a mistake. When you look at what has happened in \nStates such as Ohio, and particularly in a State like that of the \nPresiding Officer--in Buffalo and Rochester and Syracuse and the \nupstate cities in her State, you can see the kind of incredible job \nloss, not only from this most recent recession since October but look \nat the job loss in manufacturing that we have seen through the entire \nBush years while this Government has moved forward on Bush trade \npolicies.\n  Look at the original North American Free Trade Agreement negotiated \nby the first President Bush, unfortunately the finishing touches put on \nby President Clinton, and then the Central American Trade Agreement \npassed by the House and Senate in the midpart of this decade, and now \nconsidering again trade agreements negotiated by Bush trade negotiators \nwith Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Unfortunately what we have seen \nis a huge spike--more than a spike because it is more long term and \nfundamental than that--we see the huge growth in our trade deficit. We \nhave today a trade deficit of $2 billion just for today, and $2 billion \nfor tomorrow, and $2 billion for Saturday, and $2 billion for Sunday. \nEvery day it's a $2 billion trade deficit. George Bush the first said a \n$1 billion surplus or deficit translates into some 13,000 jobs, so a \ntrade deficit of $2 billion, according to President Bush the first, \ntranslates into 26,000 lost jobs; a $2 billion trade surplus would be \n26,000 gained jobs. In this country, we haven't seen a trade surplus \nsince 1973. What that says is this trade policy leads to persistent \ntrade deficits. This trade policy leads to persistent job loss. And \nthis trade policy leads to families who are hurt and communities which \nare destroyed.\n  I can take you to lot of places in my State and you can look at the \nhavoc wreaked by U.S. trade policy. I do not blame all of manufacture's \ndecline, all of job loss, on trade policy, to be sure. But there is no \nquestion when you have a $2 billion-a-day trade deficit over the course \nof a year, between $700 and $800 billion trade deficit for a year, you \nknow that is a problem.\n  My point is not to debate trade policy today. It is only to say to \nthe administration and my friends on both sides of the aisle and the \ncrowd at the end of the hall here in the House of Representatives, we \nshould not be bringing up more trade agreements until we look at what \nour trade policy does. I can point not just to job loss; I can also \npoint to what happened as an outgrowth of the Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations with China, our trade policy with China, when I believe seven \npeople in Toledo, OH, and dozens around the country died from the \ntaking of the blood thinner heparin, ingredients of which came from \nChina and those ingredients were contaminated. Or you can look at toys. \nIn an experiment, a class assignment by Professor Jeff Weidenheimer at \nAshland University, not far from where I grew up, he sent out first-\nyear chemistry students to stores to buy toys at Halloween and \nChristmas and Easter and found lead-based paint, which is toxic for \nchildren, on many of these toys, again coming from China--United States \ncorporations outsourcing jobs, then hiring subcontractors in China. So \nwe are not just importing goods, we are also importing lead-based \npaint, also importing contaminated ingredients in heparin, also in \nvitamins, in dog food and other products.\n  My point is let's do a dispassionate, nonideological, nonpartisan \nstudy before we do more trade agreements.\n\n[[Page S4628]]\n\nLet's do a nonpartisan, nonideological, unbiased study of how NAFTA has \nworked, how CAFTA has worked, how our relations with China with PNTR \nand currency, how all that has worked before we move ahead.\n  In these turbulent economic times, first, we have plenty to do, on \nhealth care, education, climate change, housing, particularly on the \nbanking system, and all of that. We have plenty to do, but that is not \neven the point. The point is before we do more trade agreements, let's \nlook at how they worked. Let's look at what has happened, especially \nrather than following the Bush trade agenda which we know simply has \nnot served this country well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, once upon a time, someone had a good \nidea about trying to open the mortgage market to as many people as \npossible. Between that moment and now, we have seen a giant economic \ncrisis that has mushroomed out of control. We have sat around for \nmonths now trying to figure out how did it happen and why did it \nhappen.\n  One of the reasons it happened is, using common sense, we said to \npeople: You can go make money by talking people into borrowing money, \nand you do not have to worry about whether they pay it back. Let me go \nthrough that one more time. We said to a market, the mortgage market: \nIf you go talk people into borrowing more money than they can afford, \nit does not matter if they can pay it back, you do not need to worry \nabout that because you are going to make your money anyway.\n  In other words, the people closing their loans had no skin in the \ngame. They were not a partner to the risk. So that is how we got people \nqualifying for loans by wearing a special costume and photograph. That \nis how you got these ``liars loans.'' They were called ``liars loans.'' \nEverybody knew people were lying to get these loans, but no one was \ndoing anything about it because the people who were making the loans \nwere making the money and had no risk.\n  You would think with this occurring, we would now be on hyper alert \nfor the exact same set of circumstances, but we are not. Because it is \ngoing on today as we speak. If you turn on any cable channel almost \nanywhere in America, before midnight you are going to see an ad that \nsays to seniors: You need to take advantage of a great Government \nprogram, a Government benefit. You can be paid cash for the value of \nyour house without any risk. They are called reverse mortgages.\n  It is a type of home loan that converts the value in your home you \nhave acquired over a lifetime and converts it to cash. Now, in and of \nitself, this is not a bad concept. People ought to be able to borrow \nagainst the value of their homes. We do it with home equity loans.\n  Here is the problem. We have the people closing these loans who have \nno skin in the game. Guess who is insuring all these loans. We are. The \ntaxpayers. There is no risk to those people paying for those ads on \ncable TV, no risk. Reward. No risk. We are taking the risk.\n  If, in fact, the housing markets go down and the value of someone's \nproperty goes down and it is time for that loan, the value of that loan \nto be recovered when the house is sold, if it does not sell for enough \nmoney, guess who is left holding the bag.\n  Hello. Subprime mortgages chapter two. We are back. We have the same \nissue we had with the subprime. Since we began this program in 1990, \nHUD has endorsed and insured 500,000 loans. But, wait, we took the cap \noff it recently. We anticipate that HUD will, in fact, insure 200,000 \nof these loans this year alone. We have done 500,000 loans since 1990, \nand we are going to do 200,000 loans this year. We are talking about a \nhuge growth in the potential liability to the American taxpayer.\n  These are complex and expensive loans. For many elderly, the equity \nthey have in their home is it. With the economic circumstances we have \nright now, there is going to be a lot of pressure on the elderly to \nenter into one of these reverse mortgages, maybe to help other family \nmembers who have lost a job.\n  It is important we fix this program. It is embarrassing that we let \nthe subprime mess go for as long as we did, without anybody saying: \nWhoa, hold on. It will be doubly embarrassing if we allow this reverse \nmortgage situation to go down the exact same path.\n  With these loans, as they increase dramatically in number and value, \nwe are also seeing an increase in fraud. The HUD inspector general has \nbeen working in the reverse mortgage field, and all the other \ninspectors general in our country have done a great job of beginning to \nfind problems of a specific nature as it relates to fraud.\n  Some of it is where we have inflated appraisals. Some of it is where \nyou have shoddy repairs being done, which decrease the value of the \nhome, which increase the risk to the taxpayer. Some of it is people \ncontinuing to collect the proceeds on the home past the time they \nshould, past perhaps the death or the moving out of the senior who did \nthe loan in the first place.\n  Why is the fraud increasing? I have a theory why the fraud is \nincreasing. All the bad actors over there in subprime, they are looking \nfor a new stream of money so they are all sliding over and saying: Hey, \nlet us start making these reverse mortgages to seniors.\n  OK. We have to do something about this now. I filed an amendment to \nthe legislation that is in front of the Senate that will do some \nimportant things in terms of fraud prevention and detection and \nenforcement provisions: We are going to require the borrower to certify \nthey reside in the property; to report the termination of the residence \nto HUD; require that in the case of a property that is purchased with \nthe proceeds of a reverse mortgage, the property is owned and occupied \nfor at least 180 days, so we do not have the flipping we have seen in \nthe subprime market; require these properties be appraised by certified \nappraisers, HUD-certified appraisers; we have to verify the purchase \nprice to ensure the appraised value is not inflated and make sure the \nappraised value is not too high in relation to comparable properties--\nyou can imagine how important this is right now since our housing \nmarket values are in such flux--to require the counselors to report \nsuspected fraud or abuse to HUD's inspector general and to inform \nprospective borrowers how they can report suspected fraud and consumer \nabuse; require that the lenders and consumers maintain a system to \nensure compliance; explicitly state that the HUD inspector general has \nthe authority to conduct independent audits and inspections of the \nlender.\n  Would it not have been nice had we done that back when we started \nhaving the problems with subprimes? Conduct independent audits and \ninspections of reverse mortgage lenders to make sure they are in \ncompliance with the requirements; and to compare the reverse borrower's \nrecord against the Social Security's death master file for early \nindications for when payouts should end because payouts under these \nreverse mortgages stop at the death of the recipient of the reverse \nmortgage; provide that any limitation on when criminal charges can be \nbrought against fraud perpetrators in this area be calculated on when \nwe find out about the criminal activity, not when it occurred. Because, \nin many instances, we may not find out about the fraud until the \nelderly person dies, and then they find out that maybe they thought \nthey still had value in their home, but they were lied to.\n  This is an important one: Provide that advertising for reverse \nmortgages cannot be false or misleading and must present a fair and \nbalanced portrayal of the risks and the benefits of the product.\n  The fraud is the first step. Going after fraud is the first step, but \nwe have to do more. It is very important that we protect our seniors \nfrom predatory lenders. When you see these ads on TV, it sounds too \ngood to be true. ``Government benefit,'' ``No risk.'' But there is a \nhuge risk. There is a risk of a senior paying more than they should for \na product that does not work for them and a very big risk for the \ntaxpayers of this country.\n\n[[Page S4629]]\n\n  I look forward to working with the Senate Judiciary and Banking \nCommittees as well as HUD and the HUD inspector general and GAO to get \nthe things done we must do to clean up this problem. If we do not learn \nfrom our mistakes, we are doomed to repeat them. I urge all my \ncolleagues to become knowledgeable about this reverse mortgage area, \nget word to their constituents to be careful about these reverse \nmortgages. They are very dangerous.\n  At the end of the day, if someone is making money off you and they do \nnot care whether you can pay it back, it is a dangerous combination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from Missouri \nfor her statement. I hope people listen to what she had to say because \nit is a warning to many. Again, I would reiterate that one of the \nreasons we are trying to move this fraud bill through, everybody will \nbe against fraud and everybody is against crime, but as the Senator \nfrom Missouri knows so well, you have to have some laws on the book to \ngo after fraud and go after crime. I wish to speak further on that, but \nI see my dear friend and distinguished colleague from Vermont on the \nfloor.\n  I will yield the floor so he can also speak on a matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my colleague from Vermont. I wish to \ncongratulate him for bringing forth a very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Clearly, if we are going to begin to address the crisis in our \nfinancial institutions, we need the manpower to go out there and do the \ninvestigations. We do not have it and this legislation does that.\n  I wished to say a few words in the midst of this debate on an issue. \nI am not bringing forth an amendment, but I did wish to say a few words \non that; that is, in my office--I suspect in every Senate office--we \nare being deluged with e-mails and letters and telephone calls \nexpressing outrage at the high interest rates people all across this \ncountry are being forced to pay by these very same financial \ninstitutions we are in the process of bailing out.\n  What is going on now is that while we spend hundreds of billions of \ndollars bailing out our friends on Wall Street, and while they receive \nzero interest loans from the Fed, what they are saying to the American \npeople is: Thanks very much for the bailout. We are going to raise your \ninterest rates from 15 to 20, to 25, to 30 percent. Pure and simply, \nthat is called usury within Biblical terms. In fact, that is immoral. \nThat is the type of action we should be eliminating right now.\n  I have introduced legislation which is very similar to the type of \nlegislation that regulates credit unions right now. We would have a \nmaximum interest rate of 15 percent, with some exceptions going to 18 \npercent, so the American people who are now on under great financial \nstress, who are buying groceries with their credit cards, who are \nbuying clothes for their kids with credit cards, who are paying for \ncollege expenses with their credit cards, are not forced to pay 25 or \n30 percent interest rates.\n  What I would like to do, rather than relate what I believe, is read a \nfew of the e-mails I have received from the constituents. We are \nreceiving a lot of them. Let me read one that comes from the northern \npart of our State. It says:\n\n       I, like so many others, am appalled at the hikes in credit \n     card rates. Everywhere in our small town of Montgomery \n     everybody is talking about the latest surge in interest \n     rates. People who are never late in payments have seen their \n     rates climb overnight. I, for one, used to overpay on my \n     payments but can't afford to now. In addition, I am a \n     founding member of a small agricultural co-op and we have a \n     shop and studio. Today we found out that the charge for using \n     credit cards has increased. How are people supposed to buy \n     things when small businesses can't afford to process credit \n     cards and people can't afford the interest rates if they use \n     cards? No one has any money for anything anymore. The \n     outrage, which I am sure doesn't surprise you, is building. \n     Doesn't anyone get it?\n\n  Well, doesn't anyone in the Senate get it? I hope we do.\n  Here is another one that comes from the largest city in our State, \nBurlington:\n\n       I signed up with MBNA (at the time) for a credit card with \n     an interest rate of 7.9 for the life of the credit card (as \n     long as I adhered to terms such as paying on time, not going \n     over limit, etc.) I received a notice yesterday that the \n     interest rate is going to 13% on May 1. I called them and \n     they said it had nothing to do with my credit. Bank of \n     America, due to the economic situation, is raising its rates \n     ``for business reasons only.'' One option they gave me is to \n     pay down my balance at 7.9 but not use it on any future \n     purchases. I now appreciate more than ever your fight against \n     this sort of action. Basically they can do whatever they \n     want.\n\n  That is quite right. They can do whatever they want.\n  Another one:\n\n       Dear Senator Sanders, we just received a note from Bank of \n     America in which they tell us that they are raising our \n     credit rate: 15.74 percent on new and outstanding purchases . \n     . . using a variable rate formula. I know you have been \n     working on a cap for credit cards and are very concerned \n     about big banks profiting so highly at the expense of \n     consumers.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Senator Sanders, there is a lot of news this week on how \n     the credit card companies are trying to recoup their losses \n     by raising interest rates on our credit cards. That is what \n     my husband and I have just experienced. Two months ago I ran \n     my husband's credit report, and between three credit bureaus \n     we ranked around a 800 credit score. We have never been late \n     on a payment and have been married 41 years.\n\n  Then she talks about the impact these high credit rates are going to \nhave on her.\n  Another one:\n\n       Dear Bernie, yesterday in the mail I received notification \n     from Bank of America that they were hiking up the interest on \n     my Visa card from 7% to over 12%. This seems arbitrary and in \n     a time when I am extremely worried about my ability to pay my \n     bills because my workload has gone way down. I am furious and \n     scared.\n\n  The bottom line is, I am receiving dozens of e-mails from people in \nmy State and from all over the country. They want to see whether the \nCongress has the guts to stand up to the financial institutions which \nhave poured $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions into \nWashington in the last 10 years.\n  What the American people are saying is that 30-percent interest \nrates--arbitrary and huge increases in interest rates for people who \nhave always paid their bills on time--is not only unfair, it is \nimmoral. People should not have to pay 30 percent to borrow money in \nthe United States.\n  I hope very much the time will come, sooner rather than later, when \nwe will pass a national usury law that will put a cap on interest rates \nfor large financial institutions similar to what exists for credit \nunions, which is 15 percent with some exceptions.\n  I yield the floor and look forward to working with the senior Senator \nfrom Vermont in passing this legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, with the vote and disposition of the Kyl \namendment today and the Kyl amendment and the Leahy-Grassley amendment \nyesterday, we have basically completed work on the underlying bill. \nThose were the only amendments that affected the underlying bipartisan \nfraud enforcement bill. A number of other amendments have come in, but \nthey, of course, have nothing to do with this bill. They are not within \nthe jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. They are, in large part, \nextraneous to the fraud enforcement bill. Many if not all are within \nthe jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I haven't seen one yet that \nshould be in Agriculture, but hope springs eternal. Today, a Senator \noffered an amendment drawn from the HELP Committee jurisdiction. In a \nway, it is a compliment that so few people have suggested changes that \nthey wanted to make to the Judiciary Committee bill. I guess Senators \nare anxious in case they are not around here next week when we have a \nBanking bill.\n  I would like to conclude consideration of the bill that actually is \nbefore the Senate. We will soon have a list of\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\namendments on which both sides will agree to have votes. I don't think \nany of them really have anything to do with the Judiciary bill, but \nevery Senator has a right to offer whatever amendments he or she wants, \nwhether germane to the bill or not, and to get a vote on them. If they \nare all going to require rollcall votes, we should be done certainly \nsometime before midnight. Then we can pick up the next piece of \nlegislation, which I understand we should have done by Saturday. Of \ncourse, the only amendments really involving this bill could have been \ndone yesterday. We could have finished this bill yesterday.\n  I would like to speak briefly about the bipartisan Fraud Enforcement \nand Recovery Act. This bill has received overwhelming support. Almost \neveryone recognizes the importance of strengthening the Federal \nGovernment's capacity to investigate and prosecute the kinds of \nfinancial frauds that have undermined our economy. The legislation has \nstrong bipartisan support. I applaud Senator Grassley, who is the lead \ncosponsor. He worked with me to write this bill. He has been a leader \non this issue.\n  Senators Specter and Snowe have joined as cosponsors. Many different \nlaw enforcement and good government organizations are supporting this \nbill as well, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association, the National Association of Assistant \nUnited States Attorneys, the Association of Certified Tax Examiners, \nand Taxpayers Against Fraud.\n  Now let me address the authorizations in the bill. I have rarely seen \nsuch detailed justification with regard to an authorization. I mention \nthis because this is not an appropriations bill. It is authorizing \nlegislation. It still has to go through the appropriations process. \nEvery agency authorized to receive money in the bill has set out in \ndetail exactly what it would do with that money if it is authorized and \nappropriated. The detail includes the number of agents, prosecutors, \nand other key personnel who would be hired, and each agency has \nexplained why the added resources are needed. Those detailed \njustifications have been shared with anyone interested in reviewing \nthem.\n  In total, the bill authorizes $245 million a year over the next 2 \nyears to hire more than 300 Federal agents, more than 200 prosecutors, \nand another 200 forensic analysts and support staff to rebuild our \nNation's fraud enforcement efforts. We have broken those numbers down \nagency by agency.\n  These resources for additional agents, analysts, and prosecutors are \ndesperately needed. The number of fraud cases is now skyrocketing, but \nresources were shifted away from fraud investigations after 9/11. \nToday, the ranks of fraud investigators and prosecutors are drastically \nunderstocked, and thousands of fraud allegations go unexamined each \nmonth.\n  Reports of mortgage fraud are up nearly 50 percent from a year ago \nand have increased tenfold over the past 7 years. In the last 3 years, \nthe number of criminal mortgage fraud investigations opened by the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, has more than doubled, and the \nFBI anticipates that number may double yet again. Despite this \nincrease, the FBI currently has fewer than 250 special agents \nnationwide assigned to financial fraud cases, which is only a quarter \nof the number the Bureau had more than a decade ago at the time of the \nsavings and loan crisis. At current levels, the FBI cannot even begin \nto investigate the more than 5000 mortgage fraud allegations the \nTreasury Department refers each month. Other agencies have documented \nsimilar crises in their ability to keep up with the rising pace of new \ncases.\n  We all know that fraud enforcement simply can't be adequately covered \nwith funds allocated in the recently passed recovery legislation for \nState and local law enforcement. As someone who pushed strongly for \nrecovery legislation that included State and local law enforcement, I \nknow the purpose behind those funds and what they are dedicated to. It \nis intended to ensure that State and local law enforcement agencies and \ncrime prevention programs could avoid layoffs, make new hires, and \nreinforce their work to prevent the increased crime so often associated \nwith economic downturns. In so doing, these funds would reinforce and \nrevitalize those neighborhoods that have experienced economic \ndevelopment and that could so easily backslide. State and local law \nenforcement fund are urgently needed for those vital purposes. They \nshould not be diverted from State and local law enforcement needs to \nfund Federal fraud investigations.\n\n  Moreover, while states have done admirable work cracking down on \nmortgage fraud, the Federal Government must play a substantial role in \nthis area. Mortgage fraud schemes and other financial fraud schemes \noften cover many States and jurisdictions, which hampers the ability of \nany State or local investigators and prosecutors to reach them. These \nschemes also are often extremely complex and labor-intensive to \nunravel, requiring the expertise and resources of the Federal \nGovernment and the mortgage fraud task forces in which Federal and \nState law enforcement officers work closely together. We simply cannot \nask States to solve this enormous and complex problem on their own. I \nbelieve that we need to be good law enforcement partners and that the \nFederal Government needs to do its share. To fulfill those \nresponsibilities these additional funds need to be authorized.\n  I agree that the $10 million in additional funding to the FBI for \nmortgage fraud enforcement in the omnibus appropriations bill is a good \nstart, but it is just a small start to what is needed. I wish the \neconomic recovery had been able to include an additional $50 million \nfor the FBI that the Senate initially was willing to include, but that \nadditional funding was stripped away. Unfortunately, to achieve \nbipartisan support and passage of the economic recovery package, those \nfunds were eliminated. The funds currently being provided are \ninsufficient to tackle the magnitude of this problem. I refer all \nSenators to the testimony before the Judiciary Committee by the \nDirector of the FBI and the Deputy Director of the FBI and to the \ndetailed justifications the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have \nprovided.\n  I believe authorizing and funding fraud enforcement will save the \ngovernment money. That is what the Justice Department has found. That \nis what Taxpayers Against Fraud has found. That is what the \nadministration indicates in its Statement of Administration Policy in \nstrong support of this bill. As the administration says: ``These \nadditional resources will provide a return on investment through \nadditional fines, penalties, restitution, damages, and forfeitures.'' I \nwould add that strong fraud enforcement will also save money by \ndeterring fraudulent conduct.\n  According to recent data provided by the Justice Department, the \ngovernment recovers on average $32 for every dollar spent on criminal \nfraud litigation. Similarly, the nonpartisan group Taxpayers Against \nFraud has found that the Government recovers $15 for every dollar spent \nin civil fraud cases. Just last year, the Justice Department recovered \nnearly $2 billion in civil false claims settlements, and, in criminal \ncases, courts ordered nearly $3 billion in restitution and forfeiture. \nStrengthening criminal and civil fraud enforcement is a sound \ninvestment, and this legislation will not only pay for itself, but \nshould bring in money for the Federal Government.\n  If fraud goes unprosecuted and unpunished, then victims across \nAmerica lose money. In many cases, American taxpayers take the loss \ndirectly. For example, in the case of many mortgage frauds, the Federal \nGovernment has guaranteed the loans, and when the fraud is uncovered, \nAmerican taxpayers, as well as the victim, lose out. More directly, \nwith the billions of dollars of Federal funds now going out through the \nrecovery legislation, the Troubled Assets Relief Program, and other \nbailout programs, we should all recognize that enforcement will be \nessential to protect those recovery funds from fraud and to recover any \nmoney that is fraudulently taken. If we do not take action to \ninvestigate and prosecute this kind of fraud, Americans will lose far \nmore money than this bill costs.\n  The only organizations that have opposed this legislation are the \nHeritage Foundation and the National Association of Criminal Defense \nLawyers. They have argued that the legal fixes\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\nin this bill constitute overreaching by the Federal Government. In \nfact, this bill does not overfederalize or overcriminalize.\n  Senator Grassley and I took great care in crafting it to avoid those \nkinds of excesses. The bill creates no new statutes and no new \nsentences. Instead, it focuses on modernizing existing statutes to \nreach unregulated conduct and on addressing flawed court decisions \ninterpreting those laws. This is exactly the kind of Federal criminal \nlegislation that these critics should appreciate. Rather than \ngratuitously adding new laws or expanding Federal jurisdiction, it acts \nin a targeted way to fill in gaps identified by investigators and \nprosecutors to make it easier for them to reach the conduct most \nrelevant to the current financial crisis.\n  The bill amends the definition of ``financial institution'' in the \ncriminal code in order to extend Federal fraud laws to mortgage lending \nbusinesses that are not directly regulated or insured by the Federal \nGovernment. These companies were responsible for nearly half the \nresidential mortgage market before the economic collapse, yet they \nremain largely unregulated and outside the scope of traditional Federal \nfraud statutes. This change will finally apply the Federal fraud laws \nto private mortgage businesses like Countrywide Home Loans and GMAC \nMortgage.\n  The bill would also amend the major fraud statute to protect funds \nexpended under the Troubled Assets Relief Program and the economic \nstimulus package, including any government purchases of preferred stock \nin financial institutions. The U.S. Government has provided \nextraordinary economic support to our banking system, and we need to \nmake sure that none of those funds are subject to fraud or abuse. This \nchange will give Federal prosecutors and investigators the explicit \nauthority they need to protect taxpayer funds.\n  This bill will also strengthen one of the core offenses in so many \nfraud cases--money laundering--which was significantly weakened by a \nrecent Supreme Court case. In United States v. Santos, the Supreme \nCourt misinterpreted the money laundering statutes, limiting their \nscope to only the ``profits'' of crimes, rather than the ``proceeds'' \nof the offenses. The Court's mistaken decision was contrary to \ncongressional intent and will lead to financial criminals escaping \nculpability simply by claiming their illegal scams did not make a \nprofit. Indeed, Ponzi schemes like the $65 billion fraud perpetrated by \nBernard Madoff, which by definition turn no profit, are exempt from \nmoney laundering charges under this formulation. This erroneous \ndecision must be corrected immediately, as dozens of money laundering \ncases have already been dismissed.\n  None of these changes constitute overcriminalization. Rather, they \nreach fraudulent conduct at the center of our ongoing economic crisis. \nAmericans are rightly demanding accountability for this fraud, and we \ncannot have full accountability without the participation of Federal \ninvestigators and prosecutors armed with the tools and resources they \nneed.\n  We can delay no further in taking decisive action to strengthen fraud \nenforcement and doing everything we can to fight the scourge of fraud \nthat has contributed to our economic crisis. There is simply no good \nreason for us not to act. The administration ``strongly supports \nenactment'' of this bill. The Justice Department supports it, the FBI \nsupports it, the Secret Service supports it, the TARP inspector general \nsupports it, the HUD inspector general supports it, Federal and State \nlaw enforcement officers support it.\n  The bottom line, Madam President--before I lose my voice entirely--\nis, this legislation is to stop people who have been robbing the \nretirement savings of Americans, who have been robbing their homes from \nunder them, who have been robbing the money they have set aside for \ntheir kids' college education and getting away with it under some of \nthe elaborate mortgage fraud schemes. They get away with it because \nthere is no real ability to go after them. There is neither the money \nnor the personnel. This legislation gives both money and personnel but \nalso gives teeth to the law.\n  I have said on this floor several times, if you have somebody who \nsets up a $100 million fraud scheme, they do not care what happens to \nthe people in their way. They do not care if they ruin the lives of the \npeople they are going after. They do not care if the people lose their \nhomes because they figure if they get caught, they might have to give a \nlittle bit of the money back in a fine or otherwise. They are not \ndeterred. They, obviously, do not have a sense of conscience or \nmorality. They do not care if people lose their life savings. They do \nnot care if people lose their retirement. They do not care if people \nlose their hope for the future. All they want is the money.\n  Madam President, I tell you right now, if these same people think \nthey are going to go to prison for what they are doing, if they think \nthey will spend time behind bars for years and years, then maybe--\nmaybe--some Americans may be able to keep their homes, some Americans \nmay be able to keep their dreams, some Americans may be able to keep \ntheir retirement, some Americans may be able to keep sending their \nchildren to college.\n  People are now losing that dream. That is why there is strong \nbipartisan support for this bill. That is why I must admit I am \nsomewhat frustrated that many have come here to try to bring amendments \nthat have absolutely no place in this bill, and, if anything, would \nslow up the ability to protect Americans. But they have the right to do \nthis.\n  We will soon have a list of amendments, we will set the list in, and \nwe will set a time for final passage. And maybe--maybe--within a few \nweeks the President will be able to sign this legislation and people \nwill be a lot more protected than they are now.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1000\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1000, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask that my amendment be modified with \nthe changes that are already at the desk and ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Webb and Wyden be added as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 currently before the \nSenate. This legislation, which is long overdue, will take critical \nstrides toward enabling the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation to investigate and prosecute the mortgage and securities \nfraud that have played such a large role in bringing our economy to the \nbrink of collapse. I would like to commend Senators Leahy, Grassley, \nand Kaufman for introducing this bill that I am proud to cosponsor and \nhope that the Senate will pass it as quickly as possible.\n  The fact is that the current recession stands apart from others we \nhave experienced since the end of World War II, and not just because it \nis the longest and deepest. Although many downturns are the result of a \ndecline in the business cycle, this recession was in significant part \nbrought about by two factors that could well have been avoided had \nmortgage brokers and their associates and financiers set aside greed \nand outsized profits in favor of responsible lending, financial \npractices, and sustainable, but nonetheless healthy, rates of return.\n  First, during the most recent housing boom, as are all aware, many \nhomebuyers were placed into predatory, subprime loans that they could \nnot be reasonably expected to repay. Indeed, while unscrupulous \nlenders, including private mortgage brokers and lending businesses that \nwere not subject to the type of oversight and regulations that have \ntraditionally prevented fraud, profited from a quick short-term fee in \nexchange for underwriting an irresponsible mortgage with little due \ndiligence, homebuyers were left with loans that began with low interest \nrates and affordable payment but that morphed into significantly higher \ninterest rates and payments. In other cases, the New York Times has \nreported that circles of appraisers delivered inflated appraisals on \ndemand, while lawyers paid by the seller, but holding themselves out as \nrepresenting the buyer, and mortgage brokers conspired to persuade \nbuyers to take on overpriced and often dilapidated homes. And the scams \ncontinue to this day. The Times reports that deed thieves are currently \napproaching distressed owners and offering to ameliorate financial \ndifficulties by temporarily taking over deeds. Then they refinance and \nflee with the owners' equity in tow.\n  The result of the fraudulent loans and scams has been nothing short \nof a disaster that has devastated communities nationwide. RealtyTrac, \nthe leading online marketplace for foreclosure properties, in January \nreported that Americans received 3.2 million foreclosure filings on 2.3 \nmillion properties during 2008. That represents a staggering 81-percent \nincrease in total properties from 2007 and a 225 percent increase in \ntotal properties from 2006.\n  Unfortunately, mortgage brokers and related parties are not solely to \nblame for the economic calamity that has befallen the nation. Large \nWall Street investment banks thought they saw a profit opportunity and \ndecided to package and sell risky subprime mortgages in largely \nunregulated markets. They believed that they could reduce risk by \nplacing mortgage securities into such bundles but were in many cases \ndishonest with themselves and investors about the potential for losses. \nAlthough paper profits soared so long as housing prices increased, once \nthey began to tumble, the value of these securities did as well.\n  It is now estimated that in the past year, U.S. banks and financial \ninstitutions lost more than $500 billion as a result of their \ninvestments in subprime mortgages. Some of this Nation's most \nrecognizable companies, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers have \nbeen wiped away due to collapse of the mortgage-backed securities \nmarket, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been taken over by the \nFederal Government.\n  While other financial institutions have not shuttered their doors, \nthey have absorbed significant losses. This has caused banks to all but \ncease to lend, which has led to untold difficulties for businesses and \nindividuals seeking credit. Consumers could not obtain car and student \nloans, and business owners, and small business owners in particular, \ncould not acquire capital to expand operations or, in many cases, make \npayroll. In short, the staggering 5.1 million job losses we have \nwitnessed since the onset of the recession in December 2007 are in \nlarge part attributable to the collapse of housing and financial \nmarkets.\n  To ameliorate the situation, Congress was last October forced to pass \nthe $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act that created the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, to rescue financial markets. \nCombined with other actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board, Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, and the Treasury Department, the \nCongressional Oversight Panel on April 7 reported that the total value \nof all direct spending, loans and guarantees provided in conjunction \nwith the federal government's financial stability efforts now exceeds \n$4 trillion. In addition to this unprecedented exposure, Congress also \npassed the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in \nFebruary to assist those displaced by the recession and sow the seeds \nfor recovery.\n  Notably, as Congress passed the $700 billion financial rescue package \nlast October, I insisted that our obligation did not stop with the \nenactment of that legislation. Indeed, I called on Congress to demand \naccountability for the massive malfeasance that has been perpetrated on \nthe American people and specifically made the point that those \nresponsible for our Nation's economic meltdown must be investigated and \nsubsequently prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Frankly, it \nwould be inconceivable to me to devote anything less than 100 percent \nof our resources to investigating those responsible for this crisis.\n  It is for these reasons that on February 25, I, joined by Senator \nWhitehouse, introduced the FBI Priorities Act of 2009, S. 481, to \naugment FBI investigations of financial crimes. Turning to specifics, \nthis bill authorizes $150 million for each of the fiscal years 2010 \nthrough 2014 to fund approximately 1,000 Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation field agents in addition to the number of field agents \nserving on the date of enactment. This extra manpower will help enable \nthe FBI to develop and fully investigate, as well as bring responsible \nparties to justice.\n  There is simply no question that this additional manpower is an \nabsolute necessity to combat fraud given rising caseloads and a wholly \ninadequate level of resources. Consider the following facts: In the \nlast 6 years, suspicious activity reports alleging mortgage fraud that \nhave been filed with the Treasury Department have increased nearly \ntenfold to 62,000 in 2008. In the last 3 years, the number of criminal \nmortgage fraud investigations opened up by the FBI has more than \ndoubled to exceed 1,800 at the end of 2008. Moreover, the FBI \nanticipates a new wave of cases that could double that number yet again \nin coming years. Finally, despite increases in caseloads, the FBI \ncurrently has fewer than 250 special agents nationwide assigned to \nthese financial fraud cases. At current levels, these agents cannot \nindividually review, much less thoroughly investigate, the more than \n5,000 fraud allegations received by the Treasury Department each month.\n  Although the details of the legislation I have introduced differ from \nthose in the measure currently before the Senate, I believe the impact \non the government's ability to root out and prosecute fraud would be \nsimilar. In particular, the legislation now under consideration \nauthorizes $165 million a year for hiring fraud prosecutors and \ninvestigators at the Justice Department in 2010 and 2011. This includes \n$75 million in 2010 and $65 million in 2011 for the FBI to hire 190 \nadditional special agents and more than 200 professional staff and \nforensic analysts to nearly double the size of its mortgage and \nfinancial fraud program. With this funding, the FBI can expand the \nnumber of its mortgage fraud task forces nationwide from 26 to more \nthan 50.\n  Notably, the funding authorized in the bill also includes $50 million \na year for U.S. Attorneys' Offices to staff those fraud task forces and \n$40 million for the criminal, civil, and tax divisions at the Justice \nDepartment to provide special litigation and investigative support in \nthose efforts. In addition, the bill authorizes $80 million a year for \n2010 and 2011 for investigators and analysts at the U.S. Postal \nInspection Service, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Department of \nHousing and\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\nUrban Development's Office of Inspector General to combat fraud in \nFederal assistance programs and financial institutions.\n  In addition to adding critical funds necessary to identify and \nprosecute fraud, this legislation makes several vital improvements to \nfraud and money laundering statutes to strengthen prosecutors' ability \nto combat a growing wave of fraud. Specifically, the bill amends the \ndefinition of ``financial institution'' in the criminal code to extend \nFederal fraud law to mortgage lending businesses that are not directly \nregulated or insured by the Federal Government. Responsible for nearly \nhalf the residential mortgage market prior to the economic collapse, \nthese companies inexplicably remain largely unregulated and outside the \nscope of traditional Federal fraud statutes. This provision would apply \nthe Federal fraud laws to private mortgage businesses, just as they \npertain to federally insured and regulated banks.\n  Furthermore, this legislation amends the false statements in mortgage \napplications statute to make it a crime to make a materially false \nstatement or to willfully overvalue a property to influence any action \nby a mortgage lending business. Currently, these strictures apply only \nto Federal agencies, banks, and credit associations and do not \nnecessarily extend to private mortgage lending businesses. This \nprovision would ensure that private mortgage brokers and companies are \nheld fully accountable under this Federal fraud provision.\n  Finally, I would like to point out that this bill would modify \nFederal law to protect funds expended under TARP and the economic \nstimulus package. Specifically, the legislation would amend the Federal \nmajor fraud statute to include funds flowing pursuant to TARP and the \nstimulus package. The change will give Federal prosecutors and \ninvestigators the explicit authority they require to protect taxpayer \nfunds, which could not be more critical with $4 trillion at risk as \npart of TARP and related programs and $787 billion at stake as part of \nthe stimulus package. It is absolutely vital that every dollar we have \nput at stake go toward economic stabilization and revitalization and \nnot to line the pockets of those who seek to defraud taxpayers.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote for the Fraud Enforcement \nand Recovery Act of 2009, S. 386. This bill improves enforcement and \nrecovery mechanisms for mortgage, securities, financial institution and \nother frauds. In the context of today's global financial crisis, it is \na very important piece of legislation, and I commend its authors.\n  The current economic downturn has many causes. But certainly fraud--\nin mortgage lending and in the mortgage-backed securities and \nderivatives markets--played a significant role. The Fraud Enforcement \nand Recovery Act of 2009 does a number of things to help deter and \nuncover fraud, and compensate its victims. First, it authorizes \nsignificant new resources for the FBI, the Department of Justice, the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, and other agencies to \ninvestigate and prosecute these kinds of cases.\n  In addition, the bill extends Federal fraud laws to the mortgage \nlending business, just as they apply to federally insured banks. \nSimilarly, it makes sure that Federal prohibitions against false \nstatements apply to statements made to influence mortgage lending \ndecisions. Very importantly, because the taxpayers have now put \nextraordinary sums of money into propping up the financial sector, the \nbill makes clear that fraudulent activities in connection with the TARP \nprogram and the economic stimulus package can be prosecuted. The bill \nalso reverses an erroneous Supreme Court interpretation of the Federal \nmoney laundering statute that was making it impossible to prosecute so-\ncalled Ponzi schemes. These simple and effective clarifications and \nexpansions of current law will help protect the American people from \nthese very damaging frauds.\n  I also strongly support Section 4 of the bill, which amends the False \nClaims Act--FCA. The FCA provisions clarify liability for making false \nor fraudulent claims to the federal government. A few concerns have \nbeen raised about this part of the legislation, which I would like to \nbriefly address here.\n  One criticism is aimed at the bill's rejection of an ``intent'' \nrequirement under the FCA. The Supreme Court recently held in the \nAllison Engine case that such a requirement exists. The bill simply \nreturns the law to its original intent. The judicially manufactured \nrequirement that the person making a false claim intend that the \ngovernment itself pay the claim was giving subcontractors a way to \navoid liability for fraud, which is inconsistent with the purpose of \nthe act.\n  Another criticism alleges that the addition of a ``materiality'' \nrequirement to the FCA is potentially broad and unclear. But \n``material'' is defined in the bill in a way that is consistent with \nSupreme Court and other judicial precedents, so this claim is \nunconvincing.\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 is an important \naccomplishment. Those who perpetrate financial fraud, which is so \nharmful not only to the victims of the fraud but to the economy as a \nwhole, must be discovered and prosecuted. This bill makes it easier to \ndo that, so I am pleased to support it.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, earlier today amendment No. 1006 was \npassed by a voice vote. If there had been a rollcall vote, I would have \nopposed this amendment, as it added more than $40 million to a bill \nthat already costs nearly half a billion dollars.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before we begin the debate on appointing \nconferees on the budget resolution, will the Parliamentarian inform us \nof the parliamentary status on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 386.\n\n\n                      Budget Resolution Conference\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, floor staff informs me they are working on \nan agreement that will allow us to go to the consideration of the \nconferees. At this point, we will open the discussion but will not turn \nto it. I will use this time to make my statement so that we are \nefficiently using the time of the Senate.\n  I remind my colleagues that some of the key elements in the Senate-\npassed budget resolution we will soon be taking to conference. The \nbudget needs to be considered in the context of the very tough hand we \nhave been dealt. This administration and this Congress have inherited a \nmess of truly staggering proportions. If we start with the deficit \noutlook, we can see that the previous administration inherited \nsurpluses that they rapidly turned into record deficits, and then \nrecord deficits of a proportion that stagger the imagination. I don't \nthink anybody could have anticipated we would have deficits approaching \n$2 trillion in a year.\n  We also saw in the previous administration a dramatic increase in the \nFederal debt--a more than doubling of the Federal debt in the period \nthat the previous administration was responsible for.\n  The Obama administration inherited record deficits, a doubling of the \ndebt, the worst recession since the Great Depression, financial market \nand housing crises unparalleled since the 1930s, and nearly 4 million \njobs lost in the last 6 months alone. On top of it all, we have ongoing \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I often think what it must be like to be President Obama, who wakes \nup every morning with this heavy responsibility on his shoulders. In \nour caucus today, we had the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \nChairman Bernanke. I told him that I believe when the history of this \nperiod is written, he will go down as one of its heroes--somebody who \nhelped rescue us from what could have been a financial collapse, not \nonly here but around the country.\n  In the budget resolution that passed the Senate, which we will be \ntaking to conference, we have tried to preserve the major priorities of \nthe President: reducing our dependence on foreign energy; a focus on \nexcellence in education; fundamental health care reform, because that \nis the 800-pound gorilla that can swamp the fiscal boat of the country; \nmiddle-class tax cuts; and cutting the deficit in half over the term of \nthe budget.\n  The budget we produced reduced the deficit by more than half over the \nnext 5 years. We have reduced the deficit by two-thirds. I am proud of \nthat fact. We reached 3 percent of GDP a little less\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\nthan that--which all of the economists say is essential to stabilizing \nthe debt.\n  At the same time, we have adhered to the President's intentions to \nmake certain strategic investments--one of the most important in \nenergy--to reduce our dependence on foreign energy, because that is an \nimperative for this country, a strategic imperative, a financial \nimperative, and a national security imperative.\n  The budget resolution that went through the Senate reduces our \ndependence on foreign energy, creates green jobs, preserves the \nenvironment, and helps with high home energy costs. It does it in the \nfollowing ways: one, a reserve fund to accommodate legislation to \ninvest in clean energy and address global climate change; second, \nproviding the President's level of discretionary funding for the DOE; \nthird, building on the economic recovery package to provide investments \nin renewable energy, efficiency, and conservation, as well as low \ncarbon coal technology, and modernizing the electric grid.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy once again for his incredible courtesy and \ngraciousness in allowing us to interrupt his very important legislation \nso we can go to this matter of naming conferees, because we are under a \ntight deadline there. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nfor his incredible graciousness.\n  We also, in this budget, preserve the President's priority of a focus \non excellence in education. If we are not the best educated, we are not \ngoing to be the most powerful country in the world for very long. So we \nadopt the priority of investments in education to generate economic \ngrowth and jobs, to prepare our workforce to compete in the global \neconomy, to make college more affordable, and to improve student \nachievement. We do it, again, in three ways: a higher education reserve \nfund to facilitate the President's student aid increase; by extending \nthe simplified college tax credit, providing up to $2,500 a year in tax \ncredit--that is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in your tax liability; \nand, finally, by providing the President's requested level of $5,550 \nfor Pell grants and fully funding his education priorities, such as \nearly education.\n  When I am asked about the President's budget, I give it very high \nmarks because I think it has the priorities exactly right--reducing our \ndependence on foreign energy, excellence in education, and health care \nreform, all in the context of dramatically reducing the deficit. So on \nhealth care, the budget resolution that previously passed the Senate, \nwhich we will take to the conference committee, bends the health care \ncost curve, reducing costs long term, improves health care outcomes, \nexpands coverage, increases research, and promotes food and drug \nsafety. Again, we do it in three different and very specific ways: No. \n1, a reserve fund to accommodate the President's initiative to \nfundamentally reform the health care system. As many have said, we have \na sickness system, not a wellness system. We have to make a transition. \nWe also have a reserve fund to address Medicare physician payments, \nbecause we know that the doctors across the country who serve Medicare-\neligible patients are due for major deep cuts--cuts of more than 10 \npercent. We are not going to let that happen. Third, it continues \ninvestment in key health care programs, such as the NIH and the FDA.\n  Not only have we preserved the President's key investment priorities, \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil, moving toward excellence in \neducation, health care reform, but we also preserve his fourth key \npriority of cutting the deficit dramatically. In the budget resolution \nthat previously passed the Senate, we reduce the deficit by two-thirds \nby 2014--that is in dollar terms we reduced it by two-thirds. Most \neconomists say you ought to evaluate it as a percentage of the gross \ndomestic product, that that is the best way to see what you are \naccomplishing. If we look at it in those terms, we are reducing the \ndeficit by more than three-quarters, from 12.2 percent of GDP in 2009 \ndown to less than 3 percent of GDP out in 2014.\n  I am especially proud of that trajectory on the deficit, because I \nthink it is absolutely critical. I would be the first to say we need to \ndo even more in the second 5 years, but this is a 5-year budget. The \nreason it is a 5-year budget is that, of the 34 budgets that Congress \nhas done since the Budget Act was instituted, 30 of those 34 times we \nhave done a 5-year budget. Why? Because the forecasts beyond 5 years \nare murky, at best, highly unreliable. So we have stuck to a 5-year \nbudget, as has traditionally been the case.\n  With respect to the revenue side of the equation in this budget, the \nCongressional Budget Office, in looking at what we have done, would \nconclude that as a total, compared to current law, the budget \nresolution that passed the Senate reduces taxes. Let me emphasize that, \nbecause some want to put all the emphasis on the tax increases in this \npackage; but if you take the tax increases and the tax reductions and \nput it all together, and you look at a net result, you find that we are \ncutting taxes over the 5 years by $825 billion. That is because we have \nextended the middle-class tax relief that is from the 2001 and 2003 \nacts, the 10-percent bracket, the childcare tax credit, the marriage \npenalty relief, and the education incentives. All of that is in this \nbill.\n  We also provide alternative minimum tax reform relief for 3 years to \nprevent 24 million people from being swept up in the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  We also have estate tax reform, $3.5 million an individual, $7 \nmillion a couple, indexed for inflation. That means 99.8 percent of \nestates in this country will pay zero; 99.8 percent of estates will pay \nzero.\n  We also have business tax provisions and the traditional tax \nextenders, such as the research credit, that are included in this \nbudget, for a total of tax relief of $958 billion.\n  On the other side of the equation, we have loophole closures, such as \ncodifying economic substance and international tax enforcement to go \nafter these offshore tax havens, these abusive tax shelters. We raise \n$133 billion for a net tax reduction of $825 billion over the 5 years \nof this budget.\n  On the spending side of the house, domestic discretionary spending, \nagain as a percentage of the gross domestic product--and the reason, of \ncourse, economists say that is what you should focus on rather than the \ndollar amounts is that this takes account of inflation. It gives a more \nfair comparison year by year.\n  We hear all this talk that this is a big spending budget. No, it is \nnot. This budget reduces domestic discretionary spending as a \npercentage of gross domestic product from 4.3 percent in 2010 down to \n3.2 percent in 2014. We are taking domestic discretionary spending down \nto one of its lowest levels in the last 50 years.\n  In fact, nondefense discretionary spending increases under this \nbudget resolution an average 2.5 percent.\n  In addition, we have a series of budget enforcement tools that are in \nthis resolution: discretionary caps for 2009 and 2010. Some have said \nwe ought to have discretionary caps for 2011 too. Well, why? Well, why? \nWe are going to be back here a year from now. We have discretionary \ncaps for 2009 and 2010. Why do we need them for 2011, when we are going \nto be right back here, same place, same time 1 year from now?\n  We also maintain a strong pay-go rule. We provide a point of order \nagainst long-term deficit increases; a point of order against short-\nterm deficit increases; we allow reconciliation for deficit reduction \nonly in the resolution out of the Senate; and we provide a point of \norder against mandatory spending on an appropriations bill.\n  Let me address, very briefly, this last provision because what we \nfound was some of our colleagues have gotten increasingly clever about \nfinding new ways to spend money. We found they were increasing \nmandatory spending on appropriations bills. Mandatory spending is \ntypically not done on an appropriations bill, as the Chair well knows. \nAppropriations bills are designed to deal with discretionary spending, \nnot mandatory spending. Mandatory spending is things such as Social \nSecurity and Medicare, certain farm supports. Those are mandatory \nspending items. We found some of our colleagues have gotten very clever \nand started to increase mandatory spending on appropriations bills. We \nhave created a point of order to try to short circuit that bad \npractice.\n  The budget resolution also attempts to address our long-term fiscal \nchallenges. Let me be very clear. My colleague will momentarily speak, \nand he\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\nwill be highly critical of the budget resolution for not more fully \naddressing our long-term challenges. It may surprise listeners to hear \nme say that I agree with him. If there is a place this budget can be \nfairly criticized, it is that it does not do enough long term. I think \nwe do a pretty good job in the first 5 years. But beyond that--this is \nonly a 5-year budget--but beyond that, much more needs to be done.\n  The ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, Senator Gregg, and I \nhave a proposal that I believe needs to be pursued. It is to have a \ntask force given the responsibility to come up with a plan to get us \nback on a sounder, long-term fiscal track and to come to Congress for \nan assured vote if 12 of the 16 members of that group could agree.\n  Nonetheless, there are three important elements of this budget \nresolution that deal with our long-term fiscal circumstance. No. 1 is \nthe health reform reserve fund. That, after all, is the biggest threat \nto our long-term fiscal security and stability. No. 2 is we have \nprogram integrity initiatives to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse. \nWe have five in this budget, and they are very important--Medicare, \nSocial Security, defense, and others as well. I hope very much that \nthese are pursued in the conference committee.\n  No. 3 is we have a long-term deficit increase point of order to \nrequire a 60-vote point of order against moves to increase long-term \ndeficits.\n  Finally, let me say that on this question of the long term, the \nPresident has been very clear. At the fiscal responsibility summit on \nFebruary 23, the President said this:\n\n       Now, I want to be very clear. While we are making important \n     progress towards fiscal responsibility this year, in this \n     budget, this is just the beginning. In the coming years, \n     we'll be forced to make more tough choices, and do much more \n     to address our long-term challenges.\n\n  The President got it exactly right with that statement. We are going \nto have to do much more. But this budget is a good and responsible \nbeginning.\n  Mr. President, with that, I will yield the floor. Let me say, \nmomentarily we will have a unanimous consent request before us. I do \nnot yet have it in my hands. I will say this before we begin this \ndebate. This is an institution with Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents. On the Budget Committee, we have all three represented.\n  I am chairman of the committee representing the Democratic Party. \nSenator Gregg is the ranking Republican. Senator Gregg is someone with \nwhom we have strenuous debates and disagreements. You will see that in \nthe coming hours. But I wish to make very clear that I have high regard \nfor Senator Gregg. He is motivated by patriotism, by love of country, \nand by a fundamental understanding that we are on an unsustainable \ntrack, that we have to be much more serious about our long-term buildup \nof deficits and debt. He has not just talked about it, he has been \nprepared to act.\n  I wish to recognize him for his commitment to something I also \nbelieve in. I think it is abundantly clear we cannot stay on our \ncurrent course. It is a course that will lead us to a much diminished \nstandard of living for the future. While I believe this budget is a \ngood beginning, I do not assert that this in any way solves our long-\nterm problem. It does not. But it is a beginning, an important \nbeginning, and we need to do more.\n  I also thank Senator Gregg for his unfailing courtesy and \nprofessionalism, not only in our public debates but in the workings of \nthe Budget Committee. He has assembled a first-rate and professional \nstaff. We have worked together well to do the business of the committee \nand the business of the country.\n  I thank Senator Gregg, once again, for all he has done to allow the \nbudget resolution to be fully debated, fully discussed, to have our \ndifferences aired publicly and privately but also to do it in an air of \ncivility and respect, something I certainly feel toward him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin by saying I think it is \nterribly unsportsmanlike of the chairman of the committee to say such \nnice things about me, to disarm my ability to effectively attack his \nbudget, but I wish to join his thoughts because he and his staff are \nvery good to work with. He is a professional. They are committed. He \ngenuinely believes, as I do, that this country's outyear fiscal \nsituation is not a sustainable event. We are trying to work together to \naddress that situation. We hope we can gather others to join us in this \neffort.\n  I respect he has water to carry around here, and he carries it \nextraordinarily well on behalf of his constituency, which is the \nDemocratic caucus and the President of the United States. I \ncongratulate him for the exceptional job he does.\n  That being said----\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the debate over?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can we end the debate?\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. GREGG. That being said, let's begin where the chairman leaves off \naccurately and correctly in saying that the course we are on is \nunsustainable.\n  What does ``unsustainable'' mean? It is one of those terms of art we \nuse around here. It means that by the time this budget runs its \ncourse--not necessarily the chairman's budget but the President's \nbudget because the President's budget is a 10-year budget--by the time \nthe President's budget runs its course, we will have passed on to our \nchildren a debt which will have tripled--tripled--a deficit which will \nhave averaged every year for the 10 years a trillion dollars or more \nand a national public debt--that is the debt we owe to the Chinese, to \nthe Japanese, and to our own people who own a fair portion of our \ndebt--a national public debt which will have doubled as a percent of \nour gross national product, going up to 80 percent of our gross \nnational product.\n  What does all that mean? It means essentially we will have built a \ndebt in this Nation which our children will not be able to afford to \npay down. Just the interest on that debt alone, as we move into the \nlater years of this budget, will exceed anything else in the budget as \na line item on the discretionary side of the ledger. It will exceed, \nfor example, all the money we spend, the interest alone will exceed all \nthe money we spend on national defense. It will exceed by a factor of \nthree or four or maybe even eight accounts such as education, housing, \nveterans affairs, and health. The deficits will have been so large for \nso long that the debt will have grown to a point that there is no \nlogical way or fair way that our children and our children's children, \nwho will have to pay this debt, will be able to do it in a manner that \nwould leave them with a nation that is as strong and as prosperous as \nthe Nation that was given us.\n  Putting it another way, at the end of this budget, after these 10 \nyears are over and beginning in about the third and fourth year of this \nbudget, the spending will be so out of control at the Federal level, \nthe growth of the Government will have occurred at such a rapid rate \nthat we will have created a debt structure which will mean that our \nchildren will have about three choices in their future.\n  The first is that there will be a dramatic increase in inflation. We \nwill try to pay this debt off with inflated dollars. There is no more \nregressive or harmful tax that a society can put on its people than to \nhave uncontrolled inflation or massive inflation. But that is what one \nof the choices is.\n  The other choice is that we will raise taxes to a level that they \nwill be so high we will essentially tax away the opportunity of our \nchildren to do things which were considered to be commonplace for our \ngeneration--buy a home, send their kids to college, invest in a small \nbusiness, take a risk, create a job. All of that will be taxed away \nbecause the tax rates would have to get up to such a level to pay this \ndebt off that we will no longer be able to have that type of \nprosperity. The third course of action, equally untenable, is that the \ndollar gets devalued--which is to some extent an inflationary event--\nand people stop buying our debt. They simply say: I don't believe you \ncan pay this debt off--you, the people of the United States. You are \nnot going to be able to generate enough productivity to do it. That, of \ncourse, leads to some level of implosion of our economy which I can't \neven calculate or comprehend, but it is much worse than what we even \nconfront today.\n\n  So nobody is arguing or debating--at least I am not, though there are \nsome\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\nwho are--I am not coming to this floor and saying it is irresponsible \nfor this administration, for President Obama to have inserted a large \namount of Federal spending into the economy this year and next year. We \nrecognize that this economy is in stress and that the only source of \nliquidity for our economy is our National Government and that the \nFederal Reserve, for all intents and purposes, has become the lender of \nfirst resort. But that is a short-run issue.\n  The problem with this budget is that the type of spending which has \nto be done now is not curtailed after 2 years. It is not reigned in. It \nis not reduced or even leveled off. It continues up and up in the third \nyear, the fourth year, the fifth year, the sixth year of the budget the \nPresident sent up here. The spending continues to go up on a path that \nis extraordinarily steep, so that the cost of the Government, which \ntoday and historically has been about 20 percent of GDP, jumps to 21 \npercent, 22 percent, 23 percent, and 24 percent. In fact, if you go \noutside the window and you presume these numbers continue to compound, \nyou get to a cost of Government that ends up around 28 and 29 percent \nof GDP. You cannot sustain an economy with that type of cost.\n  I have a few charts to try to put this in perspective.\n  The first chart is on the issue of debt. The budget, as proposed by \nthe President--and why do I keep talking about the President's budget \nrather than the chairman's budget? Because the President's Director of \nOMB said they are essentially the same, and they are essentially the \nsame. We can get into the differences, but the differences are at the \nmargin and they are really not arguable. The biggest difference is that \nthe chairman's budget only goes for 5 years, not 10 years. Well, there \nare other big differences, but that leaves off the second 5 years, and \nby leaving off the second 5 years, you don't talk about and you \nessentially hide some of the most dramatic effects of this spending \nbinge.\n  The President's budget increases taxes by $1.5 trillion, it increases \ndiscretionary spending by $1.4 trillion, and it increases mandatory \nspending by $1.2 trillion. And this number, this $1.2 trillion, is \ngrossly underestimated. What does it do in the area of savings? On the \nmandatory side, it does nothing in the area of savings, absolutely \nnothing. In fact, the few discretionary savings he sent up, which I \nhappen to support, were dropped in the chairman's mark, especially in \nthe area of agriculture. So as we have said, and some people have heard \nit before--maybe not in this room--it spends too much, it taxes too \nmuch, and it borrows too much as a budget. What it doesn't do is save \ntoo much, and that is what gets us into trouble. The practical effect \nof this budget's structure is that it takes Federal debt and doubles it \nin 5 years and triples it in 10 years.\n  Try to remember what we are talking about. We are not talking about \ngoing from $100 to $200 to $300. We are talking about trillions. \nTrillions. I don't know what a trillion dollars is. I can't even \nconceive of it. But that is what we are talking about. We are talking \nabout taking the Federal debt from $5.8 trillion up to $17 trillion, or \nthereabouts. To try to put it in perspective, if you take all the \nspending, all the debt run up by all the Presidents since the beginning \nof the country--George Washington through Franklin Pierce through \nGeorge W. Bush--all that debt that has been run up over 230-some-odd \nyears by all our Presidents, that debt is doubled by this President \nwithin 5 years of being in office.\n  There is another chart which shows this even better. It is called the \nwall of debt. This chart wasn't invented by me, but whoever invented it \nwas a genius, obviously. The wall of debt shows how the Federal deficit \njust goes up and up and up and up. This wall of debt is what our kids \nare going to run into when they try to have a productive lifestyle. It \nis what is going to cost them their ability to be successful.\n  By the time we get to the end of this, or even right here in the \nmiddle somewhere of this budget, the average family in this country is \ngoing to have $130,000 of new debt for which they are responsible. And \n$130,000 is probably more than the mortgage on the homes of most \npeople. The interest cost on that debt, which most Americans, which all \nAmericans are going to be responsible for, will be about $6,000. That \nmay be more than what most people pay in interest on their homes. But \nthat is the debt that is going to be passed on to them by this budget.\n  Why does it happen? It happens for one very simple reason. It is \ncalled spending. The simple fact is that under the President's budget--\nand under the budget proposed by the chairman--the spending of the \nFederal Government goes up dramatically, comes back down, and then \nstarts back up again. It goes up dramatically, of course, in these 2 \nyears here, which I said I have reservations about. I especially had \nreservations about the stimulus package, which was a misallocation of \nspending, even though I supported the stimulus effort. Why does it \nstart back up again? It starts back up again because this President, in \na very forthright manner--and I give him credit for this--has said not \nonly in his budget but he has said publicly that he genuinely believes \nthe way you create prosperity is to significantly increase the size of \nthe Federal Government, to take it to the left dramatically. So he \ndoes. As a result, spending goes up at a rate that is simply not \naffordable for our children.\n  Look at this black line here. This is the black line that reflects \nthe average spending of the Federal Government between 1958 and 2008. \nLook at how much higher the spending is of this Government under this \nproposed budget. That is a huge gap. When you are talking about an \neconomy as large as ours, when you are talking about 2, 3, and 4 \npercent--or in this case, 4 or 5 percent--that is where the massive \ndeficits come from. That is where the massive increase in debt comes \nfrom. It is debt that is the issue.\n  The chairman used to say: The debt is the threat. He is absolutely \nright, the debt is the threat, but the driver of the threat is \nspending. Unless you are willing to address the issue of spending, you \nare not going to get debt under control because you can't tax people \nenough to cover that. Well, of course you can always inflate the \neconomy and try to cover it, but that leads to much more harmful \nevents.\n  So this is the fundamental difference we have as a party. The \nPresident has said he wants to spend, he wants to tax, and he wants to \nborrow. And I think it is important to note there is a little subtlety \nhere that hasn't been focused on too much, and that is this: When \nPresident Clinton came into office, he also wanted to spend and tax, \nbut he didn't want to borrow. He used his taxes, which he increased--\nwhich I probably opposed--in order to reduce the deficit. This \nPresident, on the other hand, who is claiming he is going to raise \ntaxes on just the wealthy--which is a canard if there ever were a \ncanard around here--is using all that revenue not to reduce the deficit \nbut to increase spending, and then he spends on top of that. So he is \nusing it to grow the size of Government. He is very forthright about \nthis. He is going to use those tax revenues to nationalize the health \ncare system. That is the way I describe it; he describes it another \nway. He is going to use those revenues to basically create a massive \nexpansion of spending in the other accounts of the Federal Government. \nBut he is not going to use those revenues to try to reduce the deficit. \nThat is the big difference between President Obama and President \nClinton in the area of fiscal policy. So he doubles and triples the \ndebt, and as a result, he leaves to our children a nation which is not \naffordable. So as I said, there is a fundamental difference.\n  You know, in the past we would get these budget debates on the floor, \nand they were sort of academic exercises. People would engage in them, \nand they would be very interesting, but I don't think anybody ever saw \nit as the core of the policy of the country. Even though it was \nimportant, it wasn't the core.\n\n  This debate is about this country's future. This budget is about \nwhere this country ends up. The pathway that has been laid out in this \nbudget is a pathway that leads to a debt which the chairman has openly \nsaid is not sustainable. If the chairman knows it is not sustainable \nand the President knows it is not sustainable, why haven't they sent a \nbudget up here to address that fact? Instead, they have sent a budget \nup here which does nothing about that fact, and, in fact, it does the \nopposite. It increases spending, it\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\nincreases discretionary and mandatory spending, and it saves absolutely \nzero in the area we most need savings, which is the mandatory accounts.\n  So the difference is this: The President, as I said, has been \nforthright. His budget--this budget--probably the most significant \ndocument we have received here in the area of fiscal policy since \nperhaps the time of Lyndon Johnson or before, concludes that the way to \nprosperity is to expand the size of Government in an exponential manner \nby spending on Government programs in hopes that they create some sort \nof economic activity and create prosperity over the long run. Well, we \nbelieve, as a party, that doesn't work because in this case it is not \npaid for and it creates all this debt which we then pass on to our \nchildren to pay. We believe the way to prosperity is to have a \ngovernment that is affordable and to pass that affordable government on \nto your children. Equally important is to empower the individual \ncitizen and groups of citizens to go out, take a risk, and create a \njob, not to have the Government take from the individual the ability to \ncreate jobs because it taxes the individual either through inflation or \nthrough taxes or through a huge debt burden, as is proposed in this \nbudget--a huge debt burden that is not sustainable.\n  So this is a very significant debate and a very significant decision \npoint in our Nation's history because if this budget passes in its \npresent form, we are guaranteeing that we will pass on to our children \na nation whose Government is not sustainable, and therefore we will be \npassing on to our children a nation which is less than what we received \nfrom our parents. No generation has the right to do that to another \ngeneration, and that is what this debate is about.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I yield to Senator Johanns, who has an \namendment or who wishes to discuss a motion to instruct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, because of the procedure we are following \nat the moment, I can't make this motion right now, but we will offer \nthe motion at the appropriate time.\n  I rise today to speak about something I am bringing to the Senate. I \nam on the floor today because I think it is unwise and I also think it \nis unfair to the American people to use budget reconciliation to pass \ncap and trade.\n  Just to review the history of this, I joined the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia and circulated a letter asking the leadership of the \nBudget Committee not to include reconciliation instructions to pass cap \nand trade. I was very happy that a number of my colleagues agreed with \nus. Eight Democrats signed the letter, and 25 Republicans--even some \nwho support cap and trade--signed the letter. Notably, the budget \nresolution which we considered on the floor of the Senate did not \ninclude reconciliation instructions. I commended members of the Budget \nCommittee during floor debate for not including instructions for cap \nand trade. I do so again today.\n\n  At the same time, I expressed concern that the real threat, though, \ncame from the House in terms of what it had done with its resolution. \nThe House budget, I think we all know, included, interestingly enough, \nreconciliation instructions. We all know why they included the \ninstructions. The House has no use for them. They are not necessary \nunder House rules. Therefore, there is no reason to include them other \nthan to attempt to force cap-and-trade provisions into the conference \nreport.\n  We are nearing that day when a conference report will come to us. \nThis would restrict input from the American people, or the Senate body, \non a policy that would result in massive taxes and fees.\n  I thank Members on the other side of the aisle. I think they should \nbe commended for what they did next. Understanding that the House was \ntrying to slip climate change into law without review, without debate, \nwithout amendment, without consideration, 26 of my colleagues from the \nother side voted with the Republicans in support of my amendment.\n  What was the result? The result was that 67 Senators made it very \nclear just a few days ago that they would not support using budget \nreconciliation to pass cap and trade. This vote, I would offer, showed \ncourage and leadership. Probably most importantly, it showed true \nbipartisan spirit.\n  Today I am again asking for the support and leadership of my \ncolleagues to stand in support of my motion to instruction the budget \nconferees. My motion just says: Don't just drop our amendment when you \nwalk into the conference committee meeting.\n  It says: Remember, we voted overwhelmingly against shutting off \ndebate and using as little as a single legislative day to pass complex \ncap-and-trade legislation.\n  It says: Don't forget that cap and trade, if passed, will radically \nchange the economic landscape of this great Nation.\n  Amendments to such a bill should not be narrowly limited by the rules \nof the budget process, a process that was really built for deficit \nreduction, not greenhouse gas reduction. It asks for leadership from \nour Senate conferees so the American people can witness a full debate \non this very important issue.\n  Where does that leave us today? One might ask the question: Why is \nthe motion necessary? With such a strong showing against including \ninstructions for cap and trade, isn't that message already clear? The \nmessage is clear, but I think we have to be vigilant for some simple \nreasons.\n  First, we learned over the past several days that budget discussions \nare far from over. Reports indicate that negotiations will continue \nover the next several days, maybe into the next several weeks. Memories \nfade. If we think that budget reconciliation is off the table as time \nwears on, we could be very mistaken.\n  Budget Committee leadership from both the House and the Senate has \nspecifically noted that debate on the inclusion of reconciliation \ninstructions continues to be very intense. In other words, the use of \nbudget reconciliation for cap and trade does remain a possibility. Cap \nand trade could be slipped into law if the House instructions, as \ncurrently written, end up in the conference report.\n  For me, today's motion is about being able to say to Nebraskans when \nI return home--to look them in the eye and say: Yes, I read that bill, \nand I carefully considered its impact on you, your families, your \nbusinesses, and your future. And, yes, I did everything I could to make \nsure people from Nebraska understood well the significant tax burden \nlikely to result from the legislation. And, yes, after considering all \nof those things, I stood up and cast a vote, yes or no.\n  We need to stand up to those who want to use reconciliation to stop \ntransparency and limit debate. I believe both the Chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, whom I respect, and the Ranking Member of the \nSenate Budget Committee, whom I respect, are battling mightily to \nensure that reconciliation instructions are not included. Today, on the \nfloor of the Senate, I commend them for that bipartisan effort. But \nthey need our help. They need an army of Senators whose primary concern \nis the interest of the American people. A vote in support of this \nmotion can do just that. We need this vote. We need to pass this \nmotion. We need to insist that the text of the amendment, which 67 \nSenators, both Republican and Democrat supported, remains in the \nconference report on the budget.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to express this view. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this motion. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will indulge me for about 2 minutes because \nI want to speak quickly on behalf of the amendment of the Senator from \nNebraska? He has outlined a lot of the substantive reasons it is \nimportant. It would not be appropriate to do this type of huge policy \non a 20-hour debate, no-amendment situation, up-or-down vote. But there \nis another issue which goes to the integrity of the Senate and the \npurposes of the Senate.\n  Basically, reconciliation is purely a Senate event. The House doesn't \nneed reconciliation. The House has a Rules Committee. They can \ndetermine how long debate is going to be, when there is going to be \ndebate, and how many amendments there are going to be.\n\n[[Page S4638]]\n\n  The Senate historically has been the place where people come to talk, \nto discuss, to air out an issue, and then to have amendments on that \nissue. That is the whole function of the Senate in our constitutional \nprocess. I find it incongruous, to be kind, that the House of \nRepresentatives would be trying to dictate to the Senate the rules of \noperation of the Senate in a manner--first, it is inappropriate to \nbegin with, but they are dictating them in a manner which basically \ngoes at the fundamental purpose of the Senate, which is that the Senate \nbe the place where debate, discussion, and amendment occurs on policy \nissues of great substance.\n  I do not argue that reconciliation is not a useful and appropriate \ntool to be used around here. There are many reconciliation initiatives \nfor which I voted. But in the area the Senator has noted, which is a \nmassive change in industrial policy, a huge tax on every person who \nturns on a light in every home in America, that should not be done \nunder reconciliation. Equally important, the House of Representatives \nshould not be explaining to the Senate or telling the Senate what the \nrules of the road are in the Senate. They have enough issues on their \nown over there.\n  At this point, I think the Senator from Michigan wanted to be \nrecognized. At the completion of the remarks of the Senator from \nMichigan or the chairman's comments, unless the Senator has further \ncomments, the next Member to be recognized on our side will be Senator \nGrassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me indicate with respect to the \nquestion of reconciliation being used for cap and trade or climate \nchange, there is no provision on the House side for that purpose. At \nleast that is the stated intention of the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives. And there is no reconciliation instruction in our \nresolution at all for any purpose.\n  Let me indicate I happen to agree with the Senator from Nebraska. I \npersonally do not believe reconciliation should be used for this \npurpose. I must say, I am very disappointed the Republicans, when they \nwere in a position to do so, abused reconciliation. I believe that \nstrongly. Reconciliation was designed for one purpose and one purpose \nonly, and that was deficit reduction. Our friends on the other side \nused it to dramatically cut taxes and increase the deficit. That was, \nto me, an absolute abuse of reconciliation.\n  But two wrongs do not make a right, and I do not believe using \nreconciliation for major substantive legislation that is not \nfundamentally deficit reduction is an appropriate use of \nreconciliation. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, I think people will find that because reconciliation was \ndesigned for a very specific purpose, that it does not work well for \nthe purposes of writing major substantive legislation. I will not go \ninto all the technical reasons why that is the case, but it is the \ncase. We will get to questions of reconciliation being used for other \npurposes as well.\n  I have argued strenuously, publicly and privately, that \nreconciliation ought to be reserved for deficit reduction. But I do \nwant to indicate that there is no reconciliation instruction in the \nresolution coming from the Senate; and in the House, the Speaker has \nmade clear that reconciliation would not be used for climate change \nlegislation or for cap-and-trade legislation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I totally want to identify my position with the Senator's \nargument as to the purposes of reconciliation and the fact it should \nnot be used for major public policy initiatives which require debate \nand hearings in the Senate and an amendment process. Are we to presume, \ntherefore, that your logic on cap and trade applies also to major \nhealth care reform?\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. My logic does, as I have made very clear over and over, \npublicly and privately. But, you know, I don't get to decide. We have \nHouse conferees, we have other Senate conferees, and, of course, we \nhave a White House that has an interest--although they have no formal \nrole in the budget process here. They submit a budget, but as the \nranking member well knows, the budget resolution is entirely a \ncongressional document.\n  With that said, I do want to indicate that I previously voted for the \namendment of the Senator. I will vote for it again. But I do want to \nindicate we do not have any reconciliation instruction in our \nresolution, and the House, through its leadership, has made clear they \ndo not intend to use a reconciliation instruction for the purpose of \ncap and trade or for the purpose of climate change legislation.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for a further question, I will \nmake this a rhetorical question. The Senator is one of the most \ninfluential Members of the Senate and of the Congress. When he says he \nwants something to happen, especially when it deals with the budget, I \nknow it will.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wish that were true. I wish the Senator had been with \nme in the discussions over the last few days, even in our caucus on \nTuesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I, too, rise to speak to a motion to \ninstruct conferees. I understand we do not yet have an agreement to be \nable to move forward on that.\n  I first want to indicate that I, as well as the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, joined with the Senator from Nebraska in supporting \nhis amendment to the budget resolution. But I believe it is not enough \njust to say what we will not do on climate change. It is very important \nto say what we will do. So that is what my motion to instruct does. It \nprovides a positive direction for future climate legislation. I thank \nmy colleagues, Senators Boxer, Brown, Shaheen, Cardin, and Lieberman \nfor cosponsoring this motion to instruct.\n  The budget we pass is truly about investing in America's future. With \nall respect to our ranking member, for whom I have great respect and \nfondness, there is a difference in this budget in terms of priorities. \nThere is no question about it. There is a big difference in terms of \nwhat we want to invest in--education, energy independence, health care, \njobs. I might say coming from Michigan: Jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  So there is a difference in direction, in values, and priorities in \nthis budget. I believe it is what the American people are asking for. \nOur policy on climate change has to invest in the future just as our \nbudget does. If done right, climate change legislation will create new \njobs, new industries, and it will revitalize and strengthen our \neconomy. So I will offer a motion to instruct in response to other \namendments that say what we cannot do. My motion, on the other hand, is \nwhat America can do, what we must do.\n  My State of Michigan is facing serious challenges right now. We have \nthe highest unemployment rate in the country, of 12.6 percent. The \nhardworking people, the families in Michigan and other States that are \nstruggling, need us to do a climate change policy right so that it does \ncreate jobs and transform our economy. Our economy cannot go forward \nwith the same old policies dependent on foreign oil and pollution that \nharms our health and our economic interests. Climate policy can and \nmust look out for working families and businesses, whether it is a \nfarmer, a manufacturer, or a clean tech engineer. That is why the \nmotion to instruct that I will be offering refers to a future climate \npolicy that is well balanced to address all of these interests, so it \ndoes create jobs and strengthens manufacturing and breaks America of \nour dangerous addiction to foreign oil. We cannot rely any longer on \nthe same old technologies and the same old fuel.\n\n  With new energy solutions come new jobs and new industries. America \nhas always led the world in innovation and we can do it again in a \ngreen energy economy if we do this right. We are in the midst of a \nrevolution, an energy revolution. Over 100 years ago, Henry Ford \nrevolutionized manufacturing in transportation with the automobile and \nthe assembly line. He also revolutionized the way we pay people in this \ncountry. He gave his workers $5 dollars a day to work on the line when \nit was not necessary to do that, because he wanted to make sure he had \npeople who could buy his automobiles.\n  Through doing that, that revolutionized people to invest in workers. \nHe\n\n[[Page S4639]]\n\nhelped create the middle class of this country. In the 1980s we had a \ncomputer revolution that changed the way we work, the way we \ncommunicate, the way we learn, the way we live. The energy revolution \nof the 21st century will change our economy, I believe, if done right.\n  That is why the right kind of climate policy is so important. The \nmotion to instruct that I will be offering will direct the conference \ncommittee toward a smart climate policy that will protect and \nstrengthen manufacturing. First we ensure a level playing field in the \nworld economy so climate legislation does not hurt our bottom line. \nThis will protect U.S. manufacturers from international competitors \nthat do not follow the same important environmental standard our \ncompanies will have to follow.\n  Second, new manufacturing opportunities will arise. I believe that. \nFor example, to meet the needs of new clean energy production, we will \nneed to produce clean energy technologies on a massive scale. We are \ntalking about 8,000 parts in a wind turbine. As I have said to many \ncolleagues, we can build every single one of those in Michigan. I know \nI talk a lot about this. I talk a lot about our economy in Michigan. \nBut I truly believe if our energy policy can turn Michigan's economy \naround, it will turn America's economy around.\n  Recent history has shown what happens when we rely primarily on \nforeign sources of energy. We subject ourselves to less than friendly \ninternational governments that can leverage unstable supply and higher \nprices against the people we represent. The motion to instruct I will \noffer will guide the conference committees to take steps to further \nreduce our dangerous addiction to foreign oil.\n  Furthermore, our domestic energy needs also increase over time, and \nall sources of clean energy should be part of the portfolio. \nDiversification of our energy supply is key for security, stability, \nand opportunity. This is a national and international problem and we \nmust solve this together.\n  My motion directs the conferees to ensure that all regions contribute \nequitably and help each other as America transitions to a clean energy \nfuture. I also believe a successful climate policy has to include all \nour economic stakeholders. Agriculture and forestry can make \nsignificant contributions to greenhouse gas reduction, perhaps as much \nas 20 percent, with the right incentives. My motion to instruct \nprovides clear and certain opportunities for landowners so they can \nachieve emission reductions and benefit from doing so.\n  Finally, this motion to instruct puts us on the road to a balanced \nclimate policy. With policies that meet these objectives, we can ensure \nthe American public that greater economic opportunity lies ahead, and \nwe can do this while meeting the ambitious emission reduction targets \nset by President Obama.\n  Instead of arguing about what we cannot do, I urge my colleagues to \nembrace what we can do. That is what this motion to instruct relates \nto--creating jobs, protecting our environment, energy independence. \nThis is what our future is about.\n  In addition to speaking about the motion to instruct, I would take a \nmoment to say, on the broader budget resolution, this resolution again \nis different. It is about jobs, it is about energy independence, health \ncare, education, tax cuts, yes, for the middle class who have been \noverlooked for too long, as well as focusing on cutting the deficit in \nhalf during the life of this budget resolution.\n  We know this deficit has been run up. When I came into the Senate in \n2001, we were debating what to do about a $5.7 trillion surplus over 10 \nyears, and colleagues were willing to make decisions, our colleagues on \nother side of the aisle, were willing to go into deficits for the war \nin Iraq, go into deficits for tax cuts for a few, go into deficits for \na different set of policies.\n  It is true, this budget resolution reflects what I believe is a \ndifferent set of priorities that are the priorities of the American \npeople. I am very proud of and grateful to our chairman, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, for his leadership, and I appreciate the ranking \nmember as well for his graciousness, even though we have different \nviews. I very much appreciate the way he and the chairman conduct the \ncommittee. But I am proud to say this is different. The American people \nwant a different set of priorities, and that is what this budget \nresolution provides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, at this moment, I ask unanimous consent \nthat next Senator Grassley be accorded 14 minutes; that Senator Boxer \nfollow him for 10 minutes.\n  How much time would Senator Wyden request ?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Could I have 10 as well?\n  Mr. CONRAD. And 10 minutes to Senator Wyden.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is this all coming off of your time?\n  I will be yielding my time on this side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would always be happy to give Senator Grassley time off \nmine.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will take it off your time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Pretty soon we are going to have a motion dealing with \nsmall business. I want to address that issue now so that I get it \naddressed properly as a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Everyone in this body knows that small businesses are an extremely \nimportant and dynamic part of the U.S. economy. I wish to say, and I \noften do, that small business is the employment machine of our economy.\n  President Obama agrees with that. Small businesses have generated 70 \npercent of the net increase in jobs in the United States over a long \nperiod of time. Three weeks ago, we debated this issue during the \nbudget resolution debate. During the debate, the Senate spoke on this \npoint, because Senator Cornyn had a small business tax relief \namendment. That amendment passed by an overwhelming vote of 82 to 16.\n  America's small businesses have been suffering during this recession. \nIf you go back to your States frequently, as I do, you will hear about \nit from your small businesses very directly. A few weeks ago, Senator \nLandrieu and Senator Snowe held a hearing on the crunch hitting small \nbusiness. They found that big banks have been cranking down lending to \nsmall businesses. At a time we are putting more money into big banks, \nwhy? I do not know that we got an explanation. I have been trying to \nget an answer out of Treasury on whether banks receiving the bailout \nmoney have been similarly squeezing out small business customers. I am \nstill waiting for an answer from our Treasury Department.\n  A very good source of answer, though, as we turn elsewhere, an answer \nabout the environment of small business, is found in the monthly \nsurveys of small businesses conducted by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business. We all know about the NFIB, the largest small \nbusiness organization. NFIB has been conducting these surveys now for \n35 years.\n  The membership of that organization includes hundreds of thousands of \nsmall businesses all across America. You can find the survey on NFIB's \nWeb site www.nfib.org. I wish to encourage every Member to check out \nthis month's survey, because I am going to be referring to it with \ncharts I have with me.\n  The survey shows some extremely disturbing trends on credit \navailability. Small businesses depend on credit. Small businesses are \ngetting squeezed very hard. That chart is up now. As you can see, the \nchart shows the availability of loans has fallen off the cliff as late \nas 2007 and gets worse as you get into 2009.\n  You see on the right side of the chart the sharp downturn evidencing \nthe lack of ability of small businesses to get loans. This credit \ncrunch as well as other factors has contributed to the near record low \nin the NFIB's index of small business optimism. I wish to have you view \nthis, something like we regularly view, the University of Michigan's \nmonthly index on consumer confidence.\n  The NFIB takes surveys regularly. This chart shows small business \nowners turning extremely pessimistic in the last couple of years. You \ncan see how that has ``downturned'' very rapidly at the right end of \nthe chart. What you see here is the attitude of decisionmakers in small \nbusiness of America,\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\nthe people who create the jobs. Those are the decisionmakers for the \nbusinesses that President Obama and we in the Congress agree are most \nlikely to grow or contract jobs.\n  The pessimism evidenced by the chart is at its second lowest point in \nthe 35-year survey. This data should concern every policymaker in this \nbody. As bad as the two sets of charts are, I have a worse picture.\n  This chart shows the net increase or decrease in small business \nhiring plans. The survey asks the small business owner simply whether \nhe or she plans to expand, on the one hand, or contract, on the other \nhand, employment over the next 3 months.\n  As you can see even more dramatically, look at the right-hand side of \nthe chart here. If I said on those others to the left hand, in each \ncase I was talking about the right. I do know the difference between \nthe left and right hand. But as you can see even more dramatically on \nthe other two charts, this chart shows small business activity \ncontracting tremendously.\n  Small business hiring plans are at their most negative level in the \nentire 35-year history of this survey, again, the right side of the \nchart. Let me repeat, because it is so important, this goes back to \n1974, those surveys. Since NFIB started doing them, the likelihood of \nsmall business owners adding workers has never been worse.\n  With this pessimism, we should not be surprised then that job losses \nfor small businesses have been growing dramatically. The national \nemployment report recently released by Automatic Data Processing shows \n742,000 nonfarm private sector jobs were lost from February to March \n2009. Of those 742,000 lost jobs, 614,000 or 83 percent, were from \nsmall business.\n  The President's recent efforts to increase lending to the small \nbusiness sector are commendable. The centerpiece of his small business \nplan will allow the Federal Government to spend up to $25 billion to \npurchase the small business loans that are now hindering community \nbanks and other lenders.\n  Unfortunately, that is only a drop in the bucket.\n  Remember that small business accounts for about half of the private \nsector. Moreover, the positives that will come to small businesses from \nthis relatively small package of loans--which will ultimately and \nobviously have to be paid back--will be heavily outweighed by the \nnegative impact of the President's proposed tax increases. Helping \nsmall businesses get loans just to take that money back in the form of \ntax hikes is not helping the economy or small businesses.\n  The President's budget proposes to raise the top two marginal rates \nfrom 33 percent and 35 percent to 40 percent and 41 percent \nrespectively, when PEP and Pease are fully reinstated. President \nObama's marginal rate increase would mean an approximately 20 percent \nmarginal tax rate increase on small business owners in the top two \nbrackets.\n  Many of my friends on the other side will say that while they agree \nthat successful small businesses are vital to the success of the U.S. \neconomy, the marginal tax increases for the top two brackets will not \nhave a significant negative impact on small businesses. I take \nexception to that argument. They used Tax Policy Center data, and I \nwant to show why that should not be allowed.\n  Proponents of these tax increases seek to minimize their impact by \nreferring to Tax Policy Center data that indicate about 2 percent of \nsmall business filers pay taxes in the top two brackets. In testimony \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee, the liberal think tank, Center on \nBudget Policy and Priorities, also used that figure. Moreover, \nSecretary Geithner has testified using that figure. They argue that a \nminimal amount of small business activity is affected.\n  However, there are two faulty assumptions to this small business \nfiler argument.\n  The first faulty assumption is that the percentage of small business \nfilers is static. In fact, small businesses move in and out of gain and \nloss status depending on the nature of the business and the business \ncycle. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has indicated that, \nfor 2011, approximately 3 percent of small business filers will be hit \nby these proposed higher rates. These statistics compare to a 2007 \nTreasury which showed 7 percent of flow-through business owners paying \nthe top rate. In the latest analysis, when the impact of the \nalternative minimum tax is fully included, that percentage may drop \nsome.\n  The second faulty assumption is that the level of small business \nactivity, including employment, is proportionate to the filer \npercentage. This is where the argument is hogwash.\n  According to NFIB survey data, 50 percent of owners of small \nbusinesses that employ 20-249 workers would fall in the top two \nbrackets. You can see it right here on this chart. It shows what I am \ntalking about. According to the Small Business Administration, about \ntwo-thirds of the Nation's small business workers are employed by small \nbusinesses with 20 to 500 employees.\n  Do we really want to raise taxes on these small businesses that \ncreate new jobs and employ two-thirds of all small business workers? Of \ncourse, we don't. But that is exactly what the majority is going to do \nif they follow the President's lead.\n  With these small businesses already suffering from the credit crunch, \ndo we really think it's wise to hit them with the double-whammy of a 20 \npercent increase in their marginal tax rates?\n  Newly developed data from the Joint Committee on Taxation \ndemonstrates that 55 percent of the tax from the higher rates will be \nborne by small business owners with income over $250,000. This is a \nconservative number, because it doesn't include flow-through business \nowners making between $200,000 and $250,000 that will also be hit with \nthe budget's proposed tax hikes.\n  If the proponents of the marginal rate increase on small business \nowners agree that a 20 percent tax increase for half of the small \nbusinesses that employee two-thirds of all small business workers is \nnot wise, then they should either oppose these tax increases, or \npresent data that show a different result for this group of people.\n  As we prepare for the conference on the budget resolution, the \nPresident and the congressional Democratic leadership have an \nopportunity to change course. They have an opportunity to revisit the \ntax heavy, spending heavy, and debt heavy budget they have passed 2 \nweeks ago. Both budgets would perpetuate the double whammy of \nconstricted credit on the one hand and high taxes on the other, \ndirected at America's job creation engine--small business.\n  In the coming days, we Republicans will try to persuade our \nDemocratic friends who have all the controls of fiscal policy to change \ncourse for the benefit of small business that we all agree ought to be \nour first concern. One way they can change course is to focus, like a \nlaser beam, on jump-starting the Nation's job engine--small business \nAmerica. We need an upturn in the small business optimism index that is \ncontrary to what this chart shows. We need to reverse the direction of \nthis sharply downward sloping arrow. If we ignore this negative \nenvironment, we are just kidding ourselves. We need to change course \nand reverse this even more sharply downward sloping hiring plan arrow.\n  That is where the President and Congress agree we need to get more \njob growth. As we take the final steps on the budget, let's match that \nbudget with this reality\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I listened to Senator Grassley's \nremarks, and I have been in conference with folks who have read this \nbudget line by line. It is important for me to say something as someone \nwho represents the largest State in the Union. As I look at this budget \nand it is how one looks at it--I see it as a boon to small business. I \ndon't see one specific tax increase aimed at small business. Yes, if an \nindividual is over $250,000 a year, for all of us in that category, the \ntax breaks will expire. But to say that all small businesses are hit \nhard is an argument that doesn't hold up, in my eyes. I have great \nrespect for my friend, and I know he has analyzed it another way. But \nwhen I look at the priorities of the new President and of this \nDemocratic Congress, what do I see?\n  Here are the priorities. Investment in energy, that is going to be \ngreat for\n\n[[Page S4641]]\n\nsmall business. Talk to my venture capitalists. They are ready, \nwilling, and able to make huge commitments to alternative forms of \nenergy. Investment in education, that is also going to be good for \npeople who work in the education field. And health care, we know that \nas we have more insurance out there available for people, there will be \nmany jobs created and many small businesses created around the delivery \nof health care.\n  I guess the way one looks at this budget depends on their point of \nview. Clearly, I believed our President, when he said he had those \npriorities. I view this budget overall as being a boon to small \nbusiness and being a boon to the American people as we move forward \nwith investments that will create many jobs.\n  The reason I wanted this time in particular was to kind of reargue an \nold argument we already had once before and that has come before us. \nSenator Johanns wants to have another vote to say we won't use the \nreconciliation process which, for people who don't know what that \nmeans, we won't use a process that we only need a majority to win. We \nare going to use the 60-vote requirement to write and pass global \nwarming legislation.\n  I know this is going to pass because it passed before. I think most \nMembers believe if we can get 60 votes for climate change legislation, \nfine. But I have to say again, after reviewing the number of times the \nRepublican Party has used reconciliation since 1980, it has been 13 \ntimes out of the 19 times that reconciliation has been used. I would \nsay to people who might be listening to this, to try to keep it as \nsimple as possible: Reconciliation is used when there is a way to \nreduce the deficit. That is when it is used. You want to reduce the \ndeficit so you say: Therefore, if you are reducing the deficit, we will \ndo it with just a majority vote instead of a supermajority vote. That \nis the thinking behind it.\n  A cap-and-trade program, which many of us support in order to combat \nglobal warming, will give us the ability to reduce the deficit. We know \nthat because that is what we were told last year as we worked on the \nBoxer-Lieberman-Warner bill. Much of the funds went back to consumers \nto help them pay energy costs. But there was a segment of funds that \nwent straight into deficit reduction. But, no, my Republican friends \ndon't want to look at that. Even though they used this 13 times, they \nwant to prohibit the use of reconciliation for global warming \nlegislation.\n  As I look back on the number of times Republicans have used \nreconciliation, in my view, it didn't make life any better for the \nAmerican people. This is what they used it for. They used it to cut \nhealth program block grants to our States. They used it to cut \nMedicaid. They used it to cut food stamps. They used it to cut dairy \nprice supports. They used it to cut energy assistance. They used it to \ncut education grants. They used it to cut impact aid and title I \ncompensatory education programs for disadvantaged children. They used \nit to cut student loans. They used it to cut the Social Security \nminimum benefit. Our friends on the other side were very happy to use \nthe reconciliation process, which only required 51 votes, to hurt the \nAmerican people. That is what I think those cuts did. But when it comes \nto helping the American people by stepping up to the plate and \naddressing global warming and, in the course of doing so, creating \nmillions of new jobs, no, they want to have a supermajority.\n  Senator Johanns showed us he can get the votes to pass that. I know \nhe will. That is why I am so grateful to Senator Stabenow, who has \nsaid: OK, you want to say we won't use reconciliation. She is saying: \nWe will, in fact, keep the reserve fund in there for global warming so \nwe can move it forward. This reserve fund will allow us to invest in \nnew jobs that will come about by investments in clean energy \ntechnologies which will make us a healthier economy, energy \nindependent, and it will make us more secure because we will have to \nimport less foreign oil. We are going to see increases in energy \nefficiency which will yield amazing benefits. That will help us in the \nlong run reduce energy costs. We are going to use these funds to \nprotect consumers. This is what the Stabenow-Boxer-Brown-Lieberman-\nCardin amendment is saying. We want to keep that reserve fund in the \nbudget so we can move forward with climate change legislation.\n  I am looking forward to this moment. This is long overdue. We have \nlost 8 years. But the kind of approach we need is the kind of approach \nSenator Stabenow is envisioning. We cannot afford to wait. Scientists \nare telling us we are going to face rising sea levels, droughts, \nfloods, the loss of species, spreading diseases. Our own health \nofficials in the last administration and this one have told us we have \nto act. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed an \nendangerment finding.\n  We are being told that our people are in danger if we do not enact \nglobal warming legislation. It is spelled out.\n  Severe illnesses are going to crop up as a result of organisms that \nwill now be living in warmer waters.\n  To quote the EPA--and they talk about the heat waves and the \nmortality rate and the wildfires and the drought and the flooding--this \nis what they say. I will close with this quote. They say: Global \nwarming left unchecked is a serious harm to our people. It is not a \nclose case, they say. The greenhouse gases that are responsible for \nglobal warming endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of \nthe Clean Air Act.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the EPA's Proposed Endangerment Finding.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  EPA's Proposed Endangerment Finding\n\n       The effects of climate change observed to date and \n     projected to occur in the future--including but not limited \n     to the increased likelihood of more frequent and intense heat \n     waves, more wildfires, degraded air quality, more heavy \n     downpours and flooding, increased drought, greater sea level \n     rise, more intense storms, harm to water resources, harm to \n     agriculture, and harm to wildlife and ecosystems--are effects \n     on public health and welfare within the meaning of the Clean \n     Air Act.\n       This is not a close case in which the magnitude of the harm \n     is small and the probability great, or the magnitude large \n     and the probability small. In both magnitude and probability, \n     climate change is an enormous problem. The greenhouse gases \n     that are responsible for it endanger public health and \n     welfare within the meaning of the Clean Air Act.\n       Severe heat waves are projected to intensify in magnitude \n     and duration over the portions of the U.S. where these events \n     already occur, with likely increases in mortality and \n     morbidity. The populations most sensitive to hot temperatures \n     are older adults, the chronically sick, the very young, city-\n     dwellers, those taking medications . . ., the mentally ill, \n     those lacking access to air conditioning, those working or \n     playing outdoors, and the socially isolated.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friends and my colleagues who are listening \nto this debate, vote for the Stabenow motion to instruct. It is an \nimportant motion. It will keep the reserve fund and will allow us to \nmove forward and attack this serious problem of global warming that has \ngone unaddressed for too long.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, Chairman Conrad has emphasized how \nimportant it will be to tackle the major issues--health care reform and \nclimate change--in a bipartisan way. I wish to spend a few minutes \nfirst expressing my support for that position and urging that the \nconference on the budget proceed expeditiously because then the heavy \nlifting in the Senate will begin.\n  For example, for American health care, what is needed is nothing \nshort of a transformation of our system. American health care is simply \nbroken. Medical costs are gobbling up everything in sight. Middle-class \npeople know their paychecks are not going up, and the prime reason is \nbecause medical costs take away all of what would otherwise be a wage \nincrease.\n  Our newspapers report daily that Americans are being laid off at \ntheir jobs. They lose their health benefits. What we see again and \nagain is a spiral of tragedy, as they simply lurch from one effort to \nanother to try to find health care and cannot get it.\n  For example, on Tuesday, the New York Times published a front page \nstory titled, ``No Job and Soon No Benefits, Race to Help Son Stay \nCancer Free.'' Dana Walker of Humble, Texas, was laid off from her job \nat DHL leaving her and her family without health insurance. Her son \nJake is just 21 years old and is a cancer survivor. Now uninsured, the \nWalkers have had to defer their own care, pay up front for Jake's care, \nand have essentially been refused care at the hospital that specializes \nin care. In the article, Mrs. Walker said, ``Your job as a parent is to \nprotect your children at any cost. I really feel like I had let him \ndown.''\n  I don't believe Mrs. Walker has let her son down. She's doing all she \ncan. In the individual market health insurers can discriminate on the \nbasis of age, gender, family size, geography, health status and pre-\nexisting conditions like cancer. Even though Jake has been cancer free \nfor a year, he can't find affordable health insurance on his own. \nInsurance companies can pick and choose the customers who are the good \nrisks and leave the bad risks, like Jake Walker, out in the cold. It \nisn't Mrs. Walker who's let her son down. It's the health care system.\n  This is not going to be fixed by a piecemeal approach to health care \nreform that tackles one part of the system or another and produces \nincremental change for perhaps a short period of time. What is needed \nis transformational change. I believe Democrats and Republicans in the \nSenate are committed to that objective.\n  I think there is a growing recognition that both parties have had a \nvalid point. Democrats, in my view, are correct that you cannot fix \nhealth care unless you cover everybody because without full coverage \nyou cannot organize the market. There is too much cost-shifting. There \nis no emphasis on prevention. You have to get all Americans good \nquality, affordable care. Republicans have valid points, in my view, as \nwell. You should not just turn everything over to the Government and \nsay that is the answer.\n  What is really needed for transformational change is containing the \ncosts. The Congressional Budget Office, last May, said that for the \namount of money America is spending today on health care, all Americans \nin a couple years could have good quality, affordable coverage like \ntheir Members of Congress. That is what the Congressional Budget Office \nsaid when it looked at one approach to dealing with health costs.\n  I am very confident, under the leadership of Chairman Baucus and \nChairman Kennedy, that they will have a lot of support for \ntransformational change so we make sure all Americans have access to \ngood quality, affordable choices, and they get rewarded when they take \nsensible steps, for example, in preventive health care and wellness and \nshop carefully for health care coverage.\n  Today, if you are lucky enough to have health care coverage, you do \nnot get any choice at most employers. That is not the way it is for \nMembers of Congress. So why don't we agree, Democrats and Republicans, \nafter we get this budget conference put together, that we are going to \nmake sure all Americans get good quality, affordable choices like \nMembers of Congress have? Then let's start rewarding them. Let's reward \nthem for sensible prevention. For example, the Safeway Corporation has \nbeen doing that for some time. I would like to say that seniors who \nlower their blood pressure and lower their cholesterol would get \nreduced Part B premiums. That is the outpatient portion of the Medicare \nprogram. But these are areas where Democrats and Republicans can come \ntogether.\n  There has been considerable discussion on the Senate floor about the \nidea of reconciliation for tackling health care. I think Chairman \nConrad is absolutely right in his approach.\n  I will say there have been many of us on both the Democratic and \nRepublican side, as we have looked to health care, who want to make the \nissue of reconciliation irrelevant. We want to make the issue of \nreconciliation irrelevant because we are hoping to bring enough \nDemocrats and Republicans together so we will have 70 or more Senators \ngathered to fix the health care system.\n  These issues, ultimately, in my view, are not ones that automatically \nproduce a partisan divide. The private insurance system is also broken. \nIt is about cherry-picking.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 31 seconds.\n  Mr. WYDEN. For the remainder of my time, Madam President, let me tick \noff a number of other areas where Democrats and Republicans on this \nhealth care issue can come together for transformative change.\n  Today's private insurance model is also broken. It is all about \ncherry-picking. It is about taking healthy people and sending sick \npeople over to Government programs more fragile than they are. So what \nDemocrats and Republicans want to do--again, in the name of \ntransformative change--is we want to say that the companies are going \nto have to take all comers. We understand that is a key part of health \ncare reform.\n  But we are going to put them all on equal footing. There are not \ngoing to be any price controls or big Federal regulatory systems. But \neverybody is going to be part of a big group so we contain costs as \npart of a big pool. We will reward prevention and wellness, which, of \ncourse, is not done today. This is where I think it will be possible \nfor firms in the health care area to both do good and do well by \noffering better service to our people.\n  Other areas of transformative health care reform: The issue of \nportability and making sure our people can take their health care \ncoverage with them so they do not lose their coverage when they lose \ntheir job or they wish to leave their job. That is what happens today. \nOf course, much of the health care system does not offer that kind of \nportability because it is built around what happened in the 1940s, when \nsomebody started working and stayed put for 25 years, until you gave \nthem a gold watch. Well, today the typical worker changes their job 11 \ntimes by the time they are 40. We need portable coverage. Democrats and \nRepublicans can work together on that.\n  I want to close, again in the name of bipartisanship, by talking \nabout how we can help people who have coverage. They have been \ndescribed by some as the contentedly covered Americans. I\n\n[[Page S4643]]\n\nthink what we ought to say for those folks, Democrats and Republicans, \nis, let's let them keep the coverage they have. Let's make sure they \nare wealthier in the new system because they get rewarded when they \nengage in those preventive practices or make a good purchase. Let's \nmake sure they are healthier in the new system. Chairman Conrad is here \nand has talked about improvements, for example, in chronic care, which \nis certainly part of making Americans healthier.\n  Finally, let's make sure that if they leave their job or their job \nleaves them, as I have touched on, they are going to have a safety net \nof affordable coverage.\n  Each and every one of those points I have talked about is an issue on \nwhich Democrats and Republicans can come together. I hope the Senate \nwill follow Chairman Conrad's advice about proceeding expeditiously. I \nthink there are many Members of the Senate who want to tackle these big \nissues--climate change and health care--in a manner that makes \nreconciliation irrelevant because we have brought together the kind of \nbroad majorities that I think are particularly within the grasp of the \nSenate on this issue of reforming health care. I look forward to \nworking with colleagues on both sides of the aisle for exactly that \nkind of transformative policy to better meet the needs of the American \npeople.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, just briefly, I want to thank Senator \nWyden for his leadership. He is really an outstanding member of the \nBudget Committee. No one--no one--has spent more time on health care \nreform and tax reform than the Senator from Oregon. No one has reached \nacross the party divide more assiduously than Senator Wyden. I very \nmuch appreciate his contributions to the committee and to the Senate \nand especially to a thoughtful debate and discussion of the key issues \nfacing the country.\n  One of the things that is so striking on health care is that we are \nspending about 18 percent of our gross domestic product on health care. \nAnd some are saying: Well, we have to spend another $1 trillion to $1.5 \ntrillion. It strikes some of us as improbable that when we are spending \n$1 in every $6 in our economy on health care--about twice as much \nproportionately as any other country in the world--that the answer is \nto spend another $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion.\n  Senator Wyden, through really years of effort--and I mean years--\nworking week after week with the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, with other policymakers, has put together a bipartisan health \ncare plan. It is the only one of significance I know of that has broad-\nbased bipartisan support. He deserves all of our thanks for the efforts \nhe has extended. I once again thank the Senator for his leadership in \nthe committee, on the floor, in the Senate, and for the seriousness of \npurpose he has brought to the task.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, while I agree with Senator Conrad that \nSenator Wyden has worked hard on this and he is raising some important \nissues, I am very worried about where we may be heading in the realm of \nhealth care. I have been impressed with Senator Wyden's efforts to \ncreate something that could result in bipartisan agreement. I don't \nknow where we are headed, but I respect him greatly for his efforts.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my motion to \ninstruct conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama Mr. Sessions moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the concurrent \n     resolution S. Con. Res. 13 (the current resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2010) be instructed to insist that the \n     conference report on the concurrent resolution shall freeze \n     non-defense and non-veterans funding for 2 years, and limit \n     the growth of non-defense and non-veterans funding to 1% \n     annually for fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the budget resolution is on the floor \nnow, and I believe we ought to talk about it and be honest with \nourselves about it. I will speak as one Senator. I know it passed this \nSenate. I don't think any Republican voted for it. Maybe a couple of \nDemocrats voted against it, but it passed with extra votes to spare.\n  I would say--and I hate to say it, but I will repeat what I have said \nbefore: I believe this is the most irresponsible budget in the history \nof this Republic. It surges debt to a degree to which we have never \nseen before, not because it assumes we are going to be in long-term \neconomic turmoil--they assume we are going to have economic growth \nroaring back in a year or two and that revenues will be surging in to \nthe Government. The debt and deficit we are incurring is a direct \nresult of massive spending--an alteration, I believe, by all accounts \nof an historic concept that Americans have of limited government, lower \ntaxes, and a vibrant private sector. We have always objected to the \nEuropeans and their more socialist model. We have consistently, year \nafter year, had greater growth than they have had, lower unemployment \nthan they have had, and we have been proud of that.\n  Of course, both Europe and the United States are in trouble today. I \nwas rather mortified when the European leaders told our President and \nour Secretary of the Treasury that no, they were not going to spend \nlike the United States; no, they believe we are incurring too much debt \nand they were not going to follow us; and the President of the European \nUnion said our financial proposals were the road to hell. That is what \nhe said about them.\n  Let me share a few things before we get started on the specifics of \nthe motion to instruct. This is what the President's budget called for. \nHe submitted a 10-year budget, and this is not something, let me add, \nthat he was forced to do. This budget represents the President's, the \nadministration's, and now, I guess, this Senate's fundamental view that \nwe need to spend, spend, spend more than we ever have in history and \nnot be too much worried about the debt.\n  So under the present state of affairs, in 2008 the debt of the United \nStates, from the founding of the Republic over 200 years, totaled $5.8 \ntrillion--a lot of money. We paid on that $170 billion in interest in \n2008. That is how much interest we paid. We spent less than $100 \nbillion on education and $40 billion on highways. This year we paid \n$170 billion on interest on our debt. But, within 5 years, according to \nthe President's own budget numbers we will double that debt to $11.8 \ntrillion in 5 years, and in 10 years, the debt will triple to $17.3 \ntrillion. The young people who are coming out of school today and \nbeginning to work, how much interest will they be required to pay on \nthat 10 years from now? Not $170 billion, but according to our own \nCongressional Budget Office that scored this carefully--and they are \nunder the control of the Democratic majority, but they are a \nnonpartisan group, and I respect what they do--they calculate we will \npay $806 billion in interest, over ten times what we are spending today \non the education expenditures of the Federal Government, and many times \nthe $40 billion we spend on highways this year.\n  I would say this is a stunning development. I am worried about it. I \nthink every American should be worried about it. Are those projections \noff base? I have the numbers; they just released the numbers for this \nyear. Remember, last year was the biggest deficit this Nation has had \nsince World War II--$455 billion. We need to be working that annual \ndeficit down.\n  Look: In October, the first month, we hit $134 billion; by January--4 \nmonths--we were at $563 billion this fiscal year. That is this fiscal \nyear. By January of this year, in 4 months, $563 billion in deficit \nrepresents the largest deficit in the Republic since World War II. Here \nwe go back to the end of the quarter, at 6 months from October, through \nMarch, it is now $953 billion, already twice what last year's numbers \nwere. So we are on track this year to see an annual deficit of $1.8 to \n$1.9 trillion. That is unbelievable.\n  I ask my colleagues, does it get better? Not under the President's \nbudget. Under the President's budget, in the outyears, the numbers \ncontinue to go\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\nup, and in the tenth year, his budget projects a deficit of $1.2 \ntrillion. Over 10 years, his budget deficit will average over $900 \nbillion each year. Again, this is not projecting a war; it is \nprojecting a decline in defense spending for military activities around \nthe globe. It is projecting solid, even robust economic growth. The \ndeficits are caused by spending. I am so disappointed we haven't done a \nbetter job of controlling it.\n  I know the Senate budget is a 5-year budget. That is what they think \nis going to look a little better than the President's 10-year budget, \nbut according to the Republican staff, they did an analysis of it and \nit is essentially the same over the first 5 years. In fact, Mr. Orszag, \nof the President's Office of Management and Budget, who used to be the \nDirector at CBO, said publicly it was 98 percent of what the President \nwanted. This chart shows that in discretionary outlays it is 98.8 \npercent identical to the President's 5 years; on total outlays, it is \n96.6 percent identical; and the revenue they project is 99.8 percent \nidentical.\n  What can we do about it? There are a lot of things we can do. The \nmost difficult--and our chairman, Senator Conrad, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Gregg, have made some steps toward dealing with the \ncrisis in entitlements. They are growing at a rapid pace and we have to \ndo something about it. This budget assumes no reform on entitlements \nwhatsoever, but maybe they will be able to make something happen. I \nwould like to see us project some savings in that, but it is not shown \nin this budget.\n  So the motion to instruct I have filed, and that at some point we \nwill be voting on, would say we ought to begin to establish some sense \nof fiscal responsibility by containing the growth in discretionary, \nnondefense, nonveteran spending. This can be done. It is particularly \neasy to do so this year because we, a few months ago--a few weeks ago, \nreally--passed an $800 billion stimulus package, on top of our base \nbudget. So I would have thought, when we did our baseline budget this \nyear, knowing we had pumped in $800 billion over the next 2 years to \ntry to stimulate the economy, that we would have a frugal baseline \nbudget. Not so. In fact, according to the budget that is on the floor, \nI believe, it shows a 7-percent increase in baseline discretionary, \nnondefense spending.\n  Most of my colleagues know the rule of seven: A 7-percent growth rate \ndoubles your money in 10 years. So this proposal puts us on a track to \ndouble the spending for discretionary, nondefense spending in 10 years. \nIt is an unsustainable track.\n\n  I propose this: In light of this stimulus package--the largest single \nappropriation of money in the history of America that we passed, and \nevery penny going to the debt; all $800 billion of it has to be \nborrowed so we can spend it. In light of that, we ought to be able to \nkeep the baseline budget flat for 2 years and show a modest increase of \n1 percent over the next 3 years. This will make a difference. It will \nsave us $173 billion. It will give us--it will start us on a process of \nhaving a baseline spending level for this country at a more frugal \nrate. Most States are having to cut. Most cities are showing \nreductions, 3.56 percent, some more than that, all over the country. \nThey are not disappearing from the face of the Earth. It is not \nimpossible to cut spending, but this doesn't propose any cut. It \nproposes 2 years of flat spending--but remember, we added $800 billion \non top of it; and then for 3 years, a 1-percent increase. This will \nmake a difference. In over 10 or 15 years, it will have an even bigger \nimpact than we might think.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this. We ought to show some \nrestraint. Everybody is saying, Well, we will worry about that \ntomorrow. We have a crisis today, and we are going to spend today, and \nwe will worry about the debt later. But it is time for us to stand up \nand be counted, I believe. I think my amendment is modest, I think it \nis responsible, but I think it is significant. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider this motion to instruct.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on it. I appreciate those who \nworked on this budget, but I have to say, it should not become law. It \nis a bad mistake for this country to do it. I urge my colleagues to not \ngo forward with a lockstep movement to vote for this budget. I don't \nthink the American people are at all happy with it. I believe they know \nwe are doing something fundamental to this country--and that was a big \npart of some of the tea party talk--a deep angst out there that \nsomething is happening to their country that is unprecedented.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' attention to this motion to instruct and \nI urge their support for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his remarks. I \ndisagree with them, but I respect them. They are deeply held on the \npart of Senator Sessions, who is an important member of the Senate \nBudget Committee.\n  Let's review the record, because I have heard some things here today \nthat are a bit of rewriting of history. How did we get in this ditch? \nThis wasn't the Obama administration's doing. The Obama administration \nhas been in office less than 100 days. They inherited this colossal \nmess. Who did they inherit it from? They inherited it from the previous \nadministration, aided and abetted by what was for 6 years solid \nRepublican majorities in the House and the Senate. And what was the \nrecord they produced? Not projections in the sweet bye-and-bye of what \nthe new President's budget might do. We can look back and see what \ntheir policies actually did. And what did they do? Well, on spending, \nit is interesting to see the crocodile tears now, but when they had a \nchance, they doubled the spending of the country. That is a fact. They \ndoubled it.\n  Much more than that, they took the deficit to unprecedented levels.\n  This is the deficit record of the previous administration. What you \nsee is an ocean of red ink. The black is the previous administration. \nThe Clinton administration balanced the budget and stopped raiding the \nSocial Security trust fund. The Bush administration came in and ran up \nthe deficit to record levels, put the economy in the ditch, and then \nleft town. They said to the Obama administration: Good luck.\n  This is what happened to the debt under the Bush administration. Not \nonly did they double spending, they more than doubled the debt of the \ncountry, and that was at a time when the economy was relatively good. \nWhat a tragic record. What a legacy they have left for this country--a \nlegacy of debt, deficits, and decline--the three Ds. And they are the \nDs that belong and describe the record of the previous administration.\n  What did President Obama inherit? Record deficits, the more than \ndoubling of the national debt, the worse recession since the Great \nDepression, the financial markets and housing markets in crisis, almost \n4 million jobs lost in the last 6 months alone, and war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. My goodness, what a mess he was left to try to clean up.\n  Senator Gregg has made it very clear--and he is right--that we have a \nneed to increase the short-term deficit, unless we want to return to \nHoover economics, which put this country in a depression and, \nunfortunately, that is exactly what I heard in the previous speech--a \ndesire to return to Hoover economics. The markets will correct \nthemselves; the Government doesn't have to do anything. We can just sit \nby and watch the whole thing collapse.\n  That was the philosophy of the last administration. We can see what \nhappened. It was a tragic mistake. We can go back further in history \nand see what happened in the 1920s and 1930s when that same philosophy \nprevailed. It put this country into the worst depression in the \neconomic history of our country.\n  All I can say is, no thanks. My vote is no on going back to Hoover \neconomics.\n  I say to my colleague, Senator Gregg, who recognizes that Hoover \neconomics is not the answer, this is the statement he made:\n\n       I am willing to accept the short-term deficit number and \n     not debate it, because we are in a recession, and it's \n     necessary for the Government to step in and be aggressive, \n     and the Government is the last source of liquidity. And so \n     you can argue that this number, although horribly large, is \n     something we will simply have to live with.\n\n  Senator Gregg said much the same thing today. Of course, he is right.\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\nLook, nobody is more of a deficit hawk, I don't think, in this place \nthan I am. But I understand in the short term, when your economy is \ncollapsing, deficits and debt will grow. That is necessary because only \nthe Government can provide the liquidity to prevent a complete \ncollapse. But over time, it is absolutely essential that we pivot and \ngo back to a more sustainable fiscal course. That is what this budget \nbegins to do.\n  For example, on domestic discretionary spending, we take it from 4.3 \npercent of GDP in 2010 down to 3.2 percent in 2014. We are stepping \ndown discretionary spending in each and every year, measured as a share \nof our national economy. That is what economists say is the right way \nto measure. I could show it in dollar terms, but that doesn't take into \naccount inflation. This does.\n  When I hear this talk about this being a big-spending budget, please, \nI don't know what budget they are talking about. They are not talking \nabout the budget that passed the Senate because the budget that passed \nthe Senate increases nondefense discretionary spending, on average, per \nyear, by 2.5 percent. That is not a big spending budget.\n  Let's look at the defense side as well because in 2010 defense \nspending under this budget is 4.8 percent of GDP. Over 5 years, we step \nit down to 3.7 percent of GDP almost the exact same trajectory as \nnondefense discretionary spending that we are taking from 4.7 percent \nof GDP in 2010 down to 3.6 percent in 2014. So it is one thing to come \nout and make a claim, it is another thing to prove it. Everybody has a \nright to their own opinion, but they don't have a right to their own \nfacts.\n  These are the facts of the budget before us. This is a tough and \nfiscally responsible budget that increases nondefense discretionary \nspending, on average, by 2.5 percent a year. Measured against the share \nof the economy, we are taking both defense spending and nondefense \ndiscretionary spending down as a share of our national income to the \nlowest level it has been in many years.\n  Madam President, where are the increases that are in this budget, the \n2.5 percent, on average, increase in nondefense discretionary spending? \nI have already shown that we are taking both defense spending and \nnondefense spending down as a share of the national income. But where \nare the increases, as modest as they are?\n  In overall discretionary spending, the biggest increase is in \ndefense, which is 37 percent. Why? Because this President and this \nbudget were honest about war spending, unlike the previous \nadministration, which played hide the ball and acted as though the war \nwasn't going to cost anything.\n  I am not overstating because for several years in a row the previous \nadministration, even though we were at war, said the war in their \nbudget was going to cost nothing. Let me repeat that. The previous \nadministration, even after the war in Iraq had begun, claimed in their \nbudget submissions that the war was going to cost nothing--nothing. \nWhat an amazing thing. It wasn't true.\n  This President came in and said: No, we are going to write a new \nchapter. We are at war, and we are going to put the war cost in the \nbudget. So in the modest increases here, 37 percent of them are \ndefense; 14 percent is in international. That is also something hidden \nin the previous administration. They kept presenting what they called \n``supplemental'' budgets after their regular budget to hide the full \ncost of their involvement overseas.\n  The next largest increase in the modest overall increases we have is \nfor veterans; 10 percent of the increases is for our Nation's veterans. \nWhy? Because they deserve the best care we can provide. We have the \nlargest dollar increase for veterans health care in this budget than in \nany budget that has been presented. I am proud of that because we are \nkeeping faith with our Nation's veterans.\n  Ten percent of the increase is for education, and 10 percent is for \nincome security. That is because we are in a deep recession. That means \npeople are out of work, and if we are going to provide unemployment \nbenefits to keep them from losing their homes and being out on the \nstreet and not being able to feed their families, we provide \nunemployment benefits. That costs money, and that is in the budget.\n  Eight percent is for the census. We only do the census once every 10 \nyears, but we have to pay for it. It is in the budget. Six percent is \nfor natural resources and the environment. Three percent is for \ntransportation, and 2 percent is for other items.\n  The overall context of this budget, I want to make clear--the \ndeficit, in dollar terms, is being reduced from $1.7 trillion this \nyear, and this year's budget is almost totally the responsibility of \nthe previous President because he set in place the policies that the \nnew administration inherits. We stepped down the deficit, very \ndramatically, by more than $500 billion from 2009 to 2010, by more than \n$300 billion from 2010 to 2011, by another $300 billion from 2011 to \n2012, and then more modestly thereafter, so that we are reducing the \ndeficit over the 5 years of this budget by two-thirds. Measured as a \nshare of the gross domestic product--which, again, economists say is \nthe best way to measure--the deficit is reduced by more than three-\nquarters, from 12.2 percent of GDP to less than 3 percent of GDP in \n2014. So over the 5 years, we are reducing the deficit by three-\nquarters.\n  One other point I want to make is that the previous administration--\nnot only did they more than double the debt and double spending, they \ntripled foreign holdings of U.S. debt. It took 224 years and 42 \nPresidents to run up $1 trillion of U.S. debt held abroad. The previous \nPresident alone tripled that amount. You talk about a legacy of debt, \nyou talk about a legacy of weakening the country, that is it.\n  Madam President, I don't mind hearing criticism of the budget we have \nproposed. Is it a perfect document? No. Do we have to do much more, \nespecially in the next 5 years? Absolutely. But this budget is a good \nand responsible beginning. If our budget is so bad, why haven't they \noffered an alternative? If our budget is as irresponsible as they \nclaim, why did they not offer an alternative?\n  Well, I think we know the reason. They didn't want to have to be held \nresponsible for the tough choices of presenting a budget. So talk is \ncheap around here. This budget upholds the President's fundamental \npriorities of reducing our dependence on foreign oil, a focus on \nexcellence in education, and fundamental health care reform because \nthat is the 800-pound gorilla that can swamp this boat. Without such \nreform, we are headed on a course in health care that is totally and \ncompletely unsustainable. Finally, we are dramatically reducing the \ndeficit over the next 5 years.\n  Those are the priorities the President asked us to preserve. We have \ndone it in the budget. The President supports it. He is right to do so. \nLet's remember this President did not create this mess; he inherited \nit. He has been asked to clean it up. I am proud of the aggressive \nactions he has taken to try to get us on a better course.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I will take this moment to ask those \nSenators who have motions to instruct to please come to the floor. We \nhave had Senator Johanns offers his, and Senator Sessions offer his. We \nhave other Senators--Senator Ensign, Senator Cornyn, Senator Alexander, \nSenator Coburn, Senator DeMint, and Senator Vitter. It would be very \nhelpful if those Senators would come and be prepared to offer their \nmotions so we do not unduly take the time of the Senate in quorum \ncalls, especially on a day in which we are going to have 9 or 10 votes. \nWe know we can only do about three votes an hour. That means three \nhours of voting when we get started on voting. So it is already going \nto be a late night. It would be very helpful and considerate to our \ncolleagues if those who have motions to instruct would come to the \nfloor and offer their motions.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4646]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next two \nspeakers on our side to be recognized--and, of course, there be an \nalternative speaker possibly from the Democratic side--the next two \nspeakers on our side are Senator Vitter for 10 minutes and then Senator \nAlexander for 10 minutes to talk about their motions to instruct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that after \nSenator Alexander, Senator Coburn be recognized to talk about his \nmotion to instruct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wish to speak on behalf of a motion \nto instruct the conferees, which I have here. Do I need to send this to \nthe desk?\n  Mr. GREGG. Not yet.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will speak on behalf of it and send it at the \nappropriate time.\n  This should be a relatively easy motion for our colleagues to support \nbecause it simply instructs the conferees to support a position that \nthe entire Senate adopted unanimously. That provision during our budget \ndebate was to accept the position of maintaining a competitive student \nloan program that provides students and institutions of higher \neducation with a comprehensive choice of loan products and services.\n  I ask the Chair if she will let me know when I have 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, there are three reasons in support of maintaining a \ncompetitive student loan system. The first is that 12 million students \nrely on it today in New Hampshire, in Tennessee, in North Dakota--all \nacross our country.\n  Second is that now is not the time to be creating a new half-\ntrillion-dollar national bank that would run up the debt, a bank that \nwould replace 2,000 private lenders, and make $75 billion in new loans \na year. That is not a proper function of the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n  And third, the cost savings that is alleged is--and I will be gentle \nin my words--a trick on students to make Congressmen look good.\n  What we are going to be doing if we do not preserve this choice is \nsaying to all the students who get a loan that we are going to take \nmoney from them and then give it to other students so that Congressmen \ncan go home and brag that he or she has increased the amount of the \nPell grants. Let me be specific in what I say.\n  I was the U.S. Secretary of Education in 1991 and 1992 when we \ncreated something called the Direct Loan Program. We have a federal \nstudent loan program. Most people who go to college are familiar with \nit. About two-thirds of the students at our 6,000 different \ninstitutions from the University of New Hampshire to the Nashville Auto \nDiesel College to Harvard to San Francisco State have a Federal grant \nor a loan. When you get a student loan, you take it to the institution \nof your choice.\n  We now have 2,000 lenders who help provide all those different kinds \nof loans. They give financial aid counseling, they give interest rate \ndeductions, they help students and families plan on how to pay for \ncollege. In other words, they service the loans and then the Government \nsupports that by guaranteeing almost all of the loans.\n  We set up a separate program which we called direct lending. That \nwas, you could come straight to the Government to get your loan. In \nother words, we created a government bank run by the Department of \nEducation. We said to the students and to the institutions: You make \nthe choice. You may either have a private student loan guaranteed by \nthe Government through your local bank or financial institution, or you \nmay come to the U.S. Department of Education to get your loan.\n  We have had more than 15 years of experience with that now, and what \nhave the students and institutions said? Three out of four say we like \nthe regular student loan program, we like the choice, we like the \nprivate lender. Since we are getting the loan, we like the idea of \ngoing to a bank to get a loan because that is what banks do. If you \nwant a car, you go to a car dealer. That may be changing. You may have \nto go to the Department of Treasury to get a loan the way the country \nis going. For 15, 16 years we market tested this and so we have that \ndirect loan program.\n  The situation right now is we have 12 million students at 4,400 \ndifferent institutions getting $52 billion in loans by their choice \nfrom banks instead of from the Government. One-fourth get it from the \nGovernment. It has been that way for a long time.\n  What the President's proposal wants to do is to take all those \nchoices away from the students and say: Line up outside the Department \nof Education to get your student loan, all 15 million of you. There \nwill be 4,400 institutions and 12 million students who may not like \nthat.\n  Second point. Is a national bank a good idea? We read in the paper \nthat the Government is going to take stocks in the biggest banks. So we \nare going to nationalize the banks. Then we read in the paper the \nGovernment is going to take stock in General Motors and Chrysler--\nhopefully that is not true--so we are going to have the Government \ndeciding what kind of car we are going to be making, what kind of \nplants we will have, where the plants are going to be. I cannot think \nof a worse organization to do that.\n  This is a proposal to say: All right, now the Government is going to \nbe your bank. It is going to be the bank for your student loans. We are \ngoing to create a new national bank. It would have over a half trillion \ndollars in outstanding student loans. It would make 15 million student \nloans every year, $75 billion in loans a year. We will run all this out \nof the U.S. Department of Education, a wonderful Department. I was \nmyself there for 2 years. But what do we know about being a national \nbank? Not very much. Andrew Jackson would roll over in his grave about \nthe idea of a national bank of this size.\n  My final point. This proposal, with all due respect, is a trick on \nstudents to make Congressmen look good, and here is why.\n  The budget we originally got said we will take $94 billion in savings \nand we will spend it on Pell grants. Let's think about that a minute. \nCommon sense will tell you that the Department of Education is not \ngoing to know more, is not going to be able to replace 2,000 lenders at \na cheaper cost. That simply is not going to work. That is what common \nsense would tell you.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has told us that in order for the \nDepartment of Education to administer these loans, it would cost about \n$28 billion over the next 10 years. That is the computation I have \nmade. They estimate that the cost of administering the current Direct \nLoan Program is about $700 million a year. So if they did them all, \nthat would be at least $2.8 billion a year.\n  Conservatively speaking, you don't have $94 billion in savings; you \nhave 94 minus 28. So you have around 66. So you have $66 billion that \ngoes somewhere out to banks, maybe to reduce loans, maybe to reduce \ninterest rates, maybe to administer the loan program. But the bottom \nline is, if the Government takes this program over, it is going to be \nborrowing money at one-half of 1 percent and loaning it out to 15 \nmillion students at 6.8 percent. Borrowing at one-half of 1 percent and \nloaning it out at 6.8. On every student loan--and I hope all 15 million \nstudents listen to this--your friendly Government is going to take back \n6.5 percent\n\n[[Page S4647]]\n\nof the 6.8 percent interest you are paying. What is it going to do? The \nCongressman or Congresswoman can go home to Tennessee or wherever and \nsay: I increased Pell grants. But they won't tell you: I took money \nfrom this student to give it to that student. That is not the way to do \nit.\n  What we should do, if that spread is too high right now, is let's cut \nit down--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.--if the savings is estimated at $90 billion. We know \nit is closer to 60. Maybe it is 20, maybe it is 30, maybe it is 35. \nMaybe we should lower the interest rate to 3 or 4 percent or 5 percent \nor whatever is the appropriate rate. But that does not justify creating \na national bank in the Department of Education to try to handle 15 \nmillion loans.\n\n  So my argument, Madam President, is this: There are colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle--and there are a number of Democrats--who \nstrongly support the idea of competition and choice in higher \neducation. That is why we have the best higher education system in the \nworld. We have competition and choice all the way through it. The \ngrants and the loans don't go to colleges; they go to the students, and \nthe students choose the college. They can go to Nashville Auto Diesel \nCollege if they want or they can go to Harvard; it follows them to the \nschool of their choice. They ought to be able to go to the lending \ninstitution of their choice and not line up outside of the Department \nof Education to get 15 million loans every year. That is not right. It \nis not the way our country ought to work. So the first is to preserve \nchoice for the 15 million students who now have it at 4,400 \ninstitutions.\n  The second reason is, let's not be creating another nationalized \nasset in America. We need to be thinking of ways of getting the \nGovernment out of the private sector. I mean, this recession is not for \nthe purpose of the Government taking over every auto company, every \nbank, all the student loans, and every business that is in trouble. We \nneed to be thinking of ways of going the other direction. That is the \nAmerica we know. That is the America we want. So we don't need a new \nnational bank.\n  Arne Duncan is the new Secretary of Education. I think he is the \nPresident's best appointee. He ought to be working on paying teachers \nmore for teaching well, creating more charter schools, helping states \ncreate higher standards. That is his agenda. I don't think he came from \nChicago to Washington to be named banker of the year, which is what he \nwould be doing if he became a national bank president for student \nloans. That is what this proposal would do unless the Senate sticks to \nits position.\n  Finally, I don't want to be a part of any situation which has \nCongressmen and Senators playing a trick on 15 million students and \nsaying: I am going to borrow money at a quarter of 1 percent and loan \nit to you at 6.8, and then I am going to take credit for giving the \nrest of it away. I think that will come home to roost, and it ought to \ncome home to roost.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to make this motion to instruct, and I \nhope it will come to a vote. I hope it has the kind of bipartisan \nsupport it had before. I hope the President will think of all the other \nthings there are to do that need attention, such as fixing the banks, \ngetting credit flowing, restoring the auto companies, and leave the \nstudent loan system to continue to work in the way it should work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield, I would suggest that he send \nhis motion to the desk at this time and set aside the pending motion.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I send to the desk my motion to \ninstruct conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending motion is set \naside. The clerk will report the motion to instruct.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the concurrent \n     resolution S. Con. Res. 13 (the current resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2010) be instructed to insist that the \n     final conference report include the Senate position \n     maintaining a competitive student loan program that provides \n     students and institutions of higher education with a \n     comprehensive choice of loan products and services, as \n     contained in section 203 of S. Con. Res. 13, as passed by the \n     Senate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmotion be set aside and that my motion be sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the concurrent \n     resolution S. Con. Res. 13 (the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2010) be instructed to insist that if \n     the final conference report includes any reserve funds \n     involving energy and the environment, that such sections \n     shall include the requirements included in section 202 (a) of \n     the Senate-passed resolution to require that such legislation \n     would not increase the cost of producing energy from domestic \n     sources, including oil and gas from the Outer Continental \n     Shelf or other areas; would not increase the cost of energy \n     for American families; would not increase the cost of energy \n     for domestic manufacturers, farmers, fishermen, or other \n     domestic industries; and would not enhance foreign \n     competitiveness against U.S. businesses.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, a few weeks ago, when we debated the \nbudget here on floor of the Senate, I passed language contained in \nsection 202(a) of that budget resolution. This motion to instruct \nconferees is very simple. It says that we will fight to keep that \nlanguage in the final budget resolution.\n  What does that language do? Well, it is very simple. It says that \nthis budget legislation `` . . . would not increase the cost of \nproducing energy from domestic sources, including oil and gas from the \nOuter Continental Shelf or other areas; would not increase the cost of \nenergy for American families; would not increase the cost of energy for \ndomestic manufacturers, farmers, fishermen, or other domestic \nindustries; and would not enhance foreign competitiveness against U.S. \nbusinesses.''\n  That is a pretty simple, straightforward plea, and it is one we \nshould keep in this budget resolution--fight and demand to retain that \nlanguage in our budget. That is why I ask all my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this motion to instruct.\n  At a gut level, this is very simple. New taxes kill jobs. New taxes \nkill jobs. According to a preliminary estimate based on the Center for \nAmerican Progress data, 271,000 oil and gas jobs would be destroyed by \nthe administration's proposed new taxes and fees on energy. That would \nbe a bad idea, in my opinion, at any time. But now, as we are in the \nmidst of a horrible recession, which is still getting worse, it is a \nhorrendous idea. Now is not the time to impose these new taxes on the \neconomy, including the oil and gas industry. New taxes would hurt \nworkers by extending the recession and by depressing job creation just \nas, hopefully, an economic recovery in the next several months starts \nto gain a foothold.\n  The oil and gas industry is significant to our economy and employs \nmore than 6 million fellow Americans. Attacking that industry in the \nmidst of a horrible recession is attacking those 6 million of our \nfellow citizens. Right now, they feed their families, put a roof over \ntheir kids' heads because of good, solid jobs in the energy sector \nproducing good, affordable energy for Americans. These proposed taxes \nwould kill those jobs in the midst of a horrible recession.\n  This is not brain surgery. We know from history, from practice, that \nhigher taxes in this sector result directly in less domestic energy, \nand restrained supplies lead to higher energy costs for consumers too. \nSo in today's economy, that would stifle recovery and make Americans \nmore dependent on foreign oil and natural gas.\n  New taxes will make it more expensive for oil and natural gas \ncompanies to expand or initiate new exploration and development \nprograms, and that would mean fewer jobs for American workers.\n  New taxes hurt businesses, threaten jobs, and they are then passed on \nto\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\nconsumers as higher prices. And higher taxes are a burden felt \nthroughout the economy. They discourage business expansion, investment, \nand job creation.\n  Again, this is a very simple, basic, but important notion. This is no \ntime to increase taxes on domestic energy production. This is no time \nto stifle what will hopefully soon become the beginnings of a recovery. \nIn terms of our energy picture, this is no time to lessen domestic \nproduction when we should be moving in the opposite direction and \nincreasing domestic production and independence from foreign sources. \nAll of these energy tax proposals would do exactly that.\n  Let's be clear about it. These proposals have been made. They are \nthere in black and white. They are concrete. They are real proposals \nfrom the Obama administration and some liberal Members of Congress, and \nthey fall into two big categories: No. 1, a very aggressive, ambitious \ncap-and-trade program, which is a tax on so many forms of energy and \nactivity in our country; and No. 2, direct tax increase proposals on \ndomestic oil and gas production. I don't believe any time is a good \ntime to push that policy, but I would hope we can all agree that now, \nin the midst of a severe recession, which unfortunately is still \ngetting worse, is really not the time to increase taxes on the domestic \nenergy sector. It will cost us jobs, it will stifle a recovery, it will \nincrease costs on consumers, and it will hurt American businesses and \nconsumers.\n  Madam President, let's all join in support of this language in the \nSenate version of the budget resolution. In our previous debate of a \nfew weeks ago, it was adopted by unanimous consent. Let's make sure it \nis fought for and preserved in the final version of the budget \nresolution.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmotion be set aside, and I offer a motion to instruct the budget \nconferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the concurrent \n     resolution S. Con. Res. 13 (the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2010) be instructed to insist that \n     Conference Report include a reserve fund that promotes \n     legislation that achieves savings by going through the \n     Federal Budget line by line, as President Obama has called \n     for, to eliminate wasteful, inefficient, and duplicative \n     spending, as set forth in Section 224 of S. Con. Res 13.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this was accepted during our debate. The \nreason I bring it back is that if you ask the American people what they \nare worried about, they are worried about their jobs, they are worried \nabout their health care, but they are also worried that we are spending \ntheir children into oblivion. And they are right--we are.\n  One of the great things about President Obama's promises was that he \nsaid he recognized we have waste in the Federal Government. He \nrecognized we have duplication in the Federal Government. He recognized \nwe have programs that aren't working in the Federal Government. And the \ncommitment he made--and he has made three times since being sworn in as \nPresident--is to do a line-by-line evaluation of every Federal program \nout there, to check it for waste, No. 1; No. 2, to check to see if it \nis duplicative of something else, which a third of them are; and No. 3 \nis, does it have any metrics on it and is it being defrauded?\n  The fact is, it is now common knowledge that at least $300 billion a \nyear--at least $300 billion a year--is either wasted, defrauded, or \nduplicated in the Federal Government. The real problem is that even \nthough we now have a President who wants to attack that, Congress \nhasn't been willing to do it. We have not been willing to keep our side \nof the bargain in terms of oversight and evaluation.\n  It strikes me that if all the money we are borrowing to run the \nGovernment today was really our money, none of us would ever allow what \nis going on in the Federal Government. None of us would. None of us \nwould allow the duplication.\n  We had a hearing yesterday in Senator Carper's Federal Financial \nManagement Subcommittee on the waste and fraud in Medicare and \nMedicaid. It went up to $74 billion--$74 billion, and we are not doing \nanything about it? Total improper payments. We only have improper \npayments in about three-quarters of the Federal Government even though \nit is a mandated law that they have to supply it. But they can't \nmeasure it because they don't know what they are paying for.\n  The fact is, we know we have big problems. We have a fraud bill in \nfront of us that we haven't finished working on that is to go after \nfraud. Well, the biggest fraud is right here. The biggest waste is \nright here. So the point ought to be, as we go into a conference on the \nbudget, that we ought to commit to the American people that we are \nwilling to do what they are having to do right now; that we are going \nto look at where things aren't working, we ought to look at where \nthings are wasted, we ought to look at things we are not measuring and \nstart measuring them, and the things that are not effective, we should \nget rid of. That is all this says. It just says we will go line by line \nthrough every Federal program; that we will have oversight at least \nonce a year on everything that is out there, and we will make a dent in \nthis $300 billion-plus.\n  Here is the question. Is it moral to waste $300 billion and that $300 \nbillion come out of lost opportunity of our children? Is this a moral \nposition the Senate wants to stand on? Does the Congress want to stand \non that? Can our country ultimately survive, if we keep doing what we \nare doing? The answer to that is emphatically no, we cannot. Every \nrepublic in the history of mankind has died under fiscal collapse. They \nhave not been invaded from outside until they rotted from within.\n  This is a straightforward commitment by the Senate and the Congress, \nthrough the budget, to meet President Obama's request that what he is \ngoing to do we are going to do, and we are going to weed out a large \nportion of the ineffectiveness, of the duplication, and of the waste \nthat is in our Government and our grandkids' Government. There is no \nreason for us to have anything other than a unanimous vote on this \nmotion to instruct.\n  If you do not think we should be doing that, you do not belong in the \nSenate. If you do not think we have a constitutional obligation to \nevaluate where we are spending the money, get rid of the waste and go \nline by line through all these programs, we need some other people up \nhere. That is because right now our Republic is in jeopardy. It is not \nfrom terrorism. It is from our own potential fiscal collapse. The time \nto attack that is now.\n  It is my hope the Senate will send a huge vote on this motion that we \nmean business, we are going to join hands with President Obama, and we \nare going to fix most of what is wrong, in terms of these programs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withdraw that. I see Senator DeMint is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                      Motion To Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the concurrent \n     resolution S. Con. Res. 13 (the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2010) be instructed to insist that the \n     conference report on the concurrent resolution shall include \n     a point of order against legislation that eliminates the \n     ability of Americans to keep their health plan and eliminates \n     the ability of Americans to choose their doctor, as contained \n     in section 316 of the concurrent resolution, as passed by the \n     Senate, and insist further that an additional condition be \n     added providing such legislation shall not decrease the \n     number of Americans enrolled in private health insurance, \n     while increasing the number of Americans enrolled in \n     government-managed, rationed health care.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, we are here to talk about the budget. \nObviously there are a number of different\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\nthings in the budget of concern and some controversy. I appreciate the \nopportunity to speak on this motion which addresses a particular part \nof the budget related to health care. During the campaign the President \npromised that any changes in health care would protect the patient's \nright to pick their plan, their doctor, and to keep the plan they have \nif they want it. My motion simply codifies that, in a sense, we make \nsure we keep the promise.\n  In the budget there is a downpayment which has been referred to of, I \nthink, around $700 billion on some massive changes in health care. My \nconcern is this could mean an expansion of Government plans rather than \nmaking private health insurance more available to patients. We do not \nneed to just speak of the public interest when we are talking about \nhealth care; it is important that we talk about the patient's \ninterests. I think most of us agree that when the patients can work \ndirectly with their doctors, choose their own doctors, choose their own \nhealth plans, the Nation is better off.\n  There is an old saying that success has many fathers while failure is \nan orphan. Our health care failures have a father. In most cases it is \nthe Government. See, our policies make it hard for individuals to have \na health insurance plan they can afford and own and keep. One part of \nthat is the Government today pays for over half of the health care in \nAmerica through Medicare, Medicaid, children's health programs, and \nveterans health programs. But, unfortunately, when they pay doctors in \nhospitals they often pay below cost.\n  In fact, it has been estimated that Government payment causes private \nhealth insurance to be 20 percent to 30 percent more expensive than it \nwould be if everyone paid their fair share of the cost. So the \nGovernment at the beginning is a big part of the problem of making \nhealth insurance too expensive for individuals.\n  A number of us had the opportunity this week to hear from the \nPresident and CEO of Safeway Supermarkets. They have over 200,000 \nemployees. He was going through a lot of the statistics about their \nhealth plan and how they have been able to keep the cost of health care \nlevel for the last 4 years. They have done a lot of things not only to \nmake health insurance and health care more accessible, they have done a \nlot of things to make their employees healthier. You see, they use a \nlot of incentives, recognizing that 70 percent of our health problems \nas Americans are caused by our own behavior--whether it be smoking or \noverweight or poor diets. It is pretty obvious through the statistics \nthat people have a lot of control over how healthy they are and \ntherefore how much they have to spend on health care.\n  Safeway, through a lot of incentives that discourage smoking and \nencourage people to get in better shape--eat better, lose weight--are \nable to save their employees money and to make them healthier and to \nreduce the cost of the health care for the company and for the \nemployees.\n  There are a lot of demonstrations like this around the country that \nshow private health insurance can work. Freedom can work if we let it.\n  The President of Safeway asked us to make some changes that would \ngive them more flexibility to offer even more incentives for people to \ncut their own cost of health care by changing their behaviors. This is \nsomething we should all want. Instead of moving immediately to some \nmassive new Federal plan, let's look at what we can do to let the free \nmarket system work, where patients and doctors and employers and \nassociations can work together to make private health insurance work.\n  There are a lot of things we do here that make it harder. I will list \na few. Small businesses could do the same thing as Safeway if we \nallowed them to work together in associations to buy their health \ninsurance and to provide these incentives for better health and better \naccess to health care. But, yet, we have consistently voted against \nallowing this to happen. Why will we not let that happen? Why will we \nnot let individuals deduct the cost of their health insurance, like we \ndo employers? It is almost as though we do not want individuals to have \nhealth insurance. Then we throw up our hands and talk about how many \npeople are uninsured in our country.\n  Health insurance would work much better if it were portable. We could \nchange some of our laws and regulations to make it much easier for \npeople who have insurance with one company to take it with them when \nthey leave to go to another company or to start their own business. Yet \nwe refuse to do those things that would allow the market to work.\n  Right now in this country, individuals can only buy health care or \nhealth insurance from companies that are in their State, that are \ncertified in their State. Why not let people buy health insurance from \nany State in the country as we do with other services? Why restrict it \nto a one-State monopoly, where regulations or mandates or other things \ncould shoot up the cost of health care? We could create a more \ncompetitive, higher quality health insurance market if we let it become \nnational market.\n  We do other things that seem absurd, such as we will allow a small \nemployer to put money in a health savings account for their employees \nbut we will not let that employee use the money in the health savings \naccount to pay for a health insurance premium. Why do we do that? If we \nwant people to have health insurance, to have the freedom to buy and \nown their own health insurance, we would do these simple things that \nput the patient more in charge. They would have better health care, \nbetter health insurance, and probably a lot better health.\n  What we are doing every day is sliding closer to a national or \nsocialized health care system, saying the system we have does not work \nwhen the fact is we have done about everything we can to make it \nimpossible for a free system to work. We do have serious problems and \nchallenges in our health care system but almost all of them are made \nworse by the people who work in this place everyday.\n  The question now is whether more Government will make those problems \nbetter or worse. I think to ask that question answers it on its face. \nWe know the free market did not create these problems because there is \nno free market for health care in the United States today. Government \ndominates the market. It does not pay its fair share. It regulates \neverything to the point where it makes it very difficult for the \nprivate market to work.\n  Let's not give up on freedom and go to socialism here in America \nbefore we have tried to fix the simple things that are obvious, in \nfront of us, the things that companies such as Safeway say we can do to \nprovide better insurance and make people healthier and lower their cost \nand give them plans they can keep.\n  No matter what the problem is in Washington, people here seem to \nthink the solution is more Government. But we do not need a new Federal \nprogram for health care. We need to remove the Federal barriers that \nkeep freedom from working in health care.\n  We have taken over banks, auto industry, mortgage lending, education, \ntransportation system. Look at the areas the Government is running \ntoday and ask yourself, do you want to run health care the way we have \nbeen running education in America; as we have been running the \nfinancial markets for the last few months; or how we are doing with the \nauto industry now that we have essentially taken it over?\n  Health care is the best in the world here in America because of that \nsmall segment of the private market, the free market, that is working--\nthe best pharmaceuticals, the best technology, the best private health \ncare.\n  Socialism does not work. There is not an example in the world where \nit does. We keep hearing here, why don't we be more like Europe or more \nlike Canada, where people have to wait 6 months or more to get an MRI. \nThe only reason theirs works as well as it does is they are the \nbeneficiary of a lot of American technology that is developed in the \nfree market system. They are the beneficiaries of a lot of the \nprescription drugs that come out of our country that are developed here \nbecause there is still a free market. This is a reason that the \ntechnology and the prescriptions are not being developed in other \ncountries that are socialistic. Freedom works and we need to expand it \nhere in America.\n  Let me talk briefly about this motion to instruct conferees. \nHopefully it\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\nwill not be controversial because it is essentially a promise from the \nPresident of the United States. My amendment would require a \nsupermajority vote to consider any legislation in the future that would \ntake away people's freedom to keep their own health plan or take away \npeople's freedom to choose their own doctor or decrease the number of \npeople with private insurance while increasing the number of people in \nGovernment-rationed health care programs. All my amendment says is give \nfreedom a chance. The American people have not given up on freedom and \nneither should their elected officials.\n  I thank the ranking member, I thank the Presiding Officer, and ask \nfor the consideration of my motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. For the information of our colleagues, we have three more \nspeakers on our side who will take 10 minutes each, offering motions to \ninstruct. There may be other speakers but I do not know of them. I hope \nwe can sort of start voting here, depending on what the chairman \ndesires to do, at some point in the near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would be eager to do that. I think what \nwe need to do is have other Members come and offer their motions to \ninstruct and see what time is needed in terms of rebuttal on that. It \nwould be our intention to--if you have three more on your side, 10 \nminutes each, so we will probably need 30 minutes on the other side. I \ndon't want to lock this in at the moment because I have not talked to \nleadership and I do not know if there are other considerations, but the \nintention would be to begin voting about 7 o'clock. Perhaps we can move \nthat up. Perhaps I will not need all of that time. Hopefully not.\n  Mr. GREGG. We may not need all of the time on our side either.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We need to check with the leadership to see when votes \ncan start, but it would be our intention, perhaps in the 6:45 to 7 \no'clock timeframe, to begin voting, perhaps even a little bit before \nthat. We will have to check with the leadership.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send a motion to instruct to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the concurrent \n     resolution S. Con. Res. 13 (the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2010) be instructed to insist that the \n     final conference report limit the increase in the public debt \n     for the period of 2009 through 2019 to an amount no greater \n     than the amount of public debt accumulated from 1789 to \n     January 20, 2009.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as we have discussed earlier at some \nlength, there are three essential problems with the President's budget. \nThe first is that it spends too much, the second is it taxes too much, \nand the third is it creates too much debt. It is the third issue I \nthink many of us find to be the most severely distressing issue.\n  Of course, it is driven by the first two issues. But the idea that we \nare going to double the debt in 5 years, triple it in 10 years; we are \ngoing to have, on average, a $1 trillion deficit every year for the \nnext 10 years, and that we are going to build up the national debt to a \npoint where it is 80 percent of the gross national product, the public \ndebt is disturbing. It basically is on an unsustainable path. It means \nour Nation will be put at risk by that type of debt.\n  Now, the Congress is not doing a very good job of disciplining \nitself. This problem is driven primarily by spending. But the fact is, \nthe result of that spending is this explosion in debt.\n  As I have held up before this chart that shows the picture of the \nPresidents since the beginning of our Nation, President Washington \nthrough President George W. Bush, they generated this much debt on this \ncountry, $5.8 trillion.\n  President Obama's budget just in the first 4.5 years essentially is \ngoing to double that debt. All the debt added to the United States, to \nthe backs of American citizens since 1776, or actually 1789 when the \nGovernment started creating debt, over 200 years, all of that debt is \ndoubled now in just 5 years.\n  That is not tolerable. Then that debt, after doubling in 5 years, \ntriples in 10 years. Our children end up with this debt. Our children \nare the ones who have to pay for this. The people who will be working \nin America are the ones who are going to have to pay for this and bear \nthe burden of this debt. They are going to suffer either massive \ninflation, massive devaluation of the dollar, massive tax increases or \na dramatic disruption in our capacity to sell debt as a nation because \nof this.\n  The chairman of the committee has said this is an unsustainable path. \nYet nothing in this budget addresses the fact that this path is one we \nhave chosen to follow. It is akin to saying: We know we are going to go \noff a cliff. We are on a path that takes us off a cliff, but the budget \ndoes nothing to change the direction we are walking and, in fact, \naccelerates our pace toward that cliff.\n  That makes no sense at all to me. Why would we pass a budget which we \nknow will create so much debt and so much of a burden on our children \nthat our Government will not be able to be sustained and our children \nwill not be able to afford the Government.\n  It is counterintuitive to do something that is certainly not correct. \nOne generation has sort of a fiduciary responsibility to the next \ngeneration. In the history of our Nation, each generation has passed on \nto the next generation a better nation, a stronger nation, a more \nprosperous nation. Yet this budget locks in place a path that \nabsolutely guarantees, absolutely guarantees, that our generation will \npass onto our children a country that is not as prosperous, is not as \nstrong as what we received from our parents.\n  That is not right, not fair, inappropriate. It is a totally \ninappropriate thing to do. It can be corrected. It is not as if this is \nnot an uncorrectable event. There has been a decision made on the other \nside of the aisle and by the President in bringing forward this budget \nto significantly explode the size of the Government. That is a \nconscious decision that was made. The President is very forthright \nabout this. He thinks that is a way to create prosperity. It does not \nhappen if at the same time you are running up the national debt at \nrates which are unsustainable.\n  The debt, the public debt will double during the term of this \nbudget--double from 40 percent to 80 percent. We have the public debt \nso high under this budget, or the President and the Democratic Members \nof this Senate and the House have it so high under this budget that if \nwe tried to apply it to the European Union as a country in Europe, for \nexample, we would be rejected because, under the terms of the European \nUnion, a country cannot have as high a debt as we are going to have \nafter this budget runs its course.\n  Actually, it is about the middle of the budget that we hit that \nthreshold. Can you believe that? Countries such as France are going to \nbe more fiscally responsible than we are. But that is the truth. That \nis the way this budget plays out. As I say, this is a path over a cliff \nfor our Nation.\n  I have offered this motion to instruct. I call it the 1789 motion \nbecause that is the date when we started running up debt in this \ncountry. In essence, it says this: We cannot pass a budget here in this \n5-, 10-year cycle that adds more debt to the backs of our children than \nthe total debt that was added to this country from 1789 through January \n20, 2009.\n  I think that is a fairly reasonable standard. We are going to say you \ncannot exceed the amount of debt that is being added by this budget--\nthat amount of debt cannot exceed the amount of debt that has been \nadded to this country since our beginning, 230-some-odd years.\n  We have to have some standard to live by. That seems like a \nreasonable one, that in 5 or 10 years we do not take the debt up so \nquickly and so horrifically that we actually exceed all the debt put on \nthe backs of the American people since the beginning of our Nation, \nfrom 1789 through January 20, 2009.\n  This standard, if it is passed, will be a standard that will be \nenforced under the budget. The effect of it will be that we will have \nto figure out some way to\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\nreduce debt or the rate of growth of debt under this budget. That is \nreasonable. If it is the desire of this administration to radically \nexpand the size of Government, as it appears to be the desire of this \nadministration to take spending in this Government up to astronomical \nlevels in the context of our historical spending at the Federal \nGovernment, to go from 20 percent of GDP up to 25, 26 percent of GDP, \nif that is the purpose of this administration, and it appears to be \ntheir purpose, it is their purpose, it is what they said they are going \nto do in this bill, in this budget, well, then they cannot do it by \npassing those bills on to the next generation and creating this massive \ndebt.\n  They have to come up with some other way to do it. My suggestion \nwould be that they do not spend that much money. That would be the \nsuggestion from our side of the aisle. But maybe from the other side of \nthe aisle is that they raise taxes radically on all working Americans, \nwhich they do anyway in this bill, but they would have to raise money \nin any event. We should not put the burden on our children by creating \nall this additional debt.\n  This is a simply fairly reasonable test as to how much debt this \nbudget should be able to run up on our people. It should be less debt \nin 5 years than has been run up on the American people in over 200 \nyears.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmotion be set aside, and I send to the desk another motion for which I \nask its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] moves that the managers \n     on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the concurrent \n     resolution S. Con. Res. 13 (the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2010) be instructed to insist on the \n     inclusion in the final conference report of the point of \n     order against legislation that raises Federal income tax \n     rates on small businesses as contained in section 307 of the \n     concurrent resolution, as passed by the Senate.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my motion instructs Senate conferees to \ninclude section 307, which is included in the Senate-passed budget \nresolution, in the final conference report. As the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee knows, this creates a 60-vote point of \norder against any legislation that raises income taxes on small \nbusinesses. The Senate, in a bipartisan vote of 82 to 16--a rarity \nthese days, when we see that kind of overwhelming bipartisan support on \nanything--approved this point of order which I offered as an amendment \nto the budget. The Senate voted so overwhelmingly for this amendment--\nand I suggest it would be appropriate to vote for this motion to \ninstruct in at least the same numbers--because the Senate should not \npass a budget that increases income taxes on small businesses in Texas \nor Alaska or anywhere else, especially during a time when the economy \nis struggling and when our No. 1 priority is to help employers retain \nemployment for their current employees and, hopefully, at some point \nbegin to increase the number of jobs available to Americans.\n  Almost 400,000 businesses in Texas that employ around 4 million \npeople would be especially hit by a failure to pass this motion to \ninstruct and by any increase in income taxes on small businesses. For \nexample, earlier when I spoke on the budget resolution, I mentioned Don \nThedford, a small businessman in Tyler, in east Texas, and how he told \nme he has been able to grow his small business in part because of the \ntax relief we provided in 2001 and 2003. It is common sense and \ncertainly intuitive that taxes can have an impact on the ability of a \nbusiness to expand or, when taxes are unnecessarily high, cause it to \ncontract.\n  Another businessman in east Texas, Cory Miller from Winnesboro, tells \na similar story. Through one business that Cory has, he drills and \nservices water wells. Of course, in the process, he gives families and \ncommunities access to fresh water. In his business, he manufactures a \ntype of pump he invented, one which he now sells to other well drillers \nand drilling rig manufacturers. He has been in this business for 25 \nyears and now employs 35 people. Cory, like Don, believes the tax \nrelief we passed in 2001 and 2003 created the kind of positive, \nprogrowth environment which allowed him to grow his business and that \nhigher taxes in the middle of a recession will force him to make tough \ndecisions and possibly lay off employees.\n  Higher taxes for people such as Don and Cory will mean they will not \nbe able to reinvest more money in their businesses to purchase \nequipment or to hire more people because they will have to pay Uncle \nSam higher taxes instead. As Cory put it:\n\n       Every dollar taken from an aggressive, growth-oriented \n     small businessman like myself is a dollar that will not be \n     used to expand my business or hire new employees.\n\n  We all know if small businesses are hit by higher taxes such as those \nproposed in the administration's budget, it will cause them to \ncontract. We also know that small businesses are the vehicle that has \nproduced most of the new jobs over the last decade. Given that \nPresident Obama and his administration have said their primary \nobjective in dealing with the economy is job creation and retention, I \ndon't understand why they would propose in their budget to increase \ntaxes on the engine of job creation known as small business.\n  The Senate made its voice clear when a bipartisan majority supported \nmy point of order as an amendment to the budget in the Senate. I ask my \ncolleagues once again to reaffirm their support in the same bipartisan \nfashion by joining with me in supporting this motion to instruct \nconferees not to raise taxes on small businesses, the primary job \nengine in the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are going to start voting shortly. I ask \nunanimous consent that the votes be in the order as listed in the \noriginal unanimous consent request under which we are functioning, \nwhich would be Senators Stabenow, Johanns, Gregg, Sessions, Ensign, \nCornyn, Alexander, Coburn, DeMint, and Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand from the chairman--and certainly it is our \nsentiment--we can pretty much begin voting whenever anybody is ready.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am told by leadership staff we have a problem voting \nbefore 7 in terms of getting some Members here.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the time between now and 7 be \nequally divided between the two parties under the leadership of myself \nand Senator Conrad, and that should Senator Ensign be here, he has the \nlast motion to instruct which we need to discuss. So he gets 10 minutes \nfrom our side or such time as he may desire from our side that is still \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me observe that we have a chance to \nhandle a number of these motions by voice vote. There are a number of \nthem we could support, we could accept. Senator Gregg will be talking \nto those Members who have motions to instruct that we could accept. I \nask them to carefully consider that offer. We have stacked up 10 \npotential votes. We can do three votes an hour. That would be three \nhours of voting starting at 7. That would take us until 10 tonight. \nFrankly, as I count them, we have six of these motions that we could \naccept, shortening the time for voting by 2 hours. That would mean we \ncould be done by roughly 8. It is dependent on Senators being willing \nto take voice votes or being willing to have their motions accepted on \na unanimous consent basis.\n  I make that plea to Senators. We could do it the way that gets us \nfinished with our business in a reasonable way by 8 or we could go \nuntil 10.\n  The other thing I want to add is, this will not affect how these \nmotions do in conference. If somebody has that in\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\nmind, sometimes it does make a difference, but in this case it will \nnot.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Johanns and ask that it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the concurrent \n     resolution S. Con. Res. 13 (the current resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2010) be instructed to insist that if \n     the conference report includes a Deficit Neutral Reserve Fund \n     to Invest in Clean Energy and Preserve the Environment and \n     Climate Change Legislation similar to section 202 of S. Con. \n     Res. 13, as passed by the Senate, then that Deficit Neutral \n     Reserve Fund shall also include the language contained in \n     section 202(c) of S. Con. Res. 13, as passed by the Senate, \n     which provides that the Chairman of the Senate Budget \n     Committee may not revise allocations for legislation if that \n     legislation is reported from any committee pursuant to \n     section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I send a motion to the desk on behalf of Senator Ensign \nand ask that it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the concurrent \n     resolution S. Con. Res. 13 (the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2010) be instructed to insist that the \n     conference report on the concurrent resolution include the \n     point of order against legislation that raises taxes directly \n     or indirectly on middle-income taxpayers (single individuals \n     with $200,000 or less in adjusted gross income or married \n     couples filing jointly with $250,000 or less in adjusted \n     gross income) as contained in section 306 of the concurrent \n     resolution as passed by the Senate.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the motion \nof the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, that instructs the \nconferees to include some but not all of the limitations the Senate \nvoted for with respect to climate change legislation.\n  I think the Senate needs to understand that the effect of this motion \nwould be to instruct conferees on the issue of climate change without \nincluding the Senate's protection for consumers against higher gas and \nelectricity prices, which was adopted by the Senate by a vote of 89 to \n8 during the debate on the budget resolution. The Senate adopted \nseveral budget amendments to try to specify what the parameters should \nbe in the debate over climate change legislation.\n  One of those amendments that was adopted was one that was sponsored \nby me. That amendment specified that climate change legislation could \nnot increase electricity or gasoline prices. It was adopted by the \nSenate by a vote of 89 to 8.\n  What Senator Stabenow's motion would do if it were agreed to is it \nwould instruct that it would be the Senate's only specific instruction \non what should be included in the final budget on climate change \nlegislation, apart from the reconciliation limitations that would be \nincluded. So, in other words, other protections, such as those included \nby my amendment, could be excluded were the conferees to adhere to the \ninstructions in her motion.\n  The bottom line is, Senator Stabenow's motion to instruct would \nencourage conferees to drop the commonsense protections adopted by the \nSenate with a vote of 89 to 8 when it adopted my amendment to the \nbudget resolution.\n  Just, again, by way of background, I do not think there is anybody \nwho would argue the point that a cap-and-trade proposal is going to \nraise energy prices. This motion does nothing to include protection \nagainst those higher prices.\n  Under the President's cap-and-trade proposal that was contained in \nhis budget, it would impose what is a massive new energy tax on anyone \nwho drives a car or turns on a light switch.\n  In fact, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood has said the \nadministration is ``not for an increase in the gas tax as long as the \neconomy is bad, people are out of work, people don't have jobs. No one \nshould be promoting an increase in the gas tax.'' The cap-and-trade \nproposal the President has put forward would do just that. It would \nalso increase the cost of electricity prices.\n  Secretary of Energy Chu just testified recently:\n\n       I think especially now in today's economic climate it would \n     be completely unwise to want to increase the price of \n     gasoline.\n\n  The President and his Budget Director have been very clear that \nprices are going to go up on consumers, and they are going to feel the \npain, the economic pain associated with higher prices for electricity \nand gasoline.\n  The President himself acknowledged that when he was talking about a \ncap-and-trade proposal some time back. He acknowledged his plan would \nlead to higher electricity prices, and he said:\n\n       Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates \n     would necessarily skyrocket.\n\n  What happened during the debate on the budget is we adopted my \namendment, by a vote of 89 to 8, which specifically stated that any \ncap-and-trade climate change legislation could not increase electricity \nrates or gas prices for consumers in this country. The Stabenow motion \nto instruct, if adopted, would instruct the conferees in an opposite \ndirection. It would exclude that protection that was included in my \namendment to the budget resolution.\n  So I ask my colleagues in the Senate to defeat the Stabenow motion. \nThe Johanns motion, on the other hand, to instruct the conferees not to \nuse reconciliation to accomplish climate change legislation is a good \nmotion. I hope the Senate will vote to adopt it. That was also one that \nwas adopted by a fairly large margin when it was voted on during the \ndebate on the budget a couple weeks ago.\n  But let me restate as clearly as I can, if the Stabenow motion is \nadopted by the Senate today, it would instruct the conferees in a \nnumber of areas with regard to cap-and-trade legislation, many of which \nsound good: invest in clean energy technology initiatives, decrease \ngreenhouse gas emissions, create new jobs in a clean technology \neconomy, strengthen the manufacturing competitiveness of the United \nStates, and I could go on. There are nine of them that are stipulated \nhere. The one that is conspicuously and noticeably absent is the \nprotection against higher prices for consumers in the form of higher \ngasoline prices and higher electric rates.\n  So it was an amendment adopted by the Senate by a vote of 89 to 8. It \nwould be my view that the Senate should not go back on an overwhelming \nvote like that, which made it very clear that any climate change \nlegislation should not raise electricity and gasoline prices on \nAmerican consumers. The Stabenow motion, if adopted, would not include \nthat protection. I ask my colleagues to vote to defeat it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the advice of our colleagues, we are \nvery close to being able to begin voting. At roughly 7 o'clock, we will \nbegin. We have 10 motions pending, or we will have by that time. We are \nstill waiting for a signed copy of one motion that I will send up when \nthat is available. Again, we are asking colleagues--we have a number of \nthese we can take which would reduce the number of votes that would \nhave to be conducted. Senator Gregg is working diligently to talk to \ncolleagues to see if they are willing to take a voice vote or take an \nacceptance by unanimous consent, and we are still waiting for final \nanswers on all of those matters. So again, for the advice of our \ncolleagues, we are very close to the time when we can do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending motion to instruct \nso I may offer a motion to instruct on behalf of Senator Stabenow.\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the concurrent \n     resolution S.

Con. Res. 13, as passed \n     by the Senate) that would allow the Chairman of the Committee \n     on the Budget of the Senate to revise the allocations of 1 or \n     more committees, aggregates, and other appropriate levels and \n     limits in the resolution for 1 or more deficit-neutral bills, \n     joint resolutions, amendments, motions, or conference reports \n     that would--\n       (1) invest in clean energy technology initiatives;\n       (2) decrease greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (3) create new jobs in a clean technology economy;\n       (4) strengthen the manufacturing competitiveness of the \n     United States;\n       (5) diversify the domestic clean energy supply to increase \n     the energy security of the United States;\n       (6) protect consumers (including through policies that \n     address regional differences);\n       (7) provide incentives for cost-savings achieved through \n     energy efficiencies;\n       (8) provide voluntary opportunities for agriculture and \n     forestry communities to contribute to reducing the levels of \n     greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; and\n       (9) help families, workers, communities, and businesses \n     make the transition to a clean energy economy.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate was very close to \nreaching an agreement to complete action on the financial fraud \nmeasure. It is a bipartisan measure which is the result of significant \nbipartisan work of Senators Leahy, Grassley, and virtually every member \nof the Judiciary Committee. I thought we had an agreement, but we were \nnot able to do this, in spite of all of the good work of Senator Leahy. \nWe simply want to limit amendments to this bill. Everyone has had ample \nopportunity to offer amendments. I guess it would have been nice if we \nhad voted later last night, but I had a meeting at the White House. I \nhad to be at the meeting, and I left here about 5:15 and the meeting \nlasted until about 7:30.\n  We are going to file cloture tonight on this measure. Everyone should \nacknowledge that this means we are going to have a cloture vote \nSaturday morning around 11 a.m. There will be another vote on Sunday, \nif we are asked to use up all of this time. It is unfortunate, since \npeople had all the opportunity they had to offer amendments. No one has \ntried to stifle amendments on this or anything else this year. It is \nunfortunate, and that will mean there will be some amendments, well \nintentioned and good, that deal with the financial crisis facing this \ncountry that will fall, but we have had good debate the last few days \non this legislation.\n  I wish there were some other way to do this. I pulled out all the \nstops to try to talk to a number of Senators, and I apologize for not \nbeing able to work something out, but that is the way it is sometimes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the distinguished leader is doing \nall he can do in this case. I am surprised, as he said, since this bill \nhas had huge bipartisan support and bipartisan sponsorship. It is to \ntry to protect people from losing their retirement funds, their home, \ntheir savings for their children to go to college, from these mortgage \nfraud people. Everybody across the political spectrum has endorsed the \nbill.\n  We voted on every amendment to remain to the bill. There are about a \ndozen or more that have nothing to do with the bill. It is unfortunate \nfor the people who are seeing their life savings being ripped off by \nunscrupulous criminals, and that we cannot criminalize it in such a way \nas to stop it. So I will be here to vote. The irony is that when the \nbill finally gets to a vote, it will probably pass about 90 to 5.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Republican \nleader be allowed to make a statement prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the motions to instruct, I ask unanimous \nconsent that there be 2 minutes between each vote for debate equally \ndivided between Senators Gregg and Conrad or the sponsor of the motion. \nSenators Gregg and Conrad can determine who has the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that there be 10-minute votes after \nthe first vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on agreeing to the \nStabenow motion to instruct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Stabenow would like to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this amendment was included in the \nSenate budget resolution. It lays out clear, positive instructions for \nbalanced climate change legislation that allows agriculture and \nforestry to participate voluntarily. It focuses on jobs, protecting \nmanufacturing, protecting consumers, and it lays out a positive \napproach rather than just saying no to reconciliation, which is a \npolicy I agree with. We need to have a positive, balanced approach, and \nthis motion does that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Stabenow motion \nto instruct. She is correct that it imposes limitations on climate \nchange legislation as adopted during the budget resolution, with one \nvery important deletion, and that is one that consumers care about the \nmost, which prevents consumers from having to pay higher gasoline \nprices and electricity rates.\n  If the Senate adopts this motion, it will undermine an amendment I \noffered to the Senate budget resolution, which passed 89 to 8 in the \nSenate, which prevents consumers from having to deal with higher gas \nand electricity rates as a result of climate change legislation. That \nis an important protection. It is something the conferees need to keep \nin the budget resolution.\n  I hope the Senate will vote to defeat the Stabenow motion to instruct \nbecause it does undermine what we did in the budget resolution with \nrespect to the protections afforded to consumers when it comes to \nhigher gas and electricity prices. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller), and the \nSenator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Roberts) and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Members of the Senate, I rise this \nevening for the express purpose of asking for your support for a motion \nthat is very straightforward. We have already voted on this in an \namendment I submitted during the budget process.\n  The motion basically says that we will not use the reconciliation \nprocess to pass cap-and-trade legislation. The last time this issue was \nbefore this body, we had 67 Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, \nwho spoke very loudly and clearly opposing budget reconciliation to \npass cap-and-trade legislation. I ask that we do that again. I ask that \nwe do that again to indicate very clearly that we do not want to use \nthe reconciliation process for cap-and-trade.\n  I conclude my remarks by saying thank you for your thoughtful \napproach to this, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to point out to colleagues that \nthere is no reconciliation instruction on the budget resolution that we \nare sending to conference from the Senate. In the House, the Speaker \nand the rest of the leadership has indicated there is no intention and \nno provision for reconciliation to be used for cap and trade or for \nclimate change.\n  With that, we are prepared to vote.\n  Mr. President, we have an agreement on 10-minute votes for all \nremaining votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to the Gregg motion to instruct. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this motion is fairly simple but very \nimportant. Since our country began in 1789, we have been adding debt to \nthe American people. All this says is that all the debt that has been \nrun up, from 1789 to 2009, through January 20, 2009, that that total \ndebt should not be exceeded during the term of this budget. It seems \nlike a fairly reasonable request. If we do not follow it, we are going \nto end up passing on a debt to our children that they cannot support. I \nhope people will support this limitation on the addition of debt to our \nNation and to our children.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire has \noffered an amendment to the conference report that we not double the \ndebt from the time President Obama took office through the end of 2019. \nOur budget does not go through 2019. It would not double the debt \nthrough 2014. The debt when President Obama took office was about $10 \ntrillion. So this amendment is not necessary. I urge a no vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, with my additional time, I would simply \nnote if that is the position the majority takes, then everybody should \nvote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this motion would instruct that the \nbudget be altered so that there would be level funding for 2 years \nduring the time that we are now spending an additional $800 billion in \nthe economy as part of the stimulus package.\n  We ought to be able to keep the baseline budget level for 2 years, \nand then finish out the 5-year budget at 1 percent growth. We have \ndoubled the national debt through this budget--we will do so in 5 \nyears--and triple it in 10.\n  Interest on the debt today is $170 billion over the President's 10-\nyear budget. At the 10th year, it would be $800 billion in interest \nalone, dwarfing our education budget of $100 billion, dwarfing the \nhighway budget of $140 billion.\n  This is the right approach to show some discipline on the baseline \nbudget at a time we are surging the discretionary spending through the \nstimulus package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment that is before us will \nfreeze spending, nondefense and nonveterans funding, for 2 years and \nlimit the growth of nondefense and nonveterans funding to 1 percent \nannually for fiscal 2012, 2013, and 2014.\n  Now, I would remind all of us, we are in an economic crisis in this \ncountry. The investments we make in this budget that is before us are \nimportant for education, for health care, for energy, and for the other \npriorities that on which this country has asked us to move forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion before us so that we \ncan have the flexibility to deal with these critical issues before us \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \nthe Ensign motion.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this is my motion that says let's not \nraise taxes, whether they are direct or indirect taxes, on anybody \nmaking less than $250,000. It was agreed to unanimously when the \namendment was considered by the full Senate, 98 to 0. Unfortunately, it \nwas said that it would be stripped out. We went through a whole \nparliamentary mess to understand that this amendment would not bring \nthe bill down. I am hoping the managers who take this bill to \nconference keep this amendment in conference, so we don't raise the \ntaxes on any family making less than $250,000 a year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada is correct. This \namendment passed on the budget 98 to nothing. The Democrats are happy \nto support it. It is 8:25 at night. I suggest we take it on a voice \nvote.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to the Cornyn motion to instruct.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my motion instructs conferees to retain my \namendment, which passed by a strong bipartisan majority of 82 Senators \nwho voted in favor, which says don't raise taxes on small businesses. \nWe all know that is the principal job creator in the economy. It passed \n82 to 16. My hope is we have a similar if not better vote on this \nmotion to instruct.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we need order because Senator Alexander is \nnext, and if he would be so gracious as to accept a voice vote on his \nmotion, we would take his motion. It is a good motion. We support it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, thank you very \nmuch. I accept that.\n  All the motion does is instruct the conferees to do what the Senate \nhas already unanimously agreed to do to preserve the competitive \nstudent loan system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the motion, \nthe question is on agreeing to the Alexander motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to the Coburn motion to instruct.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. This is fulfilling a \ncampaign promise of Barack Obama. He said he wanted us to go through \nthe budget line by line to eliminate wasteful programs, eliminate \nduplicative programs. We accepted this earlier. This is a vote to say \nwe are going to do that. We are going to hold up our end of the \nbargain, as the President is going to hold up his end of the bargain, \nand we are going to go through and find some of this $300 billion worth \nof waste.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, would the Senator accept a voice vote on \nhis motion because we would be prepared to support him?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will accept a voice vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is very gracious.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the motion, \nthe question is on agreeing to the Coburn motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to make a note for the record there \nwas no ``no'' voiced on the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me indicate, because of the good \nnature and the graciousness of the Senator, this is an amendment that \nwe will try to preserve in conference.\n\n\n                                byrd rule\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from North Dakota, is it \ntrue that when a reconciliation bill comes to the floor, it must meet \nthe requirements of the Byrd rule or be subject to a 60-vote point of \norder?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it true that a provision in a reconciliation bill is \nsubject to a Byrd rule point of order if it produces a change in \noutlays or revenues that is merely incidental to the non-budgetary, \ni.e., policy, components of a provision?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes\n  Mr. Levin. Is it true that every provision of a reconciliation bill \nis subject to the Byrd rule; and any provision that does not meet all \nof the requirements of that rule, would be subject to a 60-vote point \nof order?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to the DeMint motion to instruct.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator DeMint is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, my motion simply codifies some promises \nduring the last campaign focusing on health care as part of this \nbudget. My motion would create a 60-vote point of order for any \nlegislation that takes away a person's right to pick their own doctor, \nto choose their own plan, or to keep the health plan they already have. \nThese are promises the President made, that no health care reform would \ntake away those rights, and my motion is to insist that the budget \nconference report include that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I support this amendment. I think it is \nentirely reasonable in what it outlines. We all want patients to be \nable to choose their doctors. We want to make certain if people are \nhappy with the health care plan they are in, that they are able to stay \nin that plan.\n  I would ask the Senator from South Carolina, would he consider \naccepting a voice vote--a strong voice vote--in favor of his amendment?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the offer very much, but \nknowing that the chairman probably doesn't see my nature as good as \nSenator Coburn's, I suspect it might not stay in, in conference. I \nwould like a rollcall vote, but I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nvery much for his offer.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would note for the Record that the \nSenator from South Carolina is smiling.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to the \nVitter motion to instruct.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in our original Senate debate on the \nbudget, we passed by unanimous consent language that is in section \n202(a) that we would not raise taxes on domestic energy production.\n  That language says that our budget legislation ``would not increase \nthe cost of producing energy from domestic sources, including oil and \ngas from the Outer Continental Shelf or other areas; it would not \nincrease the cost of energy for American families; it would not \nincrease the cost of energy for domestic manufacturers, farmers, \nfishermen or other domestic industries; and it would\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\nnot enhance foreign competitiveness against U.S. businesses.''\n  This motion to instruct would say we need to keep that mandate in the \nfinal version of the budget. This is important because, unfortunately, \nthe President has proposed tax increases in all those areas, and all \nthose significant increases in domestic energy production are part of \nhis budget proposal.\n  It would be tremendously wrongheaded and would hurt Americans to \nincrease taxes on energy, particularly now in the midst of a deep \nrecession. I ask all my colleagues to support this motion to instruct, \nand I respectfully ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been conferring off and on during the \nday with my distinguished Republican counterpart. I think this is where \nwe are.\n  Monday, at about 5:30, we will have a vote on cloture on the \nunderlying financial fraud legislation. We will determine what time \nTuesday morning we will vote on final passage of that bill, if cloture \nis invoked. Again, we will vote Monday night at about 5:30 on cloture, \nand sometime Tuesday morning we will vote on final passage.\n  At this stage, we have a tentative agreement to have 6 to 8 hours of \ndebate on Sebelius, and we would have passage of that by a 60-vote \nmargin on her sometime late Tuesday.\n  Following that, we are trying to work something out on Mr. \nStrickland, who is one of the secretaries for Ken Salazar. I talked to \nSenator Bunning. We are trying to get him some information to which he \nis entitled. If we can get that information, we will get that done very \nquickly. If we cannot, then Senator Bunning has agreed to a reasonable \nperiod of time--and Senator McConnell and I will determine what that \nis--to have a debate and a 60-vote margin on his approval.\n  Hopefully, if the conference is completed on the budget, we would go \nto that sometime Wednesday, with a statutory 10 hours on it.\n  That is where we are. It has been a difficult time. I am sorry to \nhave everyone concerned about the Saturday cloture vote, but that is \nhow things work.\n  I say to my friend Dr. Coburn, he is a thorn in my side, but he is a \nreal gentleman, as I have said before. I think this is going to work \nout very well for everybody. We all have a lot of things already \nscheduled the next few days. Having the Saturday vote would do a lot of \ndamage to a lot of plans--these are not vacation plans, but whatever \nplans people have in their home States. I hope that answers everybody's \nquestions.\n  I have not said this often enough. I remind everyone that all the \npress is interested in is seeing Senator McConnell and me jostle.

Mr. President, we talk a lot around here about being a \nfamily, and we are. There are people we learn to like a lot. A lot of \ntimes we see these people just passing through as they are doing their \njobs.\n  One of the people I have known since I have come to the Senate is a \nman by the name of Steve Mosley. If I had a picture of Steve Mosley, \neveryone would recognize him. He is a big man, always smiling. He was \nsomeone who came to my office quite often for different things he was \nassigned to do. I had a number of conversations with him.\n  He loved sports activities. He was a season ticket holder for the \nWashington Wizards. He never missed a home game. He loved the Redskins \nand hated the Dallas Cowboys. He was certainly willing to say that at \nany time.\n  Steve has been a member of the Sergeant at Arms team and family. For \n32 years he has been with Capitol Facilities, ensuring the service \nneeds of the Capitol were met. It was bringing wood to an office, it \nwas doing some work that needed to be done because someone had messed \nup an office, moving furniture--whatever it was, he was available.\n  He was a native Washingtonian, married to his wife Michelle for 26 \nyears. Steve had one child, a son, Steven, Jr. He is 25 years old. His \nson Steven, Jr. and his wife Michelle of course were both stunned when \nSteve died. He was only 52 years old. He was born on April 12.\n  As I said, he loved the Redskins; was a season ticket holder. Also, \nhe loved Cadillacs and he had two of them.\n  I think one of the most important things to remember about Steve is \nthat he cared deeply about people. He was always the first to help, \nwhether it was an Easter basket for one of the people who worked here \nwho was in need of a little extra, or, for people who needed a ride, \nhis Cadillac was always available to take them wherever they needed to \ngo.\n  He died way too soon and we, as a Senate, certainly are not as good \nas we were before Steve died. He was loved by all of his coworkers at \nCapitol Facilities in the Capitol. I will miss him. We all will miss \nhim. I want the Record to be spread with the knowledge to his family \nthat we cared about Steve as he cared about us.\n  Our thoughts go with his family, that they will be able to work \nthrough this time of bereavement as we look toward a brighter day.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to note the sad and sudden \npassing of a very familiar face to me and to many others around the \nCapitol.\n  Steve Mosley had been a fixture on the Capitol Facilities staff for \n32 years when he passed away last night--and those of us who knew him \nwill miss his great disposition and all that he did for so many years \nbehind the scenes to keep this place running smoothly.\n  It has been noted that Steve was a pretty serious Redskins fan. That \nis an understatement. People who knew him say they can't remember him \never missing a single home game, rain or shine. And he liked to share \nhis enthusiasm for the Skins with colleagues, particularly the Cowboy \nfans.\n  But Steve's friends also remember him for his generosity.\n  Like the time he offered to help set up the wedding reception of one \nof his colleagues so the colleague would be able to go out and enjoy \nhis bachelor party. Steve never made it to the bachelor party himself. \nHe spent the night making sure everything was ready for the reception.\n  One colleague recalled the time he wanted to get a limousine for his \ndaughter on prom night but couldn't afford to spend the money. He told \nSteve about it at work one day, and the night of the prom, Steve showed \nup at the house in a black Mercedes Benz that he had washed and waxed \nfor the occasion. Not only could the daughter use Steve's car for the \nprom--she could have him as a chauffeur too. A couple years later, \nSteve did the same thing for the girl's younger brother.\n  A lot of us have been here a long time, but few of us have been here \nas long as Steve was. He loved his job. He took a lot of pride in doing \nit well. And anytime someone new came on board, they knew they could \nlearn the ropes, and a lot more, from Steve Mosley.\n  Senator Reid mentioned earlier that the Senate is really a family. \nAnd whenever we lose somebody in the Senate, whichever office they are \nfrom or duty they perform, we lose a member of the family. And with \nSteve it is like we are losing one of the elders in that family. He \ntakes a lifetime of proud and service with him and he leaves a \ndistinguished legacy and many friends behind.\n  So on behalf of the entire Senate, I want to extend our condolences \nto Steve's wife, Michelle, and to their son, Steven, Jr, for their \nloss. And I want to take this opportunity to express my deep \nappreciation and my thanks to our friend Steve for his many years of \ndevoted service.\n  We'll miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4658-4", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4658-S4660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CHINA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am chairman of the Congressional-\nExecutive Commission on China, and I want to say a few words about \nChina and a very courageous man in China who we believe now is in a \nChinese prison and likely being tortured. I think it is very important \nfor our country to speak out about this issue.\n  Let me say first, there are many thoughtful and independent people in \nChina today who understand the importance of fundamental rights and the \nrole of strong and independent legal institutions. A few of these \npeople work for the Chinese Government. Many work at universities or \nwith U.S. companies and law firms. They care about the rule of law. \nSome of have cooperated with US agencies to increase food\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\nsafety and improve security for coal miners, and others. Those are the \nfolks in China who get it.\n  There are also independent men and women in China who take a \ndifferent approach. They apply what they know about the rule of law and \nthe role of fundamental rights in very much the same way. Except that \nthey choose to sound the alarm when the rights of vulnerable people are \nviolated. And in so doing, they go to great lengths and place \nthemselves at enormous personal risk. They defend the interests of \nconsumers whose children are poisoned by powdered milk. They help the \nfamilies of earthquake victims. They seek to represent the rights of \nillegally detained Tibetan monks. They stand up for their country and \nits people. By doing this, they are claimed to be enemies of the state. \nSo who are the enemies of the state?\n  I want to tell you about one man today, a man who is very courageous, \na man named Gao Zhisheng. His wife is visiting Washington, DC, today. I \nwant to tell you about him because it is so important for me to do so.\n  This is a photograph of this courageous lawyer from China: Gao \nZhisheng, with his son, his wife, and his daughter. He disappeared 80 \ndays ago and has not been heard from since. We know 2 years ago he was \narrested by the Chinese secret police and put in prison and tortured--\ntortured with electric shock and other devices I will not describe.\n  What was his transgression then? He wrote an open letter to the U.S. \nCongress asking us to pay some attention to the lack of human rights \nthat existed in China. For writing an open letter to Members of the \nU.S. Congress, in 2007, Gao Zhisheng, one of the most noted and \ndistinguished human rights lawyers in China, was imprisoned for over 50 \ndays and brutally tortured.\n  Now, in 2009, he taken from his bed by 10 members of the secret \npolice, and has not been heard from since. Let me tell you what has \ntranspired.\n  Mr. Gao Zhisheng has represented some of the most vulnerable people \nin China. They include persecuted Christians, exploited coal miners, \nbanned Falun Gong practioners, and so many others. He has always \nbelieved in the power of law, using the law to battle corruption, to \noverturn illegal property seizures, to expose police abuses, to defend \nreligious freedom. He is a devout Christian. He has fought to protect \nthose who engage in peaceful spiritual and religious practice in China.\n  In 2005, the government took away his license to practice law, closed \nhis law practice. As I said, in 2007, they arrested him, threw him in \nprison, and tortured him. Eventually, he was released and brought back \nhome and placed under house arrest. The police surveillance proved \nalmost harsher than prison. In fact, authorities monitored the family's \nevery movement, stationed an officer in the family's living room, \nprevented his daughter from going to school, a kind of collective \npunishment. His 16-year-old daughter was barred from attending school. \nThere was 24-hour surveillance of this traumatized family.\n  The treatment for that family in recent months was so brutal they \ndecided their survival depended on escaping China. But Gao was too \nclosely monitored and could not think of leaving them without placing \nhis family at even greater risk.\n  So in January, Gao's wife, 6-year-old son, and 16-year-old daughter \nwere smuggled out of China. They then traveled to the United States. \nAfter his family fled China, security agents seized Gao from his bed \nand he has not been seen or heard from since.\n  We know this situation is extremely grave because we know what the \nChinese have done to him in their prison system previously. They have \nnot offered the slightest word about his whereabouts, despite repeated \nrequests from United Nations agencies, the US government, foreign \ngovernments, NGOs, and the media. All have asked for information about \nthe whereabouts of this courageous human rights lawyer, and the Chinese \nGovernment has said nothing.\n  The Chinese Government has signed or ratified many international \nhuman rights commitments about Mr. Gao Zhisheng that require it to come \nclean about Mr. Gao. I call on, and we call on, today, the Chinese \nGovernment to allow Mr. Gao to have access to a lawyer, access to his \nfamily, and for the government to publicly state and justify the \ngrounds for the continued detention of this courageous person.\n  The right to speak freely and the right to challenge the Government--\nall of these are enshrined in the Chinese Constitution. Yet it appears \nthe Chinese Government and the Communist Party that runs that \nGovernment is intent on upholding the violation of these basic \nconstitutional rights in the case of Mr. Gao.\n  As I indicated, I am chairman of the Congressional-Executive \nCommission on China. We have the largest and the most significant \npublicly accessible repository of political prisoners in China. We have \nthe largest, publicly accessible data base of information about many \nthousands of Chinese political prisoners.\n  There are many people today who languish in dark cells--dark cells--\nof Chinese prisons because they spoke out to defend the rights of \nothers. None has done so more than Mr. Gao, who is a noted and \ncelebrated human rights lawyer, who has lost his law office, lost his \nlegal license, been imprisoned multiple times, has now been \n``disappeared'' into the prison system, was tortured before, and we \nexpect has been tortured again. We need to put a stop to it.\n  We need to find a way to convince the Chinese Government to tell us \nwhat has happened to Mr. Gao. What have they done with him? How do they \njustify it? And when, when, when will they tell us they will release \nthis man to be with his family and begin to accord people like Mr. Gao \nand others, who stand up for the rights of others, the same human \nrights we would expect them to be given?\n  China will be a significant part of our future. I understand that. My \nplea today is to the Government of China to do the right thing with \nrespect to this courageous and brave man.\n  As I indicated, his wife, Geng He, is with us today here in \nWashington, DC. I am not permitted to point her out in the Senate \ngalleries. But she, too, is a very courageous woman, and she wishes \nvery much to have this courageous man, her husband, released from \ndetention in China and be given his freedom.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I wish to thank my colleague from North Dakota. This is a \nvery valuable contribution my colleague has made. It may only be one \nindividual, one family, but I think when we speak up on behalf of an \nindividual such as Mr. Gao, we do so for a lot of other people across \nthe globe who face the same kinds of restrictions he is going through. \nI wish to join with him in expressing our concern.\n  I urge my colleagues to maybe craft a letter of some kind we might be \nable to send to the Ambassador here in Washington or to the appropriate \ngovernmental personalities or agencies in China to express our \ncollective concern about this. I am the second-ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and I have a deep interest in what he is \ntalking about.\n  I thank him immensely for taking a few minutes this afternoon to \naddress this issue. As the Senator points out, we are not allowed to \nrecognize people who are in the Chamber, but let it be said that there \nis an individual who is with us during these remarks who is the wife of \nthis individual. We thank her for her courage, her family's courage, \nand we will do everything we can to support the efforts of our \ncolleague from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Utah will be \nrecognized. I wish to say that earlier this week and later today I will \nbe here to talk about Roxana Saberi, who is imprisoned in Iran. She is \na constituent of mine. I have great concern about these circumstances \nin Iran and China and elsewhere, as all of us do. My thoughts and \nprayers are with Roxana and her family. Similarly, my thoughts and \nprayers are with the family of Mr. Gao.\n  I am happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am indebted to the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota for his remarks today, and I certainly join with him \nin\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nrequesting the Chinese Government to make this matter right. I am very \ngrateful he has taken the time to come and tell us about Mr. Gao as \nwell as this wonderful woman who is being held in Iran. I wish to \ncompliment him for it and say that I wish to be identified with his \nremarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4660-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4660-S4661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of SSG Gary Lee Woods, Jr., from Shepherdsville, KY. Gary was 24 \nyears old when he lost his life on April 10, 2009, from injuries \nsustained from a truck bomb that detonated near his vehicle in Mosul, \nIraq. He was a member of the 1st Battalion, 67th Armor Regiment, 4th \nInfantry Division of Fort Carson, CO.\n  Today, I join Gary's family and friends in mourning his death. Gary, \nwho was known to family and friends by his middle name, Lee, will \nforever be remembered as a loving husband, son, and friend to many. He \nis survived by his devoted wife, Christie; his father and stepmother \nGary and Debbie Woods; his mother and stepfather Becky and Pat Johnson; \nsisters Britteny and Heather Woods and Mandy Maraman; brothers Courtney \nand Troy Woods and Newman and Corey Johnson; grandparents Marilyn \nWaters and Nancy and Charlie Ratliff; in-laws Rick and Elaine Houston; \nand a host of other friends and relatives.\n  Gary, a member of the JROTC at Bullitt Central High School, joined \nthe Army following his graduation from high school. A gifted musician, \nGary sang and played the trombone, drums, piano and guitar. He was also \nan accomplished athlete and a member of Bullitt's football team.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Gary set as a soldier. Today and always, he will \nbe remembered by family and friends as a true American hero, and we \ncherish the legacy of his service and his life.\n  As I search for words to do justice to this valiant fallen soldier, I \nrecall President Abraham Lincoln's words as he addressed the families \nof soldiers who died at Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas we can take some measure of solace in\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\nknowing that Gary's heroism and memory will outlive the record of the \nwords here spoken.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Gary Lee Woods, Jr. in the \nRecord of the Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. I pray that Gary's \nfamily can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Gary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4661-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WILDFIRE IN NORTH MYRTLE BEACH, SC\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, our hearts go out to the people of North \nMyrtle Beach, SC, today. As you may know, North Myrtle Beach \nfirefighters, along with firefighters from around South Carolina, are \nbattling the worst wildfire to hit that area since 1976.\n  While the cause of the fire is unknown at this point, high winds have \nfanned the flames resulting in a total damage of nearly 15,000 acres--\n23 square miles. My understanding is that officials on the scene \nestimate that the wildfire is about 75 to 80 percent contained at this \npoint which is good news. Ninety firefighters from eight different \ndepartments from across South Carolina are currently battling this \nblaze.\n  It is at times like these when you really appreciate the hard work \nthat our firefighters do on our behalf. You also appreciate the \ndangers. I understand that last night, two of our South Carolina \nfirefighters had to deploy their emergency fire shelters when they \nbecame surrounded by flames. Both, I am told, are unhurt.\n  At this point, no injuries or fatalities have been reported and we \nshould be very thankful for that. However, many have lost their homes. \nSeventy homes have been destroyed with another 29 severely damaged. I \nexpect that that number, unfortunately, will likely go up. Anyone who \nhas ever lost a home to a fire understands the sense of terrible loss--\nthe loss of the house they grew up in and the loss of irreplaceable \nfamily heirlooms.\n  I want to thank North Myrtle Beach Mayor Marilyn Hatley, the \nGovernor, his emergency management team, the Forestry Commission, the \nState Fire Marshall, the State national guard, the officials of Horry \nCounty, the South Carolina Red Cross, and the others who are pitching \nin right now to put out this fire. My understanding is that the Red \nCross has shelters open in North Myrtle Beach and is housing several \nhundred people tonight.\n  I want to applaud our firefighters for always standing ready to \nanswer the call to action. I pray that they accomplish their mission \nsoon and come home safely to their families. And I pray for the \nfamilies who have suffered devastating losses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4661-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4661-S4663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       STATE OF THE INDIAN NATION\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, Montana has a long history with its first \ncitizens, the Native American Indian people that comprise my State's \neight tribes. Montana's history with our tribes, like those at the \nFederal level, has fluctuated greatly over the years. At first \ntreatment was shameful, characterized by war and violence. After the \nwars, the Federal Government engaged in neglect, by placing Indians on \nremote reservations and trying to forget about them. At long last, we \nhave moved to the more progressive and enlightened policy of today--\nself-determination. This shift has been a long time in coming, but it \nis critical. Under this new policy, we appreciate tribes as sovereign \nunits of government and work with them in that capacity to become self-\nsufficient through self-determination.\n  One of the good things Montana does on a biennial basis is ask an \nelected tribal chairman to address a joint session of the Montana \nLegislature and present a State of the Indian Nations speech. On March \n10, 2009, James Steele, Jr., who is both chairman of the Confederated \nSalish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation and, the \nrecently elected Chairman of the Montana-Wyoming Tribal Leaders \nCouncil, addressed my former colleagues in the legislature. I found his \nspeech to be a thoughtful call for cooperation in addressing the \ncurrent economic problems we face. It was also a fascinating \ndescription of the history of State/tribal relations. I think my \ncolleagues in Congress will appreciate, and learn from it. I therefore \nask unanimous consent to have Chairman Steele's speech printed in \ntoday's Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed n the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Good afternoon.\n       Thank you House Speaker Bob Bergren.\n       Thank you Senate President Robert Story.\n       Thank you also to Margarett Campbell, a Fort Peck Tribal \n     member and the first Indian House Majority Floor Leader.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to speak in this \n     distinguished chamber and for the opportunity to speak to the \n     leaders of Montana, who have gathered here for this State of \n     the Tribal Nations address.\n       I also thank the Montana National Guard that presented the \n     colors. You have served our Nation well in putting yourself \n     in harms way and you continue to serve through your community \n     service. As United States Senators John McCain and Dan \n     Inouye--themselves both war heroes have often pointed out--\n     American Indians have a proud tradition of serving in the \n     military in the highest percentage of any ethnic group in the \n     United States. We ask our Creator for Godspeed for all \n     Americans that serve this great country in places far away \n     and pray for their families who also make tremendous \n     sacrifices for the freedoms we have.\n       May I ask Bruce Sun Child from the Chippewa Cree Tribe to \n     lead us in a prayer.\n       (Sun Child speaks in the Cree language.)\n       Thank you Bruce for your words of prayer.\n       I am pleased to introduce the Tribal Government leaders \n     that have joined us today.\n       (Identifies tribal leaders by name)\n       Tribal leaders, I am honored to represent you today, as \n     Chairman of the Montana-Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council and as \n     Chairman of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes.\n       Honorable Governor Brian Schweitzer and Lieutenant Governor \n     John Bohlinger, thank you. Throughout your administration, \n     you have opened the front doors of the Capitol to the Tribes \n     and we have walked through those doors many times. We look \n     forward to continuing our government-to-government \n     relationship throughout the next four years.\n       I thank the distinguished members of the Senate and House \n     of Representatives and in particular, the American Indian \n     legislators of Montana:\n       Representative Shannon Augare, House Majority Whip\n       Representative Tony Belcourt\n       Representative, Frosty Calf Boss Ribs\n       Representative Carolyn Pease-Lopez\n       Representative David Roundstone\n       Senator Carol Juneau\n       Senator Sharon Stewart-Peregoy, and Senator Jonathan Windy \n     Boy\n       We look to you for leadership and guidance as the \n     legislative session continues.\n       I would also like to recognize the state-wide elected \n     officials in attendance today Superintendent of Public \n     Instruction, Denise Juneau, the first Indian woman to be \n     elected to state-wide public office; Attorney General Steve \n     Bullock; Secretary of State Linda McCulloch and State Auditor \n     Monica Lindeen.\n       There are members of the Governor's cabinet present today, \n     as well as representatives from the offices of Senator \n     Baucus, Senator Tester, and Representative Rehberg.\n       I would especially like to thank and honor today Mr. \n     Gilbert Horn, Sr. an Assiniboine of the Fort Belknap Indian \n     Reservation, who, like the more storied Navajos, used the \n     Assiniboine language with Gerald Red Elk of the Ft. Peck \n     reservation to create a code our enemies in World War II were \n     never able to break. At one point in the war Gilbert Horn \n     successfully attacked a Japanese machine gun post and despite \n     finding his uniform riddled with machine gun bullets managed \n     to survive unscathed. He was awarded the Congressional Medal \n     of Honor but this humble man felt like he didn't deserve \n     special recognition because he was only doing his job. Thank \n     you Gilbert Horn for your service to this country.\n       Thank you all.\n       Elected leaders, tribal elders, ladies and gentlemen: On \n     behalf of the Tribal Nations across the State of Montana, I \n     am honored to present the State of the Tribal Nations \n     address. My name is James Steele, Jr., and I am the Chairman \n     of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and the \n     Chairman of the Montana-Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council.\n       We live in times of tremendous change, politically and \n     economically. We have seen history made in the election of \n     President Barack Obama and his appointments of the most \n     diverse cabinet in the history of the nation.\n       And we have also lost a great leader. This past month, Crow \n     Tribal Chairman Carl Venne passed away--a tremendous loss for \n     the Crow Nation, Montana, and the Country. Carl was a former \n     Chairman of the Montana-Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council and \n     gave this address during the 2007 legislative session. Please \n     let us honor the passing of this great leader, this great \n     man, and my friend, with a moment of silence.\n       The Charles M. Russell painting that dominates this Chamber \n     serves as a reminder of the historic relationship between the \n     Tribes and those who came west to this great country. Charlie \n     Russell recognized that the coming of Lewis and Clark had a \n     profound impact on the Indian people, as our way of life\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\n     was changed forever. In 1805, the economies of Native America \n     were strong and thriving. In fact, in his orders to Lewis and \n     Clark, President Jefferson instructed the two captains to \n     take note and report to him on the economic activities of the \n     Tribes, for Jefferson knew they were vibrant. Our families \n     were strong units. We depended on each other for our \n     survival. There was food, clothing and shelter with a strong \n     religion and value system. An interesting aspect of Thomas \n     Jefferson is that he had studied the governing structure of \n     the six nations that comprise the Iroquois Confederacy and he \n     was fascinated by the idea that there could be independent \n     tribal governments who had autonomy from one another but who \n     also coalesced for their common good. Historians believe that \n     the relationship between those tribes influenced Jefferson \n     and played a role in the crafting of the Constitution and the \n     establishment of the United States.\n       The Russell mural depicts an event that took place on \n     September 4, 1805 when Lewis and Clark's journey embarked on \n     Salish territory at Ross Hole. The encounter between them and \n     the Salish tribal people was a monumental event that \n     ultimately led to the success of the expedition. The Salish \n     people graciously provided the explorers with fresh horses, \n     food and other vital supplies that were needed for their trek \n     across the Bitterroot Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.\n       Without our assistance at Ross Hole and that of other \n     tribes along the way, who knows what the outcome of the \n     journey would have been. These people came looking for a new \n     life, for opportunity, for the freedom to practice any \n     religion they chose. They came looking for hope and \n     opportunity, and we as Indian people hold that in common with \n     them today. Maybe if Indian people had a strong policy on \n     immigration things might have turned out quite differently!!\n       Today, we begin another partnership. It is a partnership \n     that must be based on mutual respect and an understanding. We \n     all must benefit if we as a state are to move forward. What \n     is essential if we as Indian people are going to survive is \n     that the State of Montana accepts the most basic premise that \n     Indian tribes are sovereign units of government. It should be \n     noted that the Constitution of the United States identifies \n     three units of government and those are federal, state and \n     Indian tribal governments. We are not racial groups who \n     happen to live on a particular land base and want what other \n     interests groups want. We are the successors in interest to \n     those who signed treaties with the United States that allowed \n     for Montana to be created. The United States does not sign \n     Treaties with interest groups, they sign treaties with \n     governments and our treaties were ratified by the United \n     States Senate. They are binding contractual agreements in \n     which we reserved to ourselves the rights of self-government \n     and when the western states joined the Union their enabling \n     acts committed them to respecting that authority. There \n     are times when this phenomenon has created jurisdictional \n     problems but to a great extent Montana, particularly in \n     more recent years, has come to understand that our \n     relationship is one of two governments that must be built \n     on mutual respect. I believe that by carrying out this \n     relationship in a mutually respectful fashion we can \n     better the lives of the people who live on Indian \n     reservations as well as those who do not. I believe that \n     Indian reservations are good for Montana and can in fact \n     significantly aid Montana in the area of economic \n     development.\n       At this time it is important that we focus on economic \n     development, job creation, education and health care. These \n     things go hand in hand and our concerns are the same as \n     yours. For too long our people have struggled in economically \n     depressed communities. Our country is in the most severe \n     economic downturn in a generation. But for Indian Country, \n     this is not new as reservations have long suffered with high \n     levels of unemployment. The question is how can Montana help \n     its tribes develop and how can those tribes in turn assist \n     Montana to develop its economy? One source of information \n     that I would ask Montana's officials to look at is the study \n     funded by the State & Tribal Economic development Commission \n     and the University of Montana called the Uncovering Economic \n     Contributions of Montana's American Indian Tribes.\n       Montana's reservations contribute to the state economy by \n     purchasing goods and services from surrounding communities \n     throughout the state with revenue generated from natural \n     resource-based jobs, tribal businesses, federal funds that \n     support some tribal operations and revenue from tribal \n     assets.\n       Cooperative agreements between the Tribes and State will \n     improve the economic conditions of the reservations and would \n     benefit the State of Montana.\n       State and tribal leaders, consider these areas for \n     cooperative agreements:\n       Partnerships focused on bringing a business development \n     approach to tribal communities though technical assistance \n     and strategic partnerships.\n       Improve management skills and the ability to land job-\n     creating grants by using tribal colleges to train the \n     workforce.\n       Assist Tribes with due diligence on energy development \n     technologies.\n       These are just a few items to consider in the efforts to \n     improve the health and well-being of our communities.\n       The Salish and Kootenai Tribes are mapping out our future \n     as energy providers. This effort will reach a new stage in \n     2015 when CSKT purchases Kerr Dam and becomes a supplier of \n     hydroelectric energy. CSKT has also successfully managed our \n     local electric utility, Mission Valley Power, for the past 20 \n     years and now serves 14,000 Indian and non-Indian customers.\n       The great Crow Nation has taken a bold step and signed an \n     agreement with the Australian Energy Company to form the Many \n     Stars Coal-to-Liquids Project. This effort will bring \n     significant opportunities to the Crow people and to all \n     Montanans, through the creation of 4,000 Montana-based jobs, \n     an increased tax base, and will have a vast positive economic \n     impact.\n       The GROS Ventre and Assiniboine Tribes of the Fort Belknap \n     Reservation have used their Indian Country Economic \n     Development funds for the creation of the Little River \n     Smokehouse. This has brought great pride to the Assiniboine \n     and Gros Ventre people. Thank you for this important program \n     and please continue its funding this session.\n       The Little Shell Chippewa Tribes continue to receive our \n     support in their endeavors to gain federal recognition. \n     Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester and Congressman Denny \n     Rehberg have also supported the tribes in their 31-year \n     effort for recognition.\n       The Northern Cheyenne is delicately balancing energy \n     development to create jobs while being environmentally \n     conscience with their traditional values.\n       The Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck \n     Reservation are proud to report that they were the first to \n     sign a revenue sharing agreement with the State of Montana to \n     eliminate duplicate taxation of new oil and gas development \n     on the reservation. This creates a competitive business \n     environment on the reservation, leading to more development \n     of tribal oil and gas resources and increased economic \n     opportunities for tribal members.\n       The Chippewa Cree Tribe is engaging in energy development \n     on and around the Rocky Boy's Reservation that will create \n     more jobs, generate revenue, and provide direct control over \n     development of land and resources. The Tribe has partnered \n     with Native American Resource Partners (NARP) to create a \n     tribally-owned energy company for exploring and developing \n     oil and gas resources. The priorities will be on natural gas \n     exploration and development followed by wind energy \n     progress.\n       The Blackfeet Nation is working to upgrade Pikuni \n     Industries to manufacture materials for Defense Department \n     contracts; and oil drilling efforts have increased on the \n     western side of the Blackfeet Reservation. The Tribe is also \n     in discussion with wind energy producers about several wind \n     projects on the Reservation.\n       These are just a few examples--from among many--of the \n     efforts tribal governments are making to improve the health \n     and well-being of our peoples.\n       Even with high rates of unemployment, the seven Indian \n     Reservations of Montana and the state-recognized Little Shell \n     Band of Chippewa, contribute a combined total of $1 billion \n     annually to the Montana economy. Those numbers may surprise \n     some people, but to those of you who work every day to make \n     your home communities better for your people, these figures \n     come as no surprise.\n       This is an important time to come together. It's important \n     to remind ourselves and our surrounding communities that \n     together, we are greater than the sum of our parts. An \n     example of that played out when Transportation Director Jim \n     Lynch reached out to Indian Country to coordinate conference \n     calls about economic stimulus dollars and transportation \n     funds. Our Nations are hungry for improvement and the tax \n     status of Indian reservations can be attractive to industry.\n       In the more immediate term, during this legislative \n     session, you will hear many ideas to help make Montana, even \n     better.\n       The Governor has already signed into law Senate Bill 39, \n     sponsored by Senator Carol Juneau, extending the duration of \n     the Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission. I thank Senator \n     Juneau, this legislative body, and the Governor for taking \n     quick action on this bill, which is so vital to the economic \n     future of my people and all Montanans. SB 39 will allow the \n     CSKT and the State the time to negotiate a water compact that \n     is fair for all who live on the reservation.\n       While there are many bills worthy of support, I must urge \n     your support in particular for several bills that are vital \n     in Indian Country because of their effect on our economies:\n       House Bill 161, sponsored by Representative Shannon Augare, \n     ratifying the Blackfeet water compact. This bill represents a \n     vital step in the journey towards fair and just water rights \n     for the Blackfeet Tribe and tribal members, and I thank \n     Representative Augare for sponsoring the bill.\n       House Bill 135, sponsored by Representative Tony Belcourt, \n     funding the Peoples Creek mitigation account, as part of the \n     Fort Belknap water compact. With this bill, the State begins \n     to fulfill its obligations under the compact to the people of \n     the Fort Belknap Reservation. Thank you Representative \n     Belcourt--or Landslide Tony as some of us call him--for your \n     sponsorship.\n       Senate Bill 201, sponsored by Senator Jesse Laslovich, \n     revising the Crow water compact. This important bill allows \n     the Crow Nation to access their interest earnings on funds \n     appropriated as part of the State of Montana's obligation \n     under the compact. With these monies, the Crow will be able \n     to set up their\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\n     water administration office, as well as complete the \n     ratification process of their water compact in the U.S. \n     Congress. I thank Senator Laslovich for sponsoring this \n     legislation.\n       House Bill 158, sponsored by Representative Shannon Augare, \n     allowing for direct tribal access to economic development \n     funding. This bill allows tribes to directly access the \n     state's Big Sky Economic Development program funding. \n     Representative Augare understands that the tribes will need \n     to access all the resources they can to help their peoples \n     during these times of economic crisis.\n       Senate Bill 456, sponsored by Carol Juneau, exempting \n     tribally owned property from state property taxes, just as \n     all governments in Montana are exempt from state property \n     taxes. I am thankful for Senator Juneau's persistence in \n     sponsoring this important bill, which is a simple matter of \n     fairness and an important symbol of respect for the state-\n     tribal government-to-government relationship.\n       I thank you for supporting the Indian Country Economic \n     Development program, contained in House Bill 2. This program, \n     established as part of the Governor's budget in 2005, has \n     been a critical engine of economic growth in Indian Country, \n     and is now more important than ever given the economic \n     crisis.\n       Legislators, as you deliberate in making laws and decisions \n     that affect the great State of Montana, let Charlie Russell's \n     painting remind you of your obligation to include Native \n     peoples as your neighbors, partners and friends. Let us move \n     forward together.\n       Thank you.\n\nLem Lemts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4663-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4663-S4664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GLOBAL YOUTH\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a resolution \ndesignating April 24 through 26, 2009, as Global Youth Service Days. S. \nRes. 105 recognizes and commends the significant community service \nefforts that youth are making in communities across the country and \naround the world on the last weekend in April and every day. This \nresolution also encourages the citizens of the United States to \nacknowledge and support these volunteer efforts. S. Res. 105 passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent on April 20, 2009. This sends a very strong \nmessage of support to the thousands of youth across our great Nation \nwho are contributing positively to their communities your efforts are \nrecognized and appreciated.\n  Over the weekend, beginning this Friday, April 24, youth from across \nthe United States and around the world will carry out community service \nprojects in areas ranging from hunger to literacy to the environment. \nThrough this service, many will embark on a lifelong path of service \nand civic engagement in more than 100 countries around the world.\n  This event is not isolated to one weekend a year. Global Youth \nService Days is an annual public awareness and education campaign that \nhighlights the valuable contributions that young people make to their \ncommunities throughout the year.\n  The participation of youth in community service is not just a nice \nidea for a way to spend a Saturday afternoon. All year long, young \npeople across America, indeed across the globe identify and address the \nneeds of their communities through community service and service-\nlearning opportunities. They make positive differences in the world \naround them, learn leadership and organizational skills, and gain \ninsights into the problems of their fellow citizens.\n  Youth who are engaged in volunteer service and service-learning \nactivities do better in school than their classmates who do not \nvolunteer because they see a direct connection to what they are \nlearning and the real world in which they live. Youth who engage in \nvolunteering and other positive activities are also more likely to \navoid risky behaviors, such as drug and alcohol use, crime, and \npromiscuity. Service within the community also contributes positively \nto young people's character development, civic participation, and \nphilanthropic activity as adults.\n  A survey by Civic Enterprises found that 47 percent of high school \ndropouts reported that boredom in school was a primary reason why they \ndropped out. High quality service-learning activities can, however, \nhelp young people make important connections between the curriculum and \nthe challenges they see in their communities.\n  It is important, therefore, that the Senate encourage youth to engage \nin community service and to congratulate them for the service they \nprovide.\n  In an effort to recognize and support youth volunteers in my State, I \nam proud to acknowledge some of the activities that will occur this \nyear in Alaska in observance of National and Global Youth Service Days:\n  Anchorage's Promise, which works to mobilize all sectors of the \ncommunity to build the character and competence of Anchorage's children \nand youth, has sponsored the annual Kids' Day 3-day events in Anchorage \nagain this year. Youth provided significant service to their peers and \nto adults who attended Kids' Day activities last weekend:\n  Students educated the public on the 5 Promises: Caring Adults, Safe \nPlaces, Healthy Start and Future, Marketable Skills, and Opportunities \nto Serve.\n  Students from King Career Center served as volunteer safety patrols.\n  Teens served as greeters and passed out bags, helped vendors set up \ntheir booths, and cleaned up during and after the event.\n  Junior ROTC members provided security and helped with parking.\n  Teens assisted Anchorage's Promise Board members with tours and \nOpening Ceremony activities.\n  Three teens assisted the Kids in Nature Workshop for Parents and \nCaregivers instructor.\n  One youth volunteer assisted staff at the Alaska Natural History \nMuseum.\n  Youth created cards to express support for our troops.\n\n  In addition to the Kids' Day events, young people from every region \nof Alaska will serve their communities in the following ways:\n  Youth volunteers, coordinated by Covenant House, will bring attention \nto the importance of conservation, recycling, and educate youth about \nEarth Day.\n  Various youth service projects will be performed by Juneau youth at \nlocal nonprofits.\n  Members of the Eagle River Boys & Girls Club provided ``kid power'' \nto fill 3000 Easter eggs.\n  The Eielson Air Force Base Youth Programs' Inside & Out Club will \nclean to make it shine as much as the kids do.\n  Youth volunteers, coordinated by the Anchorage Public Library, will \nhelp organize summer reading celebration materials.\n  Youth at Chugiak High School have produced and will show a docudrama \nthat simulates a drunk driving collision and help educate their peers \nabout the dangers of drunk driving.\n  Students at Steller Secondary School will provide the Covenant House \nresidents with gift bags containing personal hygiene products.\n  Alaska Youth and Family Network volunteers will promote personal \nresponsibility for wellness that focuses on youth with behavioral \nhealth problems.\n  Spirit of Youth volunteers from all across Alaska, including Thorne \nBay, Ketchikan, Eagle River, Kodiak, Anchorage, Palmer, Juneau, \nCantwell, Kasaan, Nenana, Nome, Shageluk, Cordova, Palmer, and Chugiak, \nwill work with their peers and adults on projects as varied as sharing \ntheir artistic talents; organizing a potato feed fundraiser to help the \nlocal library; running a girls' study group; offering free babysitting, \nteaching Sunday school, and helping the elderly at the local hospital; \nraising money for youth activities and easing community tensions; \nimproving the collective well-being of youth; including people with \ndisabilities in social activities; teaching cheerleading and dance \nskills; coordinating canned food drives; honoring Haida culture through \nart and music; working with Native elders to retain Alaska Native boat \nmaking skills; responding to emergencies; restoring salmon habitat; \nlearning about climate change and fire science; owning, operating, and \ncrewing a seine fishing boat; giving teens a forum to discuss political \nissues; educating others about child labor; helping other youth to \nsucceed in realizing their dreams; helping students with disabilities \nexcel in physical education; and educating the public about domestic \nviolence while advocating for justice and change.\n  The Alaska Teen Media Institute will provide teens with the tools and \ntraining needed to produce their own stories told in their own voices \nto be shared through a variety of media.\n  Members of the Mountain View Boys & Girls Club will kick off Mountain \nView Cleanup Day.\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\n  Members of Alaska Youth Environmental Action attended the Civics and \nConservation Summit in Juneau where they met with legislators to talk \nabout issues they care about in their communities, including the \nRenewable Energy Campaign.\n  The Anchorage Youth Parent Foundation Peer Outreach Workers will \nspread awareness of sexual assault in April by hosting an Art \nCompetition at the POWER Teen Clinic.\n\n  Mr. President, I am so proud of all of these young people. I value \ntheir idealism, energy, creativity, and unique perspectives as they \nvolunteer to make their communities better and assist those in need.\n  Many similarly wonderful activities will be taking place all across \nthe Nation. I encourage all of my colleagues to visit the Youth Service \nAmerica Web site--www.ysa.org--to find out about the selfless and \ncreative youth who are contributing in their own States this year.\n  I thank my colleagues Senators Akaka, Bayh, Begich, Bingaman, Brown, \nBurr, Cardin, Cochran, Collins, Cornyn, Dodd, Durbin, Feingold, \nFeinstein, Gillibrand, Gregg, Hagan, Hatch, Inouye, Johnson, Kennedy, \nKlobuchar, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Levin, Lieberman, Lincoln, Martinez, \nMenendez, Mikulski, Murray, Ben Nelson, Bill Nelson, Specter, and \nWhitehouse for standing with me as original cosponsors of this \nworthwhile legislation, which will ensure that youth across the country \nand the world know that all of their hard work is greatly appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4664-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                         HUMAN RIGHTS IN KENYA\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to call \nthe attention of my colleagues to the serious dangers that exist for \nhuman rights today in Kenya. I particularly express my concern about \nthe death threats being made against Paul Muite, a distinguished human \nrights attorney in that country.\n  Mr. Muite is a native of Kenya who has been an outspoken critic of \nthe hundreds of extrajudicial killings that have taken place in Kenya \nsince 2006, and he has sought an investigation by the International \nCriminal Court of these killings.\n  The threats against him have escalated in recent weeks. This week, I \nlearned that someone had thrust an AK-47 in Mr. Muite's face.\n  I urge the Government of Kenya to give high priority to this alarming \nsituation, and to take all necessary steps to protect the safety of Mr. \nMuite and others struggling to defend the fundamental human rights of \nthe people of Kenya. The world is watching and I hope my colleagues in \nthe Senate will join in calling attention to this basic issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4664-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EXERCISE TIGER\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the 65th anniversary \nof the Exercise Tiger operation and the American servicemen who took \npart in this exercise. I extend my gratitude to their dedication and \nservice to the people of Missouri and of the Nation.\n  On April 28, 1944, German Navy ``E'' boats, patrolling the English \nChannel, attacked eight American landing ships engaged in training \noperation Exercise Tiger. These operations, organized by the U.S. Army, \nwere undertaken off a beach in Devon, England often patrolled by German \n``E'' torpedo boats. With only one English ship to guard the convoy, \nthere was a devastating surprise attack on the American ships ending in \nmultiple ships being sunk.\n  Of the four thousand men who participated in this critical operation, \nnearly a quarter lost their life including over 200 men from the 3206th \nQuartermaster Company located in Missouri. Due to the secrecy of the \nmission, information on the fatalities was only released after the \nsuccessful completion of the D-Day invasion.\n  April 28, 2009 marks the 65th historic anniversary of the WWII Battle \nof Exercise Tiger and an opportunity to recognize all the men who \nserved and gave their life in that historic battle. I am proud to say \nthat we have renamed U.S. Highway 54 in my home State of Missouri as \nthe WWII Exercise Tiger Expressway, in honor of the sailors and \nsoldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice. The Missouri Exercise Tiger \nArmy and Navy Anchor Memorial has been built on the Audrain County \nCourt House Lawn in their memory.\n  The servicemen who participated in the Battle of Exercise Tiger are \nto be commemorated for their heroic actions. These men were an example \nfor all American soldiers and a credit to the United States as it \nremains the free and great country that it is today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4664-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4664-S4666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       It is time to wake up, America. All it would take [for the \n     price to drop] is for Congress to allow the oil companies to \n     drill for oil anywhere in this country and the crude oil \n     price would drop $30 to $50 a barrel. I, for one, am tired of \n     Congress blaming business or the President for the problems \n     of this country. Congress holds the key and they sit back and \n     run up the government deficits until the value of our dollar \n     is falling like a rock, which, in turn, is driving up the \n     price of crude oil.\n       It was not that long ago that the Congress of the 1990s \n     showed fiscal responsibility. But, this Congress shows that \n     it is unwilling to try to solve any of the nation's problems. \n     The deficit is snowballing into a problem that cannot be \n     ignored any longer it is having an effect on all of our daily \n     lives.\n       There has been many articles recently about the amount of \n     oil that this country has is not enough to solve this \n     countries demands for oil, but it sure would go a long way \n     towards balancing trade deficits and have a huge effect on \n     the economy. If Congress shows a willingness to do something \n     about this problem, the commodities markets reaction would be \n     swift; no action, be prepared to keep paying at the pump!\n       It is time to write our Senators and Representatives and \n     tell them it is long overdue that they do something about \n     utilizing our nation's oil resources, and with a percentage \n     of the revenue from it to build renewable energy plants like \n     solar and wind generation projects. The politicians keep \n     saying that they are all for looking out for the poor and the \n     working class in this country but [that is not happening.] \n     There is some huge possibilities if Congress acts, if not we \n     are starting to see what the future looks like.\n     Kyle, Genesee.\n                                  ____\n\n       These high gas prices are making it more and more difficult \n     for my family to just get to town for the basic essentials. \n     We live on top of a mountain in Idaho, and it takes us 25 \n     minutes just to drive down in town where we do our grocery \n     shopping, banking, medical care and prescription pick-up as \n     well as postal service, and any hardware or building supplies \n     we might need as we are building a large house. Due to the \n     increasing gas prices, we have had to condense our trips down \n     to once a week, so we are not near as frequently patronizing \n     the local businesses like we used to. I would plead with \n     Congress to please increase our domestic oil supply as this \n     is an extreme hardship on thousands and thousands of Idaho \n     residents as well as the local businesses.\n     Darlene, Kamiah.\n                                  ____\n\n       Let me begin by saying that I sincerely appreciate your \n     decision to consult your constituents about the energy issue. \n     Though the electorate may be vastly uninformed, it is \n     nevertheless every citizen's duty to be active and politics, \n     and you are encouraging this laudable behavior. You deserve \n     to be commended.\n       Yet now I fear I must turn from a tone of praise to one of \n     criticism because you requested personal--and thus \n     emotionally-charged--anecdotes. Indeed you asked for policy \n     opinions, too, but from your email, those seemed of secondary \n     importance. Anecdotes and emotions have no rightful place in \n     the policy-making process, no matter how many you receive and \n     how depressing they are. The responses you receive will\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\n     be surely come primarily from the constituents hit hardest by \n     the high prices, yielding a very skewed measurement of public \n     opinion.\n       The hysteria regarding the oil ``crisis'' of the day \n     invariably clouds our judgment. It leads to proposals that \n     lack all substance and justification such as the gas tax \n     holiday. These ideas are motivated chiefly by personal \n     electoral concerns rather than a sincere desire to help \n     citizens. Using a conservative estimate of 20 mpg for my \n     compact car, I would have to drive 725 miles a week this \n     summer just to save $100. This is the kind of relief the \n     American people need, really? Oh and, by the way, it would \n     cost an estimated $9 billion when our nation is the largest \n     debtor in the world. (I am not accusing you of supporting \n     this proposal, but it illustrates my point.)\n       Instead let us look at a major cause of this problem; it is \n     not speculators or Al-Qaeda. Over the period from 2000 when \n     national prices were at approximately $1.50 per gallon till \n     the year 2007 when prices were at approximately $2.75 per \n     gallon, inflation is estimated at 17 to 40 percent. (This \n     according to http://www.measuringworth.com.) Conservative \n     numbers indicate $1.50 in 2000 is worth $1.80 in 2007, while \n     aggressive estimates would value that same $1.50 at $2.11 in \n     2007. And as the average gas price in 2007 was at $2.75, \n     simple arithmetic shows that inflation accounts for at least \n     a quarter of the price increase and possibly as much as half \n     of the increase.\n       Yet in the public arena, most still blame the increase on \n     speculators or price-gouging oil companies or OPEC. Inflation \n     is seldom mentioned even though we have just seen how \n     integral a role it has played. This problem needs to be \n     addressed. Our inflation in turn is caused chiefly by our \n     growing national debt and the expensive foreign policy that \n     it finances. I submit that entitlement spending is \n     problematic too, but our military spending is much more \n     easily curtailed because public opinion is not as deeply \n     entrenched in support of it.\n       Although I personally believe we should bring the troops \n     home from Iraq and Afghanistan, I know you disagree, and I \n     realize that I will be unable to sway you on this issue. \n     However, military spending can still be readily cut back in \n     other areas. I think our global military presence is a great \n     place to start. As of 2005, America held 737 foreign military \n     bases. The simple question is why. Why do we need a military \n     presence in Japan or Germany? This cannot be defended as \n     merely part of the War on Terror, and yet these bases and \n     others like them are costing the American taxpayer billions \n     of dollars every year. This is an encroachment on the \n     national sovereignty of other countries, but, more \n     importantly, it is an exorbitant waste. If there is a \n     legitimate reason for our costly global military presence, \n     please inform me. But if not, you must agree that the \n     financial benefit of shutting down these bases is too great \n     to ignore. (Check out Nemesis by Chalmers Johnson for more \n     information on this topic.)\n       I sincerely thank you for soliciting the opinions of your \n     constituents. As you may have assumed by now, I have not been \n     hard hit by high energy prices. I am going to be a college \n     student in the fall, and I prefer riding my bike to driving \n     my car. I hope that you acknowledge the role of inflation in \n     today's energy crisis, and I urge you to look at the \n     rationale for our global military deployment. Getting our \n     fiscal house back in order will have a real and palpable \n     benefit for the American people, and solutions like scaling \n     back the military are the first step.\n     Eddie, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I work for a small semi-trailer manufacturer here in Boise. \n     Our orders for new trailers have fallen off considerably. \n     Existing orders are now being canceled at an alarming rate. \n     Every Monday morning there is a number of trailers parked in \n     front of our building from owner operators calling it quits. \n     I ask all of my customers why and they all say the diesel \n     fuel prices are the reason.\n       Today, in our weekly sales meeting, the owner told us we \n     needed to get some orders on the schedule or the company will \n     be laying off 100 people. We have already reduced our \n     workforce by 50 since March. He went on to say that if it \n     continues he will have to send 50 more home by the end of \n     July. Like I said above, we are a small company, we had 400 \n     employees total at the first of 2008. By the end of July, we \n     could cut our work force by 50 percent. I have heard that \n     since January 1st the trucking industry has lost around 800 \n     trucks due to fuel prices. This is unacceptable and very \n     unreasonable and our government just stands by and lets it \n     happen.\n     Gary, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       We need relief fast. These fuel and food costs are killing \n     our home budget. The baby boomers have having to continue to \n     work to pay for fuel. We are very concerned and we vote, so \n     please help.\n     Joe and Cheri.\n                                  ____\n\n       The oil-producing countries recent pursuit of nuclear \n     power--and their interest in investing in British nuclear \n     power is an interesting trend, I think.\n     Claudia.\n                                  ____\n\n       Like most Americans, the high cost of gas has limited my \n     trips to visit family and conduct personal business--a \n     necessity in rural Idaho.\n       The only real solution to our energy problem is to wean \n     this country off oil. Increased domestic oil production would \n     only be putting a band-aid on a gaping hole. It would not \n     solve our energy needs and we would still be buying oil from \n     abroad. It is also a finite resource so in a few years time \n     whatever drop in the bucket ANWR might provide (no one knows \n     how much oil resides there), will eventually be gone. The \n     only real solution is investment in alternative energy. \n     Government-provided grants and subsidies to innovative \n     entrepreneurs would eventually solve our problems and sever \n     the dependence on Venezuela and the Middle East once and for \n     all.\n       At the very least, this country can ``tighten its belt'' \n     with regard to conservation. As we all know, America uses \n     more energy per capita than any other country. I have \n     traveled abroad extensively and have thoroughly enjoyed the \n     availability of public transportation--most of which is \n     subsidized by the government and small hot water heaters.\n       Thank you for considering my thoughts.\n     Courtney, Kamiah.\n                                  ____\n\n       Even though I have a secure job at the INL I do not \n     consider myself to be rich I have seen many problems brought \n     on by the energy/housing/banking fiascoes. I just saw a news \n     article where people who have minimum wage jobs are having to \n     quit because they cannot afford to drive to work!! Bread has \n     doubled in price due to the new emphasis of the \n     administration placed on ethonal production. My 401K plan has \n     lost over $50,000 since January 1, 2008.\n       I challenge you to try to live as a `normal' American. I \n     have a $1,100 mortgage, a $500 payment for my daughter's \n     college education, $250 in car insurance (for myself, my wife \n     and two daughters), $300 for food (that is just for my wife \n     and myself) and about $300 for gas. Why do not you challenge \n     your fellow Congressman to this little test: Live like this \n     for a month, no congressional [perks].\n       Assume you bring home $3,000/month:\n       $1,000 mortgage or rent\n       $500 college\n       $200 medical\n       $300 gas\n       $300 food\n       $250 car insurance\n       $400 credit card\n       Total: $2,950.00\n       In my exaggerated case, that does not leave much for any \n     car repairs (did I mention your car is 10 years old and \n     because of all the money worries, it has lost 50 percent of \n     its value since Jan!)--So a new hybrid car is totally out of \n     the question. Also, I forgot to tell you that you worked in \n     construction and have to have a big truck (3/4 ton) to haul \n     your tools and supplies around--no sissy two-seater hybrid \n     for this job! Now that you see what a family in Idaho is \n     probably facing.\n       Big oil wants the offshore oil leases opened made \n     available. . . . Gee, from what I saw on C-SPAN the other \n     night, big oil is buying and holding leases, but not \n     drilling. This has been going on since I believe the speaker \n     said 1999 or so. Is not that kinda like artificially \n     controlling the supply? They want the leases, they have to \n     work or forfeit them, no refund. We will not even mention the \n     $56+ billion profit (Websters definition: Income minus \n     expenses). And then they have the nerve to say they need the \n     tax handouts because it is ``good for the economy'' and they \n     need it to protect the environment. We just do not understand \n     them! In a recent interview shown on TV, none of the big oil \n     CEOs would support environmental advertisements.\n       The banks are making money investing in oil, etc. Then they \n     charge 11->30 percent for credit cards. Not every American is \n     to blame for the housing/banking bust! I just looked up my \n     credit union rates for 0-$999.00, they are paying 0.50 \n     percent APY.\n       It is about time to put [partisan and parochial interests \n     aside] and do what is right for the country. It does not \n     matter if it is the idea of a Republican, Democrat, or \n     Independent, if it is the right thing to do, support it!\n       After all of the ranting above, believe me that I still \n     love and support America and what its real values are. But I \n     do [believe that far too many people in power have \n     collectively trashed America and are not being forced to fix \n     it.]\n     Jerry.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I have been retired for almost four years. \n     We make $2,200 a month. We have a house payment of $1,000 a \n     month. When we retired, we were making plenty to keep us. \n     Since we have retired, everything has gone up. The nearest \n     grocery store (very small corner market) is 15 miles away. We \n     have to drive 100 miles round trip to do any kind of \n     shopping, doctors, etc. Our home is very rural, so when we \n     built it 28 years ago it would have cost us $10,000 to run a \n     natural gas line, so we opted for propane, which has risen to \n     $3.00 a gallon. We have a wood stove to help, but the nearest \n     wood to cut is 70 miles one way. My husband has bone on bone \n     knees, and is in a lot of pain, so getting wood is going to \n     get harder and harder. When we retired we figured on being \n     able to draw Social Security at 62\\1/2\\. Now they have \n     changed it to 66. My husband worked for 38 years and was able \n     to retire while he is still young. He will be 60 in three \n     days. Yes, we are able to live, but there is nothing extra. \n     At least we are doing better than my parents making $1,200 a \n     month and having to decide between eating, staying warm, and \n     being able to buy their prescription drugs, (that before the\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\n     Medicare Part D program were free). We need to take care of \n     our own. Use our own oil, feed our own people, keep the \n     illegal aliens out because they are using more of our \n     governments money than we are. I have my doubts you will ever \n     read this, but it is worth a try.\n     Trish.\n                                  ____\n\n       I work for the federal government, but had to make a \n     difficult choice last week. I had to decide on buying enough \n     gasoline to get to work for the next two weeks or providing \n     additional food for my family. I commute daily from 20 miles \n     one way to work and do not have an option to move at this \n     time. The need for gasoline won over the additional food. \n     Please support Senator Crapo and Congressman Simpson as they \n     work to provide real solutions to our increased costs for \n     energy instead of merely blaming the current administration \n     and promising to raise taxes as the only solutions.\n     Tom, Ririe.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have just read through your website and have found only \n     responses that support your conclusions. Are you afraid to \n     post any dissent on the subject? Yes, gas prices are at a \n     record high and yes, many people are seeing significant new \n     bills and a reduction in their spendable income. Some, \n     certainly, are no longer able to stay out of debt. \n     Nonetheless, all of the solutions that you are proposing will \n     do little to impact anyone's pocketbook or bottom line. \n     Offshore drilling, whether it be in Florida or Alaska, will \n     not ease the current situation. No new oil will flow out of \n     those areas for years. If you allow such exploration, who do \n     you think will pay for the new equipment and technology \n     required to access such oil? I know who--either the consumers \n     or the taxpayers, but probably, both.\n       More importantly, why are many Americans struggling to pay \n     the increased cost of gas? How many Prius drivers are \n     complaining? How many times did the Senate vote down \n     legislation to force automakers to manufacture more fuel \n     efficient vehicles?\n       On your website, you state, ``It is why I support \n     legislation to fully utilize proven American oil and natural \n     gas reserves in a way that preserves the environment for \n     future generations.'' How are you going to fully utilize \n     reserves and preserve the environment? Has there ever been an \n     oil installation that preserves, or benefits the environment?\n       I am extremely happy that you support renewable energies. \n     Idaho certainly has a great deal of renewable potential. We \n     have great solar, wind, and water resources. Are you aware \n     that Idaho, as a state, offers some of the most paltry \n     incentives in the entire country? As a state, we do not even \n     have a net-metering law.\n       Renewable energies are currently poised to be rapidly \n     deployed, far faster than the decades required to extract the \n     limited quantities of oil out of ANWR.\n       Before we vote to open vast areas to development, let us \n     look forward to the future to determine if this is a prudent \n     thing to do. At the very least, let us determine if it will \n     even solve the issue at hand.\n     Jake, Driggs.\n                                  ____\n\n       Please check out this web site.

I have been on every \n     National Geographic and all the magazines, so I have seen oil \n     as crude and the finished product. The refining is basically \n     the same as in 1973. The cost is low to refine to gas stage. \n     What I am getting at is what Ted Stevens said to Leo Lucas \n     and I back in the 1980s when I lived next door to him on \n     Leo's ranch. He said, ``There can be no crooked oilmen \n     without crooked Senators and Congressmen. He went on to \n     predict this ``crunch'' we are having as something that OPEC \n     has always said would happen.\n       Maybe it is time to take it away from the oil people. We \n     have more oil in Alaska than Saudi Arabia, same with North \n     Dakota, Pennsylvania, and nobody has any idea how much is in \n     Utah. But I would never go for drilling in ANWR.\n       That is something you cannot image. The beauty is stunning, \n     although they say the impact would be like a sheet of plywood \n     in the middle of a football field. I believe them to be \n     liars. They have the best drillers in the world in Alaska. I \n     have worked with all but a few of them. They can drill from \n     elsewhere and get all the oil without going there, even if it \n     is like the sheet of plywood. It will not stay that way. They \n     are pigs and will ruin all they touch. Anyway, who would want \n     a sheet of plywood in the middle of their football field?\n       For all they would get offshore would be dwarfed by it, \n     anyway. Let us use our resources and tell OPEC that grain is \n     $139 a bushel. Leave them alone. They hate us. If someone \n     wanted me to stay away from them there is no way they would \n     ever have to say it twice.\n     Oliver, Salmon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4666-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         HONORING RECIPIENTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I wish to honor one of the most \ndedicated advocates for American Indian tribes in my State of South \nDakota and throughout the United States. On Sunday, April 19, 2009, Tim \nWapato was called home. Tim has long served many issues important to \nIndian Country throughout his life and I have included his obituary \nbelow and ask that it be printed in the Record. An enrolled member of \nthe Colville Confederated Tribe in Eastern Washington, he made his home \nin Rapid City, SD. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family, \nincluding his wife, my friend, Gay Kingman-Wapato, and their family. He \nwill be greatly missed by everyone he touched on his journey through \nthis world.\n  The information follows:\n  Sherman Timothy Wapato, 73, entered the Spirit World at his home in \nRapid City, SD on Sunday, April 19, 2009 as a result of heart failure. \nHe was an enrolled Member of the Colville Confederated Tribe in Eastern \nWashington.\n  Sherman Timothy Wapato was the second child of six children born to \nPaul and Elizabeth Wapato. During Tim's early years of schooling, the \nFamily moved frequently, as Paul Wapato was an Evangelist Minister. Tim \nwent to nine different elementary schools prior to settling down in the \nMethow Valley (Washington) for Jr. High and High School. The ``Wapato \nBoys'' were the only Indians attending Winthrop, H.S. and were admired \nfor their abilities in school and in sports.\n  Tim graduated High School in 1953 in Winthrop, WA, where he excelled \nin sports and government. Tim was a popular student and was well known \nfor his basketball prowess, good humor and leadership abilities. He was \nClass President as well as Homecoming King.\n  Tim then attended Washington State University and California State \nUniversity at Los Angeles Majoring in Political Science, Public \nAdministration and Police Administration.\n  In 1955, Tim enlisted in the U.S. Army and was honorably discharged \nin 1957 where he was in Communications and played basketball for the \nArmy.\n  Tim moved to Los Angeles, California in 1958 where he joined the Los \nAngeles Police Department. (LAPD) With his quick-wit, coupled with \npassing a series of LAPD exams and obvious leadership abilities, at the \nyoung age of 34, Tim quickly rose to the rank of Lieutenant, LAPD. Tim \nwas the youngest to achieve that rank at that age and at that time. \nOlder Officers learned to ``Trust'' his Leadership and follow his \nsupervision. He supervised up to 188 Officers depending upon the \nassignment and circumstances.\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\n  As a LAPD Lieutenant of Police, Tim served as Officer-in-Charge of \nDetective Special Investigative Teams handling homicide, robbery and \nnarcotics; Sex Crimes; Vice-Unit Investigations; Equal Opportunity and \nDevelopment, and the Affirmative Action Unit/Discrimination Complaint \nUnit. Tim also served as Patrol Division Watch Commander, Patrol \nDivision Supervisor, and an Instructor at the Academy on robbery and \nhomicide investigations, police-community relations and American Indian \nCulture awareness. He was a frequent Instructor at the Indian Police \nAcademy at Roswell, New Mexico, training Officers to work on Indian \nReservations. While Officer-In-Charge he was responsible for assessing \nthe legal implications of each investigation, assignment of \ninvestigative personnel, and analysis, evaluation of status and crime \ntrends and recommendations for strategic planning to address issues and \nprogrammatic concerns.\n  In 1972 and 1973, through the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, the \nLAPD loaned S. Timothy Wapato to the Colville Confederated Tribe for a \nSpecial Assignment to plan and design a Tribal Police Department and a \nTribal Court. Tim completed the design for the Department with a fish \nand wild life enforcement section, fish and wildlife biology section, \ncourt system, and public highway safety program.\n  During the 21 years Tim served with the LAPD, Tim volunteered his \noff-duty time to work for the City of Los Angeles (LA) including the \nfollowing; Chairman of the Los Angeles City-County Native American \nCommission, Member of the Council for Peace and Equality in Education, \nMember of the Board for the LA Indian Center, President, United \nAmerican Indian Council, and President, American Indian Welcome House.\n  Sherman Timothy Wapato retired from the LAPD in 1979, after 21 years \nof service to the City of Los Angeles and after receiving numerous \ncommendations for his work.\n  After retirement, Tim immediately took a post with the Columbia River \nInter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC) where he worked for 10 years, \n(1979-1989). Initially Tim was the Director of Fisheries Protection and \nEnforcement. In 1980 Tim was appointed by the Board of Directors to \nExecutive Director of the Commission. He executed and administered \ngrants and contracts, supervised over 65 legal, technical and \nadministrative employees and was responsible for administering a $5.5 \nmillion annual budget. He directed the analysis, evaluation, \nformulation and implementation of policy, judicial and legislative \ninitiatives, developed cooperative working agreements with \ninternational, national, federal state, and regional parties for the \nbenefit of Tribal and intertribal interests in the areas of water \nrights, regulation and enforcement, treaty rights, hydropower fishing \nrights and resource management.\n  While Tim was at CRITFC, he was appointed by President Reagan in 1986 \nto serve on the U.S. Pacific Salmon Commission. President Reagan re-\nappointed Tim to negotiate the Treaty between Canada and the United \nStates to serve a second term in 1988. As a Commissioner, Tim reported \nto U.S. Secretary of State and was responsible for implementing the \nInternational Treaty provisions between the U.S. and Canada. His peers \nelected Tim to be the Chairman of the International Treaty Council, \n(the full Commission comprised of Canadian and U.S. Commissioners) with \nthe responsibility of U.S. Chief Negotiator in the annual negotiations \non the Treaty with Canada. The result was the Pacific Salmon Treaty \nbetween the U.S. and Canada which acknowledged Tribes as sovereigns and \nequal co-managers.\n  In 1989 Tim accepted a Senior Executive Service, Political \nAppointment and became the Commissioner of the Administration for \nNative Americans in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). \nTim led ANA from 1989-1993. As, Commissioner for ANA, Tim was \nresponsible for formulating and administering a $34,000,000.00 budget \nto provide grants, contracts, technical assistance and training, \ninteragency agreements and activities beneficial to ANA clients. He \nserved as the principal advisor to the Sec. of the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) on Native American Affairs, including \nNative Hawaiians, Samoans and other Pacific Islanders. Tim provided \ntestimony before Congress, delivered keynote speeches at national, \nregional, tribal, federal and state meetings and worked on the \nreauthorization of the ANA Legislation within the Federal Govt., with \nCongress and with key Indian organizations. Tim saw the need for \nimproved coordination for Indian Tribes and helped establish the Inter-\nAgency Council which served as liaison and coordination within HHS and \namong federal agencies to ensure effective integration of programs and \npolicies affecting Native Americans.\n  While ANA Commissioner, Tim was also appointed to membership in the \nSenior Executive Service Advisory Board, U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement, and to the Native American Veterans Coordinating Council \nwith the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Upon leaving Government Service in 1993, the Tribal Nations asked S. \nTimothy Wapato and his wife, A. Gay Kingman to develop and establish a \nNational Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) Office in Washington, DC. Tim \nand Gay founded NIGA and through hard work and long hours developed \nNIGA into a powerful national organization for Indian Tribes. NIGA's DC \noffice roots began in their home, discussions held frequently around \nthe kitchen table, but the success of their work on the organization \nquickly expanded to increasingly larger offices on Capitol Hill. In \n1995, the NIGA was the first Indian Organization ever to purchase and \nown property on Capitol Hill.\n  As Executive Director and chief management officer of NIGA, Tim \nprovided overall leadership, direction and guidance to Indian Tribal \nNations. He supervised employees, managed and guided all NIGA projects, \ndeveloped and implemented operating policies and procedures for \ninvestment funds, and public relations, including working with \nCongress. Namely, Tim developed and directed a strategy for a \ncoordinated effort among public relations staff, attorneys, lobbyists, \nand Indian Tribes to realize success with Congress and the \nAdministration. Under his leadership, this coalition was effective in \nstopping attempts to pass harmful legislation in Congress; and \nstrategies and recommendations were developed to support amendments \nbeneficial to Tribes.\n  The national press called upon Tim often; again his quick wit and \nhumor gained him enduring relationships with the media. In April 1994, \nNIGA won the coveted National AWARD FOR ``Creativity in Public \nRelations'' in New York City for the campaign/strategy implemented to \neducate the Public on Indian Gaming.\n  Besides the coordinated Communication effort, two major programs were \ndeveloped under Tim's NIGA leadership to assist Tribes:\n  The ITN or Integrated Tribal Network, an electronic communication \nsystem, and the Institute for Tribal Government, an educational \ndepartment within NIGA to offer courses and workshops to train and \neducate Tribes, States and staff of Casinos on a wide range of topics. \nIn 1998, Tim first resigned from NIGA, wanting to make an attempt at a \nthird retirement, but his resignation was not accepted by the Board. \nLater, Tim resigned again but remained faithfully committed to Indian \nTribes but relocated to Rapid City, SD, so that he and Gay could be \nnear family and take care of Gay's father, Gus Kingman, who lived to be \n104 years old.\n  In his fourth retirement, Tim served as the Executive Director of the \nInter-Tribal Bison Cooperative in Rapid City until he experienced a \nstroke in August of 2000.\n  Tim and Gay formed Kingman/Wapato & Associates, an Indian owned \nconsulting, lobbying and technical assistance firm. Soon thereafter, \nthe Great Plains Tribes asked them to help organize the Great Plains \nTribal Chairman's Association where Gay continues to work as Executive \nDirector.\n  Tim never let his health challenges hold him back; right up until his \ndeath, he continued to give speeches, expert advice and served on \nseveral national boards, including the National Center for American \nIndian Enterprise Development and the Institute for Tribal Government, \nPortland State University. He remained active in NIGA, National \nCongress of American Indians, Veterans Affairs, legislation politics,\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\nand was a mentor to many young people as they continued the battles for \nIndian Tribes.\n  Tim was highly respected throughout the United States and touched \nmany lives. He received many honors and was known for his brilliant \nmind, his wise advice, his humor, his vision, his capabilities, his \nability to provide leadership in crisis and his strength of will. \nThough a tireless leader, he always made time and always had a kind \nword for his family and his extended family, of which he has legion. In \nhis life's work, Tim had a skill for cutting through to the core issue, \nno matter how complex, then inspiring those around him to join hands to \neither take care of a problem or take advantage of an opportunity. It \nwould be inadequate to label Tim simply as a visionary, because he \nhimself would correct such a label and point out that together, we did \nnot all just see or talk, rather we all made real things happen and \nstood our shared ground. That is Tim's truly unique legacy, providing \nguideposts to those who stand proudly in Tim's wake by having \nexperienced a man--never daunted, habitually principled, strategically \ndefiant, possessing great perspective yet a healthy appreciation for \nsatire, and always hopeful.\n  Tim was preceded in death by his parents, Reverend Paul Wapato (1955) \nand Elizabeth Wapato (1994), his Sister, Esther KeAna Wapato (1965) and \nPhillip Francis Wapato (1961)\n  S.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resources study of the Honoliuli Internment Camp site in the \nState of Hawaii, to determine the suitability\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\nand feasibility of establishing a unit of the National Park System; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a Special \nResources Study of the Honouliuli Gulch and associated sites located in \nthe State of Hawaii in order to determine the suitability and \nfeasibility of designating these sites as a unit of the National Park \nSystem.\n  During World War II, over 1,000 Japanese Americans were incarcerated \nin at least eight locations on Hawaii. In a report completed in 2007, \nthe Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii documented these sites that \ninclude Honouliuli Gulch, Sand Island, and the US Immigration Station \non Oahu, the Kilauea Military Camp on the Big Island, Haiku Camp and \nWailuku County Jail on Maui, and the Kalaheo Stockade and Waialua \nCounty Jail on Kauai. These camps also held approximately 100 local \nresidents of German and Italian ancestry.\n  Those detained included the leaders of the Japanese immigrant \ncommunity in Hawaii, many of whom were taken from their homes and \nfamilies in the hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The forced \nremoval of these individuals began a nearly four year odyssey to a \nseries of camps in Hawaii and on the continental US. Over 1,000 \nimmediate family members of these men joined their husbands, fathers \nand relatives in mainland camps. The detainees were never formally \ncharged and granted only token hearings. Many of the detainees' sons \nserved with distinction in the US armed forces, including the legendary \n100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team and Military Intelligence \nService.\n  This report found that both the Kilauea Military Camp and the \nHonouliuli sites feature historic resources and recommended that the \nsites be nominated for listing on the National Register for Historic \nPlaces. In 2008, the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii published a \nmore detailed archeological reconnaissance of the Honouliuli site. This \nreport found that there were numerous historic features that would \nqualify the site for National Historic Register and further recommended \nthat the site be conserved. The Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii is \ncurrently working with Monsanto, the landowner, to nominate the \nHonouliuli Gulch site to be listed on the National Historic Register.\n  So far I have received letters in support of this legislation from a \nrange of local, regional and national organizations, including the \nJapanese American National Museum, Hawaiian Historical Society, Go For \nBroke National Education Center, Japan America Society of Hawaii, \nHonolulu Chapter of the Japanese Citizens League, Japanese Cultural \nCenter of Hawaii, Honolulu Japanese Junior Chamber of Commerce, MIS \nVeterans Club of Hawaii, the United Japanese Society of Hawaii, \nJapanese American Citizens League, The Conservation Fund, Densho, \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation, Japanese American National \nHeritage Coalition and the Friends of Minidoka.\n  This legislation will enable the National Park Service to study these \nimportant sites in my state and make recommendations to Congress \nregarding the best approach to conserve and manage these sites to tell \nthis chapter in our Nation's history to current and future generations.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 872. A bill to establish a Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security \nfor Management, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and \npartner on the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee, Senator \nAkaka, to address the critical management challenges facing the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, by introducing the Effective \nHomeland Security Management Act of 2009. I am proud to have Senators \nCarper and Levin also joining us in this important effort.\n  This legislation would elevate the role and responsibilities of the \ncurrent DHS Under Secretary for Management to a Deputy Secretary of \nHomeland Security for Management while preserving the authority of the \nSecretary and Deputy Secretary of DHS as the first-and second-highest \nranking DHS officials, respectively. Under the legislation, the \nindividual appointed as the Deputy Secretary for Management would be \nthe third highest ranking official at DHS and would serve a five year \nterm in order to provide management continuity at DHS during times of \nleadership transition, such as following a presidential election like \nthe one we just experienced.\n  In the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Congress established the \nposition of Under Secretary for Management to oversee the management \nand administration of DHS. However, management issues have persisted at \nDHS since its creation. In 2003, the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, included implementing and transforming DHS on its high-risk list \nof programs susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. \nSimilarly, in December 2005, the DHS Inspector General issued a report \nwarning of major management challenges facing DHS. The report noted \nthat although progress has been made since DHS' inception, \n``[i]ntegrating its many separate components in a single, effective, \nefficient, and economical Department remains one of DHS's biggest \nchallenges.'' Further, DHS's own Performance and Accountability Report, \nreleased in November 2006, states that it did not meet its strategic \ngoal of ``providing comprehensive leadership and management to improve \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the Department,'' further \nunderscoring the need for good management. In 2007, the Homeland \nSecurity Advisory Council Culture Task Force Report also detailed \npersisting organizational challenges within DHS and prescribed \nleadership and management models designed to empower employees, foster \ncollaboration, and encourage innovation. The third recommendation of \nthe report was that DHS establish an operational leadership position. \nThe report noted, ``[a]lignment and integration of the DHS component \norganizations is vital to the success of the DHS mission. The [Culture \nTask Force] believes there is a compelling need for the creation of a \nDeputy Secretary for Operations, DSO, who would report to the Secretary \nand be responsible for the high level Department-wide measures aimed at \ngenerating and sustaining seamless operational integration and \nalignment of the component organizations.''\n  For these reasons, as part of the Implementing Recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission Act of 2007, Congress clarified that the role and \nresponsibilities of the Under Secretary for Management would include \nserving as the Chief Management Officer and principal advisor to the \nSecretary on the management of DHS. In that legislation Congress also \nprovided that the Under Secretary for Management would be responsible \nfor strategic management and annual performance planning, \nidentification and tracking of performance measures, and the management \nintegration and transformation process in support of DHS operations and \nprograms. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act \nof 2007 also established managerial and leadership qualifications for \nthe Under Secretary for Management and increased the pay scale for that \nUnder Secretary.\n  However, there continue to be significant management challenges \nassociated with integrating DHS, whose creation represented the single \nlargest restructuring of the Federal Government since the creation of \nthe Department of Defense in 1947. In addition to its complex mission \nof securing the Nation from terrorism and natural hazards through \nprotection, prevention, response, and recovery, leadership of DHS has \nthe enormous task of unifying 200,000 employees from 22 disparate \nFederal agencies. This January, GAO again included implementing and \ntransforming DHS on its high-risk list, noting that ``[a]lthough DHS \nhas made progress in transforming into a fully functioning department, \nthis transformation remains high risk because DHS has not yet developed \na comprehensive plan to address the transformation, integration, \nmanagement and mission challenges GAO identified since 2003. . . DHS \nhas developed an Integrated Strategy for High Risk Management that \noutlines the department's process for, among other things,\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\nassessing risks and proposing initiatives to address challenges, but \nthe strategy lacks details for the transformation of DHS and \nintegration of its management functions. DHS has also developed \ncorrective action plans to address management challenges that contain \nseveral of the key elements GAO has identified for a corrective action \nplan . . . However, the plans generally do not contain measures to \ngauge performance and progress, nor do they identify the resources \nneeded to carry out the corrective actions identified.''\n  As former Chairman and now Ranking Member of the Oversight of \nGovernment Management Subcommittee, improving the management structure \nat DHS has been one of my top priorities. The Subcommittee's Chairman, \nSenator Akaka, and I have been committed to ensuring that DHS has the \nproper tools to make continual improvements in its operations. Because \nmanagement challenges persist at DHS, I believe the existing Under \nSecretary for Management position at DHS's lacks sufficient authority \nto direct the type of sustained leadership and overarching management \nintegration and transformation strategy that is needed department-wide, \nand Congress must elevate that Under Secretary's role. The legislation \nI offer today would do that and would provide the focused, high-level \nattention that will result in effective management reform. I believe \nthis legislation is vital to DHS's success, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 872\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand and improve Cooperative Threat Reduction \nPrograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Improvement Act of 2009.\n  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains the number \none national security threat facing the United States and the \ninternational community. Our success in responding to this threat \ndepends on cooperation with other nations and on maintaining a basic \nconsensus on non-proliferation principles. The Nunn-Lugar Program has \nbecome the primary tool through which the U.S. works to safely destroy \nnuclear, chemical, and biological warfare capacity. Through Nunn-Lugar, \nthe U.S. has eliminated more nuclear weapons than the combined arsenals \nof the United Kingdom, France, and China. When the Soviet Union \ndissolved Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus emerged as the third, fourth \nand eighth largest nuclear weapons powers in the world. Today they are \nnuclear weapons free.\n  I am delighted that President Obama made the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program such a high profile issue during his campaign. \nIn 2005, then-Senator Obama and I traveled to Russia to see the Nunn-\nLugar Program in action. We visited the Russian nuclear warhead storage \nfacility at Saratov and the mobile missile dismantlement facility near \nPerm. This experience gives him a unique vantage point to take \nimportant steps to revitalize and expand the program.\n  The Nunn-Lugar Program has accumulated an impressive list of \naccomplishments. To date it has deactivated 7,504 strategic nuclear \nwarheads, 742 intercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, destroyed, \n496 ICBM silos eliminated, 143 ICBM mobile launchers destroyed, 633 \nsubmarine launched ballistic missiles, SLBMs, eliminated, 476 SLBM \nlaunchers eliminated, 31 nuclear submarines capable of launching \nballistic missiles destroyed, 155 bomber eliminated, 906 nuclear air-\nto-surface missiles, ASMs, destroyed, 194 nuclear test tunnels \neliminated, 422 nuclear weapons transport train shipments secured, \nupgraded security at 24 nuclear weapons storage sites, and built and \nequipped 16 biological monitoring stations.\n  While originally focused on the states of the former Soviet Union,\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\nNunn-Lugar has also produced results outside of Russia. The program \neliminated a formerly secret chemical weapons stockpile in Albania. \nOther governments, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Congo, the \nPhilippines, and Indonesia are now inquiring about Nunn-Lugar \nassistance with dangerous weapons and materials.\n  Mr. President, last month the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, \nreleased a report on the future of the Nunn-Lugar Program. It provided \na critically important set of recommendations that should guide the \nObama Administration's efforts to expand the Nunn-Lugar Program around \nthe world.\n  The report was required by the 2008 National Defense Authorization \nAct to recommend ways to strengthen and expand the Defense Department's \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program. The report argues \npersuasively that the Nunn-Lugar Program should be expanded \ngeographically, updated in form and function and supported as an active \ntool of foreign policy. Over the last 16 years Nunn-Lugar has been \nfocused heavily on the destruction and dismantlement of massive Soviet \nweapons systems and the facilities that developed them. In the future, \nthe program will be asked to address much more complex and diverse \nsecurity threats. The changing security environment means that the \nmagnitude of projects focused on former Soviet weapons threats are \nlikely to be the exception and not the norm. As a result, the NAS \nreport argues that the program must be less cumbersome and bureaucratic \nso it can be more agile, flexible, and responsive to ensure timely \ncontributions across a larger number of countries. It concludes by \nsaying ``that expanding the nation's [Nunn-Lugar] cooperative threat \nreduction programs beyond the former Soviet Union, as proposed by \nCongress, would enhance U.S. national security and global stability.'' \nThe report argues that Nunn-Lugar ``should be expanded geographically, \nupdated in form and function . . . and supported as an active tool of \nforeign policy by engaged leadership from the White House and the \nrelevant cabinet secretaries.''\n  Specifically, the NAS Report recommends that the Pentagon take the \nfollowing steps: Remove any remaining geographic limitations on the \nprogram and streamline contracting procedures. Request from Congress \nlimited ``notwithstanding authority'' to give Nunn-Lugar the \nflexibility it needs for future engagements in unexpected locations. \nRequest that Congress exempt the Nunn-Lugar Program from the \nMiscellaneous Receipts Act to enable the program to accept funds from \nforeign countries and to co-mingle those with program funds to \naccomplish nonproliferation and disarmament goals. Review the legal and \npolicy underpinnings of the Nunn-Lugar Program because many are \ncumbersome, dated, limiting, and often diminish value and hinder \nsuccess. In addition to supporting traditional arms control and \nnonproliferation goals, Nunn-Lugar should be used to advance other \nmultilateral instruments such as the Proliferation Security Initiative \nand United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540. While the Nunn-\nLugar Program grew through the 1990s there was little corresponding \ngrowth in the size of the staff that guided policy--the office must be \nexpanded. Engage broader military components, including the Unified \nCombatant Commands, to ensure full coordination and effective \nimplementation of Nunn-Lugar.\n  The majority of these items do not require legislation but rather \nsimple Executive Branch management actions and improvements. As a \nresult, I have written to Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, \nMichele Flournoy, and the new WMD Coordinator at the White House, Gary \nSamore, urging them to adopt these important recommendations. But the \ngranting of limited notwithstanding authority for the Nunn-Lugar \nProgram and its exemption from the Miscellaneous Receipts Act does \nrequire Congressional authorization. The bill I am introducing today is \nfocused on accomplishing this task.\n  One of the most striking points made by the report's authors was that \nthe Nunn-Lugar Program has suffered from a lack of leadership. It \nstates that ``since 1995, the level of leadership in DoD has been \ndowngraded from a high priority program managed by a Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Cooperative Threat Reduction, and Special \nAssistant to the Secretary of Defense, to a CTR Policy Office under a \nDirector for the CTR Program.'' An even more stark contrast is the time \nand diplomacy that former Secretaries Perry and Cohen committed to \nvisiting project sites and engaging foreign capitals when compared to \ntheir successors. I am confident this is a trend that can be reversed \nquickly by the Obama administration with proper leadership. Under \nSecretary Flournoy, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and Secretary \nGates should make visiting Nunn-Lugar sites a high priority and offer \ntheir personal diplomacy to assisting the program in meetings its \ngoals.\n  The Nunn-Lugar Program has made critically important contributions to \nUS national security through the elimination of strategic weapons \nsystems and platforms arrayed against us. Even as the threat changes, I \nam confident that it will continue to serve US interests with the right \nleadership and direction. I commend the members of the NAS committee \nfor an insightful and invigorating set of recommendations. I ask my \ncolleagues here in the Senate to support this legislation and I am \nhopeful that the Obama administration will use the report's \nrecommendations as a resource as they move to expand the program.\n  In sum, we must take every measure possible in addressing threats \nposed by weapons of mass destruction. We must eliminate those \nconditions that restrict us or delay our ability to act. The US has the \ntechnical expertise and the diplomatic standing to dramatically benefit \ninternational security. American leaders must ensure that we have the \npolitical will and the resources to implement programs devoted to these \nends.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Udall, of New Mexico):\n  S. 874. A bill to establish El Rio Grande Del Norte National \nConservation Area in the State of New Mexico, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce El Rio Grande \nDel Norte National Conservation Area Establishment Act. This \nlegislation will designate approximately 235,980 acres of public land \nmanaged by the Bureau of Land Management in Taos and Rio Arriba \ncounties as a National Conservation Area. The conservation area \nincludes two new wilderness areas--the 13,420-acre Cerro del Yuta \nWilderness on the east-side and the 8,000-acre Rio San Antonio \nWilderness in the west.\n  The conservation area will protect and enhance cultural, ecological, \nand scenic resources in an area with premier recreational opportunities \nimportant to the region's economy. It incorporates the upper reaches of \nthe Rio Grande Gorge, previously designated as a Wild and Scenic River, \nand protects elk wintering grounds and migratory corridors along the \nplateau between Ute Mountain to the east and San Antonio Mountain to \nthe west. The conservation area will protect breeding habitat for other \ngame species like deer and antelope and for birds of prey that hunt \nthroughout the area, including peregrine falcons, golden eagles, and \nbald eagles. The riparian area along the Rio Grande also provides \nimportant habitat for brown trout and the federally-listed endangered \nsouthwestern willow flycatcher.\n  The Cerro del Yuta Wilderness will add protections to Ute Mountain, a \nmountainous and forested extinct volcano which rises to more than \n10,000 feet from an elevation of about 7,600 feet at its base. From its \npeak Ute Mountain offers views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the \neast, the deep canyon walls of the Rio Grande Gorge at its western \nbase, and the high mesa sagebrush-grasslands interspersed with pinon \njuniper woodlands that form the majority of the conservation area to \nits west. Known as Tah Ha Bien to members of the Taos Pueblo and Cerro \ndel Yuta to the earliest Hispanic settlers of the region, Ute Mountain \nwas named for the historic Ute tribe that traversed this area along its \nroute to the eastern plains. The mountain has a long history both \ngeologically and culturally speaking, and evidence of human interaction \nwith Ute Mountain can be still be found, including prehistoric hunting \nstations, historic\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\nsheep herding camps, and important sacred sites on the mountain. As a \nrelatively new addition to the public domain, the Bureau of Land \nManagement has only begun to account for all the cultural resources \nthat may be present on Ute Mountain.\n  The Rio San Antonio Wilderness Area lies northwest of San Antonio \nMountain and is currently managed as a Wilderness Study Area by the \nBureau of Land Management. Composed of grassland vegetation similar to \nthe majority of the conservation area, its unique character is shaped \nby the 200-foot-deep canyon formed by the waters of the Rio San Antonio \nthat bisects the wilderness area. The canyon provides important \nriparian habitat to wildlife and offers visitors opportunities for \nsolitude and primitive and unconfined recreation. A favorite pastime of \nlocals and visitors alike is the outstanding opportunity for fly \nfishing the Rio San Antonio. By affirmatively designating this area as \nwilderness, we can help preserve its natural character that draws \nvisitors to the area.\n  This legislation seeks to protect the valuable natural and cultural \nresources found in the area while also recognizing that the history of \nthese lands is still being written by the local community, composed of \nPueblo Indians, descendents of Hispanic and American settlers, and new \ngenerations of settlers drawn to the area for similar reasons as those \nwho came before them. Residents maintain a strong connection to these \npublic lands and are interested in preserving the traditional ways in \nwhich they have used them. A good example of this is the importance to \nthe local community to ensure that the continued and sustainable \ncollection of pinon nuts and firewood from the public lands is \npermitted. Based on this input, earlier drafts were revised to make \nspecific mention that these uses are permissible within the \nconservation area. In addition, existing grazing within the \nconservation area will be preserved consistent with current management \npractices.\n  Visitors and residents of northern New Mexico also enjoy these public \nlands for recreational purposes, including hiking, camping, mountain \nbiking, river rafting, skiing, hunting, fishing, photography and bird \nwatching, among many others. The local economy benefits greatly from \nthe tourists who visit this area to take in the scenic beauty and \nnatural character of the region, and it is my hope that this \ndesignation will further highlight the region as a premier destination \nin the State, nationally and internationally.\n  This bill is the culmination of more than 2 years of work with \nmembers of the local community to craft language that achieves the \nbalance vital to ensure a thriving economy, the preservation of the \nregion's natural resources, and a sustained way of life for residents \nof northern New Mexico. Without the constructive input from the local \ncommunity, this bill would look very different from the one that I am \nprivileged to introduce today. I am also pleased that my colleague \nSenator Tom Udall is a cosponsor of this legislation, and I look \nforward to working with him and other members of the Senate toward its \nultimate passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 874\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to regulate the judicial use of presidential signing \nstatements in the interpretation of Acts of Congress; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Grassley and Senator Tester, to offer the Presidential \nSigning Statements Act of 2009. The purpose of this bill is to regulate \nthe use of Presidential Signing Statements in the interpretation of \nActs of Congress. This bill is similar in substance to two prior \nversions of this legislation: the Presidential Signing Statements Act \nof 2007, which I introduced on June 29, 2007; and the Presidential \nSigning Statements Act of 2006, which I introduced on July 26, 2006.\n  As I have stated before, I believe that this legislation is necessary \nto protect our constitutional system of checks and balances. This bill \nachieves that goal in the following ways.\n  First, it prevents the President from issuing a signing statement \nthat alters the meaning of a statute by instructing federal and state \ncourts not to rely on, or defer to, presidential signing statements as \na source of authority when determining the meaning of any Act of \nCongress.\n  Second, it grants Congress the power to participate in any case where \nthe construction or constitutionality of any Act of Congress is in \nquestion and a presidential signing statement for that Act was issued \nby allowing Congress to file an amicus brief and present oral argument \nin such a case; instructing that, if Congress passes a joint resolution \ndeclaring its view of the correct interpretation of the statute, the \nCourt must admit that resolution into the case record; and providing \nfor expedited review in such a case.\n  Since the days of President James Monroe, Presidents have issued \nstatements when signing bills. It is widely agreed that there are \nlegitimate uses for signing statements. For example, Presidents may use \nsigning statements to instruct executive branch officials how to \nadminister a law or to explain to the public the likely effect of a \nlaw. There may be a host of other legitimate uses.\n  It is clear, however, that the President cannot use a signing \nstatement to rewrite the words of a statute, nor can he use a signing \nstatement to selectively nullify those provisions he does not like. \nThis much is clear from our Constitution. The Constitution grants the \nPresident a specific, defined role in enacting legislation. Article I, \nsection 1 of the Constitution vests ``all legislative powers . . . in a \nCongress.'' Article I, section 7 of the Constitution provides that, \nwhen a bill is presented to the President, he may either sign it or \nveto it with his objections. He may also choose to do nothing, thus \nrendering a so-called pocket veto. But the President cannot veto part \nof a bill--he cannot veto certain provisions he does not like.\n  The Framers had good reason for constructing the legislative process \nas they did. According to The Records of the Constitutional Convention, \nthe veto power was designed to protect citizens from a particular \nCongress that might enact oppressive legislation. However, the Framers \ndid not want the veto power to be unchecked, and so, in Article I, \nsection 7, they balanced it by allowing Congress to override a veto by \n2/3 vote.\n\n[[Page S4677]]\n\n  As I stated when I initially introduced this legislation in 2006, \nthis is a finely structured constitutional procedure that goes straight \nto the heart of our system of checks and balances. Any action by the \nPresident that circumvents this procedure is an unconstitutional \nattempt to usurp legislative authority. If the President is permitted \nto re-write the bills that Congress passes and cherry pick which \nprovisions he likes and does not like, he subverts the constitutional \nprocess designed by the Framers. The Supreme Court has affirmed that \nthe Constitutional process for enacting legislation must be \nsafeguarded. As the Court explained in INS v. Chahda, ``It emerges \nclearly that the prescription for legislative action in Article I, \nSection 1 and 7 represents the Framers' decision that the legislative \npower of the Federal Government be exercised in accord with a single, \nfinely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure.'' 462 U.S. 919, \n951, 1982.\n  It is well within Congress's power to enact rules of statutory \ninterpretation intended to preserve this constitutional structure. This \npower flows from Article I, section 8, clause 18 of the Constitution, \nwhich gives Congress the power ``To make all laws which shall be \nnecessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, \nand all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of \nthe U.S., or in any department or officer thereof.'' Rules of statutory \ninterpretation are ``necessary and proper'' to execute the legislative \npower.\n  Several scholars have agreed: Jefferson B. Fordham, a former Dean of \nthe University of Pennsylvania Law School said, ``[I]t is within the \nlegislative power to lay down rules of interpretation for the future;'' \nMark Tushnet, a Professor at Harvard Law School explained, ``In light \nof the obvious congressional power to prescribe a statute's terms (and \nso its meaning), congressional power to prescribe interpretive methods \nseems to me to follow;'' Michael Stokes Paulsen, an Associate Dean of \nthe University of Minnesota Law School noted, ``Congress is the master \nof its own statutes and can prescribe rules of interpretation governing \nits own statutes as surely as it may alter or amend the statutes \ndirectly.'' Finally, J. Sutherland, the author of the leading multi-\nvolume treatise for the rules of statutory construction has said, \n``There should be no question that an interpretive clause operating \nprospectively is within legislative power.''\n  Indeed, recent experience shows why such legislation is \n``necessary.'' The use of signing statements has risen dramatically in \nrecent years. President Clinton issued 105 signing statements; \nPresident Bush issued 161. What is more alarming than the sheer \nnumbers, is that President Bush's signing statements often raised \nconstitutional concerns and other objections to several provisions of a \nlaw. The President used those statements in a way that threatened to \nrender the legislative process a virtual nullity, making it completely \nunpredictable how certain laws will be enforced. Even where Congress \nmanaged to negotiate checks on executive power, the President used \nsigning statements to override the legislative language and defy \ncongressional intent.\n  Two prominent examples make the point. In 2006, I spearheaded the \ndelicate negotiations on the PATRIOT Act Reauthorization, which \nincluded months of painstaking efforts to balance national security and \ncivil liberties, disrupted by the dramatic disclosure of the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program. The final version of the bill featured a \ncarefully crafted compromise necessary to secure the act's passage. \nAmong other things, it included several oversight provisions designed \nto ensure that the FBI did not abuse special terrorism-related powers \npermitting it to make secret demands for business records. The \nPresident dutifully signed the measure into law, only to then enter a \nsigning statement insisting he could withhold any information from \nCongress required by the oversight provisions if he decided that \ndisclosure would ``impair foreign relations, national security, the \ndeliberative process of the executive, or the performance of the \nexecutive's constitutional duties.''\n  The second example arose in 2005. Congress overwhelmingly passed \nSenator John McCain's amendment to ban all U.S. personnel from \ninflicting ``cruel, inhuman or degrading'' treatment on any prisoner \nheld by the United States. There was no ambiguity in Congress's intent; \nin fact, the Senate approved it 90 to 9. However, after signing the \nbill into law, the President quietly issued a signing statement \nasserting that his Administration would construe it ``in a manner \nconsistent with the constitutional authority of the President to \nsupervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and \nconsistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power.''\n  Many understood this signing statement to undermine the legislation. \nIn a January 4, 2006 article titled, ``Bush could bypass new torture \nban: Waiver right is reserved,'' the Boston Globe cited an anonymous \n``senior administration official'' as saying, ``the president intended \nto reserve the right to use harsher methods in special situations \ninvolving national security.''\n  As outrageous as these signing statements are, intruding on the \nConstitution's delegation of ``all legislative powers'' to the \nCongress, it is even more outrageous that Congress has done nothing to \nprotect its constitutional powers. In 2006 and 2007, the legislation I \nintroduced giving Congress standing to challenge the constitutionality \nof these signing statements failed to muster the veto-proof majority it \nwould have surely required.\n  With a new administration, I believe the time has come to pass this \nimportant legislation. This bill does not seek to limit the President's \npower, and it does not seek to expand Congress's power. Rather, this \nbill simply seeks to safeguard our Constitution. In this Congress, it \nhas a better chance of mustering a majority vote and being signed into \nlaw by the new President.\n  That said, two days after criticizing President Bush's signing \nstatements, President Obama issued one of his own regarding the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act of 2009. Citing among others his ``commander in \nchief'' and ``foreign affairs'' powers, he refused to be bound by at \nleast eleven specific provisions of the bill including one long-\nstanding rider to appropriations bills designed to aid congressional \noversight. As I told The Wall Street Journal, ``We are having a repeat \nof what Democrats bitterly complained about under President Bush.'' I \nhope this will be the exception rather than the rule.\n  In the meantime, this bill seeks to implement measures that will \nsafeguard the constitutional structure of enacting legislation. In \npreserving this structure, this bill reinforces the system of checks \nand balances and separation of powers set out in our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 875\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Presidential Signing \n     Statements Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION.\n\n       As used in this Act, the term ``presidential signing \n     statement'' means a statement issued by the President about a \n     bill, in conjunction with signing that bill into law pursuant \n     to Article I, section 7, of the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 3. JUDICIAL USE OF PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS.\n\n       In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, no \n     Federal or State court shall rely on or defer to a \n     presidential signing statement as a source of authority.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN COURT \n                   PROCEEDINGS OR SUBMIT CLARIFYING RESOLUTION.\n\n       (a) Congressional Right To Participate as Amicus Curiae.--\n     In any action, suit, or proceeding in any Federal or State \n     court (including the Supreme Court of the United States), \n     regarding the construction or constitutionality, or both, of \n     any Act of Congress in which a presidential signing statement \n     was issued, the Federal or State Court shall permit the \n     United States Senate, through the Office of Senate Legal \n     Counsel, as authorized in section 701 of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978 (2 U.S.C. 288), or the United States \n     House of Representatives, through the Office of General \n     Counsel for the United States House of Representatives, or \n     both, to participate as an amicus curiae, and to present an \n     oral argument on the question of the Act's construction or \n     constitutionality, or both.

If Congress does pass such a \n     concurrent resolution, the Federal or State court shall \n     permit the United States Congress, through the Office of \n     Senate Legal Counsel, to submit that resolution into the \n     record of the case as a matter of right.\n       (c) Expedited Consideration.--It shall be the duty of each \n     Federal or State court, including the Supreme Court of the \n     United States, to advance on the docket and to expedite to \n     the greatest possible extent the disposition of any matter \n     brought under subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 876. A bill to provide for the substitution of the United States \nin certain civil actions relating to electronic service providers and \nFISA; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to reintroduce \nlegislation that would substitute the United States in the place of \nelectronic communications service providers who were sued for violating \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, and other statutory \nand constitutional provisions.\n  FISA reform legislation passed the Senate in February and July of \n2008, both times by a vote of 68 to 29, before being signed into law by \nPresident Bush on July 10, 2008. This legislation made many necessary \nchanges to FISA to enhance our intelligence collection capabilities, \nbut it also included a controversial provision giving retroactive \nimmunity to telecommunications companies for their alleged cooperation \nwith the warrantless surveillance program authorized by the President \nafter September 11, 2001. The legislation stripped the Federal courts \nof jurisdiction to decide more than 40 consolidated cases involving \nclaims of violations of FISA and related statutes, even though most \nMembers of Congress had not been briefed on the program, and despite \nthe fact that the judge handling the cases, Chief Judge Vaughn Walker \nof the Northern District of California, had questioned the legality of \nthe program in a related opinion issued just days before the final \nSenate debate.\n  During the February and July FISA debates, I sought to keep the \ncourts open as a way to check executive branch excesses. Through both a \nstand-alone bill, S. 2402, considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand an amendment, SA 3927 to S. 2248, offered during the Senate's \nFebruary debate on the FISA reform bill, I proposed to substitute the \nU.S. Government for the telephone companies facing lawsuits for their \nalleged cooperation with the Terrorist Surveillance Program, TSP. Just \nas in 2008, I propose legislation that would place the Government in \nthe shoes of the telephone companies, with the same defenses no more \nand no less. Thus, under the bill, plaintiffs get their day in court \nand may hold the Government accountable for unlawful activity, if any, \nrelated to the surveillance program. At the same time, the carriers \nthemselves avoid liability stemming from their efforts to be good \ncitizens.\n  I fought hard in 2008 to keep the courts open on the question of the \nTSP, and urged my colleagues to improve the FISA bill. I continue that \nfight today with a new Administration in office. During the prior floor \ndebate I said: ``Although I am prepared to stomach this bill, if I \nmust, I am not yet ready to concede that the debate is over. Contrary \nto the conventional wisdom, I don't believe it is too late to make this \nbill better.''\n  As I observed on the floor last year, it is necessary for Congress to \nsupport intelligence collection efforts because of the continuing \nterrorist threat. No one wants to be blamed for another 9-11. Indeed, \nas I acknowledged during the debate, my own briefings on the telephone \ncompanies' cooperation with the Government convinced me of the \nprogram's value. Nevertheless, I tried to impress upon my colleagues \nthe importance and historical context of our actions. I said:\n\n       We are dealing here with a matter that is of historic \n     importance. I believe that years from now, historians will \n     look back on this period from 9/11 to the present as the \n     greatest expansion of Executive authority in history--\n     unchecked expansion of authority. The President disregards \n     the National Security Act of 1947 mandating notice to the \n     Intelligence Committee; he doesn't do it. The President takes \n     legislation that is presented by Congress and he signs it, \n     and then he issues a signing statement disagreeing with key \n     provisions. There is nothing Congress can do about it.\n       The Supreme Court of the United States has gone absent \n     without leave on the issue, in my legal opinion. When the \n     Detroit Federal judge found the terrorist surveillance \n     program unconstitutional, it was [reversed] by the Sixth \n     Circuit on a 2-to-1 opinion on grounds of lack of standing. \n     Then the Supreme Court refused to review the case. But the \n     very formidable dissenting opinion laid out all of the \n     grounds where there was ample basis to grant standing. Now we \n     have Chief Judge Walker declaring the [surveillance illegal]. \n     The Congress ought to let the courts fulfill their \n     constitutional function.\n\n  It is not too late to provide for judicial review of controversial \npost-9/11 intelligence surveillance activities. The cases before Judge \nVaughn Walker are still pending and, even if he were to dismiss them \nunder the statutory defenses dubbed retroactive immunity, Congress can \nand should permit the cases to be refiled against the Government, \nstanding in the shoes of the carriers.\n  This legislation substitutes the U.S. in place of any electronic \ncommunication service provider who provided communications in \nconnection with an intelligence activity that was: authorized by the \nPresident between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007; and \ndesigned to detect or prevent a terrorist attack against the U.S. In \norder for substitution to apply, the electronic communications service \nprovider must have received a written request from the Attorney General \nor the head of an element of the intelligence community indicating that \nthe activity was authorized by the President and determined to be \nlawful. If the provider assisted the Government beyond what was \nrequested in writing, this legislation will provide no relief to the \nservice provider.\n  The legislation also establishes a limited waiver of sovereign \nimmunity that only applies to ``covered civil actions'' essentially, \nthe 40 cases currently pending before the U.S. District Court in the \nNorthern District of California. This is to prevent the Government from \nasserting immunity in the event it is substituted for the current \ndefendants.\n  We can still pass legislation substituting the Government for the \nvarious telecom defendants and have a judicial assessment of the \nconstitutionality and legality of the controversial surveillance. Such \na judicial assessment is necessary to resolve the clash between the \nExecutive and Legislative branches over the legality and \nconstitutionality of the surveillance program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 876\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT TO FISA.\n\n       Title III of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 Amendments Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-261) is amended \n     by inserting at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 302.

A bill to provide for the non-discretionary Supreme Court \nreview of certain civil actions relating to the legality and \nconstitutionality of surveillance activities; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation that will mandate Supreme Court review of challenges to the \nwarrantless wiretapping program authorized by President Bush after 9/\n11, commonly known as the Terrorist Surveillance Program or TSP.\n  While the Supreme Court generally exercises discretion as to whether \nit will review a case or grant ``certiorari,'' there are precedents for \nCongress to direct Supreme Court review on constitutional issues--\nincluding the statutes forbidding flag burning and requiring Congress \nto abide by Federal employment laws--and the gravity of this issue \nmerits Congressional action.\n  In August 2006, Judge Anna Diggs Taylor of the U.S. District Court \nfor\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\nthe Eastern District of Michigan issued a 43-page opinion finding the \nTSP unconstitutional. At the time, many applauded and many others \ncriticized her decision, but we have yet to see appellate review on the \nmerits. Instead, in July 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th \nCircuit overturned the district court's decision on other grounds. By a \n2-1 vote, in ACLU v. NSA, it declined to rule on the legality of the \nprogram, finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit. \nThe Supreme Court then declined to hear the case, even though the \ndoctrine of standing has enough flexibility, as demonstrated by the \ndissent in the 6th Circuit, to have enabled it to take up this \nfundamental clash between Congress and the President.\n  With the Supreme Court abstaining, another lone district judge took a \nstand. In In re National Security Agency Telecommunications Records \nLitigation, Chief Judge Vaughn Walker in the Northern District of \nCalifornia considered a case brought by an Islamic charity that claims \nto have been a subject of the surveillance program. In a 56-page \nopinion he held that Congress's enactment of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act of 1978, FISA, had constrained the President's \ninherent authority--if any--to conduct warrantless wiretapping: \n``Congress appears clearly to have intended to--and did--establish the \nexclusive means for foreign intelligence surveillance activities to be \nconducted. Whatever power the executive may otherwise have had in this \nregard, FISA limits the power of the executive branch to conduct such \nactivities.'' Nevertheless, this finding is preliminary.\n  Whatever Chief Judge Walker ultimately decides, my bill will permit \nany party who is disaffected by a subsequent decision in the Ninth \nCircuit to have the case heard by the Supreme Court by eliminating \ndiscretionary review. Under my bill, the Supreme Court would also have \nto review appeals concerning the constitutionality or legality of: the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program writ large; the statutory immunity for \ntelecommunications providers created by Title II of the FISA Amendments \nAct of 2008; and any other intelligence activity involving \ncommunications that was authorized by the President during the period \nbeginning on September 11, 2001, and ending at such time as the \nactivity was approved by a Federal court.\n  Relying on similar precedents, the bill requires the High Court to \nexpedite its consideration of such cases. The bill, however, is limited \nto circumstances where the Court has not previously decided the \nquestion at issue. Thus, it does not create a permanent right of review \nfor all similarly situated parties, but it does require the Court to \ntake up the matter in the first instance.\n  Congress clearly has the power to require appellate review by the \nSupreme Court under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, and it \nhas exercised this prerogative. For example, 28 U.S.C. Sec.  3904 \nprovides for direct appeal to the Supreme Court of decisions ``upon the \nconstitutionality'' of the Congressional Accountability Act if the \nCourt ``has not previously ruled on the question'' and requires the \nCourt to ``expedite the appeal.'' Congress used nearly identical \nlanguage to provide for direct appeal and expedited Supreme Court \nreview of the constitutionality of a ban on flag burning in 18 U.S.C. \nSec.  700.\n  I propose similar action here. It is hard to conceive of a better \ncase to have finally decided in the Supreme Court than one which \nchallenges the legality of warrantless wiretapping--or the \nconstitutionality of the retroactive statutory defenses passed by \nCongress last year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 877\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act to provide immunity \nfor reports of suspected terrorist activity or suspicious behavior and \nresponse; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai, \nIndia, are a sobering reminder that terrorists continue to threaten our \nNation and civilized people throughout the world. An alert citizenry is \nour first line of defense against terrorist attacks, particularly \nattacks like those in Mumbai. Our laws must protect individuals from \nfrivolous lawsuits when they report, in good faith, suspicious behavior \nthat may indicate terrorist activity. That is why I am introducing \nlegislation, with Senator Lieberman, that will provide these important \nprotections.\n  In the 2007 homeland security law, Chairman Lieberman and I \ncoauthored a provision to encourage people to report potential \nterrorist threats directed against transportation systems. This new \nlegislation would expand those protections to reports of suspicious \nbehavior in sectors other than transportation. For example, reports of \nsuspicious activity could be equally important in detecting terrorist \nplans to attack ``soft targets'' like the hotels, restaurants, and \nreligious institutions targeted in Mumbai.\n  Real life examples highlight the need for this bill. In December \n2008, a Federal jury convicted 5 men from New Jersey of conspiring to \nmurder American soldiers at Fort Dix. According to law enforcement \nofficials, the report of an alert store clerk, who reported that a \ncustomer had brought in a video showing men firing weapons and shouting \nin Arabic, triggered their investigation. But for the report of this \nvigilant store clerk, law enforcement may not have disrupted this plot \nagainst Fort Dix.\n  That store clerk's action likely saved hundreds of lives. It also \nreveals a core truth of the dangerous times in which we live. Our \nsafety depends on more than just police officers, intelligence \nanalysts, and soldiers. It also depends on the alertness and civic \nresponsibility of all Americans.\n  We must encourage citizens to be watchful and to report suspicious \nactivity whenever it occurs. That imperative is even stronger in the \naftermath of the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, where it \nappears that the terrorists performed reconnaissance on a number of the \ntargets before the actual attacks.\n  Senator Lieberman and I recently convened two hearings in the \nHomeland Security Committee to examine lessons learned from those \nhorrific attacks. These hearings have reinforced our long-standing \nconcern that terrorists might shift their attention from high-value, \nhigh-security targets to less secure commercial facilities, where there \nis the potential for mass casualties and widespread panic. As we \nwitnessed during the three-day siege of Mumbai, commercial facilities \nor ``soft\n\n[[Page S4681]]\n\ntargets,'' such as the Taj Mahal, Trident, and Oberoi Hotels, are \nvulnerable, tempting targets.\n  Many of the Committee's witnesses during these hearings, including \nCharles Allen, DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer, Donald Van Duyn, the \nFBI's Chief Intelligence Officer, New York City Police Commissioner \nRaymond Kelley, and Al Orlob, Marriott International's Vice President \nfor Corporate Security, endorsed the idea of expanding the 2007 law \nbeyond the transportation sector. Indeed, Commissioner Kelley said that \nthe 2007 law ``made eminently good sense'' and recommended ``that it be \nexpanded [to other sectors] if at all possible.''\n  Unfortunately, we have seen that our legal system can be used to \nchill the willingness of citizens to come forward and report possible \ndangers. As widely reported by the media in 2006, US Airways removed 6 \nIslamic clerics from a flight after other passengers expressed concerns \nthat some of the clerics had moved out of the their assigned seats and \nhad requested, but were not using, seat belt extenders that could \npossibly double as weapons. In response to these concerns, US Airways \nofficials removed these individuals from the plane so that they could \nfurther investigate.\n\n  For voicing their reasonable fears that these passengers could be \nrehearsing or preparing to execute a hijacking, these honestly \nconcerned travelers found themselves as defendants in a civil rights \nlawsuit and accused of bigotry. The old adage about how ``no good deed \ngoes unpunished'' is quite apt here.\n  The existence of this lawsuit clearly illustrates how unfair it is to \nallow private citizens to be intimidated into silence by the threat of \nlitigation. Would the passengers have spoken up if they had anticipated \nthat there would be a lawsuit filed against them? Even if such suits \nfail, they can expose citizens to heavy costs in time and legal fees.\n  The bill we introduce today would provide civil immunity in American \ncourts for any person acting in good faith who reports any suspicious \ntransaction, activity, or occurrence related to an act of terrorism. \nSpecifically, the bill would encourage people to pass on information to \nFederal officials with responsibility for preventing, protecting \nagainst, disrupting, or responding to a terrorist act or to Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement officials without fear of being sued \nfor doing their civic duty. Only disclosures made to those responsible \nofficials would be protected by the legislation.\n  Once a report is received, those officials would be responsible for \nassessing its reasonableness and determining whether further action is \nrequired. If they take reasonable action to mitigate the reported \nthreat, they, too, would be protected from lawsuits. Just as we should \nnot discourage reporting suspicious incidents, we also should not \ndiscourage reasonable responses to them.\n  Let me make very clear that this bill does not offer any protection \nwhatsoever if an individual makes a statement that he or she knows to \nbe false. No one will be able to use this protection as cover for \nmischievous, vengeful, or biased falsehoods.\n  Our laws and legal system must not be hijacked to intimidate people \ninto silence or to prevent our officials from responding to terrorist \nthreats. Protecting citizens who make good faith reports--and that's an \nimportant condition in this bill--of potentially lethal activities is \nessential to maintaining our homeland security. Our bill offers \nprotection in a measured way that discourages abuses from either side.\n  Each of us has an important responsibility in the fight against \nterrorism. It is not a fight that can be left to law enforcement alone. \nThe police simply can't be everywhere. Whether at a hotel, a mall, or \nan arena, homeland security and law enforcement officials need all \ncitizens to alert them to unattended packages and behavior that appears \nout of the ordinary.\n  Many national organizations, such as the Fraternal Order of Police, \nthe National Sheriffs' Association, the National Troopers Coalition, \nand the National Association of Town Watch, support this legislation.\n  If someone ``sees something'' suspicious, Congress has an obligation \nto ensure that he or she will ``say something'' about it. This bill \npromotes and protects that civic duty. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n                                   National Troopers Coalition\n\n                                                   March 24, 2009.\n     Hon.

We \n     applaud your efforts to keep this country safe.\n       Our nation is currently at war against terrorists that want \n     to destroy our country and disrupt our way of life. It is \n     vital that we remain vigilant in our efforts to combat \n     terrorism and keep our country safe. The See Something, Say \n     Something Act, will provide necessary liability protections \n     for citizens that report suspicious activity and for law \n     enforcement officers that act upon these reports. We live in \n     a litigious society and one should not be fearful of \n     litigation when determining if he or she should report \n     suspicious activities that could prevent catastrophic loss of \n     life. What we have learned in our efforts to combat terrorism \n     is that everyone needs to remain vigilant and report all \n     suspicious activities.\n       We support your efforts to provide liability protections \n     for citizens acting in good faith that report suspicious \n     activity. We can not turn a ``blind eye'' to the terrorists \n     we are fighting and we must encourage and support an ever \n     vigilant society.\n           Respectfully,\n     A. Bradford Card,\n       Federal Government Affairs (NTC), for: Michael Edes, \n     Chairman, National Troopers Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 24, 2009.\n     Hon.

Collins,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Sheriffs' \n     Association (NSA), I am writing to express our support for \n     the See Something, Say something Act of 2009.\n       As you may know, the National Sheriffs' Association is the \n     creator of the Neighborhood Watch Program which is one of the \n     oldest and best-known citizen and law enforcement based crime \n     prevention concepts in the United States. In the late 1960s, \n     an increase in crime heightened the need for a crime \n     prevention initiative focused on residential areas involving \n     local citizens. We responded, creating the National \n     Neighborhood Watch Program in 1972 to assist citizens and law \n     enforcement.\n       For nearly four decades, particularly after the terrorist \n     attacks in 2001, the nation's sheriffs have witnessed \n     firsthand, citizens becoming more empowered by becoming \n     active in homeland security efforts through participation in \n     Neighborhood Watch. Thus, we understand and recognize the \n     importance of encouraging citizen involvement and the role \n     they play in ensuring homeland security.\n       The proposed measure would build on this concept by \n     providing the needed legal protections to individuals who \n     report suspicious activity to an authorized official, in good \n     faith, that might reflect terrorist threats. Additionally, it \n     would provide qualified immunity from civil liability for an \n     authorized official who takes reasonable action in good faith \n     to respond to the reported activity.\n       We thank you for your continued leadership and support of \n     the nation's emergency responders.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Sheriff David A. Goad,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       National Association of\n\n                                                   Town Watch,\n\n                                    Wynnewood, PA, March 24, 2009.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Town Watch (NATW), I am writing to express our support for \n     the See Something, Say Something Act of 2009.\n       The National Association of Town Watch is a nonprofit, \n     crime prevention organization whose members include citizen \n     crime watch groups, law enforcement agencies and other \n     organizations across the country involved in organized, \n     anticrime activities. NATW also sponsors the annual \n     ``National Night Out'' crime prevention event which has grown \n     to involve over 15,000 communities from all 50 states on the \n     first Tuesday each August.\n       Since 1981, NATW has always promoted the concept of \n     citizens working in close cooperation with their local law \n     enforcement and serving as ``extra eyes and ears.'' The \n     proposed legislation blends beautifully with NATW's mission. \n     It is critical to legally protect individuals who report \n     suspicious activity to an authorized official, in good faith, \n     that might reflect terrorist threats. This legislation also \n     would provide qualified immunity from civil liability for an \n     authorized official who takes reasonable action in good faith \n     to respond to the reported activity.\n       We thank you for bringing this legislation forward and for \n     supporting law enforcement\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\n     and concerned citizens across our great nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Matt A. Peskin,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Fraternal Order\n\n\n                                                    of Police,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2009.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins, On behalf of the membership of the \n     Fraternal Order of Police, I am writing to advise you of our \n     strong support for the bill you have introduced entitled the \n     ``See Something, Say Something Act.''\n       Following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 every \n     American, especially law enforcement officers, have become \n     more vigilant. Unfortunately, the increasingly litigious \n     nature of our society may result in many citizens choosing to \n     ``stay out of it''--even if they see something or someone \n     suspicious. Citizens who have reported suspicious activity \n     and law enforcement officers who have acted on these reports \n     have been sued in Federal, State and local courts even though \n     their concerns were reasonable and without malice. The result \n     is that all of us may be more hesitant to report or act upon \n     any suspicious behavior we might see.\n       Congress took a step in the right direction in 2007 when it \n     passed legislation granting immunity from civil liability for \n     citizens who report suspicious activity and law enforcement \n     officers who act upon such reports involving threats to \n     transportation security. Your bill would expand this immunity \n     to cover all suspicious activity whether it is in a train \n     station, a Federal building, or a sports stadium. This bill \n     will not only protect vigilant individuals from frivolous \n     lawsuits, but it also greatly increases our nation's \n     security.\n       On behalf of the more than 327,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, I would like to thank you again for your \n     leadership on this issue. If I can be of any further \n     assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me, or \n     Executive Director Jim Pasco, in my Washington office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n                                               National President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Begich, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 881. A bill to provide for the settlement of certain claims under \nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, The Tlingit and Haida people, the first \npeople of Southeast Alaska, were perhaps the first group of Alaska \nnatives to organize for the purpose of asserting their aboriginal land \nclaims. The native land claims movement in the rest of Alaska did not \ngain momentum until the 1960s when aboriginal land titles were \nthreatened by the impending construction of the Trans Alaska Pipeline. \nIn Southeast Alaska, the taking of Native lands for the Tongass \nNational Forest and Glacier Bay National Monument spurred the Tlingit \nand Haida people to fight to recover their lands in the early part of \nthe 20th Century.\n  One of the first steps in this battle came with the formation of the \nAlaska Native Brotherhood in 1912. In 1935, the Jurisdictional Act, \nwhich allowed the Tlingit and Haida Indians to pursue their land claims \nin the U.S. Court of Claims, was enacted by Congress.\n  After decades of litigation, the native people of Southeast Alaska \nreceived a cash settlement in 1968 from the Court of Claims for the \nland previously taken to create the Tongass National Forest and the \nGlacier Bay National Monument. Yes, there was a cash settlement of $7.5 \nmillion, but the Native people of Southeast Alaska have long believed \nthat it did not adequately compensate them for the loss of their lands \nand resources.\n  Beware of the law of unintended consequences. When the native people \nof Southeast Alaska chose to pursue their land claims in court they \ncould not have foreseen that Congress would ultimately settle the land \nclaims of all of Alaska's native people through the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act of 1971. Nor could they have foreseen that they \nwould be disadvantaged in obtaining the return of their aboriginal \nlands because of their early, and ultimately successful, effort to \nlitigate their land claims. Sadly this was the case.\n  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 imposed a series of \nhighly prescriptive limitations on the lands that Sealaska Corporation, \nthe regional Alaska Native Corporation formed for Southeast Alaska, \ncould select in satisfaction of the Tlingit and Haida land claim. None \nof the other 11 Alaska-based regional native corporations were subject \nto these limitations. Today, I join with my Alaska colleague, Sen. Mark \nBegich, cosponsored by Sens. Daniel Akaka and Daniel Inouye to \nintroduce legislation to right this wrong.\n  For the most part, Sealaska Corporation has agreed to live within the \nconstraints imposed by the 1971 legislation. It has taken conveyance of \nroughly 290,000 acres from the pool of lands it was allowed to select \nunder the 1971 act. As Sealaska moves to finalize its land selections \nit has asked the Congress for flexibility to receive title to certain \nlands that it was not permitted to select under the prescriptive, and \nas Sealaska believes, discriminatory, limitations contained in the 1971 \nlegislation.\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today would allow Sealaska to \nselect its remaining entitlement from outside of the withdrawal areas \npermitted in the 1971 legislation. It allows the Native Corporation to \nselect up to 3,600 acres of its remaining land entitlement from lands \nwith sacred, cultural, traditional or historical significance \nthroughout the Alaska Panhandle. Substantial restrictions will be \nplaced on the use of these lands.\n  Up to 5,000 acres of land could be selected for non-timber related \neconomic development. These lands are called ``Native Futures'' Sites \nin the bill. Other lands referred to as ``economic development lands'' \nin the bill could be used for timber related and non-timber related \neconomic development. These lands are on Prince of Wales Island, on \nnearby Kosciusko Island.\n  Sealaska observes that if it were required to take title to lands \nwithin the constraints prescribed by the 1971 legislation it would take \ntitle to large swaths of roadless acres in pristine portions of the \nTongass National Forest. The lands it proposes to take for economic \nuses under this legislation are predominantly in roaded and less \nsensitive areas of the Tongass National Forest.\n  The pools of lands that would be available to Sealaska under this \nlegislation are depicted on a series of maps referred to in the bill. \nIt must be emphasized that not all of the lands depicted on these maps \nwill end up in Sealaska's ownership. Sealaska cannot receive title to \nlands in excess of its remaining acreage entitlement under the 1971 \nlegislation and this legislation does not change that entitlement.\n  Early in the 110th Congress, several of our friends in the other body \nintroduced H.R. 3560 to address these issues. Later in September 2008 I \nintroduced legislation similar to this bill to give all parties time to \nthoroughly review the measure. Over the past two years, Sealaska, and \nthe communities of Southeast Alaska have worked collaboratively in good \nfaith to identify issues that may arise from the transfer of lands on \nwhich those communities have relied for subsistence and recreation out \nof the Tongass National Forest and into native corporation ownership. \nMy colleagues in the Alaska congressional delegation and I have devoted \na great deal of time in reaching out and encouraging comment from \nSoutheast Alaska on this new bill. Sealaska has itself conducted \nnumerous public meetings on the bill throughout the region. I believe \nthat these efforts have helped us to formulate a bill that addresses \nthe concerns we most frequently heard.\n  The legislation we are introducing today in the 111th Congress is \ndifferent from the original bill in numerous respects. In some cases, \nthe lands open to Sealaska selection have changed from those that were \navailable in the first House bill to accommodate community concerns. \nFor example, this bill, compared to last September's version, reduces \nthe economic development timber land selection pool to about 78,000 \nacres from 80,000 to protect additional boat anchorages by retention of \nshoreline timber in Shipley Bay on northern Prince of Wales Island and \nat Cape Pole on southwest Kosciusko Island. It eliminates the Lacy \nCover Native Futures Site on northern Chichagof Island, it provides \nfull public access across sacred sites and historic trail conveyances \nnear Yakutat and Kake. It addresses the concern of the Huna Indian \nAssociation for management of sacred sites in Glacier Bay and it deals \nwith a complaint about the original\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\nbill by the U.S. Forest Service. Our conversations have led to \nprecedent setting commitment by the Sealaska Corporation to maintain \npublic access to the economic development lands it receives on Prince \nof Wales Island for subsistence uses and recreational access. These \ncommitments are laid out in section 4(d) of this bill.\n  Sealaska also has offered a series of commitments to ensure that the \nbenefits of this legislation flow to the broader Southeast Alaska \neconomy and not just to the Corporation and its native shareholders. \nThese commitments are memorialized in a letter from Sealaska's \nchairman, Alaska State Senator Albert Kookesh, and its president and \nchief executive officer, Chris E. McNeil, Jr.\n  We all hope that after 38 years that this measure can advance to \npassage this Congress and resolve the last 65,000 to 85,000 acres of \nentitlement that southeast Alaska's 23,000 Native shareholders have \nlong had a right to receive. It is impossible to expect Alaska's native \ncorporations to provide meaningful assistance to Alaska's native \ncommunity if they continue to be denied the lands that Congress \nintended them to receive to utilize to provide economic benefits for \nthe native people's of the State. I hope this measure can pass and \nbecome law before the 40th anniversary of the claims settlement act in \n2011. Justice delayed truly is justice denied.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no ojbection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 881\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Southeast Alaska Native Land \n     Entitlement Finalization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) in 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) to recognize and \n     settle the aboriginal claims of Alaska Natives to land \n     historically used by Alaska Natives for traditional, \n     cultural, and spiritual purposes; and\n       (B) that Act declared that the land settlement ``should be \n     accomplished rapidly, with certainty, in conformity with the \n     real economic and social needs of Natives'';\n       (2) the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 \n     et seq.)--\n       (A) authorized the distribution of approximately \n     $1,000,000,000 and 44,000,000 acres of land to Alaska \n     Natives; and\n       (B) provided for the establishment of Native Corporations \n     to receive and manage the funds and that land to meet the \n     cultural, social, and economic needs of Native shareholders;\n       (3) under section 12 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \n     Act (43 U.S.C. 1611), each Regional Corporation, other than \n     Sealaska Corporation (the Regional Corporation for southeast \n     Alaska) (referred to in this Act as ``Sealaska''), was \n     authorized to receive a share of land based on the proportion \n     that the number of Alaska Native shareholders residing in the \n     region of the Regional Corporation bore to the total number \n     of Alaska Native shareholders, or the relative size of the \n     area to which the Regional Corporation had an aboriginal land \n     claim bore to the size of the area to which all Regional \n     Corporations had aboriginal land claims;\n       (4)(A) Sealaska, the Regional Corporation for southeast \n     Alaska, 1 of the Regional Corporations with the largest \n     number of Alaska Native shareholders, with more than 21 \n     percent of all original Alaska Native shareholders, did not \n     receive land under section 12 of the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1611);\n       (B) the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska was 1 of \n     the entities representing the Alaska Natives of southeast \n     Alaska before the date of enactment of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.); and\n       (C) Sealaska did not receive land in proportion to the \n     number of Alaska Native shareholders, or in proportion to the \n     size of the area to which Sealaska had an aboriginal land \n     claim, in part because of a United States Court of Claims \n     cash settlement to the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of \n     Alaska in 1968 for land previously taken to create the \n     Tongass National Forest and Glacier Bay National Monument;\n       (5) the Court of Claims cash settlement of $7,500,000 did \n     not--\n       (A) adequately compensate the Alaska Natives of southeast \n     Alaska for the significant quantity of land and resources \n     lost as a result of the creation of the Tongass National \n     Forest and Glacier Bay National Monument or other losses of \n     land and resources; or\n       (B) justify the significant disparate treatment of Sealaska \n     under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. \n     1611);\n       (6)(A) while each other Regional Corporation received a \n     significant quantity of land under sections 12 and 14 of the \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1611, 1613), \n     Sealaska only received land under section 14(h) of that Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1613(h)), which provided a 2,000,000-acre land \n     pool from which Alaska Native selections could be made for \n     historic sites, cemetery sites, Urban Corporation land, \n     Native group land, and Native Allotments;\n       (B) under section 14(h)(8) of that Act (43 U.S.C. \n     1613(h)(8)), after selections are made under paragraphs (1) \n     through (7) of that section, the land remaining in the \n     2,000,000-acre land pool is allocated based on the proportion \n     that the original Alaska Native shareholder population of a \n     Regional Corporation bore to the original Alaska Native \n     shareholder population of all Regional Corporations; and\n       (C) the only land entitlement of Sealaska derives from a \n     proportion of leftover land remaining from the 2,000,000-acre \n     land pool, estimated as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     at approximately 1,700,000 acres;\n       (7) despite the small land base of Sealaska as compared to \n     other Regional Corporations (less than 1 percent of the total \n     quantity of land allocated pursuant to the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)), Sealaska \n     has--\n       (A) provided considerable benefits to shareholders; and\n       (B) been a significant economic force in southeast Alaska;\n       (8) pursuant to the revenue sharing provisions of section \n     7(i) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. \n     1606(i)), Sealaska has distributed more than $300,000,000 \n     during the period beginning on January 1, 1971, and ending on \n     December 31, 2005, to Native Corporations throughout the \n     State of Alaska from the development of natural resources, \n     which accounts for 42 percent of the total revenues shared \n     under that section during that period;\n       (9) as a result of the small land entitlement of Sealaska, \n     it is critical that the remaining land entitlement \n     conveyances to Sealaska under the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) are fulfilled to \n     continue to meet the economic, social, and cultural needs of \n     the Alaska Native shareholders of southeast Alaska and the \n     Alaska Native community throughout Alaska;\n       (10)(A) the conveyance requirements of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) for southeast \n     Alaska limit the land eligible for conveyance to Sealaska to \n     the original withdrawal areas surrounding 10 Alaska Native \n     villages in southeast Alaska, which precludes Sealaska from \n     selecting land located--\n       (i) in any withdrawal area established for the Urban \n     Corporations for Sitka and Juneau, Alaska; or\n       (ii) outside the 10 Alaska Native village withdrawal areas; \n     and\n       (B) unlike other Regional Corporations, Sealaska was not \n     authorized to request land located outside the withdrawal \n     areas described in subparagraph (A) if the withdrawal areas \n     were insufficient to complete the land entitlement of \n     Sealaska under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);\n       (11) 44 percent (820,000 acres) of the 10 Alaska Native \n     village withdrawal areas established under the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) described in \n     paragraph (10) are composed of salt water and not available \n     for selection;\n       (12) of land subject to the selection rights of Sealaska, \n     110,000 acres are encumbered by gubernatorial consent \n     requirements under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);\n       (13) the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management \n     grossly underestimated the land entitlement of Sealaska under \n     the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et \n     seq.), resulting in an insufficient area from which Sealaska \n     could select land suitable for traditional, cultural, and \n     socioeconomic purposes to accomplish a settlement ``in \n     conformity with the real economic and social needs of \n     Natives'', as required under that Act;\n       (14) the 10 Alaska Native village withdrawal areas in \n     southeast Alaska surround the Alaska Native communities of \n     Yakutat, Hoonah, Angoon, Kake, Kasaan, Klawock, Craig, \n     Hydaburg, Klukwan, and Saxman;\n       (15) in each withdrawal area, there exist factors that \n     limit the ability of Sealaska to select sufficient land, and, \n     in particular, economically viable land, to fulfill the land \n     entitlement of Sealaska, including factors such as--\n       (A) with respect to the Yakutat withdrawal area--\n       (i) 46 percent of the area is salt water;\n       (ii) 10 sections (6,400 acres) around the Situk Lake were \n     restricted from selection, with no consideration provided for \n     the restriction; and\n       (iii)(I) 70,000 acres are subject to a gubernatorial \n     consent requirement before selection; and\n       (II) Sealaska received no consideration with respect to the \n     consent restriction;\n       (B) with respect to the Hoonah withdrawal area, 51 percent \n     of the area is salt water;\n       (C) with respect to the Angoon withdrawal area--\n       (i) 120,000 acres of the area is salt water;\n       (ii) Sealaska received no consideration regarding the \n     prohibition on selecting land from the 80,000 acres located \n     within the Admiralty Island National Monument; and\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\n       (iii)(I) the Village Corporation for Angoon was allowed to \n     select land located outside the withdrawal area on Prince of \n     Wales Island, subject to the condition that the Village \n     Corporation shall not select land located on Admiralty \n     Island; but\n       (II) no alternative land adjacent to the out-of-withdrawal \n     land of the Village Corporation was made available for \n     selection by Sealaska;\n       (D) with respect to the Kake withdrawal area--\n       (i) 64 percent of the area is salt water; and\n       (ii) extensive timber harvesting by the Forest Service \n     occurred in the area before 1971 that significantly reduced \n     the value of land available for selection by, and conveyance \n     to, Sealaska;\n       (E) with respect to the Kasaan withdrawal area--\n       (i) 54 percent of the area is salt water; and\n       (ii) the Forest Service previously harvested in the area;\n       (F) with respect to the Klawock withdrawal area--\n       (i) the area consists of only 5 townships, as compared to \n     the usual withdrawal area of 9 townships, because of the \n     proximity of the Klawock withdrawal area to the Village of \n     Craig, which reduces the selection area by 92,160 acres; and\n       (ii) the Klawock and Craig withdrawal areas are 35 percent \n     salt water;\n       (G) with respect to the Craig withdrawal area, the \n     withdrawal area consists of only 6 townships, as compared to \n     the usual withdrawal area of 9 townships, because of the \n     proximity of the Craig withdrawal area to the Village of \n     Klawock, which reduces the selection area by 69,120 acres;\n       (H) with respect to the Hydaburg withdrawal area--\n       (i) 36 percent of the area is salt water; and\n       (ii) Sealaska received no consideration under the Haida \n     Land Exchange Act of 1986 (Public Law No. 99-664; 100 Stat. \n     4303) for relinquishing selection rights to land within the \n     withdrawal area that the Haida Corporation exchanged to the \n     Forest Service;\n       (I) with respect to the Klukwan withdrawal area--\n       (i) 27 percent of the area is salt water; and\n       (ii) the withdrawal area is only 70,000 acres, as compared \n     to the usual withdrawal area of 207,360 acres, which reduces \n     the selection area by 137,360 acres; and\n       (J) with respect to the Saxman withdrawal area--\n       (i) 29 percent of the area is salt water;\n       (ii) Sealaska received no consideration for the 50,576 \n     acres within the withdrawal area adjacent to the first-class \n     city of Ketchikan that were excluded from selection;\n       (iii) Sealaska received no consideration with respect to \n     the 1977 amendment to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) requiring gubernatorial consent for \n     selection of 58,000 acres in that area; and\n       (iv) 23,888 acres are located within the Annette Island \n     Indian Reservation for the Metlakatla Indian Tribe and are \n     not available for selection;\n       (16) the selection limitations and guidelines applicable to \n     Sealaska under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)--\n       (A) are inequitable and inconsistent with the purposes of \n     that Act because there is insufficient land remaining in the \n     withdrawal areas to meet the traditional, cultural, and \n     socioeconomic needs of the shareholders of Sealaska; and\n       (B) make it difficult for Sealaska to select--\n       (i) places of sacred, cultural, traditional, and historical \n     significance; and\n       (ii) Alaska Native futures sites located outside the \n     withdrawal areas of Sealaska;\n       (17)(A) the deadline for applications for selection of \n     cemetery sites and historic places on land outside withdrawal \n     areas established under section 14 of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1613) was July 1, 1976;\n       (B)(i) as of that date, the Bureau of Land Management \n     notified Sealaska that the total entitlement of Sealaska \n     would be approximately 200,000 acres; and\n       (ii) Sealaska made entitlement allocation decisions for \n     cultural sites and economic development sites based on that \n     original estimate;\n       (C) as a result of the Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration \n     Act (Public Law 108-452; 118 Stat. 3575) and subsequent \n     related determinations and actions of the Bureau of Land \n     Management, Sealaska will receive significantly more than \n     200,000 acres pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \n     Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);\n       (D) Sealaska would prefer to allocate more of the \n     entitlement of Sealaska to the acquisition of places of \n     sacred, cultural, traditional, and historical significance; \n     and\n       (E)(i) pursuant to section 11(a)(1) of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1610(a)(1)), Sealaska was \n     not authorized to select under section 14(h)(1) of that Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1613(h)(1)) any site within Glacier Bay National \n     Park, despite the abundance of cultural sites within that \n     Park;\n       (ii) Sealaska seeks cooperative agreements to ensure that \n     sites within Glacier Bay National Park are subject to \n     cooperative management by Sealaska, Village and Urban \n     Corporations, and federally recognized tribes with ties to \n     the cultural sites and history of the Park; and\n       (iii) Congress--\n       (I) recognizes the existence of a memorandum of \n     understanding between the National Park Service and the \n     Hoonah Indian Association;\n       (II) does not intend to circumvent that memorandum of \n     understanding; and\n       (III) intends to ensure that the memorandum of \n     understanding and similar mechanisms for cooperative \n     management in Glacier Bay are required by law;\n       (18)(A) the cemetery sites and historic places conveyed to \n     Sealaska pursuant to section 14(h)(1) of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1613(h)(1)) are subject to a \n     restrictive covenant not required by law that does not allow \n     any type of management or use that would in any way alter the \n     historic nature of a site, even for cultural education or \n     research purposes;\n       (B) historic sites managed by the Forest Service are not \n     subject to the limitations referred to in subparagraph (A); \n     and\n       (C) those limitations hinder the ability of Sealaska to use \n     the sites for cultural, educational, or research purposes for \n     Alaska Natives and others;\n       (19) unless Sealaska is allowed to select land outside \n     designated withdrawal areas in southeast Alaska, Sealaska \n     will not be able--\n       (A) to complete the land entitlement selections of Sealaska \n     under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 \n     et seq.);\n       (B) to secure ownership of places of sacred, cultural, \n     traditional, and historical importance to the Alaska Natives \n     of southeast Alaska;\n       (C) to maintain the existing resource development and \n     management operations of Sealaska; or\n       (D) to provide continued economic opportunities for Alaska \n     Natives in southeast Alaska;\n       (20) in order to realize cultural preservation goals while \n     also diversifying economic opportunities, Sealaska should be \n     authorized to select and receive conveyance of--\n       (A) sacred, cultural, traditional, and historic sites and \n     other places of traditional cultural significance, including \n     traditional and customary trade and migration routes, to \n     facilitate the perpetuation and preservation of Alaska Native \n     culture and history; and\n       (B) Alaska Native future sites to facilitate appropriate \n     tourism and outdoor recreation enterprises;\n       (21) Sealaska has played, and is expected to continue to \n     play, a significant role in the health of the southeast \n     Alaska economy;\n       (22)(A) the rate of unemployment in southeast Alaska \n     exceeds the statewide rate of unemployment on a non-\n     seasonally adjusted basis; and\n       (B) in January 2008, the Alaska Department of Labor and \n     Workforce Development reported the unemployment rate for the \n     Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan census area at 20 percent;\n       (23) many southeast Alaska communities--\n       (A) are dependent on high-cost diesel fuel for the \n     generation of energy; and\n       (B) desire to diversify their energy supplies with wood \n     biomass alternative fuel and other renewable and alternative \n     fuel sources;\n       (24) if the resource development operations of Sealaska \n     cease on land appropriate for those operations, there will be \n     a significant negative impact on--\n       (A) southeast Alaska Native shareholders;\n       (B) the cultural preservation activities of Sealaska;\n       (C) the economy of southeast Alaska; and\n       (D) the Alaska Native community that benefits from the \n     revenue-sharing requirements under the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.); and\n       (25) on completion of the conveyances of land to Sealaska \n     to fulfill the full land entitlement of Sealaska under the \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), \n     the encumbrances on 327,000 acres of Federal land created by \n     the withdrawal of land for selection by Native Corporations \n     in southeast Alaska would be removed, which will facilitate \n     thorough and complete planning and efficient management \n     relating to national forest land in southeast Alaska by the \n     Forest Service.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to address the \n     inequitable treatment of Sealaska by allowing Sealaska to \n     select the remaining land entitlement of Sealaska under \n     section 14 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1613) from designated Federal land in southeast Alaska \n     located outside the 10 southeast Alaska Native village \n     withdrawal areas.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nensure the safety and quality of medical products and enhance the \nauthorities of the Food and Drug Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the last 5 years I have conducted \nextensive oversight of the Food and Drug Administration. As a result of \nmy oversight activities, I identified serious problems at the FDA that \nincluded: the quashing of scientific opinion within the agency; delays \nin informing the public of emerging safety problems; too cozy a \nrelationship between the FDA and the industries it is supposed to \nregulate; and a failure to be adequately transparent and accountable to \nthe public.\n  The FDA will require strong leadership to rebuild public confidence \nand tackle the cultural and organizational problems that have plagued \nthe agency.\n  Strong leadership alone, however, will not fix all the problems.\n  The agency needs additional tools, resources, and authorities to \nfulfill its mission of protecting the health and safety of the American \npeople.\n  In September 2007, the Congress passed the Food and Drug \nAdministration Amendments Act to provide FDA some of the needed tools, \nresources, and authorities.\n  This legislation was a positive step forward in strengthening the \nagency and restoring the public's trust in the FDA, but Congress's work \nis not done.\n  Today, I am here to talk about another FDA bill.\n  In the summer of 2007, I started examining FDA's program for \ninspections of foreign pharmaceutical manufacturing plants.\n  I expressed concerns to the FDA regarding, among other things, \ninspection funding, emerging exporters, and severe weaknesses in the \ninspection process.\n  An increasing amount of the drugs and active pharmaceutical \ningredients Americans use are being manufactured in foreign countries, \nprimarily in China and India.\n  Yet as reported by the Government Accountability Office in November \n2007, the Food and Drug Administration does not know how many foreign \nestablishments are subject to inspection and the agency conducts \nrelatively few foreign inspections each year.\n  According to the FDA, from fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2007, \nthe agency conducted fewer than 1,400 inspections of foreign \npharmaceutical facilities.\n  And these inspections were often conducted in countries with few \nreported quality concerns.\n  In China, the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical \ningredients, and where we have seen increasing reports of contaminated \nproducts, only 11 inspections were conducted during fiscal year 2007--\nthat is way too few.\n  During the same year, FDA conducted 14 inspections in Switzerland, 18 \nin Germany, and 24 in France--all countries with advanced regulatory \ninfrastructures.\n  In addition, FDA officials estimated that the agency inspected \nforeign class II device makers every 27 years and foreign class III \ndevice makers every 6 years.\n  Class III devices are devices that support or sustain human life or \npresent a potentially unreasonable risk of illness or injury, such as \npacemakers and heart defibrillators.\n  In January 2008, we saw too well what happens when we have a broken \ninspection system.\n  Baxter International Inc. temporarily suspended production of its\n\n[[Page S4687]]\n\nblood thinner Heparin because of an increase in reports of adverse \nevents that may be associated with its drug. Then recalls were \nannounced. There were serious concerns about whether or not this \ncountry would have enough Heparin to meet patient needs as a result of \nthe contamination. After several months, FDA's investigation found that \nthe active ingredient in Heparin, which was made at a facility in \nChina, was contaminated. And the serious adverse events in patients who \nreceived Heparin were linked to the contaminated blood thinner.\n  The recalls and investigation of contaminated Heparin highlighted \nsignificant weaknesses in FDA's oversight of the production and supply \nchain and emphasized the need to improve FDA's protection of the safety \nof products made in this country and abroad.\n  The FDA is charged with ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs, \npharmaceutical ingredients, and devices produced around the world \ndespite its inadequate budget for inspections, in particular foreign \ninspections.\n  It is troubling that the FDA is grossly under-resourced at a time \nwhen foreign production of drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients \nis growing at record rates.\n  Last Congress, I introduced the Drug and Device Accountability Act of \n2008 with Senator Kennedy, chairman of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions. The Congress did not have an \nopportunity to act on that legislation. So today Senator Kennedy and I \nare introducing the Drug and Device Accountability Act of 2009.\n  Senator Kennedy is not able to join me on the Senate floor, but I \nthank him for his cooperation and work with my office on this important \nlegislation.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for \nhis commitment and efforts over the years to reform and improve the \nFDA.\n  I am going to spend the next few minutes highlighting some of the \nthings the Drug and Device Accountability Act of 2009 would do.\n  This bill would augment FDA's resources through the collection of \ninspection fees.\n  It also expands the agency's authority for ensuring the safety of \ndrugs and medical devices, including foreign manufactured drugs and \ndevices by expanding FDA's authority to inspect foreign manufacturers \nand importers; allowing the FDA to issue subpoenas; and allowing the \nFDA to detain a device or drug when its inspectors have reason to \nbelieve the product is adulterated or misbranded.\n  In addition, the bill would require individuals responsible for \nsubmitting a drug or device application or a report related to safety \nor efficacy to certify that the application or report complies with \napplicable regulations and is not false or misleading. Civil as well as \ncriminal penalties could be imposed for false or misleading \ncertifications.\n  I believe this is an important provision given the troubling findings \nover the last few years; that is, that some companies have withheld \nimportant safety information from the FDA or buried that information in \ntheir submissions to the agency.\n  In addition, in light of recent serious allegations that have been \nraised by scientists within the FDA regarding the agency's handling of \nmedical device reviews, the bill calls for an Institute of Medicine \nstudy to examine FDA's system for clearing and approving devices for \nmarketing.\n  During President Obama's weekly address last month, the President \nstated, ``There are certain things only a government can do. And one of \nthose things is ensuring that the foods we eat, and the medicines we \ntake, are safe and do not cause us harm.''\n  I concur, and the Drug and Device Accountability Act is an \nopportunity for Congress to help FDA do a better job of ensuring that \nour increasingly foreign-produced drug and device supply is safe and \neffective.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and with \nthe Obama administration to ensure that FDA has the necessary tools and \nresources to meet its oversight responsibilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 883. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin recognition and celebration of the establishment of the Medal of \nHonor in 1861, America's highest award for valor in action against an \nenemy force which can be bestowed upon an individual serving in the \nArmed Services of the United States, to honor the American military men \nand women who have been recipients of the Medal of Honor, and to \npromote awareness of what the Medal of Honor represents and how \nordinary Americans, through courage, sacrifice, selfless service and \npatriotism, can challenge fate and change the course of history; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today along with Senator Graham, I am \nintroducing the Medal of Honor Commemorative Coin Act of 2009 to assist \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation in raising the funds it \nneeds to promote the qualities which the Medal of Honor embodies--\ncourage, sacrifice, selfless service, and patriotism.\n  The Medal of Honor was first authorized by Congress in 1861 and \nrepresents our Nation's highest award for valor in action against an \nenemy force. The medal symbolizes the value we, as a Nation, place on \nthe power of one individual to make a difference in extraordinary \ncircumstances through selfless actions of bravery. Although the Medal \nof Honor was created for the Civil War, Congress made it a permanent \ndecoration in 1863. Since then, fewer than 3,500 Medals of Honor have \nbeen awarded to members of the U.S. Armed Forces--approximately half \nduring the Civil War. Today, there are only 111 living recipients. \nThese select few exemplify the values of our great nation through their \nincredible acts of bravery and commitment to our country.\n  The Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation was formed in 1999. This \n501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization promotes heroism and selflessness \namong our Nation's youth by perpetuating the Medal of Honor's legacy \nthrough increased awareness, education, scholarships, behavior, and \nexample. The commemorative coins will be legal tender, emblematic of \nthe spirit of the Medal of Honor, giving the holder a physical reminder \nof the American tradition of selfless service and sacrifice. These \ncoins will be minted for the year 2011, marking the 150th anniversary \nof the Medal of Honor's initial authorization by Congress.\n  Today, in Iraq and Afghanistan, American soldiers not only serve \ntheir country selflessly but do so in an exemplary manner. In this time \nof war and sacrifice it is of utmost importance that we show the people \nfighting for their country how much we value their service.\n  This is the medal won by Sergeant First Class Paul R. Smith. Under \nattack at the Baghdad International Airport, Sergeant Smith quickly \norganized the defense on the ground to engage a company-sized enemy \nforce. He showed no concern for his own personal safety when he mounted \na personnel carrier and manned a .50 caliber machine gun while under \nfire from the enemy and was mortally wounded in doing so. His valor \nlead to the defeat of the enemy and saved the lives of numerous injured \nmembers of his platoon.\n  This is the medal won by Captain Humbert Roque Versace. During an \nintense attack by the Viet Cong in the Xuyen Providence Captain Versace \nwas wounded while engaging the enemy. Although he fought against \ncapture through injury and hostility he was taken prisoner. While \nincarcerated Captain Versace exemplified the Code of Conduct as a \nprisoner of war, attempted to escape three times and never gave in to \nthe brutal interrogations all while maintaining command over his fellow \nAmerican soldiers that were also imprisoned setting an extraordinary \nexample.\n  This is the medal won by Marine Corps Second Lieutenant Robert Dale \nReem, who on the night of November 6, 1950, after leading three \nseparate assaults on an enemy position in the vicinity of Chinhung-ni, \nKorea, threw himself on top of an enemy grenade that landed amidst his \nmen.\n  Since 1863 this country has been honoring its greatest heroes by \ndecorating them with the Congressional Medal of Honor. This is an elite \ngroup of men and women who make us proud everyday of the U.S. Armed \nForces and the protection they afford us. We should show our thanks in \nthe best manner possible.\n\n[[Page S4688]]\n\n  I ask all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 884. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to remove \nprivatized highway miles as a factor in apportioning highway funding; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, when our States and cities lease their \ntolled highways to private parties, American taxpayers almost always \nexperience significant fee increases at the toll booth. But our \ntaxpayers' contribution does not end there. Under current tax law, the \nFederal Treasury subsidizes private lessors through exceedingly \ngenerous depreciation and amortization deductions. Meanwhile, Federal \nfunding continues to flow to the state government--as though the \nhighway had never been privatized. Today, I rise to introduce two bills \nthat would put an end to this fleecing of the American taxpayer. I am \npleased that Senator Grassley, the Ranking Member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, is joining me in introducing both bills.\n  I'd like to take a moment to set the stage, by explaining where we \nfind ourselves. There is no denying the seriousness of our nation's \nsurface transportation funding challenges. Among the solutions that \nhave been offered are so-called Public-Private Partnerships, or PPPs. \nUnder one PPP model, a state or local government leases existing \nhighways to a private party, often on a very long-term basis. We have \nalready seen two existing highways sold off to private companies. In \n2004, Chicago sold Macquarie of Australia concession rights to the \nChicago Skyway for 99 years, in exchange for $1.8 billion. In 2006, \nIndiana sold concession rights to the Indiana Toll Road to a \npartnership between Cintra of Spain and Macquarie for 75 years, in \nexchange for $3.8 billion. Both deals have generated significant \ninterest from the press and the financial community. Now, investors are \napproaching state and local governments across the country, seeking a \npiece of what is believed to be a very lucrative pie. For instance, \nlast year Governor Ed Rendell proposed a $12.8 billion deal for a 75-\nyear sale of concession rights to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which, if \nratified, would represent the largest privatization of highway \ninfrastructure in U.S. history.\n  While I agree that States should have some latitude to determine how \nto operate their own highways, that doesn't mean that the Federal \ntaxpayer should subsidize leasing these highways. But as we uncovered \nat a Finance Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources and \nInfrastructure hearing that I convened last year, the Federal \ngovernment--and taxpayers in all states--now subsidizes these PPPs \nthrough exceedingly generous tax provisions. To take advantage of the \nTax Code's 15-year cost recovery period for highway infrastructure, a \nprivate lessor must obtain constructive ownership of the road. \nConstructive ownership is generally attained by entering a lease that \nexceeds the 45-year period that the Bureau of Economic Affairs, BEA, \nsays is a road's ``useful life.'' Once they attain this constructive \nownership, the private lessor can recover most of its costs over the \nfirst 15 years of the lease--or one-third as long as BEA says the \nhighway infrastructure can be expected to last. The end result? Private \noperators demand exceptionally long lease lengths, to ensure they can \ntake advantage of the Tax Code's subsidy.\n  These Tax Code provisions are of interest not just because the Senate \nmust prudently shepherd our Nation's tax revenues, but also because \nthere are considerable transportation policy dangers to these very \nlong-term leases. Chicago signed a 99-year lease for the Skyway, a road \nthat, at the time of the lease, had only a 47 operating history. \nIndiana signed a 75-year lease for its Toll Road, a highway that, at \nthe time of the lease, had only a 49 history. With respect to a \ncritical artery of transportation, how can a State or city possibly \npredict its future needs for a period that is twice that artery's \noperating history? It is impossible to envision how transportation will \nchange in the next hundred years. As a point of reference, the Model T \nis 101 years old--can we even pretend to imagine what the next century \nwill bring? These very long lease lengths are all the more troubling \nbecause these deals often contain non-compete clauses, which make it \ndifficult for public transportation agencies to address safety and \ncongestion problems on highways and adjacent streets.\n  It is true that private lessors are merely following the letter of \nthe law. But when cost-recovery rules subsidize forms of investment \nthat contravene the public interest, Congress should change those \nrules. Indeed, public policy concerns have already led Congress to \nalter cost-recovery rules for other assets, such as luxury cars, sport \nutility vehicles, and sports franchises.\n  Senator Grassley and I agree that to protect the American taxpayer, \nsuch an alteration is also necessary here. It's time for the tax tail \nto stop wagging the dog, by cutting off Federal tax subsidies to \ncompanies that privatize existing American highways. Our first bill, \nthe Transportation Access for All Americans Act, would do just that. It \nwould allow a private operator of an existing highway to depreciate \ncosts associated with tangible highway infrastructure on a 45-year \nperiod, in line with Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates, and to \namortize the intangible right to collect tolls on a schedule that is no \nshorter than the lease's actual length. By making these changes to the \nTax Code, our bill eliminates the unjustifiable subsidy that the U.S. \ntaxpayer is now asked to provide directly to the private operators.\n  Our second bill, S. 885, the Transportation Equity for All Americans \nAct, deals with the highway funding that is provided for a privatized \nroad. As I understand it, when a road is privatized, all responsibility \nfor maintaining the road, collecting tolls, paying the investors' \nprofit, and so forth are taken on by the private entity. It simply \nmakes no sense that the road should continue to qualify for highway \nfunding if the road is privately operated. Similarly, it makes no sense \nthat the formulae that distribute the Federal highway funding should \nreflect any credit for privatized roads--it would be like the users \npaying twice, once at the toll booth and again in the taxes they \nalready pay to use the Nation's highways.\n  Under current law, all roads, including interstate highways, national \nhighways, and other major state and local roads in the federal-aid \nsystem are included in the calculation of the federal highway funds. \nThe lane-miles and vehicle-miles-traveled on all these roads are used \ndirectly to apportion the federal highway funds for the Interstate \nMaintenance Program, the National Highway Program, and the Surface \nTransportation Program. The calculation currently includes roads that \nare publicly or privately operated. Our second bill is very simple; it \nsubtracts from these calculations the lane-miles and vehicle-miles-\ntraveled for any privatized highway, thus eliminating the double \npayments. The bill also corrects the Equity Bonus program to reflect \nproperly the changes in the formula calculations.\n  This year Congress must reauthorize the Federal surface \ntransportation programs. I look forward to working with Finance \nChairman Baucus and Senator Grassley and EPW Chairman Boxer and Senator \nInhofe to complete a new transportation bill that meets the needs of my \nState and the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 884\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Equity for \n     All Americans Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REMOVAL OF PRIVATIZED HIGHWAY MILES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 104(b) of title 23, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) Privatized highway miles.--\n       ``(A) Definition of privatized highway.--In this paragraph, \n     the term `privatized highway' means a highway subject to an \n     agreement giving a private entity--\n       ``(i) control over the operation of the highway; and\n       ``(ii) ownership over the toll revenues collected from the \n     operation of the highway.\n       ``(B) Exclusion.--For the purposes of paragraphs (1), (3), \n     and (4), the lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on a \n     privatized highway\n\n[[Page S4689]]\n\n     that is otherwise an included highway shall be excluded from \n     consideration as factors in the formula for apportionment of \n     funds under this title.''.\n       (b) Equity Bonus.--Section 105 of title 23, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g) Privatized Highways.--Calculations under this section \n     shall be made without taking into account the exclusion under \n     section 104(b)(6) of certain lane miles and vehicle miles \n     traveled from consideration as factors in the formula for \n     apportionment of funds pursuant to this title.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Bill Summary--Transportation Access for All Americans Act\n\n       The Internal Revenue Code generally characterizes a lease \n     of assets as an outright purchase of those assets if the \n     lessee has acquired all the benefits and burdens of ownership \n     for a term that significantly exceeds their expected \n     remaining useful life (as generally determined by the Bureau \n     of Economic Analysis). The Bureau of Economic Analysis \n     estimates the service life of highways and streets to be 45 \n     years. For Federal income tax purposes, a lessor with such \n     constructive ownership is allowed to recover its costs \n     through depreciation and amortization deductions. \n     Notwithstanding BEA's 45-year estimate, the Tax Code \n     currently permits the value of the lease of tangible \n     infrastructure to be depreciated on a 15-year schedule, on a \n     150% declining-balance basis. The intangible franchise right \n     to collect tolls is currently recovered over a 15-year \n     period, regardless of the lease length. The Act would amend \n     Section 168(g)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code so that a \n     taxpayer that leases an existing highway on a sufficiently \n     longterm basis can depreciate the tangible infrastructure on \n     a 45-year schedule, on a straight-line basis. The Act would \n     also amend Section 197(f) of the Internal Revenue Code so \n     that the lessor of an existing highway can amortize the \n     intangible franchise right to collect tolls over the greater \n     of a 15-year period or the actual length of the lease.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Bill Summary--Transportation Equity for All Americans Act\n\n       The bill would amend sections 104(b) and 105 of title 23, \n     USC, pertaining to Federal-aid highways apportionment factors \n     and the equity bonus program. Section 104(b) provides the \n     manner in which the Secretary apportions the sums authorized \n     to be appropriated for expenditure on the Interstate and \n     National Highway System program, the Congestion Mitigation \n     and Air Quality Improvement program, the highway safety \n     improvement program, and the Surface Transportation program \n     for that fiscal year, among the several States. The amendment \n     to section 104(b) would remove lane miles and vehicle miles \n     traveled on a ``privatized highway'' from the formula factors \n     for the National Highway System, the Surface Transportation \n     program, and the Interstate Maintenance component.\n       Section 105, the equity bonus program, provides that the \n     Secretary allocate among the States amounts sufficient to \n     ensure that no State receives a percentage of the total \n     apportionments for the fiscal year for specific programs that \n     is less than the calculated State percentage. The amendment \n     to section 105 would provide that, notwithstanding section \n     104(b)(6), lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on a \n     ``privatized highway'' are not excluded from the calculations \n     under this section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 885.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to require \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to determine the price of all milk used \nfor manufactured purposes, which shall be classified as Class II milk, \nby using the national average cost of production, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on \nlegislation I am introducing with Senator Casey that will require the \nSecretary of Agriculture to determine the price of all manufactured \nmilk, classified as Class II milk, using the national average cost of \nproduction. At a time when the dairy farmers in Pennsylvania and across \nthe country are seeing record low prices for their milk, this \nlegislation is necessary to bring the price of milk back to a level \nwhere farmers can earn a living and provide for their families.\n  Over the past year, farmers in my state have seen the average price \nfor a hundredweight, cwt, of milk drop from around $24 in July 2008, to \nhovering around $10 this February. This dramatic price decrease has \nbeen the result of a perfect storm of factors, including record high \nfuel prices last summer, which increased the cost of feed and other \nsupplies, and a decrease in demand for dairy products abroad, where \ncases of melamine in milk have caused a severe drop in demand.\n  Last year, Sen. Casey and I worked diligently to increase the Milk \nIncome Loss Contract, MILC, Program in the 2008 Farm Bill. We were \nsuccessful in\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\nincluding a cost of production increase to all MILC payments. These \ndirect payments from the federal government are triggered when the \nprice of milk per cwt falls below $16.94. When the average price of \nmilk for a given month falls below this trigger, farmers are paid 45 \npercent of the difference between the actual price of milk and the \ntrigger price. With the 2008 Farm bill's inclusion of the cost of \nproduction to these payments, farmers are seeing higher MILC payments \nthan they otherwise would.\n  However, this is not enough. I have heard numerous reports from my \nconstituents that the price of milk has fallen so low that they are \nfearful of having to sell their farms in order to provide for their \nfamilies. Many of the dairy farms in Pennsylvania are small, family-\nowned farms, which, once sold, will be lost forever. We cannot let this \nhappen. The dairy industry is critical not only to Pennsylvania's \neconomy, but to the economy of the U.S. and to the security of our \nnation.\n  The Federal Milk Marketing Improvement Act will not only use a \nnational average cost of production to determine Class II milk, but \nwill also keep the Secretary of Agriculture engaged in protecting \nfarmers from falling milk prices. This legislation would require the \nSecretary to adjust the value of milk four times a year, ensuring that \nprice volatilities in the fuel sector will not unfairly hurt this \nindustry, as we have seen it do in the past year.\n  Finally, this legislation provides an exemption for new dairy \nproducers, up to 3 million pounds of milk during the first year of \nproduction, to encourage growth in the industry. With recent losses \nacross the country of so many dairy farms, this provision is important \nto spurring new farmers and producers to enter the dairy industry.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this and \nother legislation which will help a vital industry to this country. Our \ndairy farmers are the backbone of the agricultural community, and they \ndeserve our support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 890. A bill to provide for the use of improved health information \ntechnology with respect to certain safety net health care providers; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Health \nInformation Technology Public Utility Act, legislation I have recently \nintroduced to facilitate nationwide adoption of electronic health \nrecords, EHRs, particularly among small, rural providers. This \nlegislation will build on the successful open source models for EHRs \ndeveloped by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Indian Health \nService--as well as the open source exchange model recently expanded \namong federal agencies through the Nationwide Health Information \nNetwork-Connect initiative.\n  Health information technology, IT, that is interoperable and \nmeaningful is a necessary tool to improve the quality of health care \nAmericans receive and make our health care system more efficient. It is \nthe cornerstone of health care communication and coordination between \npatients and providers and among providers in order delivery high-\nquality medical care. Several of the mechanisms embedded in this \ntechnology--clinical decisions support, interoperability--achieve the \nlong-term policy goals we are considering as part of our broader health \nreform discussions. It is clear that coordination and communication \namong providers, improved efficiencies in resource use, streamlined \nadministration and billing, and increased access to meaningful data \nabout quality improvement and improved health outcomes will not be \npossible without meaningful use of this technology among all providers.\n  However, access to affordable technology is the primary reason why \nproviders across the nation do not invest in this valuable tool. The \nlicensing fees of proprietary software are expensive and beyond the \nreach of many of health care providers--particularly small, rural \nproviders. Moreover, the federal government has spent substantial \ntaxpayer dollars in the development of open source technology--with the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and the Indian Health Service, IHS, \nnational leaders in open source electronic health record, EHR, \ndevelopment and implementation. Both the Veterans Health \nAdministration's VistA software and the Indian Health Services' \nResource and Patient Management System, RPMS, are affordable and \ndependable systems that have been in place for decades.\n  Most recently, the health IT funding included in the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act, ARRA, although substantial, is likely to \nfall short of offering affordable options to all providers. In fact, \nCBO estimates that, even with funding and incentives in the ARRA, 30 \npercent of hospitals and 10 percent of physicians will not have adopted \nhealth IT by 2019. And, there are some providers that are ineligible \nfor funding under ARRA altogether.\n  The Health Information Technology Public Utility Act will address \nthis problem by increasing access to open source software through a \npublic utility model. The public utility model proposed in this bill \nwould be administered by a Federal Consolidated Health Information \nTechnology Board under the umbrella of the ONCHIT, separate from the \nPolicy and Standards Committees. Members of this Board would represent \nrelevant agencies across the federal government. The Board would be \nresponsible for linking efforts of current and new VistA and RPMS user \ngroups, and updating VistA and RPMS open source software (including \nprovider-based EHRs, personal health records, and other software \nmodules) on a timely basis.\n  The legislation also establishes a new 21st Century Health \nInformation Technology Grant Program to provide funding to public and \nnot-for-profit safety net providers to cover the costs of \nimplementation and initial maintenance of VistA and/or RPMS systems. \nGrants will focus on eligible hospitals and clinics, with some \nadditional funding for demonstrations in long-term care, home health, \nand hospice.\n  The Health Information Technology Public Utility Act fills a crucial \ngap in health IT affordability and accessibility. This legislation does \nnot replace commercial software; instead, it complements the private \nindustry in this field--by making health information technology a \nrealistic option for all providers and by making it possible for the \nbenefits of health IT to accrue to all patients and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this important policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 890\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require annual disclosure to the Securities and \nExchange Commission of activities involving columbite-tantalite, \ncassiterite, and wolframite from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise before you today to speak on an \nissue that I have brought to the Senate Floor before and have been \nwatching for quite some time now. I would like to submit for the record \nthe Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009.\n  This bill will require U.S.-registered companies selling products \nusing columbite-tantalite, coltan, cassiterite, or wolframite, or \nderivatives of these minerals, to annually disclose to the Securities \nand Exchange Commission the country of origin of those minerals. If the \ncountry of origin is the Democratic Republic of Congo or neighboring \ncountries, the company would need to disclose the mine of origin.\n  These minerals are the ``conflict diamonds'' of Congo, however rather \nthan ending up in jewelry these minerals are ending up in our \nelectronics products.\n  This is not the first time this issue has been raised. Only last year \nSenator Durbin and I introduced S3058, the Conflict Coltan and \nCassiterite Act, which prohibited the importation of certain products \nthat contained or are derived from columbite-tantalite or cassiterite \nmined or extracted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While the \nbill did not go anywhere, the issue itself has gained attention. We \nhave taken a strong hard look at last year's bill and have done our \nbest to improve on it.\n  In the current legislation we call for transparency and \naccountability throughout the supply-chain of these minerals. By making \nthis supply-chain more translucent, we ultimately can help save \nmillions of innocent Congolese lives who find themselves caught in the \nmiddle of this conflict, a conflict based on the control of these \nminerals. Some in industry have already started down this road and are \neven in front of the curve with their efforts, but we still need to \nstrive to do a better job of showing transparency and we need to do it \nquickly.\n  It is no secret that the exploitation of minerals is taking place and \nfunding the conflict in Congo. In its final report, released on \nDecember 12, 2008, the United Nations Group of Experts on the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo found that official exports of \ncolumbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite, and gold are grossly \nundervalued and that various illegal armed groups in the eastern region \nof the Democratic Republic of Congo continue to profit greatly from \nthese natural resources by coercively exercising control over mining \nsites from where they are extracted and locations along which they are \ntransported for export.\n  I have said this before and I will say it again, this murky, \nconflict-funding supply-chain of minerals in eastern Congo has been the \nheart of darkness for that country too long and I am not the only one \nwho believes that.\n  Last month the Democratic Republic of Congo's U.N. Ambassador Faida \nMitifu spoke in New York during a panel discussion on media coverage of \nsexual violence against Congolese women. When the issue of minerals in \neastern Congo was raised, Ambassador Mitifu said the exploitation of \nmineral resources is the driving force behind the conflict.\n  Her exact quote ``the minerals have truly been the driving force \nbehind this war. It has been dressed with different clothes, but truly \nthe minerals are the driving force.'' She went onto say the history of \nexploitation and conflict dates back to the Congo's colonial history \nwith Belgium.\n  She is right. The mismanagement of natural resources has long cast a \ngloom over the Democratic Republic of Congo. The exploitation of these \nnatural resources that began during the reign of King Leopold has \nendured for over 100 years. During this 24-year tyranny of Congo, King \nLeopold exploited the local population by turning it into a slave \ncolony, extracting the resource of the day--rubber, while over 13 \nmillion Congolese died.\n  In his book the ``Heart of Darkness'' Joseph Conrad describes King \nLeopold's colonial project in the Congo ``the vilest scramble for loot \nthat ever disfigured the history of human conscience.'' But have we \nseen history change at all? Well let me share with you some of the \nlives ravaged by this ongoing conflict.\n  This small 3\\1/2\\-year-old boy became one of the millions of victims \nof displacement and malnourishment. His family fled into the jungle \nfrom a rebel group that had burnt their village to the ground in just \noutside the village of Kitchanga in North Kivu.\n  They lived in the jungle and had been constantly on the move. Food \nbecame scarce and meals became as sporadic as 2 to 3 a week. He fell \nsick and developed a cough. When his mother brought him to the local \nhealth clinic, they were immediately referred to an international \nhumanitarian organization in the area. There, this young boy was \ndiagnosed with malaria, tuberculosis, and anemia.\n  His doctors then discovered he had been eating only what his mother \ncould gather in jungle and ate only once every three to four days. They \nimmediately began his treatments, which his small, frail body was \nstruggling to accept.\n  While this small 2-year-old boy had a similar story, however more \ndisheartening. His family had fled into the jungle when the rebels \nattacked their village. After 3 months of seeking shelter in the \njungle, his mother finally brought him to a local health clinic where \nhe too was referred to the international humanitarian organization \nthere. The only diagnosis the doctors could come up with was malaria. \nHowever when this photo was taken his body was rejecting the \ntreatments, he no longer cried-out in hunger or pain, he no longer \nresponded to anything.\n\n  The issue of rape in the Congo is quite possibly the worst in the \nworld. We used to call it a ``tool of war'' but now it's not even due \nto the war. Because it has been taking place there for so long, it has \nnearly become an accepted behavior and one where impunity reigns free.\n  Last year I spoke with Dr. Mukwege from Panzi Hospital in the city of \nBukavu in the South Kivu Province of Congo. Panzi Hospital is the \nleading treatment hospital of rape and sexual violence survivors in \nCongo. Dr. Mukwege sat in my office and told me of how he was seeing as \nmany as 10 new rape survivors who needed treatment a week.\n  He then pulled out a map and circled the areas where majority of his \npatients were coming from and explained that those areas were the key \nmining areas for coltan and cassiterite in South Kivu. He said that \nrebels controlled these areas because of the mineral wealth and that \nwith their control of these areas came their lawlessness and with \nlawlessness came the impunity of rape.\n\n[[Page S4697]]\n\n  Rape, displacement, insecurity, forced labor, child soldiers, curable \nillnesses left untreated, and deaths of 1,500 people a day are only a \nfew of the human indignities directly and indirectly surrounding this \nstruggle for control of the minerals in eastern Congo. However there is \nno room for turning a blind eye on this matter when we all must be \nactors in this supply-chain--from miner to consumer.\n  American greatness has always been founded on our fundamental \ngoodness. We need to be a nation where the strong protect the weak and \npeople of privilege assist those in poverty. It says a lot about the \nkind of America we all should work for when we speak out against this \ntype of tragedy and commit ourselves to those who are suffering there.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senators \nBrownback and Durbin as an original cosponsor of the Congo Conflict \nMinerals Act of 2009. The purpose of this bill is to bring greater \nattention and transparency to the way in which the trade in three \nminerals--columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, or wolframite--is \nintertwined with the ongoing violence, displacement and human rights \nabuses in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The metals derived \nfrom these three minerals are used widely in the electronic products \nthat we use daily, from cell phones to laptops to digital cameras. By \nworking to ensure the raw materials used in those products are not \nbenefiting armed groups, we can have a positive impact on ending armed \nconflict and human rights abuses in the Congo.\n  Specifically, this bill charges the State Department to support the \nwork of the United Nations Group of Experts to further investigate and \nprovide companies with guidance on the links between natural resources \nand the financing of armed groups. It also charges the State Department \nwith developing a strategy to help break these linkages, while helping \ngovernments in the region to establish the necessary frameworks and \ninstitutions to monitor and regulate the cross-border trade of these \nminerals. Then, this bill requires U.S.-registered companies selling \nproducts containing those three minerals to disclose the country of \norigin of those minerals and, if they come from Congo or neighboring \ncountries, to give further information, including the mine of origin. \nThis requirement will compel companies to take responsibility for their \nsuppliers and thus bring greater transparency to the trade in these \nminerals, which may enable more targeted actions down the road. \nFinally, this bill encourages USAID to expand programs seeking to \nimprove the conditions and livelihood prospects for communities \naffected by this violence in Congo. We must not forget that the long-\nterm goal is not to shut this trade down, but to support a conflict-\nfree mining economy that benefits the Congolese people.\n  The United Nations Group of Experts has reported over the years that \nvarious illegal armed groups in eastern Congo profit greatly from the \nregion's vast natural resources. In February 2008, the Group of Experts \nstated, ``individuals and entities buying mineral output from areas of \nthe eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo with a strong \nrebel presence are violating the sanctions regime when they do not \nexercise due diligence to ensure their mineral purchases do not provide \nassistance to illegal armed groups.'' They defined due diligence as \ndetermining the precise identify of the deposits from which the \nminerals have been mined, establishing whether or not these deposits \nare controlled and/or taxed by illegal armed groups, and refusing to \nbuy minerals known to originate--or suspected to originate--from \ndeposits controlled/taxed by these armed groups. In December 2008, the \nUnited Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1857, \nbroadening existing sanctions relating to Congo to include individuals \nor entities supporting the illegal armed groups through the illicit \ntrade of natural resources. The resolution also encouraged member \ncountries to ensure that companies handling minerals from Congo \nexercise due diligence with their suppliers.\n  The U.S. has invested financial resources and diplomacy over recent \nyears in trying to bring peace and stability to eastern Congo, and \nthere have been some successes. However, our efforts have ultimately \nbeen hindered by a failure to directly address the underlying causes of \nconflict. A study by the Government Accountability Office released in \n2007 found that U.S. efforts in Congo are undermined by weak governance \nand mismanagement of natural resources. The plunder and unregulated \ntrade of eastern Congo's rich mineral base continues to make war a \nprofitable enterprise. This legislation attempts to finally confront \nand address that problem. It commits the United States government and \nthose companies under our jurisdiction to shed light on the dynamics of \neastern Congo's mineral economy and to take actions to reduce its \nexploitation by armed groups. This can be an important step--perhaps \neven a transitional one--as we work with our regional partners to help \nthem establish and implement better frameworks for regulation and \noversight.\n  Some may say the bill goes too far, while others may argue that this \nbill does not go far enough; that it has loopholes and lacks sufficient \n``teeth.'' This bill is not perfect. However, we must realize the \nconflict mineral problem is a complex one. This legislation is just a \nfirst step to bring greater transparency to that problem, which will \nthen enable more comprehensive, robust and targeted measures down the \nroad. At the same time, we must tread carefully because there are many \ncommunities in eastern Congo whose livelihoods are intertwined with the \nmining economy. All-out prohibitions or blanket sanctions could be \ncounterproductive and negatively affect the very people we seek to \nhelp. I am confident that this bill is sensitive to that complex \nreality. It tasks the Government Accountability Office, within two \nyears, with assessing any problems resulting from the implementation of \nthis Act, determining any adverse impacts on local Congolese \ncommunities, and making recommendations for improving its \neffectiveness. It also urges USAID to expand its programs to work with \nthese communities and improve their livelihood prospects.\n  I also realize that some others may argue that this bill goes too \nfar; that it imposes impractical or onerous requirements on companies \nwho end-use these minerals. Similar arguments were made in the early \ndays of the Kimberley Process. I appreciate that these three minerals \noften pass through extensive supply chains and processing stages before \nthe relevant metals are used in technological products. Bringing \ntransparency to those supply chains may not be easy, but it is \nsomething we can and should expect of industry when certain commodities \nare known to be fueling human rights violations. Industry itself has \nacknowledged this. In February 2009, the Electronic Industry \nCitizenship Coalition, which includes several major U.S. electronic \ncompanies, put out a statement saying that companies can and should \nuphold responsible practices in their operations and work with \nsuppliers to meet social and environmental standards with respect to \nthe raw materials used in the manufacture of their products. That was a \nbold statement and I want to work with companies to make it a reality \nwith respect to Congo.\n  I traveled in 2007 to eastern Congo and saw firsthand the grave \nsuffering of people who have lived through a decade of conflict and \nhumanitarian crisis. The numbers are staggering: an estimated 5.4 \nmillion deaths over the last decade--making it the deadliest conflict \nsince the Second World War. In addition, millions of people are still \ndisplaced from their homes, living in squalid camps where children are \nsubject to forced recruitment and women suffer unspeakable levels of \nsexual violence. In my travels to many parts of Africa over the years, \nthe suffering of women and girls in eastern Congo particularly stands \nout. I met with women and girls there who had been gang raped, often \nleaving them with horrific physical and psychological damage. I met \nwith women who had lost their husbands, their homes, and their \nlivelihoods and yet against all odds they refused to give up--if only \nfor the sake of their children. I believe this bill will make attaining \npeace for these women and their families a little easier and that is \none of the reasons why I am supporting it.\n  In 2006, under the leadership of then-Senator Obama and Senator\n\n[[Page S4698]]\n\nBrownback, the U.S. Congress passed the Democratic Republic of Congo \nRelief, Security and Democracy Promotion Act. That bill committed the \nUnited States to work comprehensively toward peace, prosperity and good \ngovernance in the Congo. The Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009 seeks \nto move us a step closer toward those goals. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it, and thank Senators Brownback and Durbin for their \nleadership on this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4698-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 111--RECOGNIZING JUNE 6, 2009, AS THE 70TH \nANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGIC DATE WHEN THE M.S.

St. Louis set \n     sail on June 6, 1939 for return to Antwerp, Belgium with the \n     refugees; and\n       Whereas 254 former passengers of the M.S. St. Louis died \n     under Nazi rule: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that June 6, 2009, marks the 70th \n     anniversary of the tragic date when the M.S. St. Louis \n     returned to Europe after its passengers were refused \n     admittance to the United States and other countries in the \n     Western Hemisphere;\n       (2) honors the memory of the 937 refugees aboard the M.S. \n     St. Louis, most of whom were Jews fleeing Nazi oppression, \n     and 254 of whom subsequently died during the Holocaust;\n       (3) acknowledges the suffering of those refugees caused by \n     the refusal of the United States, Cuban, and Canadian \n     governments to provide them political asylum; and\n       (4) recognizes the 70th anniversary of the M.S. St. Louis \n     tragedy as an opportunity for public officials and educators \n     to raise awareness about an important historical event, the \n     lessons of which are relevant to current and future \n     generations.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, seventy two years ago the M.S. St. Louis, a \nGerman ocean liner, sailed from Hamburg, Germany to Havana, Cuba with \n937 passengers, mostly Jewish refugees searching for the freedom and \nsafety of the American dream. Those passengers left their homes because \nof state supported anti-semitism including violent pogroms, expulsion \nfrom public schools and service, and arrest and imprisonment solely \nbecause of Jewish heritage. Some passengers were released from prisons \nat Buchenwald and Dachau only because they were immigrating out of the \ncountry. With their freedom and safety stripped away by Nazi \npersecution, these refugees sailed for Cuba, a way station to wait for \nentry visas to the U.S.\n  When the M.S. St. Louis arrived in Cuba, only 28 passengers were \nallowed to disembark. Corruption and political maneuvering within the \nCuban government invalidated the transit visas of the other passengers. \nThose individuals waited with great hope for a remedy that would \nprovide refuge far from Nazi persecution. Before returning to Europe, \nthe ship sailed towards Miami in hopes of a solution. The ship sailed \nso close to Florida that the passengers could see the lights of Miami. \nOne survivor remembers his father commenting that ``Florida's golden \nshores, so near, might as well be 4,000 miles away for all the good it \ndid them.''\n  The US Immigration and Nationality Act of 1924 strictly limited the \nnumber of immigrants admitted to the U.S. each year and in 1939 the \nwaiting list for German-Austrian immigration was several years long. \nWhile the press was largely sympathetic to the plight of the passengers \nof the M.S. St. Louis, no extraordinary measures were taken to permit \nthe refugees to enter the United States. The passengers were told that \nthey must ``await their turns on the waiting list and qualify for and \nobtain immigration visas''.\n  On June 6 the M.S. St. Louis sailed back to Europe with nearly all of \nits original passengers. Refuge for the passengers was eventually \nobtained in Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. World \nWar II started three months later and those countries, with the \nexception of Great Britain, fell to Nazi occupation. Two hundred and \nfifty-four of those passengers died during the Holocaust and many \nothers suffered under Nazi persecution and in concentration camps.\n  During this week when we remember the Holocaust, it is appropriate \nand right to acknowledge the voyage of the M.S. St. Louis and the lives \nand the dreams of those refugees who made a trip towards freedom only \nto be returned to Europe. This Senate Resolution acknowledges the 70th \nanniversary of the voyage of the M.S. St. Louis and honors the memory \nof those passengers, 254 of who died during the Holocaust. This \nresolution also provides an opportunity for public officials and \neducators to reflect on this historic event and lessons that are \nrelevant to current and future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4698-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4698-S4699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 112--DESIGNATING FEBRUARY 8, 2010, AS ``BOY SCOUTS OF \n AMERICA DAY'', IN CELEBRATION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LARGEST \n            YOUTH SCOUTING ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. Hutchison, \nMr. Cochran, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Coburn, \nMr. Lugar, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Burr, Mr. Brown, Mr. Carper, Mr. \nAlexander, Mr. Inhofe, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Risch, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Thune, \nMr. Casey, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Warner, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Begich, Mr. \nConrad, and Mr. Johanns) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 19\n\n       Whereas in March 2009, the Shi'ite Personal Status Law was \n     approved by the parliament of Afghanistan and signed by \n     President Hamid Karzai;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations, the law legalizes \n     marital rape by mandating that a wife cannot refuse sex to \n     her husband unless she is ill;\n       Whereas the law also weakens mothers' rights in the event \n     of a divorce and prohibits a woman from leaving her home \n     unless her husband determines it is for a ``legitimate \n     purpose'';\n       Whereas President Barack Obama has called the law \n     ``abhorrent'' and stated that ``there are certain basic \n     principles that all nations should uphold, and respect for \n     women and respect for their freedom and integrity is an \n     important principle'';\n       Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \n     Rights has said that the law represents a ``huge step in the \n     wrong direction'' and is ``extraordinary, reprehensible and \n     reminiscent of the decrees made by the Taliban regime in \n     Afghanistan in the 1990s'';\n       Whereas the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) has asserted that passage of the law \n     could discourage countries in Europe from contributing \n     additional troops to help combat terrorism in the region;\n       Whereas President Karzai has instructed the Government of \n     Afghanistan and members of the clergy to review the law and \n     change any articles that are not in keeping with \n     Afghanistan's Constitution and Islamic Sharia, yet has not \n     made a concrete declaration that the provision legalizing \n     marital rape and other provisions curtailing women's rights \n     will be removed completely;\n       Whereas the law includes provisions that are fundamentally \n     incompatible with the obligations of the Government of \n     Afghanistan under the various international instruments that \n     it has ratified, as well as under its own Constitution;\n       Whereas Afghanistan is a signatory of the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which establishes the \n     principle of nondiscrimination, including on the basis of \n     sex, and states that men and women are entitled to equal \n     rights to marriage, during marriage, and at its dissolution;\n       Whereas Afghanistan became a party to the International \n     Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, done at New \n     York December 16, 1966, and entered into force January 3, \n     1976 (ICESCR), which emphasizes the principle of self-\n     determination, in that men and women may freely determine \n     their political status as well as their economic, social, and \n     cultural development;\n       Whereas Afghanistan acceded to the Convention on the \n     Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, \n     done at New York December 18, 1979, and entered into force \n     September 3, 1981 (CEDAW), which condemns discrimination \n     against women in all its forms and reaffirms the equal rights \n     and responsibilities of men and women during marriage and at \n     its dissolution;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding any declarations or reservations \n     made upon ratification of these various international \n     conventions, the Government of Afghanistan is under an \n     obligation not to act in any way which might defeat the \n     object and purpose of these conventions, pursuant to the \n     Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, done at New York \n     May 23, 1969, and entered into force January 27, 1980, which \n     is widely recognized as embodying customary international \n     law;\n       Whereas Article 22 of the Constitution of Afghanistan \n     (2003) prohibits any kind of discrimination between and \n     privilege among the citizens of Afghanistan and establishes \n     the equal rights of all citizens before the law;\n       Whereas Article 54 of the Constitution of Afghanistan \n     obligates the Government of Afghanistan to ensure the \n     physical and psychological well-being of the family, \n     especially of mothers and children;\n       Whereas the international community and the United States \n     have a long-standing commitment to and interest in working \n     with the people and Government of Afghanistan to re-establish \n     respect for fundamental human rights and protect women's \n     rights in Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas the provisions in the Shi'ite Personal Status Law \n     that restrict women's rights are diametrically opposed to \n     those goals: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) urges the Government of Afghanistan and President Hamid \n     Karzai to declare the provisions of the Shi'ite Personal \n     Status Law on marital rape and restrictions on women's \n     freedom of movement unconstitutional and an erosion of growth \n     and development in Afghanistan;\n       (2) supports the decision by President Karzai to analyze \n     the draft law and strongly urges him not to publish it on the \n     grounds that it violates the Constitution of Afghanistan and \n     the basic human rights of women;\n       (3) encourages the Secretary of State, the Special \n     Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Ambassador-\n     at-Large for International Women's Issues, and the United \n     States Ambassador to Afghanistan to consider and address the \n     status of women's rights and security in Afghanistan to \n     ensure that these rights are not being eroded through unjust \n     laws, policies, or institutions; and\n       (4) encourages the Government of Afghanistan to solicit \n     information and advice from the Ministry of Justice, the \n     Ministry for Women's Affairs, the Afghanistan Independent \n     Human Rights Commission, and women-led nongovernmental \n     organizations to ensure that current and future legislation \n     and official policies protect and uphold the equal rights of \n     women, including through national campaigns to lead public \n     discourse on the importance of women's status and rights to \n     the overall stability of Afghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/23/senate-section/article/S4699-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4699-S4700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1003.
