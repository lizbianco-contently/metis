Mr. President, a long 10 weeks ago, President Obama made \nhistory when he nominated the Nation's first Hispanic to be a Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court, and only the third woman. This week, the \nSenate will make history when we confirm her.\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is an American of tremendous qualifications. \nBoth her academic record and her career experience are second to none. \nShe graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and went on to \ndo as well at Yale, where she was a member of the Law Review. She has \nserved as a prosecuting attorney, a lawyer in private practice; she was \non the trial bench and an appellate judge. After she is confirmed, she \nwill be the only Justice in the current Supreme Court with experience \nas a trial judge--experience that I believe will be valuable to her \ncolleagues.\n  One of the objections people have had about the makeup of the Court \nis that people come with basically no experience in the courtroom other \nthan the appellate judges who sit in back rooms and listen to arguments \nonce in a while and not in a courtroom listening to cases being \npresented, sustaining and overruling objections, and listening to \narguments to the jury. They simply have not had that experience. She \nhas. She has developed a 17-year record as a moderate, mainstream \njudge.\n  When the judge testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee for 4 \ngrueling days, she respectfully and thoroughly answered questions from \nboth sides of the aisle--Democrats and Republicans. This week, the \nSenate will debate her nomination. It will be a fair debate. It will be \na full debate.\n  I appreciate the statements from my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who have said they will vote to confirm her to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Many Senators have very thoughtfully said they regret how politicized \nthe process of confirming judges has become in recent years. An unsung \nhero in the battle for the judiciary is Lamar Alexander, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. Senator Alexander has been Governor of the State of \nTennessee. He was in the Cabinet as Secretary of Education. During the \nvery difficult nuclear option, when there was a knockdown, drag-out \nfight that I felt would have ruined the basic makeup of the Senate and \nwhat the Senate stood for, it was he who quietly and in the background \ncame up with the idea of the Gang of 14. Basically, he said to me and \nto others: Why don't we have an equal number of Democrats and \nRepublicans sit down and try to work this out. He took none of the \nlimelight. He stepped back, and the process he suggested went forward.\n  He has decided to vote for Sonia Sotomayor. Most of his colleagues \nare not going to do that. I am sure if you ask Lamar Alexander why he \ndecided to do that, of course, the qualifications are fine, but I think \none reason he wants to do it is he believes in having temperate \nsuggestions on both sides of the aisle to make a better Senate.\n  So I am very fond of Lamar Alexander. I appreciate his ability to \nbring sides together, and I appreciate his standing up in this instance \nfor this judge, because the process of confirming judges has become in \nrecent years very politicized. Whose fault is it? It is probably the \nfault of both sides. It is something that just got out of hand. \nHopefully, we can bring it back to where it has been in the past.\n  I have tried during the time I have been the majority leader to allow \nfull and firm debate. There have been limited instances out of \nnecessity where we haven't had full opportunities to amend pieces of \nlegislation. That is the way it used to be when I came here, and that \nis the way I hope it is going to be in the future.\n  In light of the battle we have had in the past over the so-called \nnuclear option, I appreciate the sentiments of a number of Senators. \nLindsey Graham is an example. Lindsey Graham has had editorials all \nover the country written on his behalf. Columns have been written in \nmajor newspapers in Nevada complimenting the Senator from South \nCarolina for the statements he made regarding this judicial problem we \nhave now.\n  I am disappointed that not more of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle are likely to vote for this outstanding nominee, particularly \nin light of her record and qualifications, but maybe in the future \nthings will get better. I am, however, grateful for the respect my \ncolleagues have shown her throughout this process, even those who have \nsaid they are not going to vote for her.\n  I look forward to voting to confirm Judge Sotomayor as soon as we can \nso that she can continue her commendable service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/04/senate-section/article/S8710-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate will soon begin debate on \nthe nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of \nthe Supreme Court. Before that debate begins, I wish to make a few \nobservations.\n  First, I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, along with their respective staffs, for conducting what can \nonly be described as a dignified and respectful hearing. I know it was \ngratifying to them, as it was to me, to hear Judge Sotomayor say that \nevery single Senator who had promised to give her the opportunity to \nexplain her views had kept that promise. It was equally gratifying to \nhear Senators Durbin and Schumer describe the hearings as respectful \nand fair.\n  As I have often said, our goal in the Senate should be to disagree \nwithout being disagreeable. I think we hit the mark during the hearings \non Judge Sotomayor, and the Judiciary Committee should be commended for \nit. As we begin final consideration, our goal should be the same: Those \nwho support the nomination will make their case, those who oppose it \nwill make theirs, and then we will vote, fulfilling our constitutional \nresponsibility with the seriousness and the deliberation the American \npeople expect.\n  Over several weeks, I have outlined my concerns about the nominee in \nsome detail. Once the hearing was over, I said that those concerns had \nonly multiplied. But the primary reason I will not support this \nnomination, as I have already said, is because I cannot support the so-\ncalled empathy standard upon which Judge Sotomayor was selected and to \nwhich she, herself, has subscribed in her writings and rulings.\n  As I have said, the empathy standard is a very fine quality. And I \nhave no doubt that Senator Obama, now President Obama, had very good \nintentions when he made the case for a so-called empathy standard as a \nSenator, a candidate, and now as President. But when it comes to \njudging--when it comes to judging--empathy is only good if you are \nlucky enough to be the person or group for whom the judge in question \nhas empathy. In those cases, it is the judge, not the law, which \ndetermines the outcome. That is a dangerous road to go down if you \nbelieve, as I do, in a nation not of men but of laws.\n  Judge Sotomayor has impressed all of us with her life story, but if \nempathy is the new standard, then the burden is on nominees such as she \nwho are chosen on that basis to demonstrate a firm commitment to equal \njustice under the law. On the contrary, Judge Sotomayor has openly \ndoubted the ability of judges to adhere to this core principle, and she \nhas even doubted the wisdom of them doing so.\n  In her writings and in her speeches, Judge Sotomayor has repeatedly \nstated that there is no objectivity or neutrality in judging. Let me \nsay that again. Judge Sotomayor has repeatedly stated that there is no \nobjectivity or neutrality in judging. She has said her experiences will \naffect the facts she chooses to see as a judge. Her experiences will \naffect the facts she chooses to see as a judge. She has argued that in \ndeciding cases judges should bring their sympathies and prejudices to \nbear. She has dismissed judicial impartiality as an ``aspiration'' that \ncannot be met even in most cases. She has even questioned whether a \njudge trying to be as fair as possible in applying the law does a \ndisservice both to the law and to society. These statements suggest not \njust a sense that impartiality is not possible but that it is not even \nworth the effort.\n  Nothing could be more important in evaluating a judicial nominee than \nwhere they stand on the question of equal justice. As I have said, \nAmericans expect one thing when they walk into a courtroom--whether it \nis traffic court or the Supreme Court--and that is equal treatment \nunder the law.\n\n[[Page S8711]]\n\nAmericans have accepted serious ideological differences in Supreme \nCourt nominees over the years. But one thing they will never, ever \ntolerate is a belief that some groups are more deserving of a fair \nshake than others. Nothing could be more offensive to the American \nsensibility than that.\n  Judge Sotomayor is certainly a fine person with an impressive story \nand a distinguished background. But a judge must be able to check his \nor her personal or political agenda at the courtroom door and do \njustice evenhandedly, as the judicial oath requires. This is the most \nfundamental test. It is a test that Judge Sotomayor does not pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/04/senate-section/article/S8711-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the second \nrollcall vote be vitiated and replaced by a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1912\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this vote will be on amendment No. 1912. \nThe amendment eliminates, as recommended by the President of the United \nStates, the USDA Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program, \nalso known as the Small Watershed Program.\n  This program is the perfect example of how reckless earmarking can \ndevastate a well-intentioned government program. Like the previous four \nPresidents' budgets, this administration has proposed to terminate this \naccount--four previous Presidents--because ``Congress has earmarked \nvirtually all of this program in recent years, meaning that the agency \nis unable to prioritize projects on any merit-based criteria, such as \ncost-effectiveness.''\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Small Watershed \nProgram was 97 percent earmarked in fiscal year 2009, which severely \nmarginalized the ability of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \nevaluate and prioritize projects.\n  A 2003 Office of Management and Budget study showed this program has \na lower economic return than any other Federal flood prevention \nprogram, including those in the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency.\n  The onslaught of earmarks over the years has most certainly \ncontributed to the current backlog of about 300 unfunded authorized \nsmall watershed projects, totaling $1.2 billion.\n  As was originally intended, the Small Watershed Program may be a \nworthwhile program, but by inundating it with so-called \n``congressionally designated projects,'' the program is challenged to \nfunction properly to the point where four previous Presidents have \nrecommended its termination. Nevertheless, the Appropriations Committee \nhasn't given up on plundering it just yet. The bill provides $24.3 \nmillion for this program, including $16.5 million in earmarks for \nvarious unauthorized projects.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the President's recommendation. \nAgain, I will quote from the President's recommendation--the President \nof the United States:\n\n       The administration proposes to terminate the Watershed and \n     Flood Prevention Operations Program. The Congress has \n     earmarked virtually all of this program in recent years, \n     meaning that the agency is unable to prioritize projects on \n     any merit-based criteria, such as cost-effectiveness.\n\n  So it goes on and on. Every analysis is that it has a lower economic \nreturn than any other program. Four Presidents have sought to eliminate \nit. We will probably lose this vote. But if there is ever a graphic \nexample that once a program is established and once you fund it, it \nacquires a constituency and a powerful special interest and that \nfunding continues on and on--we are proving, and we will continue to \nprove as we go through the appropriations bills, that there is no \nprogram that, once it exists, is going to be eliminated by this body, \nand that the appropriators continue to defy not only the President of \nthe United States but logic and good sense as we amass deficits of \nmonumental proportions which are mortgaging our children's and \ngrandchildren's futures.\n  We cannot even stop a program the President wants terminated, that \nhas no value, that the Office of Management and Budget and any \nobjective observer will say deserves termination. It\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\nis only $24.3 million, but the appropriators will join and jawbone \nothers, and we will lose this vote, the same way we lost a vote \nyesterday that, again, had been recommended for termination by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I didn't come up with this. It wasn't my idea to terminate it, \nalthough I certainly do think we should. It was the idea of the \nPresident of the United States. It is also every objective observer's \nidea. We will prove that not only will we not eliminate that program, \nbut we send the message to the country that this program--even though \nthe President wants it terminated, even though it has a clear record of \ntotal inefficiency--we will continue to maintain.\n  Sooner or later, there will be more tea parties and more protests, \nand the American people are going to rise up and say: Stop it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this program provides for cooperation \nbetween the Federal Government, State government agencies, and local \norganizations to prevent erosion, floodwater and sediment damages, and \nto further the conservation and proper utilization of lands in \nauthorized watersheds.\n  This program helps communities prepare detailed watershed work plans \nfor flood prevention projects in cooperation with soil conservation \ndistricts and other local sponsoring organizations.\n  Annual natural resource benefits include 90 million tons of soil \nsaved from erosion; 47,000 miles of streams and stream corridors \nenhanced or protected; more than 1.8 million acre-feet of water \nconserved; nearly 280,000 acres of wetlands created, enhanced or \nrestored; and over 9 million acres of upland wildlife habitat created, \nenhanced, or restored.\n  This is a very important program. I urge Senators to oppose this \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have a lot of sympathy for the \ncomments made by the Senator from Arizona. I think he has accurate \npoints. My colleague from Wisconsin makes points, as well, about the \nprogram overall.\n  My point in rising is to say that the system is very difficult to \nchange and to get things pulled out. That is why we have to change the \nsystem. What I have put forward for years is a proposal to take a BRAC-\ntype process--the military base closing process--and have it looked at \nand make a recommendation to the Congress and then one vote on the \nentire package. That is a way we found to eliminate military bases.\n  When a program like this is started, or others, there are people who \nsay: Wait a minute. This works for my district even if it doesn't work \nfor somebody else. This is a high-priority project, even if it is not \nfor somebody else. That system is such that it is built to spend, not \nbuilt to cull, where you can cull things out and say this one doesn't \nlook good, but this does, in trying to get it through a body of 100 \npeople. We are trying to get an Agriculture appropriations bill through \nthat we have not been able to get done in 3 years. We haven't had floor \ntime for an Agriculture appropriations bill. We are trying to move this \nforward.\n  I think the Senator has some excellent points. We need to pass this \nsort of BRAC process for the rest of government so we actually do go at \na culling process that everybody has faith in, which has worked before \non military bases and we now can apply to the rest of government. That \nis a system where we can eliminate things, which we need to do in a \nnumber of areas. It is not going to happen on a one-shot-by-one-shot \nbasis because some people say: This is a program that really works for \nmy area. Then we get hung up on the floor with lengthy battles, and \nthen we are never able to get the bill through.\n  I urge my colleagues--and I hope some on the majority side will look \nat this CARFA bill, we call it, to see about putting that in place so \nwe can get at these in a systematic way that everybody is agreeable to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2030\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak in opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona to strike funding for Iowa State \nUniversity's Rural Vitality Center.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, Iowa historically has \nranked near the bottom nationally in business startups. Small \nbusinesses with less than five employees account for 86 percent of Iowa \nbusinesses, yet these enterprises increasingly are bypassed by existing \nentrepreneurial assistance and capital networks, particularly in \nnonmetro areas. The Iowa Rural Vitality Project is Iowa State \nUniversity's response to help foster innovation and economic vitality \nin rural Iowa.\n  The Vitality Center engages with academic institutions, community \nleaders, and economic development agencies to leverage resources. The \ncenter provides statewide leadership by building community capacity for \nassisting and supporting entrepreneurs and community foundations.\n  During the past year, the Vitality Center has led an effort to \norganize a statewide microloan foundation and complementary community \nmicroenterprise development initiatives. The program targets low- and \nmoderate-income people and underserved rural areas. The microloan \nprogram helps fund businesses that don't quite meet the commercial \nlenders' requirements for credit, which is even more important during \nthese tight lending times. This initiative is creating two to three new \nbusiness startups per month that would not otherwise exist.\n  According to Iowa State University, the funding approved for fiscal \nyear 2010 will be used to encourage the development of 20 community-\nbased entrepreneurial development systems, allow for expanded \nphilanthropic capacity in 10 community foundation projects, and \nresearch new strategies for enhancing rural vitality for rural and \nunderserved communities. Their program, with this funding, will help \ncontinue their creation of jobs across the State.\n\n[[Page S8713]]\n\n  The Feds aren't the only ones supporting this center. They have \nreceived grants from private sources and the State legislature for \ntheir efforts. It also receives a $1 for $1 match from each community \ndemonstration project for approximately 10 projects, and approximately \na $2 non-Federal to $1 Federal match from Iowa State University on the \ncenter operations budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment to strike the funding \nfor this center.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2030\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, all time is yielded back on McCain amendment \nNo. 2030.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2030) was rejected.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Brown \nbe recognized for a period of approximately 8 minutes, followed by \nSenator Sanders, to speak until 11:15 a.m., until our recess occurs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           health care reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise again, as I have every day for the \nlast week or so, to share some letters from Ohioans--from people in \nPainesville, Findlay, Lima, Springfield, Zanesville, and all over my \nState--which speak to people and their health care situations.\n  We hear discussion in this Chamber of market exclusivity and the \ngateway and the exchanges and all these kinds of Washington terms that \npeople don't necessarily understand, but we don't talk often enough \nabout how this health care system today is damaging the country. We \ndon't think often enough about the situations people find themselves \nin.\n  We are not just enacting health care reform. If we do nothing, if we \ncontinue down this road, it means that small businesses, that are so \noverwhelmed with health care costs, are going to go out of business; \nthat more small businesses are going to have to eliminate their \ninsurance programs; and larger businesses--our biggest companies in the \ncountry--are having trouble competing internationally because of health \ncare costs. People are paying huge costs out of pocket for their copays \nor deductibles, and so they cannot afford health care insurance. This \nmeans many people have deferred care, which is no care.\n  At the same time, we see the Nation's insurance companies all too \noften using preexisting conditions to deny care; using lifetime caps to \ndeny care. This system is broken. Many parts of the system work, and \nthe point of this bill is to protect what works and to fix what is \nbroken in our health care system.\n  For 4 or 5 minutes, I wish to share some letters I have received from \npeople around my State of Ohio about the situations they are facing \nwith their health care. This is Debra, from Adams County. Adams County \nis three counties east of Cincinnati on the Ohio River.\n  Debra writes:\n\n       In October 2003, I discovered I had breast cancer. Luckily \n     we found it early and I was treated with a lumpectomy and \n     radiation treatments. I'm doing fine now. But I had to fight \n     with the insurance companies to pay for the radiation \n     treatments. I had 32 radiation sessions and they were over \n     $800 per treatment. To 2002 I paid $218 per month for health \n     insurance. Over the next 3 years my premiums were increased \n     to $550 per month. Today, the insurance company increased \n     premiums to $719 per month.\n       We are not poor but we are not rich, but $719 per month for \n     insurance is half of what I receive in a month. I cannot \n     afford to pay that amount. No insurance company wants to take \n     me because of my preexisting breast cancer condition. I don't \n     know what I am going to do. If I cancel the insurance and \n     then I come down with cancer again or another serious \n     illness, we will lose everything we worked so hard for all \n     our lives.\n       I paid for my own insurance since 1985 and have never asked \n     for help, but I can't do this. Please can you help me?\n\n  Think about this. This is a woman who was paying $200 per month for \nhealth insurance. She paid for health insurance for almost 25 years. \nThen she gets sick. Then she had to fight with her insurance to get \nthem to even pay for the treatment. Then they more than tripled the \ncost of her health insurance.\n  That is not what health insurance should do. That is not what a \nfunctioning good health care system should do. That is why we need this \nhealth care reform, to help people such as Debra in Adams County.\n  Barbara from Delaware County, an increasingly suburban but somewhat \nrural county straight north of Columbus, central Ohio. Barbara writes:\n\n       I had excellent insurance when employed for many years. \n     Then I was laid off when I turned 63. I went without \n     insurance and tried to find a health insurance policy which I \n     could afford. I was very happy to turn 65 and have Medicare.\n       After having worked for 30 years, I am very grateful for \n     both Social Security and for Medicare. At the age of 68, I \n     don't mind paying into the system since I am glad to be part \n     of a system that helps all of us who are in our advanced \n     years. The security of knowing that I would be covered if \n     something unforeseen would occur keeps my stress level down.\n\n  Barbara lost her job at 63, lost her insurance, fortunately had no \ncatastrophic illness or disease happen between 63 and 65 until she got \non Medicare. But when I hear this kind of assessment--when I hear her \ntalk about Social Security and Medicare and how it has been for her--\nand then last night on this Senate floor I heard one of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle talk about how government cannot do \nanything right, we don't want government involved in health care, this \nis all a conspiracy of big government intrusion into our lives--think \nabout Social Security; think about Medicare.\n  We know government has run Social Security and Medicare pretty darn \nwell. Medicare has an administrative cost of well under 5 percent. \nPrivate insurance has administrative costs of 15, 20, 25, sometimes 30 \npercent. We know this health care system--this is not going to be a \nsingle-payer system. People will have choices between the public option \nand individual insurance plans. That is the way we are going to rebuild \nthis health care system. If you are in health care that you appreciate \nand you are satisfied with, you can keep it. We are going to put some \nconsumer protections on it to make it better.\n  Barbara speaks so articulately about why Medicare and Social Security \nwork.\n  The last couple of letters I will read--this is from Cynthia, from \nMercer County, on the Indiana border in western Ohio.\n\n       My son had a cyst removed in February that cost $8,000 and \n     I had hernia surgery in May that cost $12,000. My insurance \n     company picked up some of the cost but I only make $31,000 a \n     year. We can't even afford my property taxes. My son also has \n     a learning disability and will likely not go to college this \n     fall; therefore, my insurance company sees fit to drop him \n     from coverage in October when he turns 19. Americans who work \n     hard should be at least granted excellent affordable health \n     care without breaking the bank. Let's get the best care \n     possible, not just a Band-Aid.\n\n  Cynthia's son, when he turns 19, gets dropped off the insurance plan. \nOur legislation says if you choose to, you can stay on your parents' \ninsurance plan until you turn 26. So it gets people through those tough \nyears of school, looking for a job, maybe into the military, coming out \nof the military--all the things that happen in young lives. Our bill \nprotects people up to age 26.\n  Today, under the status quo, Cynthia is not protected. Cynthia's son \nis not protected. Cynthia cannot afford these huge costs, these huge \npremiums, these huge copays and deductibles. That is why we need a \nchange.\n  The last letter I will read is from Mike from Ross County. The county \nseat of Ross County is Chillicothe, a couple of counties south of \nColumbus. Mike writes:\n\n       I am a self-employed small businessman. I am unable to \n     obtain insurance for my wife and one of my two daughters. I \n     live that risk every day, praying that my wife and daughter \n     do not need major medical care. This is America, we can and \n     must do better than that.\n\n  One of the things we did in this bill was put together special \nprovisions for small business people so if you are self-employed, if \nyou run a small business, you can get insurance at a more reasonable \ncost. We know big insurance companies charge small business much more \nper person than they charge larger businesses. This will allow small\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\nbusiness to go with other small businesses in what we call the \nexchange, and they will get much better rates because the insurance \ncosts and the costs of illness and treatment will be spread over \nhundreds of thousands of people instead of only 5 or 6 or 10 people in \none of these health care plans in a small business.\n  This also has tax credits, additional tax credits for small \nbusinesses. We are going to see a lot of help in this legislation for \nsmall business.\n  I will close again saying our health care bill that was voted out of \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee protects what \nworks in our health care system and fixes what is broken. If you are \nhappy with your health care insurance, you can keep it. If you are \nhappy with your employer plan, you can keep it. We will build some \nconsumer protections around it.\n  If you are not happy, you are dissatisfied, or you don't have \ninsurance, you will get insurance under this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2276\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I thank the Senator and applaud his \nstrong efforts in fighting for health care for all Americans. I want to \ntake a few minutes right now to touch on an issue that in fact has not \ngotten a lot of discussion here in Congress and that is that family-\nbased dairy agriculture is on the verge of collapse. This is not a \nregional issue, this is a national issue. From the east coast to the \nwest coast, what we are seeing is prices plummeting for dairy farmers \nway below the cost of production. If Congress does not act, all over \nAmerica rural communities are going to be suffering economically. \nPeople are going to be losing their jobs. The American people \nincreasingly will not be able to obtain fresh locally produced food.\n  As we talk about stimulus, as we talk about trying to revive this \neconomy, let's remember rural America and let's remember the dairy \nfarmers throughout this country who are producing an important part of \nthe food we consume. At this moment, dairy farmers across the country \nare suffering from the lowest milk prices in four decades. Let me \nrepeat that. Dairy farmers across the country are suffering from the \nlowest milk prices in four decades.\n  In the last year, the price farmers receive for their milk has \nplummeted 41 percent, to $11.30 per hundredweight. To understand how \nlow $11.30 per hundredweight is, you must understand it takes $17 or \n$18 to produce a hundredweight of milk. In other words, for every cow \nthat is milked, the farmer is losing a substantial amount of money.\n  As a result of these low prices, many family farms have gone out of \nbusiness and, if we do not act immediately, you are going to see many \nmore, from one end of this country to the other, close up. I can tell \nyou in the State of Vermont there was a lot of publicity surrounding a \nfarm in the southern part of our State that had been in one family \nsince the Revolutionary War--since the Revolutionary War. But because \nof these horrendously low milk prices, that farm has gone up for sale.\n  This is not just an issue for dairy farmers. This is not just an \nissue for rural communities. This is an issue for every American who \nwants to gain access to good quality, locally produced food.\n  All over this country people are saying no, I don't want my food \ncoming in from China, I don't want my food coming in from places all \nover the world. I want to see the quality food that is produced in my \narea, in my State, in my region. If we do not act to protect family-\nbased dairy agriculture, we are going to increasingly lose that \nopportunity.\n  Let me underline this. I know the people familiar with dairy always \nsay these are great regional fights, the Northeast is fighting the \nMidwest is fighting the Southeast is fighting the west coast, and every \nregion has its own set of priorities.\n  This is not a regional issue, this is a national issue. Let me talk a \nlittle bit about what is happening, briefly, in various regions around \nthe country. California Farmers Union President Joaquin Contente spoke \nabout the situation in his State of California. He testified:\n\n       In my lifelong history as a dairy farmer, I have never seen \n     prices this far below our cost for this long and I have never \n     seen so many dairy producers so desperate for relief. In my \n     county alone--\n\n  This is in California, not Vermont.\n\n       In my county alone, 25 dairies have either filed or are in \n     the process of filing for bankruptcy and many more are closer \n     to bankruptcy each day.\n\n  Joaquin Contente, California Farmers Union president.\n  Let me talk about Texas, the Southwest. The executive director of the \nTexas Association of Dairymen spoke about the situation in his State of \nTexas. He said:\n\n       This is the worst situation I have seen since 1970. Some \n     say it is the worst since the depression.\n\n  That is the State of Texas. Let me talk about the Midwest, Wisconsin. \nA Stanley, WI dairy farmer stated:\n\n       In my area, farmers are burning up their equity accumulated \n     over their lifetimes. One farmer in my area had to cash out \n     his wife's IRA just to get crops planted this spring. My \n     parish priest in my small town has had to counsel one or more \n     dairy farmers a week to prevent their suicides. And we know \n     of reports across the country of farm suicides that have \n     already occurred.\n\n  These are just a few examples from California and Texas. I can go on \nand on about what is going on in California and the Northeast.\n  Last week, after Congress's strong urging, Secretary Vilsack \nannounced that the government would spend $243 million to raise price \nsupports for dairy farmers, and we very much appreciate the Secretary \nand the Obama administration's quick response to our needs. That \nsupport is important. It is likely to raise milk price supports by \nabout $1.25 per hundredweight, but that is nowhere near enough of what \nwe need when in fact cost of production is $17 or $18 per \nhundredweight.\n  This afternoon I will be offering legislation cosponsored by you, \nSenator Gillibrand, cosponsored by Senator Schumer, Senator Tom Udall, \nSenator Specter, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen, among others. This \namendment will go a long way to help farmers over the short-term \ncrisis.\n  Long term, obviously we need to do some fundamental rethinking about \ndairy agriculture, how you bring long-term stability to the dairy \nindustry and end that volatility that has been rampant in that industry \nfor so many years. There are so many ideas out there about how we bring \nlong-term stability for dairy farmers in this country. This is short-\nterm relief to make sure farmers all over this country do not go out of \nbusiness. What this amendment would do is provide the Secretary of \nAgriculture with $350 million in additional funding for milk price \nsupports. That would, again, bring the price up about another $1.50 per \nhundredweight. This short-term help could mean the difference between \neconomic viability or financial disaster for dairy farmers from one end \nof this country to the other.\n  Once again, all of us are focused on how we get out of this deep \nrecession. All of us are focused on how we create decent-paying jobs. I \nurge my colleagues, do not forget about rural America. Rural America, \nwhether it is Vermont, Wisconsin, California, Colorado--rural America \nis hurting. They need help as well.\n  Later on this afternoon I will be bringing forth this very important \namendment to provide some economic support for rural America and hope \nto have the support of all my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/04/senate-section/article/S8714-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8714-S8715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

I rise for a minute to concur with the comments of my \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Sanders.\n  I have spent some time on the phone over the last few weeks with \ndairy producers in Missouri. What is happening is heartbreaking. And in \nthis economic downturn, it is hard to look everywhere we can be \nlooking. One day, the car sector is grabbing our attention; another \nday, we are talking about what is going on in terms of utility costs \nfor our constituents; another day, we are back talking about whether \npeople can even afford health care. There are so many places we are \ntrying to look and do what is necessary to get us through this rough \npatch.\n  Unfortunately, the independent producers do not have a whole lot of \nlobbyists out there. A lot of the big, multinational agricultural \ncorporations have plenty of help.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senate Agriculture appropriations bill \ncontains $4.9 million to help public television stations meet the \nFederal mandate to provide over-the-air digital signals to rural areas, \nsimilar to last year's funding level. Rural public television stations \nthroughout the country are at extreme disadvantage when faced with the \ntask of converting their stations and vast network of translators from \nanalog to digital transmission. Why? Because they are spread over a \nlarger geographic area--private and some of the network stations--and \nthey have a much smaller population base to draw upon when funding \nsystem improvements than their urban counterparts. Urban stations have \na bigger population base.\n  To date, most rural stations have focused their resources on \nconverting transmitters to meet the Federal mandate. The funding \nprovided in this Agriculture appropriations bill will be critical to \nhelping stations transmit their signals far enough to reach people in \nrural areas far from the transmitters. Generally, stations have these \ntransmitters send a signal out over the airwaves, but in a large number \nof cases they need translators. They take the transmitter signal at a \ncertain point and then they boost the power so they can send it further \nout. That was also true under the old analog system. Obviously, the \nanalog translators would not work for digital, so we need digital \ntranslators. In most cases, for technical reasons, the digital \ntranslators cover less of an area, particularly in places that are \nhilly or mountainous, so additional translators are needed.\n  At present, we have millions of people living in rural America who \nsimply cannot get the over-the-air digital signal. These funds are \nallocated on a peer-review process within the Rural Utilities Service \nof the Department of Agriculture. For example, in my State of Iowa, a \nlarge number of people in the Dubuque area are not receiving the Iowa \npublic TV digital over-the-air signal now because of the lack of a \ndigital translator which gets its signal from a Cedar Rapids-Waterloo \ntransmitter. I understand also that the Oklahoma public television \nsystem received considerable funding through this program a few years \nago. But many other State systems have very real needs that have not \nbeen met. Few public TV stations are able to acquire the needed funds \nto do this. In the current 2009 round, public TV stations requested \nabout three times the available needed funding we have in the USDA \nprogram. While it is true that both the Department of Commerce and the \nCorporation for Public Television do provide equipment for public TV \nstations, it is also true that these funds are both inadequate to fully \nmeet all the needs they are intended for, and they have not been \nproviding significant funds for translators.\n  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides about $36 million \nfor public TV and radio stations for equipment. They have provided \ndigital equipment, shifting analog libraries to digital, and power \nequipment. But they have not focused on digital translators. It is not \ntheir mission to focus on the special needs of rural areas such as the \nRural Utilities Service must do. Even if they do in the future provide \nsome funding for translators, the total we now need is going to be far \nmore than the funds that will be available in the coming fiscal year. \nEven if they did have the funds, they asked for three times the amount \nof funding that we have in this bill to build these translators. The \nDepartment of Commerce also has a program which provides equipment, \nagain not focused on translators. They provide equipment such as \nnetwork operations equipment that allows stations to take signals from \na national broadcast and send them out over their transmitters. They \nprovide emergency funding when there is a local equipment failure but, \nagain, they have a very limited amount of money for translators.\n  Again, there is a considerable need for additional funds for digital \nTV to reach rural America. The lack of a single translator can mean \nthat 100,000 households are not able to get over-the-air digital \nsignals. These funds are badly needed. I thank my friend from Oklahoma \nfor letting me go first because I have to chair a hearing at 2:30. I \nwished to make these comments because I have real-time experience with \nthese translators in my State in Dubuque. But there are other places in \nrural Iowa that are on the fringes of where the transmitters are, and \nthey have to have these translators to get the signal out.\n  Again, one could say: Well, they charge the people. But there are not \nthat many people. They deserve to have public television also. That is \nwhat this money was for, the $4.9 million, to help them get these \ntranslators. It is not only Iowa, any State that has a lot of rural \narea, especially if it is hilly or mountainous, needs translators. I am \nnot an expert in this area whatsoever, but I know they cost money. I do \nknow the need is there. All I can say is, they had asked for three \ntimes more than what we have in this bill. So if there are some other \nfunds in Commerce or in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, I \nrather doubt they will be able to anywhere meet the need that is out \nthere, and they will be\n\n[[Page S8717]]\n\nback again next year asking for more money to get these translators \nbuilt, as we switch from the analog to digital.\n  I, respectfully, request that the Senate oppose the Coburn amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am constantly amazed. We have three \nseparate programs, of which this administration says we don't need one \npenny from the Department of Agriculture for this. That is what they \nsay. They say we have plenty of money in CPB to do everything that is \nneeded with the translator stations this year. We are 92 percent \ncomplete on everything that has been translated. This is similar to \nevery government program. They never die. Not only do we have the \nDepartment of Commerce that is going to have additional funding this \nyear for that very same thing, we have the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting. The fact is, they want it to go through the Agriculture \nDepartment because there is more control. We can direct it. We can have \nmore control.\n  We are in a crisis. We will have close to a $2 trillion deficit this \nyear. Here we have $4.9 million that the administration says isn't \nneeded. They want to get rid of it. They are right. What do we do? \nEvery time we come to approach a program, we decide we can't eliminate \nit. Every family in America today is eliminating a lot of programs for \nthemselves.\n  This appropriations bill is an atrocity. I will go through it so \neverybody can see what it is. In fiscal 2009, the grand total for this \nwas $128 billion. It is now $123 billion. Do you know why it is there? \nThey got $20 billion from mandatory in the stimulus and another $6 \nbillion in the stimulus. So this isn't a decrease. It is outrageous the \namount of money we are spending. We will go through it line by line.\n  Agriculture programs in 2009, discretionary were $6.85 billion. They \nare $7.22 billion. That is a 6-percent increase. The mandatory spending \nwas $18 billion. It is now $22 billion. That is a 21-percent increase. \nPlus they got $1 billion in the stimulus. So if you add that to the $30 \nbillion, we actually have $31 billion compared to $24 billion this \nyear. Think about what kind of increase that is. Title II conservation \nprograms was $969 million in 2009. We gave $340 million, which hasn't \nbeen spent yet; it will be spent this year. Yet we increase it another \n4.5 percent to $1.015 billion.\n  Rural development, they got $3 billion this year. In this bill they \nget 2.7. That is an 11-percent increase. That doesn't count the $4.36 \nbillion that was given in the stimulus. Domestic food programs went \nfrom $76 million to $86 million. We need that now, no complaint there. \nWe have a lot of people requiring our help right now, but they also got \n$20 billion which hasn't been spent yet in the stimulus. So we have \ngone from $76 million to $106 million, a 45-percent increase. Foreign \nassistance, we spent $1.5 billion on foreign assistance in agricultural \nprograms in 2009. This is at $2 billion, a 33-percent increase. Plus \nthey got $700 million in the stimulus that has not been spent. So add \nthat together and you have $2.1 billion versus 1.5.\n  It is ridiculous the amount of money that is in this appropriations \nbill. All these ought to be trimmed back based on what the stimulus was \ndoing rather than growing them at four times the rate of inflation. We \nare growing government in this bill four times the rate of inflation. \nWe are going to have a $2 trillion deficit and we are proud of this \nbill? This bill is a stinker.\n  FDA Commodities Futures Trading, $2.1 billion to $2.527 billion, a \n20-percent increase in one year. Let's talk about some of the separate \nprograms. Agricultural research got increased $200 million. By the time \nyou add in what we did in the stimulus, it goes from $1.18 to $1.23 \nbillion. That is where most of the earmarks are stolen from, \nagricultural research, and most of that money isn't applied to \nresearch. It gets directed through an earmark. National Institute of \nFood and Agriculture Research went from 1.22 billion to 1.3, an $80 \nmillion increase, a 6.76-percent increase; Economic research, up $3 \nmillion, just a 4-percent increase; Statistical service, up 7 percent; \nAnimal health inspection, up 4 percent; Agricultural marketing \nservices, up 5 percent; Grain inspection packers, up about 4 percent; \nFood safety, where we should be increasing funding because of the \nproblems we have had, is up only 2 percent. Where we have the problems, \nwe are not increasing the appropriations. We are actually barely \nkeeping even with inflation. But on food safety, we don't increase it. \nFarm service salaries, they increase $90 million, a 6.5-percent \nincrease, plus we gave $50 million in the stimulus; Farm service agency \nloans, if you add in the stimulus, which has not been spent, we get to \n$195 million from $147 million. That is a 33.3-percent increase.\n  Federal crop insurance: Up $1 billion, from $6.5 billion to $7.5 \nbillion. That is a 12-percent increase.\n  Conservation programs. Mr. President, $340 million NRCS was given in \nthe stimulus. It has not been spent yet. And $962 million is what we \nhad last year. Mr. President, $1.015 billion, plus the $340 million, \nand what you get is a 33-percent increase.\n  Conservation operations: No money in the stimulus. We go from $853 \nmillion to $949 million. That is an 8-percent increase.\n  Watershed and flood prevention is flat. It is flat. We have all these \nwater conservation dams that are falling apart. Kind of like in our \nhighway bill, we fix the earmarks, but we do not take care of the \nbridges. That is what we are doing on the watershed.\n  RC, the President terminated it. Finally we got one that is going \nunder.\n  Rural development: Salaries up 8 percent.\n  Rural housing: Counting the $330 million we did in the stimulus that \nhas not been spent, you have a $430 million increase--$130 million \nincrease over it, about a 7-percent increase.\n  You can keep going. I will not continue to bore my colleagues. But \nthe fact is, overall in this bill, we have a tremendous increase in \nspending when you consider what we did in the stimulus--not a \ndecrease--taking into account for that.\n  Now back to this amendment. All this amendment does is cut $4.9 \nmillion--$4.9 million--out of a $124 billion bill. The reason this \namendment is offered is because the administration is doing the right \nthing. They are eliminating a program that is not needed now. We can \nsay anything we want, but we have three agencies doing the same thing, \nand what the administration recognized, to their credit, is we do not \nneed three agencies doing the same thing. What we need is one agency \naccountable. We are 92 percent complete, and let them be responsible \nfor finishing it and save the American taxpayer some money.\n  That is what the Obama administration wanted to do with this \nelimination. But, no, it comes right back. Each of the three programs \nthat presently do this work--the USDA, the Commerce Department's PTFP, \nand the Corporation for Public Broadcasting--is a part of their \nrespective agency's budget. Unless we eliminate it, we are going to \nspend that money, and it will not be well spent, it will not be wisely \nspent, it will not be efficiently spent. It will just be spent, and \nthey will ask for more next year. Even when we are at 97 percent or 98 \npercent complete, we will see the same request to come. The logic was \nbecause they asked for three times as much; therefore, $4.9 million \nought to be OK. Well, $4.9 million is not OK when we need zero out of \nthe Department of Agriculture to begin with.\n  One of the things the Obama administration wants to do is to \nstreamline this process, not have three agencies going through this. \nThey want to consolidate the current three-pronged effort into one \nefficient program that is already in existence. And nobody denies that \nCPB has done a pretty good job with the public television stations and \nthe translator stations through their money.\n  The USDA received $14 million in 2004, $10 million in 2005, $5 \nmillion in each of the years 2006 through 2008. PTFP--which is the \nDepartment of Commerce--has gone all the way from 1998, when they got \n$12.5 million--and every year, all the way up--to 2002, when they got \n$36 million; and then they went back down to $15 million in 2007. They \ndid not get any money in 2008 because they did not need it.\n  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, however, has gotten, on \naverage, over $35 million a year, and they\n\n[[Page S8718]]\n\ngot $29 million last year. Plus we spent $650 million in the stimulus \non this program. It has not all been spent. So we are lining up. We \nhave plenty of money in the stimulus package, and then we are going to \nask for another $4.9 million.\n  This is exactly the reason the American people are disgusted with \nCongress. This is a bill that is out of its bounds in terms of its \nspending. It has not recognized what is in the stimulus that has not \nbeen spent. So what we are doing is we are actually going to increase \nthe debt through this bill that is going to be spent.\n  To put that in personal terms, what does that mean? A $2 trillion \ndeficit is $6,000 for every man, woman, and child in this country. That \nis what we are going to do this year: We are going to spend $6,000 per \nman, woman, and child more than we take in for every man, woman, and \nchild in this country. And do you know what. We are on course to do \nexactly the same thing next year with this kind of appropriations bill. \nThere is no check with reality in the Senate as far as when it comes to \nspending money, and I refuse to apologize for looking out for the next \ntwo generations when we do not have the courage to say no to anybody. \nWhat we say is: Yes, I will get this bill for you so you can look good \nat home.\n  Well, who is looking out for the 2- and 3- and 4- and 5-year-olds in \nthis country who, when they were born, took on almost $500,000 worth of \nunfunded liabilities? Our debt is going to double in the next 5 years. \nIt is going to triple in the next 10 years. There is no effort in this \nbill to make that less burdensome on those children.\n  With that, I yield the floor on this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2248\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to talk about an amendment I \noffered that has been ruled nongermane by the Parliamentarian. I flatly \ndisagree with that ruling, and I want the American people to understand \nwhat we have ruled nongermane.\n  We offered an amendment that said grants and contracts under this \nbill should be competitively bid. Think about that. When we go out to \nspend money--with the six or seven exemptions in the contracting \nclause, and the fact that maybe for some things only one person can \napply to it, which have been accepted in that--we said for American \ntaxpayers to get value, we ought to ask and mandate that competitive \nbidding take place on grants and contracts in this bill.\n  Not one of these has ever passed the Senate, and I want to tell you \nwhy. It is because we do not want things to be competitively bid. We do \nnot want your dollars to be spent wisely, efficiently, and effectively \nbecause when we do that we take away our political power to say \nsomebody is going to get a contract or somebody is going to get a \ngrant.\n  So this amendment, which was offered, specifically excluded earmarks \nbecause the complaint last week, when I offered the same amendment on \nthe previous bill, was that if they are authorized--and remember, an \nearmark goes to a specific person, a specific company, those well \nconnected in Washington--I specifically eliminated earmarks from this \namendment so we would not have the excuse to say we do not want things \ncompetitively bid. But what we were going to find, had this amendment \ngone to a vote, is that it would have been voted down, too, because the \nproblem is not in America, the problem is right here.\n  We view political power and incumbency more precious than we view the \neconomic realities and sustenance of this country and the true freedom \nof the people in this country. We diminish that because we think our \npositions ought to be enhanced, and we ought to secure our next \nelection by making sure we are the dolers of everything good, and that \nwe can actually connect those who give big campaign contributions to \ngreat rewards from the Congress when it comes to appropriations \nbills. What this amendment would do is require that the contract be \ncompetitively bid according to the law. We actually have a law that \nsays contracts have to be competitively bid, except Congress routinely \nexcuses that on appropriations bills.\n\n  Just so the American people get this, we don't competitively bid \ncontracts on these appropriations bills. We don't competitively bid the \ngrants. We don't mandate that they are competitively bid, although some \ngrants are competition-based but not based on dollars, based on \nperformance. So Congress wins and the American people lose. Every time \none of these bills goes through here without competitive bidding, our \nchildren are the real losers.\n  The President of the United States has said it is his policy that \nanything over $25,000 the government buys in this country ought to be \ncompetitively bid. Yet routinely it is his supporters who vote against \nthat. President Obama means it, but we can't get it through here. We \nhave $350 billion a year of documented waste, fraud, and duplication in \nthe discretionary budget, plus Medicare fraud every year. There has \nbeen no attempt to accept amendments to eliminate that, to lessen that.\n  The fact is, we are on idle pilot to grow this government 8 percent \nthis year in spite of the $787 billion stimulus. If you are sitting at \nhome thinking about that, not very many people have 8 percent more \nincome this year. So one of two things is going to happen in the next \n18 months in this country. Here is what is going to happen. Either we \nare going to default on our debt because people are going to quit \nloaning us money or the average middle-income taxpayer is going to see \na tax hike because, if we take all the income of the top 5 percent of \npeople in this country, we cut our deficit only in half. If we take all \nthe income--I am talking about a 100-percent tax rate of the top 5 \npercent earners in this country--we will cut our deficit in half.\n  So if you are a middle-class American, no matter whether you think \nsome people should pay more than they do--5 percent pays 80 percent of \nthe taxes in this country--you can bet that in the next 18 months, you \nare going to see a middle-class tax increase go through this body. The \nreason it is going to go through is because we will not apply any \ncommon sense to the appropriations bills.\n  Most American families are cutting back on their spending; some \nbecause they have lost their jobs, others because they are worried and \nthey are fearful. What is the Federal Government doing? I am not \ntalking about the stimulus bill. We are actually increasing spending. \nWe are not making the hard choices about what is a priority and what is \nnot; what is a necessity and what is not. We are not eliminating \nanything. We are building up everything, just like the last amendment \nwe talked about. There is absolutely zero need for that program in the \nDepartment of Agriculture, but next year we will have the same debate \nagain.\n  I have an amendment on cheeses. I am not going to do it because there \nis no reason to waste the Senate's time. But we created a demonstration \nproject back in the early 1990s with Wisconsin and Vermont and we have \nbeen funding it ever since. They have this outstanding large specialty \ncheese production in Wisconsin and Vermont. They don't need any money, \nbut we are going to send them more money this year because we did last \nyear. The fact is, the specialty cheeses they make cost two and three \ntimes what regular cheese costs and they are luxury items, but we are \ngoing to fund that not because they need it, not because they are not \ncompetitive, not because they haven't grown their industry, but because \nwe have funded it before.\n  Now ask yourself, if you read the Constitution, where is it in the \nConstitution that we are supposed to give two States millions and \nmillions of dollars for an agricultural program that should be funded \nby the State if they want to do it or funded by the individuals who \nactually produce the cheese and are making good money. But we are going \nto continue to do it.\n  So I am not going to offer that amendment. I am not going to waste \nthe time of the Senate on it. But there is a real question of why we \nare in the\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\ntrouble we are in as a nation today. It is because we ignore what the \nConstitution tells us to do. We ignore what our oath tells us to do, \nwhat we swear to do, which is uphold the Constitution. And within that \nis the enumerated powers, as well as the 10th amendment. The 10th \namendment says whatever is not specifically spelled out--specific--and \nif you read what Jefferson and Madison had to say about what that \nmeant, you will find that all of those responsibilities are left to the \nStates and to the people. That is what they said.\n  We have this ``cash for clunkers'' going on right now, and the Senate \nis going to vote for an increase in that program. But the reason we are \nhaving to do that is because we can't manage it. We have proven--the \nDepartment of Transportation--they don't even know how many \napplications they have from people. They don't even know if they have \nover the number. What they know is they have approved $760 million of \nthe money so far, but that doesn't count all of the applications that \nhave come in from the dealers. Here we are incentivizing the purchase \nof cars, taking money from our grandkids, and Americans are smart \nenough to know if they can get 4,500 bucks back from the Federal \nGovernment, they will take advantage of that. So we have created this \nwonderful increase in demand for automobiles. But why not an increase \nin demand for boats or how about RVs or how about refrigerators? They \nare more efficient. Why not give somebody a $500 credit on their \nrefrigerator? Why are we limiting this to the automobile industry that \nwe now as taxpayers have the responsibility of bailing out of debt?\n  The fact is, we are clueless. We are not plugged in to what the \naverage American family is going through in terms of a budget. We will \nnot apply that same standard to their money up here, and their kids, \nour kids, and our grandkids are the ones who are going to suffer.\n  So ask yourself a question: Why would the Senate not allow an \namendment on competitively bidding the contracts and grants in this \nbill? Hundreds of millions of dollars that we are going to pay much too \nmuch for, an area where we could save a tremendous amount of money, and \nif it is grant programs that truly do a great job, we could get more of \nthat great job done if we got it done more efficiently. It is pretty \ndisturbing that we are so far off course with what we are doing and, \nmore importantly, how we are doing it.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2246\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the pending amendment \nNo. 2246, which caps the amount of money the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture spends on conferences and requires transparency on the \npurpose and cost of the conference sponsored or attended by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  This is a report I issued a year ago on the $90 million in conference \ncosts the U.S. Department of Agriculture has spent. It is a pretty \ndetailed report. You can go to my Web site and get it. But it tells \nabout the lack of attention to any sort of fiscal discipline.\n  By the way, the Department of Agriculture is the worst practitioner \nof all of the agencies of the Federal Government on conferences, in \nterms of wasteful conferences, in terms of the number of people going \nto conferences--by far the worst. In 2001, USDA spent $6 million on \nconferences. Within 5 years, that went to $19 million. They tripled.\n  All this amendment says is, in 2010--9 years later--they can't spend \nmore than double what they spent in 2001. That allows conferences to \ngrow 11 percent a year. Twelve million dollars for conferences is a lot \nof money. That is less than the amount they spent this last year. It is \nless than any amount they have spent since 2001, but it is still double \nwhat they have spent in 2001.\n  This amendment also requires an itemized list of expenses and \nexpenditures by the Department on the conference, who the primary \nsponsor of the conference is, the location of the conference, a \njustification of the location, including the cost efficiency of the \nlocation, the total number of individuals whose travel to the \nconference was paid for by the Department, and an explanation of how \nthe agency advanced the mission by attending the conference.\n  It is about transparency. I have seen it quoted before, and I believe \nit is true: The greatest pleasure in the world is to spend somebody \nelse's money. What our agencies are doing in many instances is not \nbeing frugal with the tax dollars we give them. The Department of \nAgriculture is a great example of that, when they are running close to \n$20 million a year--not this last year but still above $12 million--on \nconferences, and when we have the technology now to eliminate half the \nconferences.\n  I don't have any problem with travel. I don't have any problem with \nthem going to conferences that are legitimate. But I do have a problem \nwith a 3\\1/2\\-times increase in the amount of conferences they attend, \nespecially given our economic situation today.\n  So this is fairly straightforward. We should put a cap on it. We \nshould limit it. It is my hope my colleagues will do that.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note an absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I understand we are in the process of \nputting together a series of votes, but while we have a moment, I ask \nunanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The CARS Program\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, I thank our leaders on this important \nAgriculture bill--the chairman, whom I appreciate so much for all of \nhis hard work; he has a great bill in front of us, along with the \nranking member from Kansas.\n  I wish to speak about legislation the ranking member, Senator \nBrownback, and I have been working on now for some time. The first \npiece of it has proven to be extremely effective, despite the \nnaysayers. It has come back even more successful than we thought it \nwould. I thank Senator Brownback for working with me. Making sure this \nis fully paid for within the recovery package is important to Senator \nBrownback, and this achieves that. I thank him for partnering with me \nand understanding the significance of what we have been working to do.\n  The CARS Program has truly been an incredible success. In only a \nweek, it has proven to be an excellent way to stimulate the economy. \nDealers haven't seen this level of customer excitement in years. I can \ntell you, as someone who grew up on a car lot--my dad and grandfather \nhad an Oldsmobile dealership when I was growing up. This is important \nto small towns as well as big cities across the country.\n  We are not only helping to save the over 160,000 dealership jobs \nacross the country, but it is making our air cleaner and reducing oil \nconsumption. So far, we have seen a 61-percent increase in vehicle fuel \neconomy, which I think is surprising, as we hoped for an increase and \nwe hoped people would turn in vehicles with lower mileage and get a \nhigher mileage vehicle. In fact, we have seen even greater results than \nwe thought we would. They are trading in vehicles averaging 15.8 miles \nper gallon, and the new vehicles average 25.4 miles per gallon. So this \nis extremely significant.\n  What is even more important is that is $700 to $1,000 a year in lower \ngas prices for the average family. At this time, when money is so \ntight, when people are concerned about saving every penny, this is a \ngood deal for consumers, a good deal for the environment, for the \neconomy, small businesses, as well as, certainly, everyone involved in \nthe auto industry.\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\n  It is also significant that 83 percent of the trade-ins are trucks \nand 60 percent of the new vehicles are small cars. So we are seeing \npeople move away from their clunker truck into a more energy-efficient \ncar. That is good news for the environment and for fuel economy for the \naverage family as well.\n  This has been a great program, with over 250,000 cars sold. Dealers \nare packed and sales are booming. At a GM dealership in Ferndale, MI, \nfoot traffic was up 60 percent just last week, according to the general \nmanager.\n  It is not just dealerships being helped, as I indicated. Steel and \naluminum producers have announced that they expect a benefit from the \nprogram, as more cars are made to meet demand generated by the program. \nScrap recyclers, which supply the steel industry, which have also been \nhurting lately, are also seeing a pickup in business. The boost to \nthese industries isn't just immediate either. Analysts predict that the \nbenefits will have a lasting impact. So we are talking broadly about \nmanufacturing materials, as well as the small businesses in the \ncommunities involved.\n  Getting people into showrooms and excited again is having a \npsychological impact on consumers and businesses as well. This is \nhappening all over the country.\n  The Houston Chronicle reports that more than 70 percent of the \nclunkers being traded in are SUVs, and 84 percent of the new vehicles \nare small, fuel-efficient cars.\n  The Brownsville Herald in Texas quotes Don Johnson, the owner of The \nReal Don Johnson Chrysler-Jeep-Hyundai, who said:\n\n       This is a good deal for the people. It's a good deal for us \n     because we will sell more cars, but it's a good deal for \n     people.\n\n  The Daily Record in Dunn, NC, reports strong interest and increased \ntraffic in dealerships. Dan Lowe, from John Hiester Chrysler Jeep Dodge \nin Lillington, NC, said his dealership is getting 25 to 30 calls a day \nabout the CARS Program. He told the newspaper:\n\n       We are excited about anything that gets cars off the lot.\n\n  This is certainly doing that.\n  A Pennsylvania car dealer, Bill Rosado, told the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       I can't believe I'm saying this: I need more Chrysler \n     inventory.\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       My goodness, I've got to rehearse that line a couple times.\n\n  This program has been extremely successful in a very short amount of \ntime.\n  The House, because of its success, as we all know, has acted to add \nadditional dollars by moving from one program in the recovery package \ninto this program. I thank them very much for doing that and for the \nleadership of my partner in the House, Betty Sutton, and the delegation \nfrom Michigan, who worked so hard, and also those from Ohio, Indiana, \nand others as well.\n  In the Senate, we have had great bipartisan support. Again, I thank \nmy bipartisan cosponsor, Senator Brownback, and I thank Senator \nVoinovich as well. We have been partnering on something that makes \nsense. This is taking some stimulus dollars and putting them directly \ninto a stimulus that is visible; it is working, it is putting money \ninto the economy, and it is saving people money on gas. It is something \nI believe is important to continue.\n  I will close by also thanking our leader, Senator Reid, who has once \nagain been extremely supportive of bringing this forward so we have an \nopportunity to vote. I am hopeful we will see a strong, bipartisan vote \non this important stimulus.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2243 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 2243.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I note that the Senator from Michigan \nnoted everyone who won. Let me tell you who did not win and that is our \nkids and grandkids. Americans are not stupid. If you give them 4,500 \nbucks, they are going to find any old car they have that is running and \nthey have held for a long time. All our farmers are going to the barns. \nThat is why you are getting pickups. They haven't been driving the \npickups for years. But they are cranking them up to make them run and \ntrading them in so they can get 4,500 bucks.\n  The people who lose are our kids. It is $3 billion we are talking \nabout to go to help people buy cars. But where are we going to get the \n$3 billion? We are going to steal it from our children. What other part \nof the economy should we not be incentivizing? How about the appliance \nmakers? How about the television makers?\n  I also ask unanimous consent--actually, I have discussed this with \nthe chairman. Rather than ask for a recorded vote, we will have a voice \nvote on amendment No. 2245.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2244\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I also note that we will have a vote on the amendment in \nterms of eliminating $4.9 million for a duplicative program in the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? At this moment, \nthere is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I inform my colleagues, we are trying \nto get to a final conclusion on this bill. It is an important bill, but \nalso a number of Members want to speak on the Sotomayor nomination to \nthe Supreme Court. The attempt is to get this bill moving forward. I \nthink we are close to a final UC to get to passage of this bill.\n  I wish to comment before we move into that sequence about the \nimportance of the agriculture industry. It is a key issue in my State, \nand it is a key issue in Wisconsin, the State of the leader of this \nsubcommittee. It is an industry that has done better than a number of \nothers have been doing during this recessionary time period. It is one \nthat is a good performer for us on exports. We have one of the best \nexporting models, as far as business in agriculture, in this country. \nBecause it is very competitive, it has a lot of capital intensity to \nit, a lot of intellectual brain power put behind it, both at the public \nand private level.\n  It is one of those models in which we compete and do well globally. \nWe are also aggressive in our trade policy to push for free trade, but \nif other countries are going to subsidize, we will back up our guys and \nsay: If you subsidize your agricultural industry, then we are going to \ndo it to fight you back on it. We don't take any guff around the world. \nWe want a free-trade world, but if you are going to attack us, we are \ngoing to respond. If you have missiles, we have missiles, and we are \ngoing to do it. That model has worked well to create a very \ncompetitive, very growth-oriented, very export-oriented business that \nis globally competitive, high technology, and one I think that is \nmoving well into the future.\n  We have a lot of things going on in agriculture, and a number of them \nare funded in this bill. We want to see the industry expand in the \nenergy business. A lot of us are very supportive of ethanol. Some are \nsaying: I am for it, but I want the next generation of ethanol. We are \nfunding that, as far as getting into cellulosic ethanol.\n  We are looking at other types of fuels. One that is interesting for \nsome people is on algae production into a diesel type of fuel. We are \ndoing something on wind because wind is what generally blows across the \nPlains in your State, Mr. President, my State and a number of others \nand harvesting that in such a way that we can get it to other markets--\nthe electric markets--and add a cost-competitive rate so it is not one \nthat drives it up.\n  All of this does take a lot of effort. I want to acknowledge that \nsome colleagues on my side are saying: I am not satisfied with this \nbill; I don't like some of the items in this bill. I say to them: I \nagree. There are provisions in this bill I don't like. But it is part \nof us getting a process to move an Agriculture appropriations bill \nthrough, something we have not been able to get\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\nthrough on the floor for over 3 years in a stand-alone type of bill, on \na very important industry that is globally competitive, that has been a \ngood one for us in this recessionary time period we are in.\n  I note we have a lot of problems with this bill, but I also say I \nthink we have a lot we are doing right with it and looking forward into \nthe future of what we can do to be very supportive.\n  I note a couple of things that are going on that are important for us \nas a country in agriculture on which we can get some crosscurrents.\n  Norman Borlaug, an agronomist from Texas A, is known as the father \nof the green revolution that brought a lot of the new technology to \nfeed the world. This has been over a career. He won the Nobel Peace \nPrize in 1970 for his contributions to the green revolution.\n  I mention him because he is a key person in looking to the future of \nhow the world is fed and fed at a good level. He notes it is important \nfor us to do things in an environmentally sensitive and environmentally \nsound way but that we also need to fund high-yield, disease-resistant \nwheat varieties. We need to be able to use plant genetics that are in \nsome places around the world. Some are saying: We don't like your \nalterations on plant genetics. We need to be able to do this. To feed a \nhungry world, we are going to have to use agricultural pesticides, \ninsecticides, and fertilizer, and that gets into crosscurrents. They \nsay: I want all the agricultural production, but I don't want these \ninputs brought into it. We don't have a model for that to work yet.\n  It is important we support organic food markets and organic food \nproduction, but we cannot go that way fully. It is the sort of thing we \ncannot feed a hungry world on on a cost-competitive basis, a globally \ncompetitive industry, if you say we are going to pull out all these \ntools that have made the green revolution work.\n  I think it is also important that we fund into the next generation of \ngenetics and technology in this area. I was interested in one of my \ntravels across Kansas. Last year, we had a time where some of my corn \nfarmers could not plant for a couple days, and it was not because it \nwas wet. It was because the satellite went down. Their global \npositioning system on their corn planter would not work, so they could \nnot plant their corn because the satellite was down. I am going: Well, \nthat is an interesting excuse. I haven't heard that one before. But it \nwasn't an excuse. It was a fact of life. To plant these crops and do \nthe best job--and they apply just the right amount of fertilizer to \nthat soil and that crop in that specific location will take--it takes a \nglobal positioning satellite that has had the data read into it and fed \nback. That is how high tech the industry is.\n  I don't want us to move away from that level of technology and input; \notherwise, I think we are going to lose our edge.\n  We also have some developments in the environmental field that I \nthink are interesting. We have people in Kansas and other places around \nthe country who are working on things such as green concrete. You ask: \nWhat would that be? It is concrete that has soy oil brought into it to \nhelp it be an environmentally sound, renewable type of process. They \nalready are making the foam matting in the seat in your car out of \nsoybeans. So when you sit in a new Mustang--in particular, I know that \ncar for sure--the foam rubber is made out of soybeans. I guess if you \nget caught in a Colorado blizzard and don't have anything to eat for \na week or two, you can eat the seat.\n\n  I don't think it is edible.\n  But my point is, that, again, is an investment in the technology we \nare putting in this Agriculture appropriations bill to make new things \nthat will work.\n  This bill is an increase in funding. I don't like that because I \nthink we should not be doing those sorts of funding increases. A major \nportion of that is the WIC Program. When we get into a recession, we \nget more and more people needing food. They are not able to pay for it \nthemselves, and the government steps up. That is the problem when we \nhave a recession--government costs go up, government receipts go down, \nand you get caught in this trap.\n  One of the reasons why I think a program such as Cash for Clunkers is \ninteresting is because it stimulates the economy, not the government. \nIt gets that economy rolling, which is 80 percent of us balancing the \nbudget. It is getting the economy moving. We have to restrain our \nspending and do a better job of that.\n  I think we also need to be a lot more targeting of our programs. \nPrograms such as the WIC Program and this Agriculture appropriations \nbill are a consequence of a bad economy. I don't like it, but I think \nthe key for us is to be an economic stimulus and not a government \nstimulus.\n  On the whole, while I think we have problems with this bill, I like \nthe overall trend of what we are doing in the agricultural industry. I \nlike what the chairman has focused on in this bill.\n  On top of these items, I note for my colleagues, we put a special \neffort on the food aid program and getting the food aid program \nupdated. To me, the needs of those who are in very difficult \ncircumstances in refugee camps and different places around the world--\nwe spend too much on transportation and administration on food aid. \nNearly 60 percent goes into those two. That number has to come down. \nBut we need to get more food on the target because, in many cases, we \nare what stands between that person and starvation and death. It is the \nfood aid, the generous food aid of the American people, that flows \nthrough this appropriations bill that does that.\n  The Food and Drug Administration is also in this bill, and that is \npart of the increase. The development and the increasing need for \ndifferent types of drugs are addressed in this bill as well.\n  We have to get more innovative on FDA. I would like to see us in the \nneglected disease categories find more truncated procedures that \napprove drugs that have narrower, smaller marketplaces. That is in this \nbill.\n  While I believe there are a number of things negative about this \nbill, I think the chairman has put together an overall good bill. I am \nglad we are getting to the point where we can move this one on through, \nconference it, and bring it back separately, as well so we can \nrecognize this very important industry. It is important in my State and \nit is important in the States of all the Members, and we should do this \nseparately instead of rolling it together in some sort of omnibus bill \nlike we too often have done.\n  I believe we are getting close to getting to a final UC. That would \nbe my hope so we can move this bill forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes while we are \nwaiting until procedures get lined up to say a few words about an \namendment I am offering which is going to come up for a vote fairly \nsoon. This is an amendment which addresses the crisis in dairy all over \nthis country. It is an amendment that is supported by Senator Snowe, \nSenator Udall of New Mexico, Senator Schumer, Senator Bennet of \nColorado, Senator Specter, Senator McCaskill, Senator Gillibrand, \nSenator Klobuchar, Senator Shaheen, and Senator Casey. As you will \nnote, these are people from all over the country. What we are not \ntalking about here is a regional issue, we are talking about a national \nissue.\n  I want to pick up on a point for a moment that Senator McCaskill made \nearlier this morning. I think it is important. All of us know that \ntoday our country is in a major economic crisis, the deepest recession \nsince the Great Depression. But sometimes what media does, and maybe \nwhat we do here in Congress, is focus on that crisis in the areas where \nthere is, if you like, concentrated misery, such as Detroit, which has \nundergone terrible problems, thousands of people on a given day have \nlost their jobs, and sometimes, in the midst of the economic crisis \nfacing our country, we forget what is happening in rural areas, in \nsmall towns all over this country. Sometimes when farms go out of \nbusiness, farms that have been owned by a family for generations, when \nrural communities go into, literally, an economic depression, we don't \npay quite as much attention\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\nto that. It is not on the front pages of the New York Times. The fact \nis, right now rural America is in the midst of a very serious economic \ncrisis. Unemployment is extremely high.\n  One of the particular areas where we are seeing not just a deep \nrecession but, in fact, a depression is within the dairy industry. In \nthe last year, if you can believe it, the price dairy farmers--many of \nthem small, family-based dairy farmers--have received for their milk \nhas plummeted by 41 percent. In the last year, it has gone down by 41 \npercent. The reality of what that means is that farmers today, for \nevery gallon of milk they are producing, are losing money. It is not \nthat they are making a little bit, they are losing money. What we are \nseeing, not just in the Northeast, not just in the Midwest, not just in \nthe Southeast, not just in the West, but all over this country, are \nfamily farmers going out of business, plunging their rural economies \nand their communities into depression-type economics.\n  Let me quote, if I might, from people from different parts of the \ncountry.\n  A Minnesota dairy farmer writes:\n\n       This situation is unlike any experienced in the past and \n     the width and depth cannot continue to be ignored. It has not \n     discriminated based on herd size or geographic location. \n     Dairy farmers of all sizes and across all regions of the \n     country are enduring an unprecedented disaster.\n\n  That is from Minnesota.\n  The President of the California Farmers Union--when we talk about \ndairy, sometimes California is in another world from the rest of the \ncountry because their herds are much larger.\n  By the way, I should say the National Farmers Union is supporting \nthis amendment, and 11 agricultural commissioners and secretaries from \nStates are supporting this amendment as well, as is the DFA, the Dairy \nFarmers of America, which is the largest dairy farm cooperative in \nAmerica.\n  This is what the fellow who is the head of the California Farmer's \nUnion says. His name is Joaquin Contente. He testified:\n\n       [I]n my lifetime history as a dairy farmer, I have never \n     seen our prices remain this far below our costs this long and \n     I have never seen so many dairy producers so desperate for \n     relief. In my county alone 25 dairies have either filed or \n     are in the process of filing for bankruptcy and many more are \n     closer to bankruptcy each day.\n\n  From Texas, the executive director of the Texas Association of \nDairymen said:\n\n       This is the worst situation I have seen since 1970. Some \n     say it is the worst since the Depression.\n\n  From Wisconsin, a dairy farmer states:\n\n       In my area farmers are burning up the equity accumulated \n     over their lifetimes. One farmer in my area had to cash out \n     his wife's IRA just to get his crops planted this spring. My \n     parish priest in my small town has had to counsel one or more \n     dairy farmers a week to prevent their suicides.\n\n  Those are just a few examples from Wisconsin, California, and Texas. \nTrust me, I could tell you many similar stories from the State of \nVermont.\n  Once again, as we attempt to revitalize our economy, let's not forget \nabout rural America. Let's not forget about dairy farmers. Let's \nsupport this legislation which will provide $350 million to increase \ndairy support prices. I look forward to the support of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2284 to Amendment No. 1908\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside and the Senate now consider amendment No. 2284.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for Mr. Dodd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2284 to amendment No. 1908.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Agriculture to fund certain \n    projects in communities and municipal districts in Connecticut, \n                    Massachusetts, and Rhode Island)\n\n       On page 85, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7__.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law and \n     until the receipt of the decennial census in the year 2010, \n     the Secretary of Agriculture may fund community facility and \n     water and waste disposal projects of communities and \n     municipal districts and areas in Connecticut, Massachusetts, \n     and Rhode Island that filed applications for the projects \n     with the appropriate rural development field office of the \n     Department of Agriculture prior to August 1, 2009, and were \n     determined by the field office to be eligible for funding.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2284) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 2241; 2280; 2271, as Modified; 2282, as Modified; 2249, \n                   as Modified; and 2266, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconsider the following amendments en bloc: Nos. 2241 and 2280; that \namendments Nos. 2271, 2282, 2249, and 2266 be modified with the changes \nat the desk; that the aforementioned amendments, as modified, if \nmodified, be agreed to en bloc; and that the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2241) was agreed to.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2280\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Whereas sudden loss in late 2008 of export-market based \n     demand equivalent to about three percent of domestic milk \n     production has thrown the U.S. dairy industry into a critical \n     supply-demand imbalance; and\n       Whereas an abrupt decline in U.S. exports was fueled by the \n     onset of the global economic crisis combined with resurgence \n     of milk supplies in Oceania; and\n       Whereas the U.S. average all-milk price reported by the \n     National Agriculture Statistics Service from January through \n     May of 2009, has averaged $4.80 per hundredweight below the \n     cost of production; and\n       Whereas approximately $3.9 billion in dairy producer equity \n     has been lost since January; and\n       Whereas anecdotal evidence suggests that U.S. dairy \n     producers are losing upwards of $100 per cow per month; and\n       Whereas the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 \n     extended the counter-cyclical Milk Income Loss Contract \n     (MILC) support program and instituted a `feed cost adjuster' \n     to augment that support; and\n       Whereas the Secretary of Agriculture in March transferred \n     approximately 200 million pounds of nonfat dry milk to USDA's \n     food and Nutrition Service in a move designed to remove \n     inventory from the market and support low-income families; \n     and\n       Whereas the Secretary on March 22nd reactivated USDA's \n     Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) to help U.S. producers \n     meet prevailing world prices and develop international \n     markets; and\n       Whereas the Secretary announced on July 31, 2009 a \n     temporary increase in the amount paid for dairy products \n     through the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP), an \n     adjustment that is projected to increase dairy farmers' \n     revenue by $243 million; and\n       Whereas U.S. dairy producers face unprecedented challenges \n     that threaten the stability of the industry, the nation's \n     milk production infrastructure, and thousands of rural \n     communities;\n       Now therefore be it resolved, That it is the sense of the \n     Senate that the Secretary of Agriculture and the President's \n     Office of Management and Budget should continue to closely \n     monitor the U.S. dairy sector and use all available \n     discretionary authority to ensure its long-term health and \n     sustainability.\n\n\n                    amendment No. 2271, as modified\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funds for the school community garden pilot \n                        program, with an offset)\n\n       On page 52, lines 22 and (23), strike ``$16,799,584,000, to \n     remain available through September 30, 2011,'' and insert \n     ``$16,801,584,000, to remain available through September 30, \n     2011, of which $2,000,000 may be used to carry out the school \n     community garden pilot program established under section \n     18(g)(3) of the Richard B.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution that I am offering. This sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution seeks to address drought aid that producers in my home State \nof Texas desperately need.\n  Texas is in the throes of one of the worst droughts in 50 years. We \nare seeing the hottest, driest summer on record over a large portion of \nthe State, but especially in central and south Texas. Lack of rainfall \nand sustained record triple-digit temperatures for weeks have scorched \ncrops and rangeland throughout parts of Texas causing drought losses to \nreach $3.6 billion. The Texas AgriLife Extension Service predicts this \ntotal could rise above $4.1 billion in producer losses if sufficient \nrainfall isn't received to revive crops and forage.\n  In the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, also known as the \nfarm bill, which I supported, Congress established five permanent \ndisaster programs to deliver timely and immediate assistance to \nproducers recovering from losses. The logic behind establishing the \npermanent disaster program was to ensure producers who have eligible \nlosses receive timely assistance. I agreed with the inclusion of this \nprovision and I supported it. For too many years, producers had to wait \nmonths and even years to receive assistance from USDA. The problem \ntoday is USDA has not finalized any of the five disaster programs \nincluded in the farm bill. While the Department is working to finalize \nthese programs, farmers and ranchers in Texas are seeing their crops, \nand livestock heards, diminish due to the excessive heat and drought.\n  My sense of the Senate simply urges the Secretary of USDA to use any \nof his discretionary authority to provide immediate assistance for \nproducers who are sustaining losses as a result of this extraordinary \ndrought. The Secretary has authority to provide quick assistance and he \nhas used these authorities in past extraordinary circumstances. Our \nfarmers and ranchers need immediate assistance; they cannot continue to \nwait for bureaucratic reg. writing. Please join me in encouraging the \nSecretary to use the tools at his disposal to provide any available \nassistance as quickly as possible.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2240\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I will make a point of order that amendment No. 2240 is not \ngermane postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The \namendment falls.\n  Mr. KOHL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that after \nSenator Coburn moves to commit the bill with instructions, that there \nbe 10 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled between Senators \nKohl and Coburn or their designees; that upon the use of that time, the \nmotion be set aside and the Senate then resume consideration of the \nSanders amendment, No. 2276; that then Senator Brownback or his \ndesignee be recognized to raise a budget point of order against the \namendment; that after the point of order is raised, then the motion to \nwaive the relevant point of order be considered made; that the Senate \nthen proceed to vote in relation to the Coburn motion to commit; that \nupon disposition of that motion, the Senate then proceed to vote on the \nmotion to waive the relevant Budget Act point of order; that if the \nmotion to waive is successful, then the amendment be agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that no further amendments \nor motions be in order; that upon disposition of all pending \namendments, the substitute amendment, as amended, if amended, be agreed \nto, the bill then be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote \non passage of the bill; that upon passage, the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate, with the subcommittee plus Senator \nInouye appointed as conferees; further, that if a budget point of order \nis raised against the substitute amendment, then it be in order for \nanother substitute amendment to be offered minus the offending \nprovisions but including any amendments which have been agreed to, and \nthat no further amendments be in order; that the substitute amendment, \nas amended, if amended, be agreed to, and the remaining provisions \nbeyond adoption of the original substitute amendment remaining in \neffect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I further ask unanimous consent that in the sequence of \nvotes as described above, there be 2 minutes of debate prior to each \nvote equally divided and controlled in the usual form, and that after \nthe first vote in the sequence, the remaining votes be limited to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the vote sequence be as \nfollows: Coburn, No. 2244; Coburn, No. 2245; Coburn motion to commit; \nSanders motion to waive the Budget Act point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8724]]\n\n  Mr. REID. With the Republican leader here on the floor now, I ask \nunanimous consent that upon disposition of H.R. 2997, the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 309, the \nnomination of Sonia Sotomayor to be Associate Justice of the Supreme \nCourt, and that the first hour of debate be under the control of the \nchair and ranking member of the committee, Senators Leahy and Sessions, \nto be followed by 2 hours of debate, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the majority and the Republicans.\n  Mr. President, before I ask whether my friend will accept this, I \njust want to lay out to the body, I am glad we are going to this. \nEveryone should understand we have other things to do before we leave \nhere. We are going to do them before we have a final vote on this \nSupreme Court nominee. We have to work something out on travel \npromotion, and we have to work something out on the so-called cash for \nclunkers. The other matters we are going to put over until a subsequent \ntime, but we will at least have some preconceived idea of what we are \ngoing to do when we get back.\n  I want everyone to be alerted that this is not the end of the work \nsession before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not be objecting, I just want to make a point for all of our \ncolleagues. The very important debate on the Supreme Court nominee will \ncommence in a while. It is important for people not to wait until the \nend. We need to get people on over to make their speeches. I know there \nare a number of Members on the Republican side of the aisle who do \nintend to speak to the nomination. I encourage them to begin that \nsometime soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of my friend. \nEverything relating to this nomination has been very civil, fair. \nSenator Leahy, the chairman of the committee, and the ranking member, \nSenator Sessions, have done an outstanding job of setting an example of \nhow the debate should be handled here on the floor.\n  There are strong feelings regarding this nomination. That is the way \nit should be. I was told last night that there are as many as 28 \nRepublicans who wish to speak on this matter. Of course, a lot of \nDemocrats will also want to speak.\n  I want to lay out, as my friend, the Republican leader, did, we are \ngoing to be working into the evenings. People should not wait around \nhere until tomorrow saying, I will put it off until tomorrow, or maybe \nI will wait until Thursday. There may not be a Thursday. We need to get \nthese speeches done. They are all important. They are important for the \nrecord this body makes.\n  I would hope people would work with the floor staff to set up a way \nto proceed. What we are going to do is if at all possible, have a \nDemocrat speak, a Republican speak, go back and forth. If there is not \none of the other party here, we are not going to wait around until a \nRepublican or Democrat shows up. If there is someone here ready to \nspeak, that person will be recognized and the person who was supposed \nto be here can wait until some subsequent time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The time will now be equally divided on the Coburn amendment No. \n2244.\n  Who yields time?\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I have a motion to commit at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] moves to commit the \n     bill H.R. 2997 to the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate with instructions to report the same back to the \n     Senate making the following changes:\n       (1) Amend the amounts appropriated in the bill so as to \n     report back a bill with an aggregate discretionary level of \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2010 at an amount that is 2 \n     percent greater than the $20,662,300,000 enacted for fiscal \n     year 2009, excluding funds made available for any \n     discretionary or mandatory direct food assistance program, as \n     is appropriate given--\n       (A) the minimal growth of the budgets of families of the \n     United States due to the fiscal challenges of the United \n     States; and\n       (B) the $2,000,000,000,000 deficit and $11,500,000,000,000 \n     debt of the United States.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the reason for this motion to commit is \nwhat we see on the discretionary side of this budget--not the food \nstamps, not the food support, not the areas in this budget that \nactually help people get through the tough times--a 15-percent increase \nin discretionary spending.\n  We are going to have near a $2 trillion deficit this year. We spent \n$20 billion last year. But then we spent another $6 billion in the \nstimulus which still has not been spent. So if you were to add the \nstimulus to it, you would see a 50-percent increase in the Agriculture \ndiscretionary budget. That is entirely too much money.\n  All this motion to commit says is, bring it back to us with a \nrealistic expectation of what families are having to do. Again, I would \ncaution my colleagues, this has nothing to do with food. We do not \neliminate or lessen those mandatory requirements.\n  But in the operation of the USDA and the Department of Agriculture, \nlet's have the government live within the same parameters that the rest \nof us are living within now which is--actually we are going to have a \nnegative rate of inflation this year and incomes that are not going to \ngrow significantly.\n  What we are asking for is still a rate higher than inflation but some \nfiscal responsibility that says we should live within our means. So \nwhen we spent $20 billion last year, through the end of this month, \nthen we gave another $6 billion with the stimulus, and now we come \nforward with a budget that says we are going to spend $23 billion, a \nfull 15-percent, 14-some-percent increase in the discretionary programs \nat the Department of Agriculture.\n  I find it obscene. I find it irresponsible. I find it almost elite \nthat we will not relate to what the rest of the American people are \ngoing through, and we have bill after bill after bill, and in a time \nwhen our country is on its back and our budget deficits have never been \nso high, we are going to increase discretionary spending at a rate we \nhave not seen in 10 years in this country. There is no call for it. \nThere is no excuse for it. There is no defending it.\n  I would note that, in fact, on every amendment I have stood up on, \nother than the one Senator Harkin defended, we have not had anyone \ndefend this bill. Let's hear a defense of the 15-percent increase for \nthis bill in discretionary spending. The idea is, let's not defend it, \nlet's just not answer the charge.\n  But the fact is, we are growing the discretionary portion of the \nFederal Department of Agriculture by 15 percent this year. It ought not \nto be.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as I stated at the outset of this bill, it \ndoes reflect an increase in spending over the previous year. But let's \nbe clear, 90 percent of the discretionary increase is for WIC, food and \ndrug safety, humanitarian food assistance, and rural rental housing. \nThese four items are among the most important things that government \ndoes.\n  To put it a little more in context, the largest overall increases in \nthis bill are not in discretionary programs at all. The largest single \nincrease in the bill is for nutrition programs such as the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program. That program, and programs combined with \nother programs, are together funded at $9.1 billion higher than last \nyear. These are mandatory programs that reflect the state of our \neconomy and serve as a very basic human safety net.\n  Other mandatory increases involve farm support and crop insurance \nprograms and funding $3.4 billion higher than last year. These programs \noperate as they are authorized, and this spending is what is required \nto pay farmers and ranchers the benefits they are entitled to receive \nunder the law.\n  The Senator is correct that the spending in this bill is higher than \nlast year. But much of that increase is attributable to mandatory \nprograms that\n\n[[Page S8725]]\n\ndo not change through an appropriations bill. With regard to overall \nspending, Congress has spoken on that question through the budget \nresolution and the allocations that are made to each subcommittee for \ndiscretionary spending. This bill is about how we apportion that \ndiscretionary spending to best serve the American people and the people \nthroughout the world. This bill has a proper priority.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. The honorable chairman noted that most of the increase in \nspending is in mandatory. This motion to commit does not say anything \nabout mandatory. This is about discretionary. This is about the things \nwe get to decide on. This is about the discretionary side of this bill, \nnot the mandatory side. So we are not confused. This is not about those \nsubstantive items that are mandated through the farm bill. This is \nabout what we have discretion to control, and we have indiscretion with \nthis bill because we are going to allow it to grow by 15 percent.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that both sides yield back their \ntime and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KOHL. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes in \nsupport of the Sanders amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2276\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the dairy farmers in Pennsylvania and the \nNation are receiving record low prices for their products, prices that \nwe have not seen since the late 1970s.\n  From January through June of this year, the price received by farmers \nwas 37 percent below that of a year earlier. Feed costs, by comparison, \nhave fallen by 11 percent. In this year, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture expects the all-milk price to average between $11.85 per \nhundredweight and $12.15 per hundredweight, down from $18.29 last year, \nand 18 to 20 percent below the 10-year average.\n  Exports, which have driven much of the recent growth in the dairy \nindustry, have fallen from 11 percent of production last year. \nAccording to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, these losses \nare translated into losses as high as $1,000 per cow per year, so that \na farmer milking 100 cows will lose as much as $100,000 this year.\n  This amendment provides the U.S. Department of Agriculture with $350 \nmillion in additional funds to enable it to increase the level at which \nthe government buys surplus dairy products off the market.\n  This funding would allow the Secretary to raise the support price on \nthree different types of dairy products. That is a brief statistical \nsummary of the problems which the dairy farmers are facing, not only in \nthe my State, Pennsylvania, but across the country.\n  I recently convened a session in my office to hear in some detail the \nplight of the dairy farmers. I have traveled the State. Before August \nis finished, I will have visited all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, \nwhich is a practice I make, covering virtually every county every year.\n  I have seen firsthand the desperate plight of the farmers of our \nState. We had been considering a number of amendments to this bill, but \nthey have been ruled not germane. For those who may be watching this \nprogram--this session; it is really a program, but it is a session of \nthe Senate--that means technically we could not offer other \nlegislation.\n  But I compliment the distinguished Senator from Vermont who has \nstructured this amendment in a way which will enable the Department of \nAgriculture to meet this pressing problem.\n  Recently about a dozen Senators met with the Secretary of \nAgriculture, and the conclusion was that the Department of Agriculture, \nthe Obama administration, wanted to help farmers by raising price \nsupports, but they lacked the money to do so. So this amendment, if \nadopted--and I urge my colleagues to adopt it--and there is pretty \nwidespread concern about milk prices covering virtually every section \nof the United States. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment to \ngive some very much needed relief to the dairy farmers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2285\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, notwithstanding the previous order, I ask \nunanimous consent that amendment No. 2285 be considered and agreed to \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2285) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the livestock \n                           indemnity program)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7__. (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) with livestock producers facing losses from harsh \n     weather in 2008 and continuing to face disasters in 2009, \n     Congress wanted to assist livestock producers in recovering \n     losses more quickly and efficiently than previous ad hoc \n     disaster assistance programs;\n       (2) on June 18, 2008, Congress established the livestock \n     indemnity program under section 531(c) of the Federal Crop \n     Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1531(c)) and section 901(c) of the \n     Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2497(c)) as a permanent disaster \n     assistance program to provide livestock producers with \n     payments of 75 percent of the fair market value for livestock \n     losses as a result of adverse weather such as floods, \n     blizzards, and extreme heat;\n       (3) on July 13, 2009, the Secretary of Agriculture \n     promulgated rules for the livestock indemnity program that \n     separated non adult beef animals into weight ranges of ``less \n     than 400 pounds'' and ``400 pounds and more''; and\n       (4) the ``400 pounds and more'' range would fall well short \n     of covering 75 percent market value payment for livestock in \n     these higher ranges that are close to market weight.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of \n     Agriculture--\n       (1) should strive to establish a methodology to calculate \n     more specific payments to offset the cost of loss for each \n     animal as was intended by Congress for calendar years 2008 \n     through 2011; and\n       (2) should work with groups representing affected livestock \n     producers to come up with this more precise methodology.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2280, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent that the previously agreed-to \namendment No. 2280 be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Findings:\n       Sudden loss in late 2008 of export-market based demand \n     equivalent to about three percent of domestic milk production \n     has thrown the U.S. dairy industry into a critical supply-\n     demand imbalance; and\n       An abrupt decline in U.S. exports was fueled by the onset \n     of the global economic crisis combined with resurgence of \n     milk supplies in Oceania; and\n       The U.S. average all-milk price reported by the National \n     Agriculture Statistics Service from January through May of \n     2009, has averaged $4.80 per hundredweight below the cost of \n     production; and\n       Approximately $3.9 billion in dairy producer equity has \n     been lost since January; and\n       Anecdotal evidence suggests that U.S. dairy producers are \n     losing upwards of $100 per cow per month; and\n       The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 extended the \n     counter-cyclical Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) support \n     program and instituted a `feed cost adjuster' to augment that \n     support; and\n       The Secretary of Agriculture in March transferred \n     approximately 200 million pounds of nonfat dry milk to USDA's \n     food and Nutrition Service in a move designed to remove \n     inventory from the market and support low-income families; \n     and\n       The Secretary on March 22nd reactivated USDA's Dairy Export \n     Incentive Program (DEIP) to help U.S. producers meet \n     prevailing world prices and develop international markets; \n     and\n       The Secretary announced on July 31, 2009 a temporary \n     increase in the amount paid for dairy products through the \n     Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP), an adjustment \n     that is projected to increase dairy farmers' revenue by $243 \n     million; and\n       U.S. dairy producers face unprecedented challenges that \n     threaten the stability of the industry, the nation's milk \n     production infrastructure, and thousands of rural \n     communities;\n       The Senate states that the Secretary of Agriculture and the \n     President's Office of Management and Budget should continue \n     to\n\n[[Page S8726]]\n\n     closely monitor the U.S. dairy sector and use all available \n     discretionary authority to ensure its long-term health and \n     sustainability.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2244\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Coburn \namendment No. 2244.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the next \nitem of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2276.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, with the Sanders amendment being the \nissue now, I will raise to my colleagues a point of order.\n  I understand the difficulty the dairy industry is in. We have dairy \nindustry in Kansas, and it is an important business. Certainly, prices \nare difficult and they are having trouble.\n  However, the Sanders amendment would provide the Farm Service Agency \nwith an additional $350 million. Unfortunately, even if we could agree \nthat additional funding was necessary, the amendment was put in such a \nway that it cannot work; it is not drafted appropriately. There is no \nmechanism to move the funding from the FSA salaries and expenses \naccount to the Dairy Product Price Support Program.\n  For these reasons, regrettably, I cannot support the amendment. The \npending amendment, No. 2276, offered by the Senator from Vermont, \nincreases spending by $350 million. This additional spending would \ncause the underlying bill to exceed the subcommittee's section 302(b) \nallocation.\n  Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to \nsection 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of this act for purposes of the pending amendment.\n  This amendment is supported by a number of Senators, not just from \nthe east coast or Midwest or Southwest or the West but from all over \nthe country--among others, Senators Snowe, Udall of New Mexico, \nSchumer, Bennett, Collins, Franken, Casey, Udall of Colorado, Specter, \nMcCaskill, Gillibrand, Klobuchar, and Shaheen.\n  We are united from every section of the country to make the point \nthat when we talk about the deep recession we are facing, this is a \nrecession that is impacting rural America very severely, and we cannot \nforget about rural America.\n  Right now, at this moment, dairy farmers across the country are \nsuffering from the lowest milk prices in four decades. In the last \nyear, the price farmers received for milk has plummeted 41 percent. I \nask for support on the amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n\n[[Page S8727]]\n\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator \nfrom Maryland (Ms. Mikulski) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 60, nays 37, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 260 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--37\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Byrd\n     Kennedy\n     Mikulski\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 60, the nays are \n37. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to. The point of order is \nrendered moot.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2276) was agreed to.\n\n\n                 National Animal Disease Center Funding\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, along with the chairman \nand ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, for agreeing to \nwork with me to secure in this bill an additional $3.4 million per year \nin conference, above the baseline funding level, for research \naddressing emerging animal disease threats at the National Animal \nDisease Center, NADC, in Ames, IA. NADC is a world class research \nfacility that provides vital research to identify emerging animal \ndiseases and develop effective methods to prevent and treat emerging \nthreats to animal agriculture, our food supply and human health.\n  Over the past few years we have seen the emergence of a number of \nthreats to the livestock industry in the United States such as the \navian influenza and H1N1 virus. Not only do these diseases pose a \nthreat to animal health, but they also represent a threat to human \nhealth. Work at NADC is vitally important to protecting animal and \nhuman health and improving the lives of millions of people worldwide.\n  Additional resources provided in this bill for ongoing research at \nNADC on emerging animal disease are vital to the livestock industry. In \nthe early days of the H1N1 outbreak misinformation cost pork producers \nin the United States an estimated $7.2 million a day, even though H1N1 \nwas never found in pigs in the United States. Developing additional \ncapacity for vaccine discovery and rapid detection of emerging animal \ndisease is important in protecting human health and animal agriculture.\n  I thank you again for working to provide this needed, continuing, \nresearch funding for emerging animal disease at NADC.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Iowa for his \ncomments. The impacts of emerging animal diseases are felt in many far-\nranging sectors of the economy and human health. The impact of threats \nto the health of livestock can have a devastating impact on producers. \nMisleading information about an emerging disease can also spread across \nthe country rapidly. This underscores the importance of rapid detection \nand diagnosis of emerging animal diseases.\n  I am pleased to work with you to include in the final version of the \nfiscal year 2010 agriculture spending bill $3.4 million in additional \nresources, above the baseline, to continue NADC's role as one of the \npreeminent research institutions on emerging animal diseases. This is \nintended to be additional funding that will be part of the base funding \nfor NADC in future years.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to also thank the Senator \nfrom Iowa for his comments. I agree with Chairman Kohl and Senator \nHarkin on this need and will work hard towards accomplishing this goal \nin conference. The recent H1N1 scare also illustrates the dangers of \nzoonotic diseases to the human and animal populations. If we know how \nto stop these diseases soon after they are diagnosed, we can help stop \nthe spread of the disease in animals, and possibly the transmission to \nhumans. The reverse is also true; the H1N1 scare also taught us that \nhumans can also pass diseases to the animals. The more knowledge that \ncan be discovered about emerging animal diseases, the more likely it is \nthat we can address them before they become a significant problem. \nOngoing funding provided for the NADC will be vitally important in \nprotecting human and animal health.\n  Emerging animal diseases, like the H1N1 virus, can have a devastating \nimpact on animal agriculture in the form of reduced exports and \nslaughter of infected herds and flocks. Additional ongoing resources \nprovided in this bill will make sure the livestock industry is in a \nsafe and secure place.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to echo my colleagues' \ncomments. A recent Agriculture Research Service report indicated, \n``Because swine are also susceptible to infection with avian and human \ninfluenza viruses, genetic re-assortment between these viruses and/or \nswine influenza viruses can occur.'' The potential for swine to develop \nnovel viruses that can impact human health highlights the importance of \nthe additional ongoing resources in this bill for the NADC. It is my \nintention to support the subcommittee's efforts as enunciated to \nprovide the specific resources noted above in fiscal year 2010 and over \nthe long term.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues regarding the \nadditional funding provided for NADC. Providing additional resources in \nthis bill for ongoing research at NADC on emerging animal diseases will \nhelp protect animal and human health.\n\n\n                  Commodity Supplemental Food Program\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would like to engage Senator Kohl in a \ncolloquy concerning funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food \nProgram.\n  It is my understanding that this bill provides the budget request and \nwill meet current demand according to USDA. I know that the House-\npassed measure includes additional funding to add caseload and bring \nnew States into this critically important program. I strongly support \nthe level of funding provided in the House-passed measure and expanding \nthe program into the six States USDA has approved: Arkansas, Oklahoma, \nDelaware, Utah, New Jersey, and Georgia.\n  I hope that as this bill goes to conference we can work together to \nreconcile those differences.\n  Mr. KOHL. I can assure Senator Stabenow that we will do all that we \ncan to continue to improve this important program.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate Chairman Kohl's assurance. This program is \ncritically important to thousands of seniors in Michigan and nationwide \nwho cannot afford to buy the foods they need to meet their special \ndietary needs.\n\n\n                           Emerald Ash Borer\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague \nfrom New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I thank the Chairman for entering into a colloquy \nwith me and for his hard work on this bill. I wanted to quickly discuss \nthe need to add New York to the list of States threatened by the \nemerald ash borer--an invasive insect that has destroyed over 50 \nmillion ash trees in the U.S. to date.\n  Originally found in Michigan, the emerald ash borer has been steadily\n\n[[Page S8728]]\n\nmaking its way eastward and is now threatening to decimate the 900 \nmillion ash trees across New York State. This invasive species \nthreatens a billion dollar timber industry that supplies furniture \nmakers, hardware stores, and the wood for Louisville Slugger baseball \nbats.\n  The emerald ash borer larvae burrow through trees, preventing them \nfrom receiving essential nutrients and water, eventually causing the \ntree to die. Thousands of traps have been set in Cattaraugus and \nChautauqua Counties, but more funding will be needed to stop the spread \nand ensure that New York's forests are not forever altered.\n  The current committee report lists 12 States which are affected by \nthis invasive pest. I would ask that New York be added to that list \nduring conference.\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to thank my colleague for bringing this to my \nattention and I will certainly address this issue during conference.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I thank the Chairman for his help and leadership.\n\n\n                 Food and Agriculture Policy Institute\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to raise an issue that has \nbeen brought to my attention by the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson. \nThe Senator was mistakenly credited with having requested funding for \nthe Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute in Senate Report \n111-39. I want to assure him that this will be corrected during the \nconference negotiations on the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank Senator Brownback for raising this issue. I, too, \nwant Senator Isakson to know that this will be corrected during \nconference.\n\n\n                 Southern Plains Range Research Station\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as a neighboring agriculture State, it is \na pleasure to work with the Senator from Kansas, in fact both Senators \nfrom Kansas, on numerous issues that provide for important research, \nrelief, and aid to our States. I ask that language be included in the \nconference report indicating the urgent need for additional scientific \npersonnel at the Southern Plains Range Research Station in Woodward, \nOK, near our joint borders, through the Agricultural Research Service \nin order to establish a Center for Warm-Season Grasses Research at the \nstation in fiscal year 2010.\n  The Southern Plains Range Research Station is a research unit of the \nUSDA's Agricultural Research Service. It has a mission to conduct \nresearch that addresses the challenges and opportunities associated \nwith managing America's rangelands through innovative production \npractices and improved plant germplasm. The current research program at \nthe station includes a team of three scientists: a ruminant \nnutritionist for range-livestock production research, a research \nagronomist for germplasm evaluation, and a geneticist for breeding \nimproved plants. The goal of establishing and developing a Center for \nWarm Season Grasses Research would be improved plant materials \nmanagement alternatives for rangelands and pastures in the southern \nplains. This center would provide a focused effort in native and \nintroduced warm-season grass research to address issues with biofuels \nand feedstock production which is a critical issue to farmers and \nranchers throughout the country. Additional personnel are needed to \naccomplish this mission. The addition of these two essential scientists \nwill assist the Southern Plains Range Research Station in working \ntowards its goal of establishing itself as the Center for Warm-Season \nGrasses Research in the south central United States.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate working with the Senator from Oklahoma on \nvarious agriculture issues, and can address this issue in the \nconference report.\n\n\n                    Office of Advocacy and Outreach\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise to discuss a new and relatively small office \nwithin USDA that will help ensure the Department adequately addresses \nthe needs of all farmers and ranchers. For too long, USDA has not had \nadequate focus on policy, programs, and outreach for small farms, \nbeginning farmers and ranchers, and minority farmers and ranchers. A \nprovision in the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, the farm \nbill, which was partially based on a proposal I made with Senator \nHarkin is intended to reverse that situation by creating the Office of \nAdvocacy and Outreach. The farm bill provision places the new office \nwithin executive operations at the Department to ensure that it has \noverarching coordination functions across all of the mission areas of \nUSDA and that the director of the office is not within any of the under \nor assistant secretariats so he or she can have a higher profile and be \nbetter able to analyze and improve access to the functions and \nactivities of USDA across the entire Department. The office will have \ntwo divisions--the socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers group \nand the small and beginning farmers and ranchers group.\n  The socially disadvantaged farmers group includes a new Advisory \nCommittee on Minority Farmers established under section 14009 of the \nfarm bill, and a new farmworker coordinator established in section \n14013 of the farm bill. The existing functions of the current Office of \nOutreach and Diversity that serve socially disadvantaged producers and \nminority serving institutions are also transferred to the Office of \nAdvocacy and Outreach.\n  The small and beginning farmers and ranchers group is given \nresponsibility for continuing and building upon the functions for the \nexisting Office of Small Farms Coordination, the existing Small Farms \nand Beginning Farmer and Rancher Council, and the existing Advisory \nCommittee for Beginning Farmers and Ranchers, plus a consultative role \non the administration of the Beginning Farmer and Ranchers Development \nProgram administered by CSREES.\n  The new office builds upon the recommendations made to Congress by \nthe Government Accountability Office. The new office will establish \ndepartmental goals and objectives, measure outcomes, and provide input \ninto programmatic and policy directions and decisions. The office will \nalso improve outreach and assistance to these farm communities in order \nto help make the goals and objectives a reality.\n  It is very important this new office receive an appropriation so it \ncan begin its important and historic mission. It is my understanding \nthe administration's request for $3 million is provided for in the \nHouse bill. I would ask Chairman Kohl if it is his intent to try to \nfind a way to secure funding for the new office during conference.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin. He has been a leader \nin this effort and I always appreciate his input and counsel. The \nDepartment has under consideration a number of reorganization options \nthat affect a range of departmental functions. My hope is that between \nnow and the time conference negotiations are complete we can have a \nlittle more clarity on all these proposals and find a way to make \nprogress in the areas my colleague outlines. Our very able Secretary of \nAgriculture is trying to make the pieces fit together and I will do \nlikewise during conference negotiations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am also concerned with information coming from the \nDepartment of a possible plan to move the Office out of Executive \nOperations and to place it elsewhere. This is very troubling. Congress \nwas very clear about where the office was to be situated and I believe \nit is the responsibility of USDA to follow the law in this regard. I \nwould like to ask the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, if he agrees with my \nassessment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Wisconsin for his hard work to \nensure beginning farmers and minority farmers have adequate \nrepresentation within USDA programs. The Senator is correct. The 2008 \nfarm bill contains statutory language that establishes the Office of \nAdvocacy and Outreach within the executive operations of the Department \nof Agriculture's organizational structure.\n  I would also like to stress the vital importance of USDA moving \nforward to establish this office as quickly as possible. It has now \nbeen more than a year since the farm bill was enacted into law and it \nis time for USDA to move forward in establishing the office so that it \ncan begin to carry out its mission of ensuring that the needs of small \nand beginning farmers, as well as socially disadvantaged farmers, are \neffectively addressed by the Department of Agriculture throughout its \nvarious programs and activities.\n\n[[Page S8729]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator for that assurance.\n  Let me make one final point. As I mentioned, the law creates two \ndivisions within the OA Both areas are extremely important. It is my \nfirm belief that any funding provided for this office should be equally \ndivided between the two divisions, after accounting for the funds to \nestablish the overall Director of the office.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this important program, administered by \nthe Natural Resource Conservation Service within USDA, provides for \ncooperation between the Federal Government, State government agencies, \nand local organizations to prevent erosion, floodwater, and sediment \ndamages. The program also promotes the conservation and proper \nutilization of land in authorized watersheds. WFPO helps communities \nprepare detailed watershed work plans for flood prevention projects in \ncooperation with soil conservation districts and other local sponsoring \norganizations.\n  As a result of this program, over 11,000 flood protection and water \nconservation structures have been built across the United States. Each \nyear, these structures provide over $292 million of flood damage \nprevention to agricultural land and over $399 million of flood damage \nis prevented to roads, bridges, homes and other structures.\n  There are other benefits as well--these projects protect and restore \nnatural resources. Annually, 90 million tons of soil are saved from \nerosion. Forty-seven thousand miles of streams and stream corridors are \nenhanced and protected. More than 1.8 million acre-feet of water are \nconserved. Nearly 280 thousand acres of wetlands are created, enhanced \nor restored. Over 9 million acres of upland wildlife habitat is \ncreated, enhanced or restored.\n  In Illinois, DuPage County has been working to rebuild the watershed \naround various branches of the DuPage River. The county wishes to \nreduce the incidence of flooding and damage to homes, businesses, and \nwildlife habitat. This program will allow for enhanced flood protection \nof the Meacham Grove reservoir and provide vital flood control for \nhomes and businesses downstream.\n  This effort is supported by a number of communities in DuPage County \nincluding the Roselle, Bloomingdale, Itasca, Wood Dale and Addison. \nOperation of the reservoir will be optimized by allowing storm water to \nenter the reservoir at a lower elevation. This will provide storm water \nstorage for smaller, more frequent rainfall events. It will also \nimprove the water quality of surrounding communities by allowing \npollutants and sediment to settle out in the reservoir instead of being \ntransported downstream.\n  This program has been very successful in Illinois, and I know many of \nmy colleagues have similar stories from their States. I do not believe \nwe should wait for a flood before we identify a problem. Federal \ninvestment in these types of projects can help reduce the Federal \ninvestment necessary in the event of a flood disaster. Watershed \nprojects prevent flooding and the damage floods cause to public \nfacilities, roads, bridges, homes, and businesses. They conserve water, \nimprove water quality, reduce soil erosion, and create wildlife \nhabitats. We should reduce the vulnerability of our population to flood \ndamage and improve our stewardship of the natural and beneficial \nfunctions of our floodprone areas. I oppose the amendment by my \ncolleague from Arizona, and ask that others do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first, I compliment the managers of this \nbill, Senator Kohl and Senator Brownback. They have done a remarkably \ngood job. We completed this major appropriations bill in a couple of \ndays. One day was pretty short. They have done very good work.\n  We are going to vote on final passage, and then we are going to go to \nthe debate on the Supreme Court nominee. Senator McConnell and I said \nearlier today we have a lot of Senators who wish to speak on this \nnomination. We don't want anyone to feel they do not have time to \nspeak. But we are going to go in this order: We will have a Democrat \nand Republican. The cloakrooms have to be notified that you want to \ncome and speak. If people wait until Wednesday night or Thursday to \nspeak, there may not be an opportunity to speak on this nomination.\n  We know we have at least 28 Republicans who wish to speak and there \nis probably a like number of Democrats who wish to speak on this \nnomination who have not already spoken. We hope Senators will indicate \nto staff how much time they need, and then when they tell Senators they \nneed to be available at a certain time, I hope all Senators will try to \ndo that.\n  If there is not a Democrat available when it is the Democrats' turn, \nthen we will move to another Republican, and vice versa.\n  The debate in the committee has been outstanding. I think Senator \nLeahy and Senator Sessions have done a very good job on an issue that \npeople feel very strongly about on both sides. There is no reason the \ndebate that is going to be on the Senate floor should not be as \ndignified as it was in the Judiciary Committee.\n  We are going to move to the nomination as soon as we finish final \npassage. This will be the last vote of the night. We will try to work \nout a program so we can finish this week. We have a little bit of work \nto do. I think there has been an agreement between Senator McConnell \nand me on what needs to get done. We have a few problems explaining \nwhat our desire is to some of the Senators. We will do that as quickly \nas we can.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see my friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama, on the floor. We have also discussed this. Senator \nSessions and I will open the debate, as the leader has said. I suggest \neverybody on this side check with the staff to set up a list.\n  Again, I urge people to come at the time they said. I agree with the \nleader, if they do not, we go to the next person and finish it up. I \nhope it will not be the case we will be in long quorum calls and then \neverybody says let's talk. I think the leaders have set a fair \nschedule, and we should go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The substitute amendment, as amended, is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1908), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill, as amended, pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator \nfrom Maryland (Ms. Mikulski) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to thank Senator \nBrownback, with whom I have worked extremely well on this bill. He has \nmade great contributions to the bill, and he has a wonderful staff--\nFitz Elder, Stacy McBride, and Katie Toskey--who also made great \ncontributions. On my side, Galen Fountain, Jessica Frederick, Dianne \nNellor, and Bob Ross made great contributions.\n  We are all very proud of the product, we are pleased with the vote, \nand we are happy it is over.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I, too, want to take a moment to thank \nmy colleague Senator Kohl who has worked on this for some period of \ntime. I thought this was one of the smoothest appropriations bill we \nhave had flow through the floor. I congratulate our colleague and \nparticularly his work and that of the staff to make this happen: Galen \nFountain, Jessica Frederick on his staff, Bob Ross, Dianne Nellor; on \nmine, Fitz Elder, Stacy McBride, Katie Toskey, and then Riley Scott and \nMelanie Benning were also key on it.\n  There is an item about which I have some consternation at the end \nwhere we broke the 302(b) allocation. My hope is in conference we can \nget that worked back down because clearly we have a huge budget crisis \non our hands and we have to hit these numbers. I know it was an \nimportant issue to the chairman on dairy funding and that is an \nimportant issue; particularly if you are from Wisconsin, that is an \nimportant issue. It is my hope we can work that down.\n  I do think it shows a lot of support and strength when you have a \nmajor bipartisan vote on this bill at the end. My hope is that is the \nway we will operate in the body, in a bipartisan way so we can move \nthings through for the good of the country.\n  We are in the minority, obviously, but there is no reason we cannot \nwork these issues together as much as we possibly can. Senator Kohl was \nexcellent to work with. I appreciate that chance to do it.\n  I look forward to us getting this through on a stand-alone basis, not \nrolled together in an omnibus package if at all possible. I think it is \nan important package, one we should be able to do that with. I think we \nhave the ability to get that done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Brownback for his kind \nwords. I would also like to not end the proceedings without mentioning \nan individual on my staff, Phil Karting, who did a tremendous job and \nwas an important part of the product that was finally put forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendment and requests a conference with the House, and the \nChair appoints the follow conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER appointed Mr. Kohl, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dorgan, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. \nReed, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Specter, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bennett of \nUtah, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Bond, Mr. McConnell, and Ms. Collins conferees \non the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/04/senate-section/article/S8730-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8730-S8755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF SONIA SOTOMAYOR TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME \n                       COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor, of New \nYork, to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the first hour will \nbe under the control of the chair and the ranking member of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, also himself \na member of the Judiciary Committee. He sat through and participated in \nall of the hearings on Judge Sotomayor.\n  When the Judiciary Committee began the confirmation hearing on the \nnomination of Judge Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, in my opening \nstatement I recounted an insight from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I did \nthis because it is often quoted by President Obama, the man who \nnominated her. The quote is:\n\n       Let us realize the arc of the moral universe is long, but \n     it bends towards justice.\n\n  Each generation of Americans has sought that arc toward justice. \nIndeed, that national purpose is inherent in our Constitution. In the \nConstitution's preamble, the Founders set forth to establish justice as \none of the principal reasons that ``We the people of the United \nStates'' joined together to ``ordain and establish'' the Constitution. \nThis is intertwined in the American journey with another purpose for \nthe Constitution that President Obama often speaks about. We all admit \nit is the unfinished goal of forming ``a more perfect Union.'' Our \nUnion is not yet perfected, but we are making progress with each \ngeneration.\n  That journey began with improvements upon the foundation of our \nConstitution through the Bill of Rights and then it continued with the \nCivil War amendments, the 19th amendment's expansion of the right to \nvote for women, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, and the 26th amendment's extension of the vote to young people. \nThese actions have marked progress along the path of inclusion. They \nrecognize the great diversity that is the strength of our Nation.\n  Judge Sotomayor's journey to this nomination is truly an American \nstory. She was raised by a working mother in the Bronx after her father \ndied when she was a child. She rose to win top honors as part of one of \nthe first classes of women to graduate from Princeton. She excelled at \nYale law school. She was one of the few women in the Manhattan District \nAttorney's Office in the mid-1970s. She became a Federal trial judge \nand then the first Latina judge on a Federal appeals court when she was \nconfirmed to the second circuit over a decade ago.\n  I might note on a personal basis, I am a member of the bar of the \nsecond circuit, as well as the Federal District Court of Vermont. That \nis the circuit I belong to as a member of the Vermont bar. I know how \nexcited we were in the second circuit when she became a judge.\n  She is now poised to become the first Latina Justice and actually \nonly the third woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. She has broken \nbarriers along the way. She has become a role model to many. Her life \njourney is a reminder to all of the continuing vitality of the American \ndream.\n  Judge Sotomayor's selection for the Supreme Court also represents \nanother step toward the establishment of justice. I have spoken over \nthe last several years about urging Presidents--I have done this with \nPresidents of both political parties--to nominate somebody from outside \nthe judicial monastery to the Supreme Court. I believe that experience, \nperspective, an understanding of how the world works and how people \nlive--how real people live and the effect decisions will have on the \nlives of people--these have to be very important qualifications.\n  One need look no further than the Lilly Ledbetter and the Diana \nLevine cases to understand the impact each Supreme Court appointment \nhas on the lives and freedoms of countless Americans.\n  In the Ledbetter case, five Justices on the Supreme Court struck a \nsevere\n\n[[Page S8731]]\n\nblow to the rights of working families  across our country. In effect, \nthey said we can pay women less than men for the exact same work. \nCongress acted to protect women and others against discrimination in \nthe workplace more than 40 years ago, yet we still struggle to ensure \nthat all Americans, women and men, receive equal pay for equal work. It \ntook a new Congress and a new President to strike down the immunity the \nSupreme Court had given to employers who discriminate against their \nworkers and successfully hide their wrongdoing.\n\n  The Supreme Court had allowed them to do that. We changed that again. \nI remember the pride I had when I stood beside President Obama when he \nsigned his first piece of legislation into law, the Lilly Ledbetter \nlaw, which says something that every one of us should know \ninstinctively in our heart and soul: that women should be paid the same \nas men for the same kind of work.\n  But for all the talk about ``judicial modesty'' and ``judicial \nrestraint'' with the nominees of a Republican President at their \nconfirmation hearings, we have seen a Supreme Court these last 4 years \nthat has been anything but modest and restrained.\n  I understand decrying judicial activism when judges have simply \nsubstituted their judgment for that of elected officials. That is what \nwe have seen these last few years from the conservative members of the \nSupreme Court.\n  When evaluating Judge Sotomayor's nomination, I believe Senators \nshould consider what kind of Justice she will be. Will she be in the \nmold of these activists who have gutted legislation designed to protect \nAmericans from discrimination in their jobs and in voting, laws meant \nto protect the access of Americans to health care and education, and \nlaws meant to protect the privacy of all Americans from an overreaching \ngovernment? I think not and I hope not.\n  The reason I think not and hope not is I have been looking at what \nkind of judge she has been for the last 17 years and that is not the \nkind of judge she has been for 17 years. Keep in mind, this is a \nnominee who has had more experience on the Federal court than any \nnominee to the Supreme Court in decades. What we see is she has applied \nthe law to the facts of the cases she has considered. She has done that \nwhile understanding the impact of her decisions on those before the \ncourt.\n  Those who struggle to pin the label of judicial activist on Judge \nSotomayor are met by her very solid record of judging based on the law. \nShe is a restrained, experienced, and thoughtful judge who has shown no \nbias in her rulings.\n  The charge of some Senate Republican leaders that they fear she will \nshow bias is refuted over and over again in her record of 17 years. In \nfact, her record as a judge is one of rendering decisions impartially \nand neutrally. No one has pointed to decisions that evidence bias. No \none has shown any pattern of her inserting her own personal preferences \ninto her judicial decisions. No one can because that does not exist. \nThat is not who she is nor is it the type of judge she has been.\n  As her record demonstrates and her testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee reinforced, she is a restrained and fair and impartial judge \nwho applies the law to the facts to decide cases--the kind of judge \nthat any one of us who practiced law would want to appear before, \nwhether we were plaintiff or defendant, government or respondent, rich \nor poor. Ironically, the few decisions for which she has been \ncriticized are cases in which she did not reach out to change the law \nor to defy judicial precedent; in other words, cases in which she \nrefused to ``make law'' from the bench.\n  In her 17 years on the bench there is not one example, let alone a \npattern, of her ruling based on bias or prejudice or sympathy. She has \nbeen true to her oath. She has faithfully and impartially performed her \nduties under the Constitution.\n  As a prosecutor--a distinguished prosecutor--and then as a judge, she \nhas administered justice without favoring one group of persons over \nanother. In fact, she testified directly to this point. She said:\n\n       I have now served as an appellate judge for over a decade, \n     deciding a wide range of constitutional, statutory and other \n     legal questions. Throughout my 17 years on the bench, I have \n     witnessed the human consequences of my decisions. Those \n     decisions have not been made to serve the interest of any one \n     litigant, but always to serve the larger interests of \n     impartial justice.\n\n  About 12 years ago in a case called City of Boerne v. Florida, the \nSupreme Court struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a law \nthat Congress had passed to protect religious freedom. Since then, an \nactivist conservative group of Justices has issued a number of rulings \nthat further restricted the power of Congress under section 5 of the \n14th amendment.\n  They have limited other important Federal statutes such as the \nViolence Against Women Act, and they have done this by using a test \ncreated out of whole cloth, without any root in either history or in \nthe text of our Constitution. Scholars across the political spectrum \nhave criticized the Supreme Court's rulings in this line of cases, \nincluding Judge Michael McConnell and Judge John Noonan, Jr., both \nRepublican appointees to the Federal bench.\n  Let's have some history. Hundreds of thousands of Americans lost \ntheir lives fighting a civil war to end the enslavement of millions of \nAmericans. After the war, we transformed our founding charter, the \nConstitution, into one that embraced equal rights and human dignity \nthrough the reconstruction amendments by not only abolishing slavery \nbut also by guaranteeing equal protection of the law for all Americans \nand prohibiting the infringement of the right to vote on the basis of \nrace.\n  But these reconstruction amendments to our Constitution are not self-\nimplementing. Both the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution \ncontain sections giving Congress the power to enforce the amendments. \nCongress acts to secure Americans' voting rights when it passes \nstatutes like the Voting Rights Act pursuant to its authority to \nimplement the 14th and 15th amendment's guarantees of equality. \nCongress acts to ensure the basis for our democratic system of \ngovernment when we provide for implementation of this principle.\n  In contrast to the resistance that met the initial enactment of the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965--something that brought about enormous debate \nin this country--3 years ago, Republicans and Democrats in the Senate \nand House of Representatives came together to reauthorize key expiring \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act. This overwhelmingly bipartisan \neffort sought to preserve the rights of all Americans to equal access \nto the democratic process.\n  I stood with President George W. Bush when he proudly signed that \nrestoration. But earlier this year, I attended the oral argument in a \ncase challenging the constitutionality of the reenacted Voting Rights \nAct.\n  It appeared from the questions posed by the conservative Justices \nthat they were ready to apply the troubling line of rulings in which \nthey have second guessed Congress in order to strike down a key \nprovision of the Voting Rights Act, one of this country's most \nimportant civil rights laws. Lacking a fifth vote for such a seismic \nshift, the constitutional ruling was avoided. But I remain concerned \nthat the Supreme Court nonetheless remains poised to overturn other \ndecisions made by Congress in which we decide how best to protect the \nrights and well-being of all American people.\n  I believe Judge Sotomayor will be a Justice who will continue to do \nwhat she has done as a judge for the last 17 years. I believe she will \nshow appropriate deference to Congress when it passes laws to protect \nthe freedoms of Americans.\n  I also believe she will have an understanding of the real world \nimpact of the Supreme Court's decisions, which will be a welcome \naddition. When she was designated by the President, Judge Sotomayor \nsaid:\n\n       The wealth of experiences, personal and professional, have \n     helped me appreciate the variety of perspectives that present \n     themselves in every case that I hear. It has helped me to \n     understand, respect and respond to the concerns and arguments \nof all litigants who appear before me, as well as the views of my \ncolleagues on the bench. I strive never to forget the real-world \nconsequences of my decisions on individuals, businesses, and \ngovernment.\n\n  Well, it took a Supreme Court that understood the real world to see \nthat\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\nthe seemingly fair-sounding doctrine of ``separate but equal'' was in \nreality a straitjacket of inequality and it was offensive to the \nConstitution.\n  We had ``separate but equal.'' For years in this country, we had \nsegregation. We had segregation in our schools. It was a blight on the \nidea of a colorblind Constitution. And all Americans have come to \nrespect the Supreme Court's unanimous rejection of racial \ndiscrimination and inequality in Brown v. Board of Education. That was \na case about the real-world impact of a legal doctrine.\n  But just 2 years ago, in the Seattle school desegregation case, we \nsaw a narrowly divided Supreme Court undercut the heart of the landmark \nBrown v. Board decision, a decision that was unanimous. The Seattle \nschool district valued racial diversity and was voluntarily trying to \nmaintain diversity in its schools. By a five-to-four vote, the \nconservative activists on the Court said that program was prohibited. \nThat decision broke with more than half a century of equal protection \njurisprudence, and I believe it set back the long struggle for equality \nin this country.\n  Justice Stevens wrote that the Chief Justice's opinion twisted Brown \nv. Board in a ``cruelly ironic'' way.\n  I think most Americans understand that there is a crucial difference \nbetween a community that does its best to ensure that schools include \nchildren of all races and one that prevents children of some races from \nattending certain schools. I mean, real-world experience tells us that. \nThose of us who are parents, grandparents, we know this.\n  Justice Breyer's dissent criticized the Chief Justice's opinion as \napplying an ``overly theoretical approach to case law, an approach that \nemphasizes rigid distinctions . . . in a way that serves to mask the \nradical nature of today's decision. Law is not an exercise in \nmathematical logic.''\n  Actually, I might say, if it were, we could just have computers on \nour Supreme Court.\n  Chief Justice Warren, a Justice who came to the Supreme Court with \nreal-world experience as a State attorney general and Governor, \nrecognized the power of a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board.\n  The Roberts Court, in its narrow desegregation decision 2 years ago, \nignored the real-world experience of millions of Americans and chose to \ndepart from the most hallowed precedents of the Supreme Court.\n  I am hopeful and confident that when she serves as a Justice on the \nSupreme Court of the United States, Sonia Sotomayor, a woman from the \nSouth Bronx who has overcome so much, will be mindful of the real-world \nexperiences of Americans.\n  Those critics who devalue her judicial record and choose to \nmisconstrue a few lines from speeches, ignore the aspiration behind \nthose speeches. In fact, Judge Sotomayor begins the part of the speech \nso quoted by critics with the words ``I would hope.'' She would \n``hope'' that she and other Latina judges would be ``wise'' in their \ndecision-making and that their experiences would help inform them and \nhelp provide that wisdom. I hope so, too. Just as I hope that Justices \nThomas' early life leads him to, as he testified in his confirmation \nhearing, ``stand in the shoes of other people.'' And I hope that \nJustice Alito's immigrant heritage, as he too discussed in his \nconfirmation hearing, helps him understand the plight of the powerless \nin our society.\n  Judge Sotomayor also said in her speeches that she embraced the goal \nthat: ``[J]udges must transcend their personal sympathies and \nprejudices and aspire to achieve a greater degree of fairness and \nintegrity based on the reason of law.'' I am going to be saying more \nabout this as we go along, but I would note that her critics missed \nthat Judge Sotomayor was pointing out a path to greater fairness and \nfidelity to the law by acknowledging that despite the aspirations of \nimpartiality she shares with other judges, judges are human. Her \ncritics seem to ignore her modesty in claiming not to be perfect. I \nwould like to know which one of the 100 U.S. Senators could claim to be \nperfect. There are some who could; I am not one of them.\n  By acknowledging that judges come to the bench with experiences and \npersonal viewpoints, they can be on guard against those views \ninfluencing judicial outcomes. By striving for a more diverse bench \ndrawn from judges with a wider set of backgrounds and experiences, we \ncan better ensure that the decisions of the Court will be freer of \nlimited viewpoints or narrow biases.\n  All Supreme Court nominees have talked about the value they will \nbring to the bench from their backgrounds and experiences. That \ndiversity of experience is a strength, not a weakness, in achieving an \nimpartial judiciary. A more diverse bench with a better understanding \nof the real world impact of decisions can help avoid the pitfalls of \nthe Supreme Court's decisions these last years.\n  Let me point to just one example because judges--just as Senators \nbring their experience to this body--judges do, too.\n  Judge Sotomayor sat on a three-judge panel that heard a case \ninvolving strip searches of adolescent girls in a juvenile detention \ncenter. The parents of two female children challenged Connecticut's \nblanket strip search policy for all those admitted to juvenile \ndetention centers as a violation of the fourth amendment's prohibition \nagainst unreasonable searches. Two of the male judges on the Second \nCircuit upheld the strip searches of the young girl.\n  In dissent, Judge Sotomayor cited controlling circuit precedent \ndescribing what is involved in the strip searches of these girls who \nhad never been charged with a crime--keep in mind that they had never \nbeen charged with a crime--and without any basis for individual \nsuspicion. She said that courts ``should be especially wary of strip \nsearches of children, since youth is a time and condition of life when \na person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological \ndamage.'' She also emphasized that since many of these girls had been \nvictims of abuse and neglect, they may be more vulnerable mentally and \nemotionally than other youths their age.\n  The Supreme Court recently decided a similar case, the Redding case. \nThey found that school officials violated the fourth amendment rights \nof a young girl by conducting an intrusive strip search of her \nunderclothes while looking for the equivalent of a pain reliever many \nof us have in our medicine cabinet. During oral arguments in that case, \none of the male Justices compared the search to simply changing for gym \nclasses. Several of the other Justices answered with laughter--not the \nreaction I would have if that was my adolescent daughter. And Justice \nGinsburg, the lone female Justice on the Supreme Court, described the \nsearch as humiliating to young girls. She spoke out. She did not join \nin that laughter.\n  Ultimately, the Supreme Court decided that case by a vote of 8 to 1. \nJustice Souter, the Justice whom Judge Sotomayor is nominated to \nreplace, wrote the opinion for the Court. Of course, that position \nmirrored that of Judge Sotomayor. I suspect that it was Justice \nGinsburg's understanding of the intrusiveness of the strip search of \nthe young girl that ultimately prevailed. Can we say our life \nexperience bears no weight in what we do?\n  Among the very first purposes of the Constitution is ``to establish \njustice.'' It is a purpose that has animated the improvements we have \nmade over generations to our Constitution. It is a purpose engraved in \nthe words over the entrance of the Supreme Court. These words are in \nVermont marble, and they say, ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' All the \ndozens and dozens of times I have walked into the Supreme Court, up \nthose steps straight out across from this Chamber, I have always paused \nto read those words, ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' Is that not what we \nshould stand for?\n  I hope and believe Judge Sotomayor understands the critical \nimportance of both fairness and justice. A decade ago, she gave another \nspeech in which she spoke about the meaning of justice. She said, \n``Almost every person in our society is moved by that one word. It is a \nword embodied with a spirit that rings in the hearts of people. It is \nan elegant and beautiful word that moves people to believe that the law \nis something special.''\n  I believe Judge Sotomayor will live up to those words when she is \nconfirmed, as she will be confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The \nsenior Senator from Vermont will vote for that confirmation.\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the opportunity to speak. Before I do, I \nwant to say that we had some disagreements as we went along about how \nto conduct the hearings. But Chairman Leahy made a commitment that we \nwould have a fair hearing, that every Senator would have an opportunity \nto question the witnesses and have the time to follow up, and he \ncomplied with that. I think we had a good hearing.\n  Judge Sotomayor was voted out of the committee, and I appreciate her \nkind words to me and to our colleagues on how she felt she was treated. \nI think the hearings were fair and effectively discussed the important \nissues raised by this nomination.\n  Our confirmation process began with the President indicating that \nempathy was a standard that he believes should be applied to selecting \njudges. There is some disagreement about that. I am one of those who do \nnot believe that is a legal standard. It is a kind of standard that is \ncloser to a political standard, and we need to be careful that politics \ndo not infect the judiciary.\n  I certainly do not profess to be able to say with certainty how Judge \nSotomayor will perform if confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n  History shows that Justices, once confirmed, often surprise. I have \npreviously expressed my evaluation and decision in this matter. I will \njust say I hope I am wrong. But I have concluded that the nominee has a \nfully formed judicial philosophy, one that is held by quite a few other \nlawyers and judges, but it is a philosophy contrary to the classical \nunderpinnings of the American legal system, a system that has blessed \nus so much. Edmond Burke, in his famous speech ``On Conciliation with \nthe Colonies,'' urged the King to avoid war, noting that the Colonies \nwere simply asserting the rights to which they had become accustomed. \nHe observed that almost as many copies of Blackstone's Commentaries on \nthe Laws were being sold in America as in England.\n  From the beginning, Americans have honored law because, I suspect, it \nwas the arena in which the poor individual citizen could and often did \nprevail against the powerful. Even before the Revolution, judges, \njuries, and English law decided cases. It was a people's power \ncontrolled by law that would prevail even over the political wishes of \nthe powerful. Laws, Burke noted, were to be created by the people \nthrough their elected representatives, not judges. Law in the new \nRepublic was not an abstract. It was concrete. The laws meant what they \nsaid. If by some loophole even an evil act was not covered by criminal \nlaw, the prisoner was to go free.\n  Importantly, our system rested upon a near universally held belief \nthat law and order were necessary for freedom and progress to occur. It \nfurther rested on the firm belief that there was such a thing as \nobjective truth and that if a real effort was put forth, truth could be \nascertained. For most, this was an easy concept, since a belief in God, \nthe ultimate truth, was widespread. Thus, the legal system was arranged \nto best discover truth. Rules of evidence, cross-examination, and the \nadversarial system were parts of the design to discover truth. Many \nnations have tried to replicate it without success. It is a national \ntreasure, our legal system.\n  I believe our Federal courts are the greatest dispensers of justice \nthe world has ever known. For 15 years, I practiced full time as a \nFederal attorney before Federal judges. I saw the system operate. I \nhave seen State and local judges, Republicans and Democrats, serve \nfaithfully day after day, adhering to the ideal of objectivity, \nfairness, and law. But many intellectuals in recent decades look upon \nsuch an approach as anti-intellectual. They conclude such thinking that \njudges actually do in an ideal way, they find this is hopelessly naive. \nThey think it is unrealistic. The brilliant jurist and intellectual \nJerome Frank, quoted favorably by Judge Sotomayor in a law review \narticle, said as much in the early part of the last century.\n  Since then, many theorists have gone even further, moral relativists, \npostmodernists, deconstructionists, critical legal studies adherents, \nthey all come from the same pond. They don't believe--some don't--that \nthere is an ascertainable truth. They believe these ideals actually \nconfuse thinking and mislead. They believe it is results that count.\n  I don't agree. The American people don't agree. Ideals are important. \nHigh standards can be reached. Not every time, I am sure, but most \ntimes. If the ideal is not ardently sought, it will be reached less and \nless. The American people are not cynics who settle for less than the \nideal of impartiality and equal justice for the poor and the rich under \nthe Constitution and the laws of this country. Each judge operates \nunder the Constitution and laws of this country. They expect, rightly, \nthat every judge will be fully committed to the heritage of law and the \njudicial oath they take to follow it.\n  That is why I have expressed the view since this process has begun, \nthat we are at a fork in the road, perhaps. Will we continue to adhere \nto the classical ideal of American jurisprudence, or will we follow \nresults-oriented judging, where judges cease to be committed to the law \nand equal justice because they know it is not possible. Do they believe \nwords are just words? Do they believe the Constitution can be made to \nsay what one wants it to say? In this world, the Constitution cannot \nbind a judge to what the judge considers an unwise result. Instead, we \nshould see the Constitution as a flexible, living document. Under this \nview, judges are not just umpires. Judges are more powerful. Judges can \nmake the Constitution and law say what they would prefer it to say. \nJudges can ensure that the right team wins. Judges can make policy. \nThat is the seductive siren call of judicial activism, and judicial \nactivism is an impropriety that can be embraced by conservatives as \nwell as liberals.\n  Our former chairman, Senator Hatch, has often said: Activism is a \ntendency in a judge to allow their personal and political views and \nvalues to override the law and the facts of a case to achieve a result \nthey think is desirable. That is what is not acceptable in our system.\n  That is why, at the most fundamental level, many have a problem with \nthis nominee. It seems clear from her writings and speeches that she is \na devotee of the new philosophy of judging. Her speeches, over the \nyears, are quite clear on this matter, although her hearing testimony \nbacktracked from it in a somewhat confusing manner.\n  Regrettably, I was not able to support her nomination in committee, \nnor will I support her nomination before the full Senate. I would like \nto discuss in greater detail a few of the reasons that lead me to that \nconclusion. There are more things that will be discussed later as we go \nalong, but let me say a few things now.\n  Even before the nomination of Judge Sotomayor, I made clear what my \ncriteria would be for assessing a Supreme Court nominee: impartiality, \ncommitment to the rule of law, integrity, legal experience, and \njudicial temperament. Judge Sotomayor possesses the well-rounded resume \nI like to see in a Supreme Court Justice. She has a wonderful personal \nstory. She was a prosecutor. She was a private practitioner. She was a \ntrial judge, and she was an appellate judge. Those are good experiences \nfor a judge on the Supreme Court. However, her speeches and cases she \nhas decided are troubling because they reflect the lack of a proper \nsense of the clearly stated constitutional rights that are guaranteed \nto American citizens. Her testimony was her opportunity to convince us \nshe would be the type of Justice we could vote for. Instead her answers \nlacked clarity, the consistency and courage of conviction one looks for \nin a nominee to the Supreme Court.\n  In many instances, she raised more questions through her testimony \nthan she answered. Judge Sotomayor's expressed judicial philosophy \nrejects openly the ideal of impartial and objective justice. Instead, \nher philosophy embraces and accepts the impact that background, \npersonal experience, gender, sympathies, and prejudices--these are her \nwords--have on judging. A fair and plain reading of these speeches--\nread in context--calls into question Judge Sotomayor's commitment to \nimpartiality and objectivity. When given an opportunity to explain this \nphilosophy, as was reflected in speech after\n\n[[Page S8734]]\n\nspeech, year after year, Judge Sotomayor dodged and deflected. In many \ncases, her answers could not be squared with the facts.\n  It has been suggested we should disregard those speeches. It has been \nsuggested they are just words, that they are merely meant to inspire. \nIn short, it has been suggested the words of the speeches simply do not \nmatter. But words do matter. Words are important. They must have \nmeaning or the result is chaos. No one should know this more than a \njudge. Her speeches and academic writings were not offhand comments \ndelivered without the aid of notes. They were carefully crafted to \ndispute the notion that impartiality is realistic, or even possible. \nThese were not the musings of a second-year law student. They were all \ndelivered after she was a Federal judge. They were delivered to a \nnumber of different audiences, a number of different forums, including \na bar association.\n  In her speeches and academic articles, Judge Sotomayor describes \nother approaches to judging and her approach to the law. She describes \nthe factors judges should consider when reaching decisions. She \ndescribes her fully formed judicial philosophy. She challenges the \nmainstream concept of judging.\n  Make no mistake, judicial philosophy matters. It guides judges. It \ntells them what to consider. Importantly, it tells them what not to \nconsider. Judicial philosophy is quite different from a judge's \npersonal, political, moral or social views that a judge is to set aside \nwhen they decide a case. That is what blindfolded justice means. When a \njudge puts on that robe, they are, in effect, saying to everyone in \nthat courtroom that their personal biases and prejudices and so forth \nwill not impact the fairness of the ruling they are called upon to \nmake.\n\n  Judges in trial and appellate courts, of course, are constrained by \nprecedent. Even if a trial or appellate judge harbors a radical \napproach to the law, the threat of reversal restricts that judge's \nability to employ that philosophy. But on the Supreme Court, however, \nthese restrictions are removed. On the Supreme Court, there is no \nadditional review. On the Supreme Court, a judicial philosophy that is \nfully formed is permitted to reach full bloom. As a liberal law dean \nrecently said in the Los Angeles Times: ``There's a huge difference \nbetween being a court of appeals judge who is bound by precedent and a \nSupreme Court justice who can rewrite those precedents.''\n  That is why judicial philosophy matters. Frankly, after reviewing her \nconsistent speeches in preparation for the confirmation hearing, I \nexpected Judge Sotomayor to defend her views. I expected her to defend \nher statement that ``[t]he law that lawyers practice and judges declare \nis not a definitive, capital `L' law that many would like to think \nexists.''\n  I expected her to defend the notion that the court of appeals is \nwhere ``policy is made.'' I expected her to defend her statements in \nfavor of using foreign law to interpret American statutes and her \nstatement that there is ``no objective stance, but only a series of \nperspectives.''\n  However, during her testimony, many of Judge Sotomayor's answers were \ninconsistent with her record and others were evasive and not adequate. \nOn several occasions, Judge Sotomayor appeared to run away from the \nphilosophy she had so publicly articulated. Other answers, I concluded, \nwere not plausible.\n  It has been repeatedly suggested that Judge Sotomayor's words and \nspeeches are being taken out of context. I have read the speeches in \ntheir entirety. Her words are not taken out of context. In fact, when \none reads her speeches in their entirety, in context, the impact is \nmore troubling, not less.\n  For example, Judge Sotomayor said, on repeated occasions, that she \n``willingly accept[s] that . . . judge[s] must not deny the differences \nresulting from experience and heritage but attempt . . . continuously \nto judge when those opinions, sympathies and prejudices are \nappropriate.''\n  When I asked whether there was ``any circumstance in which a judge \nshould allow prejudices to impact decision-making,'' she replied: \n``Never their prejudices.''\n  This is quite the opposite of what her speeches said. In the hearing, \nshe said her speeches discussed ``the very important goal of the \njustice system . . . to ensure that the personal biases and prejudices \nof a judge do not influence the outcome of a case.'' Well said. But \nthat is not what her speeches said--in context or line by line. She was \nnot urging that judges guard against their prejudices, as their oath \ncalls on them to do. She was accepting that a judge's prejudices may \ninfluence their decisions.\n  Similarly, Judge Sotomayor repeatedly stated she accepts that who she \nis will ``affect the facts I choose to see'' as a judge--the facts she \nchooses to see as a judge. She accepts this. When I asked her about \nthis statement, she said: ``It's not a question of choosing to see some \nfacts or another, Senator. I didn't intend to suggest that.''\n  But that is what she said repeatedly. She accepts the fact that who \nshe is will ``affect the facts I choose to see'' as a judge. The \ncontext of her speech states a clear philosophy. Judge Sotomayor was \ncontrasting her own views with that of Judge Cedarbaum and Justice \nO'Connor, two women judges of prominence. Of course, Justice O'Connor \nwas a former member of the Supreme Court. The context was her view that \n``[i]n short . . . the aspiration''--I am quoting her--``the aspiration \nto impartiality . . . is just that, an aspiration.'' Such a statement \nevidences a lack of the kind of firm commitment to fairness and to the \njudicial oath of impartiality that is expected, in my opinion.\n  We have heard again and again that our concerns are based on three \nwords: The ``wise Latina woman.'' That is not the case. We are talking \nabout a judicial philosophy, as reflected in speech after speech, year \nafter year. That is what is causing the problem here.\n  Senator Coburn, at the hearing, made a point that I think is worthy \nof emphasizing: that her refusal to effectively defend her own speeches \nand statements was almost as troubling as the philosophy contained \nwithin those speeches.\n  As the Washington Post, in endorsing her, on July 19, in their \neditorial, said:\n\n       Judge Sotomayor's attempts to explain away and distance \n     herself from [the ``wise Latina'' statement] were \n     unconvincing and at times uncomfortably close to \n     disingenuous, especially when she argued that her reason for \n     raising questions about gender or race was to warn against \n     injecting personal biases into the judicial process. Her \n     repeated and lengthy speeches on the matter do not support \n     that interpretation.\n\n  In Judge Sotomayor's opening statement, she said that her philosophy \nis ``fidelity to the law.'' But her record demonstrates that, if true, \nher view is far different than mine. For example, she has advocated for \nthe use of foreign law by American judges. Once again, we are left with \nstatements made at the hearing, though, that were in direct conflict \nwith statements made before she was nominated.\n  As Judge Sotomayor noted in her April 2009 speech--April of this \nyear--before the Puerto Rico American Civil Liberties Union, the \ncurrent debate regarding the use of foreign law in the courts, she \nnoted, pits two distinct views against one another. On one side sit \nJustices Scalia and Thomas, who believe that foreign law should not be \nused in interpreting the U.S. Constitution. That is correct, in my \nview. On the other side is Justice Ginsburg, who believes that courts \nshould be more aggressive in their use of foreign law.\n  In this speech in April, Judge Sotomayor clearly indicated who she \nthinks has the better view of the issue, stating that she ``share[s] \nmore the ideas of Justice Ginsburg . . . in believing, that unless \nAmerican courts are more open to discussing the ideas raised by foreign \ncases, and by international cases, that we are going to lose influence \nin the world.''\n  Moreover, Judge Sotomayor talked approvingly about two recent Supreme \nCourt cases in which Justices did look to foreign law precisely to \ninterpret our Constitution. That is a very clear position. I think it \nis incorrect, but it is a clear one. Others adhere to it.\n  When she came before the Judiciary Committee, however, Judge \nSotomayor articulated a very different view of foreign law, stating:\n\n       Foreign law cannot be used as a holding or a precedent or \n     to bind or to influence the outcome of a legal decision \n     interpreting the Constitution or American law that doesn't \n     direct you to that law.\n\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\n\n  Well, that is quite a different position from the theme and \nstatements in her April speech.\n  So I agree with my colleagues who lamented Judge Sotomayor's tendency \nto avoid answering questions, with one colleague noting her ``extreme \ncaution'' in answering. I do not think many would dispute that she was \nless forthcoming than Judges Alito and Roberts, our latest \nconfirmations to the Court just a few years ago.\n  In addition to her stated judicial philosophy, I am also quite \nconcerned regarding how Judge Sotomayor has approached the most \nimportant constitutional cases that have come to her court. Most of the \ncases a court of appeals judge considers are routine, fact dominated, \nand do not offer novel questions or require substantial legal \ndiscussion. Still, a few important cases that present new and critical \nissues do periodically come before the courts of appeals. These cases \ncan give insight into how the nominee will handle the many such cases \nthat regularly come before the Supreme Court.\n  Within the last 3 years, Judge Sotomayor has heard three monumentally \nimportant cases at the circuit level: the constitutional right to be \nfree of racial discrimination, the right to keep and bear arms, and the \nfifth amendment right to keep one's own property.\n  In all three of these cases, Judge Sotomayor joined or authored very \nbrief opinions--very brief opinions, oddly brief opinions--that avoided \nthe kind of careful analysis we would expect of an appellate judge. In \nall three cases, individuals went to court with the plain text of the \nConstitution on their side. In each case, Judge Sotomayor reached \nconclusions that denied individual Americans their rights that they \nwere asserting against governmental power.\n  When confronted with an appeal based on fundamental notions of equal \nprotection of the laws, Judge Sotomayor, to be charitable, took a pass. \nBy now we are familiar with the basic facts of the New Haven \nfirefighters, the Ricci case. Eighteen firefighters brought suit \nagainst the city of New Haven after the city threw out the results of a \npromotional exam. It was thrown out because not enough of certain \nminorities did well enough on the exam. Judge Sotomayor's decision in \nthe case is troubling. Her curious one-paragraph summary order, and the \nSupreme Court's subsequent reversal, are the starting points. But there \nis more. And there is a reason that so much attention has been focused \non this case.\n  Her initial attempted disposal of the case by summary order was, \nquite simply, unacceptable and an embarrassment. A summary order is, by \ncircuit rule, only for cases in which there is no legal principle \nworthy of discussion. In the end, every Supreme Court Justice concluded \nshe applied the wrong legal standard in granting a judgment against the \nfirefighters and for the city before a trial occurred, and a majority \nof the Supreme Court found that the firefighters' case was so strong \nthat they were entitled to a verdict for their side on the evidence \nthat already existed without a trial.\n  The Supreme Court understood the importance of this case--why we care \nabout it as Americans. As they said of Judge Sotomayor's logic:\n\n       Allowing employers to violate the disparate-impact \n     liability would encourage race-based action at the slightest \n     hint of disparate impact. . . .That would amount to a de \n     facto quota system. . . .\n\n  That is the Supreme Court language.\n  I was struck by something one firefighter, Lieutenant Vargas, said to \nus--that his testimony before the Senate was the first opportunity he \nhad to tell his story because the district court threw out the case \nbefore he even had a trial. On appeal, Judge Sotomayor initially \ndismissed the case by summary order, meaning that a hard copy of her \norder was never even delivered to the other judges on the court. Had \none of her colleagues, Judge Cabranes, apparently, independently, not \nheard about the case and sought a full review--a rehearing en banc is \nwhat he sought through the whole Second Circuit--it is likely the \nSupreme Court would never have even known the case existed or \nconsidered the case. It is also likely Lieutenant Vargas would never \nhave had the opportunity to tell his story, to explain to his children \nhis profound hope that, as a result of his efforts, they would be \njudged on their merit and not on their race or their ethnicity.\n  In response to my questions, Judge Sotomayor also claimed that her \nRicci decision was controlled by ``established'' Supreme Court \nprecedent, saying ``a variety of different judges on the appellate \ncourt were looking at the case in light of established Supreme Court \nand Second Circuit precedent.'' But the Supreme Court did not see it \nthat way. The Supreme Court noted that ``few, if any, precedents in the \nCourt of Appeals'' discuss this issue.\n  As noted commentator Stuart Taylor has recently confirmed, even if \nJudge Sotomayor had believed her panel was bound by Second Circuit \nprecedent, review and rehearing by the whole Second Circuit would have \nprovided the opportunity to review those previous cases afresh and to \noverrule them if they were unsound. But Judge Sotomayor cast the \ndeciding vote against rehearing this case by the full circuit. She \ndefended her ruling and defended whatever authority existed at the time \nin the Second Circuit.\n  The case is also troubling to me because Judge Sotomayor had pledged \nto me during her confirmation, in 1997, that she would follow the \nSupreme Court's decision in Adarand--a well-known case--and subject any \npreference for one race over another race to the Court's established \nstandard of strict judicial scrutiny. When I asked her about this \npromise she had made, I, once again, found her answer to be dismaying. \nShe stated that the cases I asked about, the seminal equal protection \ncases--Adarand and so forth--``were not what was at issue in this \ndecision.'' She was talking about the Ricci case.\n  But that is not right. There were two very clear claims made by the \nfirefighters in this case--one based on a statutory right and one based \non the equal protection clause of the Constitution.\n  One need only look at----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair wants to advise the Senator that his \ninitial 30 minutes has been used, and so the Senator would be moving \ninto the next period of debate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we will discuss some of the other \ncases in more detail later. But one need only look at the papers filed \nin the district court and the court of appeals to see that the Adarand \nissue and the constitutional question were central issues in this \ncase. Look at Judge Cabranes' decision, where one of the first cases he \ncites is Adarand. One does not expect this type of mistake or a lack of \naccuracy from a Supreme Court nominee in a case of this importance, \nwhen she understands she will have to discuss before the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor repeatedly stated, including in her opening \nstatement, that litigants deserve explanations; that she looks into the \nfacts, delves into the record, and explains to litigants why she rules \nfor or against them. I have read the one-paragraph Ricci opinion. Judge \nSotomayor did not afford the firefighters the respect they deserved.\n  I have also considered very carefully Judge Sotomayor's views \nregarding the Second Amendment, and I am troubled by her record and not \nreassured by the answers she gave during the hearing.\n  In sum, she effectively held that the Second Amendment--the right to \nkeep and bear arms--does not bind the States, and that means any city \nor any State in America, if her opinion is upheld, can ban all guns in \nthose jurisdictions. If her opinion is not reversed, that is what will \nhappen in America. I would note the Supreme Court, in ruling on the \nHeller case, held clearly for the first time that the Second Amendment \nis an individual right that applied to the District of Columbia, which \neffectively banned firearms in the District of Columbia. They said that \nwas not constitutional, that the citizens of the District of Columbia \nhave a constitutional right to keep and bear arms and it cannot not be \neliminated.\n  So if the Sotomayor opinion is upheld, I can only say the Second \nAmendment might be viable in the District of Columbia but not in the \nother\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\ncities and States throughout the country.\n  With regard to the takings case, one of the most significant takings \ncases in recent years, she ruled against a private landowner who had \nhis property taken. He intended to build one kind of pharmacy on it. A \ndeveloper who was working with the city utilized the powers of the city \nto attempt to extort money from that individual so he could build \nanother private drugstore on that lot. When the owner refused, the city \ncondemned the man's property, gave it to the developer, who then built \nhis own kind of drugstore there. I believe this is in violation of the \nconstitutional protection that private property can only be taken for \npublic use.\n  So words have meaning. The Constitution and laws of the United States \nhave meaning. People come to courts to assert their rights under the \nConstitution and laws. In these three cases I have mentioned, the \nlitigants did not have their rights properly listened to nor protected, \nin my opinion. Is it because she would have preferred different results \nfrom the promotional exam for firefighters? Is it because she did not \nbelieve in the rights protected by the Second Amendment as set forth in \nthe Constitution? Is it because she favors redevelopment?\n  We are left to wonder because the cases were certainly not decided \nbased on the plain language of the Constitution, and she did not openly \nand thoroughly in any one of these cases engage in a serious discussion \nof issues raised. Each was just a page or two or three.\n  One of the most important tools of a judge is words. The meaning of \nwords is obviously where the power of our Constitution and laws is \nfound. When a judge feels empowered to redefine the meaning of words in \nour Constitution, they feel empowered to amend our Constitution. If \nthey don't like the death penalty, maybe they will call it \nunconstitutional. If they don't like the right to keep and bear arms, \nmaybe they will say the Second Amendment doesn't apply to States and \ncities.\n  In a recent speech before this nomination, Professor Allen C. Guelzo, \na two-time winner of the Lincoln Prize, wisely noted that a \nconstitutional system resides on a bedrock of shared assumptions. While \nit may seem to be a collection of laws and statutes, the most important \nthing is that ``those laws and statutes depend first on a reverence for \nwords, for reason, and for orderliness.''\n  He adds that ``reverence must grow . . . from the confidence that \nwords, reasons . . . really do protect'' the rights of citizens.\n  Citizens must know their rights, when clearly stated in the \nConstitution, will be steadfastly protected by the courts. It is here \nthat I have significant qualms. The ease by which the nominee \nreconciled or attempted to reconcile fundamentally different statements \nin speeches at our hearing evidences a lack of respect for the meaning \nof words. Her explanation of controversial decisions lacked clarity, a \nvery serious shortfall indeed for a Supreme Court Justice.\n  So I came to this process with an open mind regarding Judge \nSotomayor. She has many wonderful qualities, and I truly mean that. And \nI like her. She was ever graceful in her testimony. But certain aspects \nof her record troubled me--whether, for example, she has the kind of \ndeep commitment to the ideal of objectivity and impartiality that I \nbelieve necessary. I had hoped those concerns would be addressed \neffectively. Unfortunately, many of the answers did little to ease my \nconcerns but, instead, reinforced them and led to more unanswered \nquestions. Regrettably, I cannot support her nomination to a lifetime \nappointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, it should be no surprise that my \nviews are not those of the distinguished ranking member of our \nJudiciary Committee but somewhat different. I have served on this \ncommittee for over 16 years now. I have sat through the confirmation \nhearings of four Supreme Court Justices. I am very proud to say I \nbelieve the President made an excellent choice, and I enthusiastically \nsupport this nominee.\n  Judge Sotomayor is a warm and intelligent woman. More importantly, \nthough, she is a solid, tested, and mainstream Federal judge. Her \npersonal story is one of hard work. She has risen above all kinds of \nobstacles, and she has perseverance. She is a role model for women in \nthe law, and I cannot help but feel a sense of enormous pride in her \nachievements, her nomination, and, hopefully, before the end of the \nweek, her confirmation to be a Supreme Court Justice.\n  As I said at the confirmation hearings, a Supreme Court Justice \nshould possess at least five qualities.\n  One, broad and relevant experience. So how does she stand? You can't \nfind a nominee with better experience than Judge Sotomayor.\n  She has 29\\1/2\\ years of relevant legal experience, and she has seen \nthe law from all sides.\n  For 4\\1/2\\ years she was a prosecutor in New York City. She \nprosecuted murders, robberies, and child pornography cases as an \nassistant district attorney. She worked with law enforcement officers \nand victims of crime, and she sent criminals to jail.\n  We heard from the distinguished New York City District Attorney, Mr. \nMorgenthau, who said he looked for bright young people, and he found \nher and he heard her story and she had been to Princeton. She graduated \nsumma cum laude. She went to Yale Law School. She was editor of the Law \nReview.\n  She came to his attention, and he went to recruit her as a prosecutor \nin New York City. For 8 years after that, she practiced business law as \na litigator in a private firm. She worked on complex civil cases \ninvolving real estate law, banking law, contracts, and intellectual \nproperty law.\n  Then, she was appointed by George Herbert Walker Bush--as we might \nfondly say ``Bush 41''--as a U.S. district court judge for 6 years. She \nheard roughly 450 cases in the district court up close and personal, \nwhere litigants come before the judge and the judge gains a sense of \nwhat the Federal court means to an individual.\n\n  I think that is important to know on the Supreme Court. She saw there \nfirsthand the impact of the law on people before her.\n  Then she was appointed by President Clinton. For 11 years she has \nbeen a Federal appellate court judge on the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. She has been on the panel for more than 3,000 Federal appeals, \nand she has authored opinions in more than 600 cases. These 11 years \nwere rigorous and appropriate training ground for the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor will be the only sitting Justice with experience on \nboth the Federal trial and appellate courts, and she has more Federal \njudicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in the last 100 \nyears. That is a substantial qualification.\n  Secondly, a Supreme Court Justice should have deep knowledge of the \nlaw and the Constitution. I believe her broad experience gives her \nfirsthand knowledge of virtually every area of the law.\n  As a prosecutor she tried criminal cases--homicides, assaults, \npornography cases--those crimes that destroy lives.\n  As a business lawyer, she examined contracts, represented clients in \ncomplex civil litigation, and tried intellectual property disputes.\n  As a district court judge she presided over criminal and civil jury \ntrials; she sentenced defendants; she resolved complicated business \ndisputes; and she reached decisions in discrimination and civil tort \ncases where people had been unfairly treated, injured, or harmed.\n  Finally, as an appellate judge, she has grappled with the difficult \nand critical questions that arise when people disagree about what our \nConstitution and our Federal statutes mean today. So she certainly has \nample experience.\n  Third, a Supreme Court Justice should have impeccable judicial \ntemperament and integrity. Anyone who watched Judge Sotomayor at her \nconfirmation hearings has seen her temperament and demeanor firsthand. \nShe is warm, she is patient, and she is extremely intelligent. She sat \nat that table with a broken ankle up on a box hour after hour and day \nafter day in a hot room listening to members of the Judiciary Committee \npepper her with questions. Not at any time did she lose her presence, \nlose her cool, or show anger. She showed determination and\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\npatience and perseverance. I think that means a great deal.\n  At times, the hearings became quite heated, but she would remain calm \neven in the face of provocative questioning.\n  So I am not surprised the American Bar Association and the New York \nCity Bar Association gave her their highest rating.\n  As one of her Republican-appointed colleagues on the Second Circuit \nsaid: ``Sonia Sotomayor is a well-loved colleague on our court. \nEverybody from every point of view knows she is fair and decent in all \nher dealings. The fact is, she is truly a superior human being.''\n  What greater compliment could there be for a prospective Supreme \nCourt nominee?\n  After spending time with her during our one-on-one meeting and \nparticipating in her confirmation hearings, I agree. She is a walking, \ntalking example of the very best America can produce. She has overcome \nadversity. Here is a woman--a child--the product of a poor Puerto Rican \nfamily living in a housing project in New York. She is 8 years old, she \nfinds herself with juvenile diabetes. She is 9 years old, her father \ndies. She goes to school. She struggles with the language. She \novercomes it. She graduates from high school. She goes to Princeton. \nShe succeeds in every way, shape, and form, as I said, summa cum laude, \nand then on to Yale and a member of the Yale Law Review. She overcame \nadversity and she kept going.\n  She has given back to her country and her community, and she is now \non track to become the first Latina Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court \nand only the third woman ever appointed to that Court.\n  I not only will vote for her, I will do so with great pride.\n  Finally, a Supreme Court Justice should exhibit mainstream legal \nreasoning and a firm commitment to the law. I have heard people say \nthat they don't believe she will follow the law.\n  I sat in the room during those 4 days of hearings. There was never an \ninstance that I saw where she moved away from legal precedent and the \nlaw.\n  I have said before, and I say today, I am somewhat concerned about \nthe current Supreme Court. As I see it, conservative activists have \nsucceeded in moving our Court to the right of mainstream American \nthought.\n  In just the last 2 years, this has been abundantly clear. The \nJustices have disregarded precedent at an alarming rate, and they have \nrewritten the law in ways that make clear that they are not just \n``calling balls and strikes.''\n  In 2007, the Court held that a school district cannot consider race \nwhen it assigns students to schools--even to ensure any amount of \nracial diversity. This is Parents Involved in Community Schools v. \nSeattle School District, 551 U.S. 701, 2007.\n  It held that women who were paid less than men had to sue within 180 \ndays--even when they had no way of knowing they were paid less, or they \nlost their right to back pay. This is Lily Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co. Inc., 550 U.S. 618, 2007. The occupant of the chair is new \nto the Senate. One of the first things we did was pass the Lily \nLedbetter law to overcome that Supreme Court decision.\n  The Court held for the first time since 1911 that manufacturers could \nfix minimum prices for their products. This is Leegin Creative Leather \nProducts Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 2007.\n  It held that the Endangered Species Act did not apply to certain \nFederal actions--even though the Court, in 1978, said the Act had ``no \nexception.'' This is National Association of Home Builders v. Defenders \nof Wildlife, 551 U.S. 644, 2007.\n  And it held that Congress could pass a law restricting access to OB/\nGYN services for women without including an exception for when a \nwoman's health is at risk. This is Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, \n2007.\n  That last decision was not only dangerous to a woman's health, it is \nalso contrary to the Court's opinions in Roe, in 1973; in Ashcroft, in \n1983; in Casey and Thornburgh, both in 1992; in Carhart I in 2000; and \nin Ayotte, in 2006. So this Court of conservative activists cast aside \nprecedent and ``super-precedent'' to do essentially what they believe--\nnot to follow the precedent, which was simply thrust aside.\n  The Supreme Court's shift to the right and discarding of precedent is \nnot just an ivory tower issue either. These decisions have real-life \nimpact.\n  Last week, USA Today reported that older white men, 55 years or \nolder, are losing jobs at the highest rate since the Great Depression. \nThis is Dennis Cauchon, In this Recession, Older White Males See Jobs \nFade, USA Today, July 30, 2009.\n  This is troubling. We have a law--the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act--that is supposed to protect workers from being laid off \nbecause of their age. But 2 months ago, the Supreme Court changed the \nburden of proof under that law, making it harder for older workers to \nget protection when they are fired, demoted, or not given a job because \nof their age. This is Jack Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 129 \nS. Ct. 2343, 2009.\n  Let me be clear, in my view, after 16 years on this committee: The \nJustices on the Supreme Court are not umpires; they do not just call \nballs and strikes. And they are not computers. It matters who sits on \nour Supreme Court, and it matters whether they will respect precedent \nand follow the law.\n  Judge Sotomayor is a nominee with a 17-year record of following the \nlaw. She has faithfully applied the law to the facts in case after \ncase.\n  We have a research service called the Congressional Research Service. \nIt is a neutral, respected adjunct to what we do in the Senate and the \nHouse. It carries out significant research. They took a look at her \nrecord, examined it, and this is what they said:\n\n       Her decisions do not fall along any ideological spectrum. \n     The most consistent characteristic of her approach as an \n     appellate judge has been an adherence to the doctrine of \n     stare decisis--the upholding of past judicial precedents.\n\n  When her record is objectively researched by the number one objective \nresearch service we have, she has been found to abide by court \nprecedent. They have essentially said she is not an activist, she \nfollows legal precedent. When her confirmation hearing ended, even one \nSenator who is now voting against Judge Sotomayor said this:\n\n       I actually agree that your judicial record strikes me as \n     pretty much in the mainstream of judicial decisionmaking.\n\n  This is Senator John Cornyn, Confirmation Hearings for Judge Sonia \nSotomayor, July 16, 2009.\n  Judge Sotomayor's mainstream record, her respect for precedent, and \nher commitment to the law have earned her the support of groups that \ncut across party lines.\n  She has been endorsed by law enforcement groups, such as the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police; civil rights groups, \nsuch as the Leadership Conference for Civil Rights; business groups, \nsuch as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--yes, they have endorsed her; \nformer officials from both parties, including conservative lawyer \nKenneth Starr; and legal groups, such as the American Bar Association.\n  This is a nominee with a solid record, with more Federal judicial \nexperience than any nominee in a century, and with widespread support.\n  There are those who oppose her because of a line from a speech she \nmade--one line in 29\\1/2\\ years of legal experience.\n  Second, there are those who oppose her because of one case. It is the \nRicci case--the New Haven case involving firefighters. But Judge \nSotomayor was squarely in the mainstream in that case. She followed \nestablished precedent. That is what the district court said in an \nalmost 50-page opinion. This is Ricci v. DeStefano, 2006 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 73277, D. Conn. 2006, unpublished opinion. Her second circuit \npanel unanimously agreed. This is Ricci v. DeStefano, 530 F.3d 87, 2d \nCir. 2007.\n  At about the same time, in the U.S. District Court in Tennessee, a \njudge held that in a nearly identical situation, the Memphis Police \nDepartment could replace a promotional exam that it feared was \ndiscriminatory.\n  Last year, a three-judge circuit court panel on the Sixth Circuit--\nincluding one judge appointed by President George W. Bush--agreed. This \nis Oakley v. City of Memphis, No. 07-6274, 6th Cir. 2008, unpublished \nopinion. So there was agreement on the courts.\n  It is true that five Justices, in a 5-to-4 opinion on the Supreme \nCourt, disagreed, and their decision is now the\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\nlaw of the land. This is Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. 2658, 2009. I \nwas a mayor for 9 years of a difficult city going through a number of \naffirmative action cases. I can tell you that this ruling has placed \ncities in what Justice Souter called a ``damned if you do, damned if \nyou don't situation.''\n  I agree with that. If a city has to prove that it would lose in court \nbefore replacing a civil service exam it believes is discriminatory, \nthis jeopardizes virtually any exam they might choose.\n  Finally, and most important, there is the third point of opposition, \nand that is the National Rifle Association. The NRA actively opposes \nJudge Sotomayor. They say they are scoring her confirmation vote. They \nwill tell their members that any Senator who votes to confirm Judge \nSotomayor has voted against the NRA's priorities. So let's look at that \nfor a minute.\n  The NRA says Judge Sotomayor erred in the case of United States v. \nSanchez-Villar, a 2004 case. In this case, an illegal immigrant named \nJose Sanchez-Villar was caught dealing crack cocaine and carrying a gun \nin New York City. This is United States v. Sanchez-Villar, 99 Fed. \nAppx. 256, 2d Cir. 2004.\n  Those are the facts of the case. A jury convicted. On appeal, the \ndefendant argued, among other things, that to prohibit him from \ncarrying a gun in New York City violated the second amendment.\n  Judge Sotomayor and her colleagues unanimously rejected his argument \nand upheld the conviction. The NRA is apparently upset that Judge \nSotomayor and her colleagues did not agree with Mr. Sanchez-Villar's \nsecond amendment argument.\n  But in 2004, when this case was decided, the law had been clear for \n65 years. The Supreme Court had said in 1939 that the second amendment \nonly related to militia service and judges all across our country had \nfollowed that decision for decades. This is United States v. Miller, \n307 U.S. 174, 1939.\n  Would the NRA have preferred that Judge Sotomayor rule against 65 \nyears of settled law and hold that an undocumented drug dealer had a \nconstitutional right to carry a gun in New York City? Do you want that, \nMr. President? Do I want that in my State? The answer is absolutely no.\n  The NRA also says Senators should oppose Judge Sotomayor's nomination \nbecause of another case, Maloney v. Cuomo. This is Maloney v. Cuomo, \n554 F.3d 56, 2d Cir., 2009. There, Judge Sotomayor and her colleagues \nunanimously upheld a New York law banning a particular Japanese martial \narts weapon called nunchakus.\n  The unanimous decision said the second amendment limits only the \nFederal Government, not the States. Why would Judge Sotomayor and her \ncolleagues say that? Because it was binding Supreme Court law. Look at \nthe decisions:\n  In 1876, the Supreme Court held that the second amendment only \napplies to the Federal Government. That was United States v. \nCruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1876). It said it again in 1886, in Presser v. \nIllinois, 116 U.S. 252, 1886, and again, in 1984, in Miller v. Texas, \n153 U.S. 535, 1984.\n  The fourth circuit followed that law and said in 1995 that the second \namendment only applies to the Federal Government. That case was Love v. \nPepersack, 47 F.3d 522, 1995. The Sixth Circuit agreed in 1998, in \nPeople's Rights Organization v. City of Columbus, 152 F.3d 522, 1998. \nJudge Sotomayor's own court, the second circuit, agreed in 2005, in \nBach v. Pataki, 408 F.3d 75, 2005.\n  Then last year, Justice Scalia wrote in footnote 23 of the famous \nHeller opinion:\n\n       [Our] decisions in Presser v. Illinois and Miller v. Texas \n     reaffirmed that the Second Amendment only applies to the \n     Federal Government.\n\n  That case was District of Columbia v. Heller, 128 S.Ct. 2783, \n2008. Justice Scalia is not exactly a liberal Supreme Court Justice, \nand that is his view:\n\n       Presser v. Illinois and Miller v. Texas reaffirm that the \n     second amendment only applies to the Federal Government.\n\n  Finally, just 2 months ago, three Republican appointees on the \nSeventh Circuit agreed that the second amendment only applies to the \nFederal Government. They said anyone who doubts this need only read \nJustice Scalia's opinion. And that case was the National Rifle \nAssociation v. City of Chicago, 567 F.3d 856, 2009.\n  So once again Judge Sotomayor's decision was squarely in agreement \nwith court after court after court.\n  Some of my colleagues have said that the Ninth Circuit disagreed. It \nis true that three of its judges did. But last week, the full Ninth \nCircuit voted to review these three judges' decision and to rehear it \nas a full court en banc. And that case is Nordyke v. King, No. 07-\n15763, En Banc Order, Ninth Circuit, July 29, 2009.\n  The NRA tried its case before the Seventh Circuit and lost. They lost \nin front of three Republican-appointed judges.\n  Let me summarize. Judge Sonia Sotomayor has 29\\1/2\\ years of relevant \nlegal experience. She has a 17-year record of following the law. She \nhas experience, temperament, and knowledge. She will be, in my view, a \nfine Supreme Court Justice.\n  Supreme Court Justices do not merely call balls and strikes; they \nmake decisions that determine whether acts of Congress will stand or \nfall. They decide how far the law will go to protect the safety and \nrights of all of us. They have the power to limit or expand civil \nrights protections. They have great leeway to interpret the laws \nprotecting or limiting a woman's right to choose. And they can expand \nor limit child pornography laws and campaign finance laws and so many \nmore.\n  I believe Judge Sotomayor is an exceptional person who brings a rich \nbackground as a prosecutor, a business lawyer, a trial judge, and \nappellate court judge. And her 17-year record of judicial temperance \nshows she will faithfully apply the law. I cannot tell you how proud I \nwill be to vote to confirm her as an Associate Justice on the Supreme \nCourt. I sincerely hope that a dominant majority of my colleagues will \ndo the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in proud support of the \nconfirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. We are not only about to cast a \nvote this week that will make history, but we are about to stand \nwitness in some small way to the coming age of America.\n  The great Founders of this democracy built a nation on an idea and an \nideal. They devised the unique experiment in a new form of government \nbuilt on tolerance, equal rights, justice, and a constitution that \nprotected us from the mighty sword of tyranny. They forged a community \nfrom shared values, common principles, yet preserved the freedom of \nevery citizen to pursue happiness and reach for the stars no matter \ntheir position, no matter their circumstance at birth.\n  It was a revolutionary notion that in America one is not bound by his \nor her social or economic status; that if we work hard, reach further, \naim higher, everything--anything--is possible.\n  Unlike other nations united by common history, common language, and \ncommon culture, America prides itself on its motto: E pluribus unum--\nout of many, one. In our blind rush to one side of the political \nspectrum or the other, we too often forget those words. We too often \nforget that we are united in our differences in a vast melting pot \nforged from common values and an ideal of freedom that is the envy of \nthe world.\n  Today, as we prepare to confirm Judge Sotomayor, the full realization \nof that ideal is closer than it has ever been. I know it, I feel it, \nfor I have lived it. I stand here, someone who himself came from humble \nbeginnings, raised in a tenement building in a neighborhood in Union \nCity, NJ, a son of immigrants, first in my family to go to college, and \nnow in a nation of 300 million people, 1 of 100 Members of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I never dreamed growing up that one day I would have the distinct \nhonor to come to the floor of the Senate to rise in favor of the \nconfirmation of an eminently qualified Hispanic woman who grew up in \nthe Bronx across the river from the old tenement I lived at in Union \nCity. I never dreamed that as a U.S. Senator of Hispanic heritage, I \nwould have the privilege of standing in the well of this Chamber to \ncast a historic vote for the first Hispanic woman on the highest Court \nin the land. So for\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\nme personally, my vote for Judge Sonia Sotomayor will be a proud \nmoment, one I will always remember as a highlight of my time in the \nSenate.\n  When Judge Sotomayor takes her seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, \nAmerica will have come of age. We will need only to look at the \nportrait of the Justices of the new Supreme Court to see how far we \nhave come as a nation, who we really are as a people, what we stand \nfor, and what our Founders intended us to be. It will be a striking \nportrait--one of strength, diversity, spirit, and wisdom, the portrait \nof a nation united by common concerns, yet still too often divided by \ndeeply held individual beliefs.\n  There are those in this Chamber who, because of those deeply held \nbeliefs, will vote for Judge Sotomayor and those who will not, each for \ntheir own reasons, each in part because of who they are, where they \ngrew up, how their perspective has been uniquely shaped by their \nindividual circumstances and experiences. Their vote will be based on \ntheir own logic, their own reasoning, how they interpret the facts and \nthe testimony before them. Each of us will analyze and debate those \nfacts from our own perspective. We will hold to our own intellectual \npositions. We will disagree. Some will find fault with Judge \nSotomayor's choice of words. Some will interpret her statements and \nrulings differently than she may have clearly intended. Some will \nquestion her temperament, her judgment, the details of her decisions. \nBut in this debate and, ultimately, in the final analysis, none of us \ncan deny the role our experience will play in our decision. None of us \ncan deny our backgrounds, our upbringing, the seminal events that \nshaped our life. We cannot deny who we are. All we can ask of \nourselves--of any of us--is that wisdom, intelligence, reason, and \nlogic will always prevail in the decisions we make.\n  Those who would say a U.S. Senator or a Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt does not carry something with them from their experience are \nsimply out of touch with reality. But let us remember that who we are \nis not a measure of how we judge; it is merely the prism through which \nwe analyze the facts. The real test is how we think and what we do.\n  Let's be clear. Given the facts, given the evidence before us, Sonia \nSotomayor is one of the most qualified and exceptionally experienced \nnominees to come before the Senate. I am proud to stand in favor of her \nconfirmation, not because of where she came from, not because we share \na proud ethnicity, but because of Judge Sotomayor's experience and vast \nknowledge of the law. I am proud to stand in favor of her nomination \nnot because she is a Hispanic woman but because of her commitment to \nthe rule of law and her respect for the Constitution; not because of \nthe depth of her theoretical knowledge and respect for precedent but \nbecause of her practical experience fighting crime; not because of one \nstatement she may have made years ago outside the courtroom but because \nof a career-long, proven record of dedication to equal justice under \nlaw. Nothing--I repeat nothing--should be more important to any nominee \nthan a dedication to those simple words chiseled above the entrance to \nthe Supreme Court: ``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n\n  These are the reasons I am proud to stand in support of her \nconfirmation, and these are the reasons I believe Judge Sotomayor \nshould be unanimously confirmed by the Senate. But I know that will not \nbe the case. I know there will be few on the other side of the aisle \nwho will cast their vote in support of her. I know some of my \ncolleagues have suggested that Judge Sotomayor may not have the \njudicial temperament necessary to serve on the Supreme Court. To those \nSenators who get up and say that, I say watch the hearings again. Watch \nthem closely. Listen to what was asked, watch her responses, take note \nof the depth, the dignity, and clarity of her answers. Be aware of the \ndeference she showed every Senator on the committee, her tone, the \ntenor of her responses, her rebuttals, and then tell me she does not \nhave the proper judicial temperament.\n  I think most Americans who watched her, who listened to her, would \nrespectfully disagree. Most Americans do not care about one specific \nstatement out of hundreds of statements. They care about the person. \nThey care about the experience. They care about honor and decency and \ndignity and fairness. They care about who she is and what she has \naccomplished in her long judicial career. Put simply, they care about \nthe record, and the record is clear. It shows she has a deep and \nabiding respect for the Constitution. It shows that the leaders of \nprominent legal and law enforcement organizations who know her best, \nthose who have actually seen her work, say she is an exemplary, fair, \nand highly qualified judge. It shows a crime fighter who as a \nprosecutor put the ``Tarzan murderer'' behind bars. It shows a judge \nwho has upheld the convictions of drug dealers, sexual predators, and \nother violent criminals. And it highlights a deep and abiding respect \nfor the liberties and protections granted by the Constitution, \nincluding the first amendment rights of those with whom she strongly \ndisagrees.\n  Judge Sotomayor's credentials are impeccable. Set aside for a moment \nthe fact that she graduated at the top of her class at Princeton. Set \naside her tenure as editor of the Yale Law Review, her work for Robert \nMorgenthau in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, her successful \nprosecution of child abusers, murderers, and white-collar criminals. \nSet aside her courtroom experience and practical hands-on knowledge of \nall sides of the legal system. Even set aside her appointment by George \nH.W. Bush to the U.S. District Court in New York and her appointment by \nBill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals and the fact that she was \nconfirmed by both a Democratic majority Senate and a Republican \nmajority Senate, which alone tells this Senator, if she was qualified \nthen, she must be qualified now. Set all that aside, and you are still \nleft with someone who would bring more judicial experience to the \nSupreme Court than any Justice in the last 70 years, more Federal \njudicial experience than anyone nominated to the Court in the last \ncentury. Her record clearly shows that someone so experienced, so \nskilled, so committed, so focused on the details of the law can be an \nimpartial arbiter who follows the law and still has a deep and profound \nunderstanding of the effect her decisions will have on the day-to-day \nlives of everyday people.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues who plan to vote against this \nnominee, what speaks volumes about Judge Sotomayor's temperament, what \nspeaks volumes about her experience, what speaks volumes about her \nrecord is that the worst--the very worst--her opponents can accuse her \nof is an accident of geography that gave her the unique ability to see \nthe world from the street view, from the cheap seats. I know that view \nvery well. I grew up in it. I can tell you that certainly it gives you \na unique perspective on life. it engenders compassion. It engenders \npathos. It focuses a clear lens on the lives of those whose struggles \nare more profound than ours, and whose problems run far deeper. Yes, I \nknow that view well, and it remains with me today, and it will remain \nwith me all of my life.\n\n  I daresay there may be no greater vantage point from which to view \nthe world--to see the whole picture--than a tenement in Union City or a \nhousing project in the Bronx. Thomas Jefferson, in his first inaugural \naddress said:\n\n       I shall often go wrong through defect of judgment. When \n     right, I shall often be thought wrong by those whose \n     positions will not command a view of the whole ground.\n\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor surely commands a full, wide expansive view of \nthe whole ground. It is a strength, not a weakness. It is who she is, \nnot what she will do or how she will judge. It is the long view, and it \ngives her an edge where she may see what others cannot. And that is a \ngift that will benefit this Nation as a whole.\n  I ask my colleagues to take the long view and see what this \nnomination means in the course of this Nation's glorious history. For \nme, the ideal, the idea of America, the deep and abiding wisdom of our \nFounders, will have come of age when Judge Sonia Sotomayor raises her \nright hand, places her hand on the Bible, and takes the solemn oath of \noffice. With it, the portrait of the Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court \nwill more clearly reflect who we are as a nation, what we have become, \nand what we stand for as a\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\nfair, just, and hopeful people. Let that be our charge. Let that be our \nlegacy. Let someone who is committed to the Constitution, to the rule \nof law, to precedent--and who has exhibited that over a lifetime of \nwork--be our next Supreme Court Justice.\n  I am proud and honored to support the confirmation of Judge Sonia \nSotomayor as the next Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  And finally, numerous civil rights, Latino, and law enforcement \norganizations join me in supporting Judge Sotomayor's nomination. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of support from \nthe following organizations: Mexican American Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund, the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, the National \nPuerto Rican Coalition, the National Fraternal Order of Police, the \nNational Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, Federal \nHispanic Law Enforcement Officers Association, the United States \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, \nand the Fort Worth Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, to name a few.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund,\n                                    Los Angeles, CA, July 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions, \n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: On behalf \n     of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund \n     (MALDEF), I write to express our support for the confirmation \n     of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the United States Supreme Court. \n     Judge Sotomayor is an outstanding choice to replace retiring \n     Justice David Souter. She has an impeccable record of \n     accomplishment that is worthy of serving on the highest court \n     in the nation. She possesses all of the credentials and \n     experience that make her highly qualified to sit on the \n     Supreme Court. Significantly, she is one of the most \n     qualified candidates to be considered for Associate Justice \n     in recent history.\n       The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Judge \n     Sotomayor ``well qualified'' for the Court, its highest \n     rating. She has broad and bipartisan support. She has been \n     endorsed by eight national law enforcement groups. She has \n     the support of Former President Herbert Walker Bush and \n     former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n       Judge Sotomayor has extensive experience as a trial \n     attorney having worked in both the public and private \n     sectors. She was an Assistant District Attorney in New York \n     for five years where she tried dozens of criminal cases \n     including murders, robberies, police misconduct, and fraud. \n     Former New York District Attorney Robert Morgenthau described \n     her as a ``fearless and effective prosecutor.'' She was a \n     corporate litigator in private practice for eight years as a \n     partner at the law firm of Pavia & Harcourt where she handled \n     cases in real estate, employment, banking, contracts, and \n     intellectual property law.\n       She has served as a federal judge for 17 years. She was the \n     youngest judge appointed to the federal bench in the Southern \n     District of New York where she served for six years and heard \n     over 450 cases. She has been on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the Second Circuit--one of the most demanding circuits in the \n     country--for 11 years. As a federal appellate judge she has \n     participated in over 3000 panel decisions and authored \n     approximately 400 published decisions. She has handled \n     complex legal and constitutional matters. Her decisions are \n     faithful to both legal doctrines and factual details.\n       If confirmed, Judge Sotomayor would bring more federal \n     judicial experience to the Supreme Court than any justice in \n     100 years and more overall judicial experience than anyone \n     confirmed to the Court in the past 70 years. She also would \n     be the only Justice with experience as a trial judge.\n       Judge Sotomayor's educational accomplishments demonstrate \n     her strong work ethic and clarity of focus starting from a \n     young age. She graduated summa cum laude from Princeton \n     University and is a graduate of Yale Law School where she was \n     an Editor on the Law Review, a distinction reserved for only \n     the top law students.\n       Judge Sotomayor has a demonstrated commitment to the \n     community. She has been a lecturer at Columbia Law School and \n     an adjunct professor at NYU Law School. She served on the \n     board of the Development School for Youth whose mission is to \n     develop work skills for inner city young people. She has \n     served on the Boards of Directors of the New York Mortgage \n     Agency, the New York City Campaign Finance Board and the \n     Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n       The Latino community shares in the pride of the nation at \n     President Obama's nomination of this exceptional jurist. The \n     diversity she will add to the Court is a strength that will \n     enhance respect and dignity for the judicial system. MALDEF \n     respectfully requests the opportunity to testify in support \n     of Judge Sotomayor's confirmation.\n       Judge Sotomayor is an individual of exceptional talent, \n     experience and commitment to justice. We urge her swift \n     confirmation.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Henry L. Solano,\n     Interim President & General Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Hispanic Leadership Agenda \n     (NHLA), comprised of thirty-one of the leading national and \n     regional Hispanic civil rights and public policy \n     organizations, representing a diverse Latino community and \n     millions of members nationwide, would like to request a \n     meeting regarding the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to \n     become the next United States Supreme Court Justice. As \n     community advocates with a vested interest in serving the \n     public good, members of our coalition would like to meet with \n     you and discuss Judge Sotomayor's nomination. NHLA represents \n     a vast array of constituencies that include veterans, \n     academics, legal experts, labor activists, federal employees, \n     elected officials, medical professionals and members of the \n     media, among many other community leaders who unequivocally \n     support the nomination of Judge Sotomayor based on the merits \n     of her judicial record and overall experience.\n       The NHLA mission and objectives call for providing a \n     clearinghouse of information to the Hispanic community; \n     providing a unified voice on relevant issues; and providing a \n     much needed voice on legislative issues that have direct \n     implications for our members nationwide. The composition of \n     NHLA includes groups with Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, \n     and Cuban leadership, as well as the membership of countless \n     other Hispanic and Latin-American interests. The common \n     issues of education, civil rights, immigration, economic \n     empowerment, health, and government accountability transcend \n     ethnic origin and racial identity, as evidenced by the \n     breadth of these different groups. The Hispanic community is \n     larger and more diverse than ever, numbering close to 50 \n     million persons and making up over 16% of the combined \n     population of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United \n     States territories.\n       We look forward to your response as we would like to \n     schedule meetings for the week of June 15th-19th, Should you \n     have any questions, please contact Alma Morales Riojas, \n     Secretary/Treasurer of the National Hispanic Leadership \n     Agenda and President and CEO of MANA, A National Latina \n     Organization or James Albino, Director, Hispanic Federation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Dr. Gabriela D. Lemus,\n\n                                        Chair, Board of Directors,\n     National Hispanic Leadership Agenda.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   National Puerto\n\n\n                                        Rican Coalition, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U. S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: On behalf \n     of the National Puerto Rican Coalition Inc. (NPRC), \n     representing the interests of over 8 million U.S. citizens in \n     the states and Puerto Rico, I would like to express our full \n     and enthusiastic support for the confirmation of the \n     Honorable Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the United States Supreme \n     Court. Her personal and professional experiences make her \n     uniquely sensitive and qualified to address the concerns of \n     all Americans in our nation's highest court.\n       Judge Sotomayor's personal story of growing up as a \n     daughter of Puerto Rican parents in a Bronx housing project, \n     and eventually going on to study in Princeton and Yale, is an \n     authentic reflection of the power for motivated and talented \n     people in our society to overcome hardship and achieve \n     success. This experience allows her a profound sensitivity to \n     the challenging conditions of life which are the reality for \n     a significant portion of the U.S. population and will provide \n     her with a unique perspective on how to justly and equally \n     apply our nation's laws.\n       In her professional life Judge Sotomayor's legal career has \n     included not only criminal prosecution and commercial \n     litigation, but also academia and appointment to the federal \n     bench. For the past ten years, her intellect, integrity, and \n     consensus-building have made her a highly respected jurist on \n     the Second Circuit. This followed a distinguished career as a \n     federal trial judge, during which Judge Sotomayor's \n     pragmatism and resolve brought the national baseball strike \n     to an end that satisfied all parties. She then taught for \n     over nine years at the New York University School of Law and \n     at Columbia Law School and has been a mentor to hundreds of \n     attorneys and students as well as a member of the Puerto \n     Rican and the Hispanic National Bar Associations. This wealth \n     of experience has impressed upon her both the law's \n     potential, as well as its limits. Since her nomination was \n     announced she has\n\n[[Page S8741]]\n\n     received endorsements and praise from across the country.\n       As the Senate holds confirmation hearings, NPRC will be \n     watching carefully to ensure that the Senate treats Judge \n     Sotomayor fairly. Our organization firmly believes that Judge \n     Sotomayor is the best choice for our country's next Supreme \n     Court Justice. Therefore, NPRC will include her confirmation \n     vote as part of our NPRC Community Accountability Rating. I \n     hope and trust that you and your colleagues will \n     enthusiastically support her nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Rafael Fantauzzi,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           National Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jefferson B. Sessions III,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Sessions: I am writing on \n     behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to \n     advise you of our support for the nomination of Judge Sonia \n     M. Sotomayor to join the Supreme Court of the United States.\n       Following her graduation from Yale Law School, Judge \n     Sotomayor joined the District Attorney's office in Manhattan, \n     where she tried dozens, of cases during her tenure, including \n     winning a conviction of the ``Tarzan murderer''. She worked \n     closely with rank-and-file law enforcement officers during \n     her time as a prosecutor, and, was described by the legendary \n     Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau as a ``fearless \n     and effective prosecutor.''\n       After spending some time in private practice, Judge \n     Sotomayor returned to public service and was nominated by \n     President George H. W. Bush for a seat on the U.S. District \n     Court for the Southern District of New York. The Committee on \n     the Judiciary unanimously approved her nomination, and she \n     was confirmed in the Senate by unanimous consent. Upon \n     confirmation, Judge Sotomayor became the youngest sitting \n     judge in the Southern District of New York.\n       Her first high profile case involved a labor issue--\n     Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations \n     Committee, Inc. By issuing an injunction preventing the \n     owners from imposing a new collective bargaining agreement, \n     it can be argued that Judge Sotomayor helped save baseball, \n     and certainly baseball fans, from a long, drawn out labor \n     dispute.\n       In 1998, she was named to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     Second Circuit, one of the most demanding circuits in the \n     country, by President William J. Clinton. As an appellate \n     judge, she has participated in over 3000 panel decisions and \n     authored roughly 400 opinions, handling difficult issues of \n     constitutional law, complex procedural matters, and lawsuits \n     involving complicated business organizations. Over the course \n     of her career, she has demonstrated herself to be a sharp and \n     fact-driven jurist, analyzing each case on its merits and \n     weighing the facts before rendering any decision.\n       While her ruling in Ricci v. Destefano has been getting \n     most of the media attention, we would like to bring another \n     case to your attention, Pappas v. The City of New York, et \n     al. New York City Police Officer Thomas Pappas was fired for \n     distributing through the U.S. mail racially offensive \n     material from his home. While the Second Circuit upheld the \n     termination of Officer Pappas, Judge Sotomayor dissented \n     noting that his First Amendment rights took precedence \n     because he did not occupy a high-level supervisory, \n     confidential or policymaking role within the department.\n       In other cases which came before her, both civil and \n     criminal, Judge Sotomayor has often sided with law \n     enforcement officers acting in good faith by upholding \n     convictions on appeal. It is clear that she weighs the facts \n     in evidence and makes her rulings based on the merits of the \n     case. She is a model jurist--tough, fair-minded, and mindful \n     of the constitutionally protections afforded to all U.S. \n     citizens.\n       I believe that the President has made an excellent choice \n     in naming Judge Sonia S. Sotomayor to the Supreme Court of \n     the United States and, on behalf of the more than 327,000 \n     members of the Fraternal Order of Police, I am proud to \n     endorse her nomination. If I can be of any additional support \n     on this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me or \n     Executive Director Jim Pasco in my Washington, D.C. office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Organization of\n\n\n                             Black Law Enforcement Executives,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, June 8, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Sessions: The National Organization \n     of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE), an organization \n     of approximately 3,000 primarily African American law \n     enforcement CEOs and command level officials writes to \n     express its support for President Barack Obama's nomination \n     of U.S. District Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor as Associate \n     Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       It is critically important to NOBLE, that a Supreme Court \n     justice exercises the ability to interpret the Constitution \n     in a manner that respects the fundamental rights of all \n     people, and that is fair. Judge Sotomayor has credible \n     service; her transition from local prosecutor, to U.S. \n     District Court judge, to U.S. Appeals Court jurist has \n     afforded her the opportunity to experience the breadth of \n     criminal, civil and administrative law issues. The critical \n     issues involving the dialectical contradictions of inequities \n     and fairness across the spectrum of employment, education, \n     housing, the status of juvenile offenders and the enforcement \n     of law are of deep concern to us and are issues that we \n     believe she will be sensitive to.\n       Furthermore, as the cases before the Court become more \n     challenging, and with science and technology related issues \n     advancing at such a rapid pace, we believe that Judge \n     Sotomayor is imminently qualified to look at our 200-year-old \n     Constitution in a manner that is relevant to today's world. \n     It is interesting to note a recent White House Press Office \n     statistic, ``If confirmed, Sotomayor would bring more federal \n     judicial experience to the Supreme Court than any justice in \n     100 years, and more overall judicial experience than anyone \n     confirmed for the Court in the past 70 years''.\n       Law enforcement is a profession that is constantly evolving \n     and we believe that there is a seat among the top of that \n     criminal justice system for this great American. We trust \n     that the Senate will look at her character and act quickly on \n     her confirmation.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Joseph A. McMillan,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n         Federal Hispanic Law Enforcement Officers Association,\n                                         Tampa, FL, July 16, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Sessions, The Federal Hispanic Law \n     Enforcement Officers Association (FHLEOA) is pleased to join \n     the myriad of other law enforcement groups and associations \n     throughout our nation in support of the president's \n     nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to serve as associate \n     justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n       Judge Sotomayor's personal story, educational achievements, \n     prosecutorial history, and overall common sense approach and \n     commitment to the law and law enforcement are indeed \n     impressive. But more impressive is the fact that if \n     confirmed, she will bring more federal judicial experience to \n     our highest court than any justice in the last hundred years.\n       Her record as a public servant is simply outstanding, and \n     her court rulings are indicative of a clear understanding of \n     the law. We believe our nation will be well served with Judge \n     Sotomayor as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n       FHLEOA is proud to endorse the nomination of Judge \n     Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court and we look forward to \n     her quick confirmation by the Senate.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Sandalio Gonzalez,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            United States Hispanic\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the United States Hispanic \n     Chamber of Commerce (USHCC)--the national representative for \n     almost 3 million Hispanic-owned businesses--and the \n     undersigned organizations, we write to express our support \n     for the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as Associate \n     Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. In her \n     seventeen years of service to date as a federal trial and \n     appellate judge, and throughout the course of her entire \n     career, Judge Sotomayor has strongly distinguished herself \n     through her outstanding intellectual credentials and her deep \n     respect for the rule of law, establishing herself beyond \n     question as fully qualified and ready to serve on the U.S. \n     Supreme. Court.\n       Judge Sotomayor will be an impartial, thoughtful, and \n     highly-respected addition to the Court. Her unique personal \n     background is compelling, and will be both a tremendous asset \n     while serving on the Court and a historic inspiration to \n     others. Her legal career further demonstrates her \n     qualifications to serve in this position. After graduating \n     from Yale Law School, where she served as an editor for the \n     Yale Law Journal, Judge Sotomayor spent five years as a \n     criminal prosecutor in Manhattan. She then spent eight years \n     as a corporate litigator with the firm of Pavia and Harcourt, \n     where she gained expertise in a wide range of civil law areas \n     such as contracts and intellectual property. In 1992, on the \n     bipartisan recommendation of her home-state Senators, \n     President George H.W. Bush appointed her District Judge for \n     the Southern District of New York. In recognition of her \n     outstanding record as a trial judge, President Bill Clinton \n     elevated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1998.\n       During her long tenure on the federal judiciary, Judge \n     Sotomayor has participated in thousands of cases, and has \n     authored approximately 400 opinions at the appellate\n\n[[Page S8742]]\n\n     level. She has demonstrated a thorough understanding of a \n     wide range of highly complicated legal issues, and has a \n     strong reputation for deciding cases based upon the careful \n     application of the facts to the law. Her record and her \n     inspiring personal story indicate that she understands the \n     judiciary's role in protecting the rights of all Americans, \n     in ensuring equal justice, and respecting our Constitutional \n     values--all within the confines of the law. Moreover, her \n     well-reasoned and pragmatic approach to cases will allow \n     litigants to feel, regardless of the outcome, that they were \n     given a fair day in court.\n       Given her stellar record and her reputation for fairness, \n     Judge Sotomayor has garnered broad support across partisan \n     and ideological lines, earning glowing praise from colleagues \n     who know her best in the judiciary, law enforcement \n     community, academia, and the legal profession. Her Second \n     Circuit colleague (and also her former law professor) Judge \n     Guido Calabresi describes her as ``a marvelous, powerful, \n     profoundly decent person. Very popular on the court because \n     she listens, convinces and can be convinced--always by good \n     legal argument. She's changed my mind, not an insignificant \n     number of times.'' Judge Calabresi also discredited concerns \n     about Judge Sotomayor's bench manner, explaining that he \n     compared ``the substance and tone of her questions with those \n     of his male colleagues and his own questions. And I must say \n     I found no difference at all.'' Judge Sotomayor's colleague \n     Judge Roger Miner, speaking of her ideology, argued that ``I \n     don't think I'd go as far as to classify her in one camp or \n     another. I think she just deserves the classification of \n     outstanding judge.'' And New York District Attorney Robert \n     Morgenthau, her first employer out of law school, hailed her \n     for possessing ``the wisdom, intelligence, collegiality, and \n     good character needed to fill the position for which she has \n     been nominated.''\n       We urge you not to be swayed by the efforts of a small \n     number of ideological extremists to tarnish Judge Sotomayor's \n     outstanding reputation as a jurist. These efforts have \n     included blatant mischaracterizations of a handful of her \n     rulings, as well as efforts to smear her as a racist based \n     largely on one line in a speech that critics have taken out \n     of context from the rest of her remarks. The simple fact is \n     that after serving seventeen years on the federal judiciary \n     to date, she has not exhibited any credible evidence \n     whatsoever of having an ideological agenda, and certainly not \n     a racist one. We hope that your committee will strongly \n     reject the efforts at character assassination that have taken \n     place since her nomination.\n       In short, Judge Sotomayor has an incredibly compelling \n     personal story and a deep respect for the Constitution and \n     the rule of law. Her long and rich experiences as a \n     prosecutor, litigator, and judge match or even exceed those \n     of any of the Justices currently sitting on the Court. \n     Furthermore, she is fair-minded and ethical, and delivers \n     thoughtful rulings in cases based upon their merits. For \n     these reasons, the undersigned organizations strongly urge \n     you to swiftly confirm Judge Sotomayor to the Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n     ushcc\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Arizona Hispanic\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                                    June 29, 2009.\n     Hon.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Senator of the United States of America, Chairman, Committee \n         on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Subject: Judge Sonia Sotomayor confirmation recommendation.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The Fort Worth Hispanic Chamber of \n     Commerce's Board of Directors and membership are writing on \n     behalf of Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation as the next \n     United States Supreme Court Justice. We recommend your \n     committee's most favorable and highest recommendation \n     possible to the Senate in favor of her confirmation.\n       The Fort Worth Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, including \n     experienced federal and state court attorneys, have reviewed \n     Judge Sotomayor's education, experience and her opinions as a \n     jurist; it is our consensus she is eminently qualified, \n     talented and possesses the desire to be an excellent Supreme \n     Court justice. It is clear from an early age she has been \n     driven to excel; a 1976 Princeton University summa cum laude \n     graduate and a graduate of the Yale University School of Law. \n     While at Yale Law School, she was selected to serve as an \n     editor of the Yale Law Journal. Her legal experience includes \n     serving as a New York County Assistant District Attorney, and \n     partner with the law firm of Pavia & Harcourt focusing on \n     intellectual property, international litigation and complex \n     export trading cases. Judge Sotomayor has distinguished \n     herself as a U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern \n     District of New York and now as judge with the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n       Her proven record on a variety of topics, issues and legal \n     reasoning make her an excellent nomination. It is our firm \n     belief Judge Sotomayor will apply and interpret the legal \n     precedents under the law and will uphold the law with equal \n     justice. We highly endorse Judge Sotomayor's confirmation and \n     urge your vote of approval at your earliest convenience,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rosa Navejar,\n                                                    President/CEO.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am honored to join my distinguished \ncolleague from New Jersey here today on the Senate floor to speak in \nsupport of the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as the next \nAssociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I had the privilege to sit on the Judiciary Committee for her \nconfirmation hearing, and I join all of my committee colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle who have complimented Chairman Leahy for a very \nwell-run hearing. I was proud to vote for Judge Sotomayor in the \nJudiciary Committee, and I will be proud to vote for her confirmation \nhere on the Senate floor.\n  Judge Sotomayor's remarkable education and professional \nqualifications, her commitment to public service, her uncontroversial \n17-year record on the Federal bench--longer than any nominee in 100 \nyears--her responsiveness and patient judicial temperament at the \nhearing, all confirm to me her pledge that she will respect the role of \nCongress as representatives of the American people; that she will \ndecide cases based on the law and the facts before her; that she will \nnot prejudge any case but listen to every party that comes before her; \nand that she will respect precedent and limit herself to the issues \nthat the Court must decide; in short, that she will use the broad \ndiscretion of a Supreme Court Justice wisely.\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\n  I applaud those of my colleagues who have acknowledged that Judge \nSotomayor falls well within the mainstream of the American legal \nprofession. At the same time, it is disappointing that so few \nRepublican colleagues have been willing to recognize her clear \nqualifications for our highest Court. The nearly unanimous party-line \nopposition offered by Republicans in committee and here on the floor \nraises serious concerns whether some of my colleagues would ever be \nwilling to vote for anyone outside of the Federalist Society. To my \nRepublican colleagues in opposition, I ask: What Democratic nominee \nwould you vote for, if not Judge Sotomayor, with her vast experience, \nher commitment to the rule of law, proven indisputably over 17 years, \nher remarkable credentials, and her extraordinary moving American life \nstory?\n  Unfortunately, Judge Sotomayor seems to be walking proof that \nconservative political orthodoxy is now their confirmation test, masked \nas concerns about judicial activism. Many of my Republican colleagues \nunfairly ignore her long record to base criticisms on strained \ninterpretations of a few routine and appropriate circuit court opinions \nand a few remarks taken out of context. Those criticisms feel, quite \nfrankly, like the criticisms of someone who is determined to find fault \nwith a nominee.\n  Take, for example, the New Haven firefighters case. The per curiam \nopinion in Ricci was based on controlling second circuit and Supreme \nCourt precedent. The sixth circuit took the same approach in a similar \ncase arising in Memphis. The role of a circuit court is to follow \nexisting precedence of the Supreme Court and the circuit court. That is \nwhat the Ricci per curiam did. The Supreme Court may have reversed, but \nit did so 5 to 4 on the basis of an entirely new test it created. It is \nabsurd to call Judge Sotomayor an activist for following existing \nprecedent. If you want a judicially conservative opinion, the Ricci per \ncuriam is just that.\n  The decision in Maloney was also properly conservative in a judicial \nsense. It approaches with caution a newly minted and narrowly enacted \nconstitutional right whose extension to the States would upset \ngenerations of practice and experience by sovereign States regulating \nguns within their borders. A seventh circuit panel, with two very \nprominent conservative judges on it, correctly did exactly the same \nthing. A ninth circuit panel reached a different conclusion, and then \nthat decision was vacated by the circuit to reconsider that case en \nbanc.\n  Rather than engaging in a serious inquiry of Judge Sotomayor's \nfitness for the Supreme Court, many of my colleagues have made this \nnomination into a referendum on whether the newly minted right to bear \narms should be incorporated against the States for the first time in \nour Nation's history. This is doubly unfair. First, Judge Sotomayor \ncould not answer questions at her hearing that would suggest how she \nwould rule in later cases. That is inappropriate. Second, it is \ninappropriate to try to force on a judge a particular political view as \nthe price of admission to her judicial office.\n  Criticisms of a few stray lines in Judge Sotomayor's various speeches \nare equally perplexing. Judge Sotomayor's long and noncontroversial 17-\nyear judicial record should allay any concerns about those remarks, but \nso should the context of those speeches themselves. The ``wise Latina'' \ncomment we have heard so much about came in a speech that argued how \nimportant it is for judges to guard against bias and to be aware of \ntheir own prejudices. Is it not better and truer to admit that we all \nhave prejudices we must manage than to pretend that White males form \nsome sort of ideal cultural baseline that has no biases?\n  Senator Specter said it well at the committee vote. ``There is \nnothing wrong with a little ethnic pride and a desire to encourage her \nlaw student audience.'' Maybe we should try to put ourselves in their \nshoes. Perhaps, with a little empathy ourselves, it might be easier to \nunderstand how a profession and a judiciary dominated by White males \nmight look to those young law students, and how important a little \nencouragement to them might be that their experiences might give them \nsomething valuable to contribute; that they are not the exception; that \nthey are welcome and fully a part of our society, and that they bring \nsomething valuable not only to the profession but, one day, perhaps, \neven to the judiciary.\n  In sum, my Republican colleagues' criticisms of Judge Sotomayor \nappear to be grounded in conservative political idealogy rather than \nlegitimate concern that Judge Sotomayor is not fit to serve on the \nSupreme Court, grounded in a desire for more of the rightwing Justices \nwho in recent years have filled out a conservative wing on the Supreme \nCourt. That wing has marched the Court deliberately to the right in the \nlast few years, completely discrediting the Republican claim that \njudges are mere ``umpires.''\n  Jeffrey Toobin is a well-respected legal commentator, particularly \nfocusing on the Supreme Court. He has recently reported:\n\n       In every major case since he became the Nation's 17th Chief \n     Justice, Roberts has sided with the prosecution over the \n     defendant, the State over the condemned, the executive branch \n     over the legislative, and the corporate defendant over the \n     individual plaintiff. And is it a coincidence that this \n     pattern has served the interests and reflected the values of \n     the contemporary Republican Party?\n\n  Some coincidence. Some umpire.\n  The phrase ``liberal judicial activism'' is now conservative speak \nfor any outcome the far right dislikes. They did not use it when the \nconservative block of the Court announced, by the barest of a 5-to-4 \nmargin, an individual right to bear arms that had gone unnoticed by the \nSupreme Court for the first 220 years of its history. If that is not an \nactivist decision, the term has no meaning. It is just activism that \nconforms with a deliberate Republican strategy of many years duration \nto pack onto America's courts proven conservative judges who will \ndeliver the political goods they seek.\n  Setting aside all this politics, we should also never forget, never \noverlook the historic role that judges play in protecting the less \npowerful among us. We should always appreciate how a real-world \nunderstanding of the real-life impact of judicial decisions is a proper \nand necessary part of the process of judging.\n  Judge Sotomayor's wide experience, I hope, will bring her a sense of \nthe difficult circumstances faced by the less powerful among us--the \nwoman on the phone, shunted around the bank from voice mail to voice \nmail for hours as she tries to find someone to help her avoid \nforeclosure for her home; the family struggling to get by in the \nneighborhood where the police only come with raid jackets on; the \ncouple up late at night at the kitchen table after the kids are in bed \nsweating out how to make ends meet that month; or the man who believes \na little differently or looks a little different or thinks things \nshould be different. If Justice Sotomayor's wide experience gives her \nempathy for those people so that she gives them a full and fair hearing \nand seeks to understand the real-world impact of her decisions on them, \nshe will be doing nothing wrong--nothing wrong by the measure of \nhistory, nothing wrong by the measure of justice.\n\n  Experience, judgment, wise use of discretion, and a willingness to \nstand against oppression have always been the historic hallmarks of a \ngreat judge.\n  As to experience, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously explained:\n\n       The life of the law has not been logic: it has been \n     experience. The felt necessities of the time the prevalent \n     moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, \n     avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share \n     with their fellow-men have had a good deal more to do than \n     the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be \n     governed. The law embodies the story of a nation's \n     development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt \n     with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a \n     book of mathematics.\n\n  As to judgment, Justice John Paul Stevens has observed:\n\n       [T]he work of federal judges from the days of John Marshall \n     to the present, like the work of the English common-law \n     judges, sometimes requires the exercise of judgment--a \n     faculty that inevitably calls into play notions of justice, \n     fairness, and concern about the future impact of a decision.\n\n  As to discretion, Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote:\n\n       The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. \n     He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a knight-errant, \n     roaming at\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\n     will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness. He \n     is to draw his inspiration from consecrated principles. He is \n     not to yield to spasmodic sentiment, to vague and unregulated \n     benevolence. He is to exercise a discretion informed by \n     tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system, and \n     subordinated to ``the primordial necessity of order in the \n     social life.'' Wide enough in all conscience is the field of \n     discretion that remains.\n\n  And, as Alexander Hamilton explained in the Federalist Papers, courts \nwere designed to be our guardians against ``those ill humors, which the \narts of designing men, or the influence of particular conjunctures, \nsometimes disseminate among the people . . . and which . . . have a \ntendency . . . to occasion . . . serious oppressions of the minor party \nin the community.'' Those oppressions tend to fall on the poor and \nvoiceless. But as Hamilton noted, ``[c]onsiderate men, of every \ndescription ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or fortify that \ntemper in the courts: as no man can be sure that he may not be tomorrow \nthe victim of a spirit of injustice, by which he may be a gainer to-\nday.'' We should not discard the wisdom of centuries.\n  Experience, judgment, discretion, and protection from oppression--the \nstandard for judges of Hamilton, Holmes, Cardozo, and Stevens. History \nstands with them. And thoughtful people will note that empathy is a \ncommon thread through each of these characteristics.\n  Why might empathy matter? When might it make a difference? Take, for \nexample, the history of the Colfax massacre.\n  Go back to Sunday, April 13, 1873 when a gang of White men murdered \nmore than 60 Black freedmen in Colfax, LA. Some were burned in a \ncourthouse where they had taken refuge; others were shot as they fled \nthe burning courthouse; others were taken prisoner and then executed. \nU.S. Attorney James Roswell Beckwith determined to prosecute white \ncitizens involved in the Colfax Massacre--not a popular call in those \ndays. The case was tried before a U.S. District Judge William B. Woods, \nwho determined that rule of law should prevail in his district. \nPredictably, polite White society was outraged. It took notable human \nempathy in that place and time to see the massacre of the Black \nfreedmen as a crime, and to contemplate trying White men for the murder \nof Black men. The case was brought as one of the first applications of \nthe Federal Enforcement Act, implementing the Constitution's new 14th \namendment, so there was wide room for judicial discretion in that \nuncharted area of law--no ``balls and strikes'' here. District Judge \nWoods assured a fair trial, but he also was prepared to honor \nCongress's desire that outrages upon the Black community should be \npunished as crime. He had sufficient empathy with the widows and \nchildren of the slain freedmen to take seriously their need for \nvindication, and he had sufficient courage to face the scorn and anger \nof the White community.\n  Another judge was involved, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph P. \nBradley, who under the procedural rules of the time ``rode circuit'' \nfor Louisiana, and could sit in on trials. And sit in he did. He had no \nsympathy for the former slaves, and little regard for Congress's intent \nto punish the abuse of freedmen. Disagreeing from the trial court bench \nwith Judge Woods, Justice Bradley found repeated technical faults with \nthe indictments, took a restricted view of the authorities of the 14th \namendment, dismissed the charges, and released the defendants to flee, \non low bail, pending an appeal.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court upheld its colleague Bradley's opinions, \nthereby gutting the 14th amendment and the Enforcement Act for a \ngeneration, and a wave of murder and violence by Klansmen and White \nLeague members, emboldened by de facto immunity from prosecution, swept \nthe South. Reconstruction was vitiated in those weeks. Justice, for the \nmurder of a Black man by a White, departed the South for nearly a \ncentury.\n  History and the law ultimately proved district Judge Woods correct, \nbut how much turned on the character of two judges: one who had the \nempathy to see Black men as victims of crime, and the courage to \noutrage White opinion by allowing the trial of White community leaders, \nbefore a mixed jury no less; the other a judge who valued the status \nquo, and recoiled from any shock to proper White opinion and authority; \nindeed, who was the reflection of that proper opinion.\n  That is what we mean by empathy, and while the divisions in our \nsociety are less today, there are still people who feel voiceless, \nwhose voices a judge must be attuned to hear; there are still Americans \nwho come to court bearing disadvantages that have nothing to do with \nthe merits of their case. Empathy to look through those disadvantages \nto see the real merits of the case, even when it is unpopular or \noffends the power structure is the hallmark of a great judge. The words \nof Hamilton, Holmes, Stevens, and Cardozo I have quoted display it as \nhistory; the contrasting approaches of the two judges after the Colfax \nmassacre display it as justice.\n  My Republican colleagues' misunderstanding of judicial history has \nled to a missed opportunity for bipartisan support of a highly \nqualified and moderate judge who falls well within the mainstream of \nAmerican legal thought. We could be celebrating the first Latina \njustice of the Supreme Court as a great American achievement. Instead \nwe are having to defend basic principles of American history from \nassault from the right. I hope that, as the future looks back on this \nday, it will be the historic nature of this nomination that will be \nremembered, not the strange and strained efforts to impose right-wing \npolitical orthodoxy on the courts that defend our constitutional \nrights.\n  I look forward to Judge Sotomayor's service as an excellent Supreme \nCourt Justice. I will vote proudly for her confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter of support of Justice Sotomayor from New York City's mayor, \nMichael Bloomberg.\n  I also ask to have printed in the Record a letter of support for \nJudge Sotomayor from former FBI Director Louis Freeh.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             The City of New York,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                       New York, NY. July 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Sessions: As Mayor of the \n     largest city in the country and the place where Judge Sonia \n     Sotomayor has spent her career, I strongly support President \n     Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Sotomayor to serve as an \n     Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n       One of my responsibilities as Mayor is to appoint judges to \n     New York's Family and Criminal Courts, which gives me the \n     opportunity to assess the qualifications of many judicial \n     candidates. Over the past seven and half years, I have \n     interviewed candidates for more than 40 judicial seats and \n     have, like you, developed a strong sense of the qualities \n     that will strengthen our justice system. Based on this \n     experience, I have great confidence that Judge Sotomayor's \n     rulings demonstrate her knowledge of the law, objectivity, \n     fairness, and impartiality, which are essential qualities for \n     any judge. Just as important, she possesses the character, \n     temperament, intelligence, integrity, and independence to \n     serve on the nation's highest court, and her well-respected \n     record of interpreting the law and applying it to today's \n     world is perhaps the best indication of her exceptional \n     ability as a judge.\n       Judge Sotomayor's impressive 30-year career has given her \n     experience in nearly all areas of the law. As an Assistant \n     District Attorney in Manhattan, she earned a reputation as an \n     effective prosecutor. As a Judge in the Southern District of \n     New York, she established a record that amply supported her \n     appointment to the Second Circuit And in her current role as \n     a Judge in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, \n     she is admired for her knowledge and understanding of legal \n     doctrine, having taken part in over 3,000 panel decisions and \n     authored close to 400 opinions. In each role, she has served \n     the public with integrity and diligence.\n       Judge Sonia Sotomayor is an outstanding choice for the \n     United States Supreme Court, and I stand firmly behind her \n     candidacy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Michael R. Bloomberg,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n[[Page S8745]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan, LLP,\n\n                                                     July 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators: It is with tremendous pride in a former \n     colleague that I write to recommend wholeheartedly that you \n     confirm Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the \n     Supreme Court. Judge Sotomayor has the extensive experience \n     and the judicial qualities that make her eminently qualified \n     for this ultimate honor and I look forward to watching her \n     take her place on the Nation's highest Court.\n       I first met Judge Sotomayor in 1992 when she was appointed \n     to the United States District Court for the Southern District \n     of New York. As the then newest judge in the storied \n     Courthouse at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, we followed \n     the tradition of having the newly-minted judge mentored by \n     the last-arriving member of the bench. Despite the \n     questionable wisdom of this practice, I had the privilege of \n     serving as Judge Sotomayor's point of contact for orientation \n     and to help her get underway as she took on a full, complex \n     civil and criminal case docket.\n       A few weeks of ``New Judges School'' sponsored by the \n     Administrative Office of the Courts does not in any \n     meaningful way begin to prepare a new District Judge for the \n     unrelenting rigor of conferences, motions, hearings, \n     applications, trials and other miscellaneous duties--\n     including appeals from the Bankruptcy Court--which instantly \n     construct what often appears to be an overwhelming schedule \n     for a new judge. To make matters more challenging, when I was \n     a new judge the Court followed the tradition of allowing the \n     active judges to select a fixed number of their pending cases \n     for reassignment to the new arrival.\n       Into this very pressurized and unforgiving environment, \n     where a new judge's every word, decision, writing and \n     question is scrutinized and critiqued by one of the harshest, \n     professional audiences imaginable, Judge Sotomayor quickly \n     distinguished herself as a highly competent judge who was \n     open-minded, well-prepared, properly demanding of the lawyers \n     who came before her, fair, honest, diligent in following the \n     law, and with that rare and invaluable combination of legal \n     intellect and ``street smarts.''\n       As I spent a lot of time reading her opinions, observing \n     her in the courtroom conducting the busy, daily docket of a \n     trial judge, and discussing her cases and complex legal \n     issues, I was greatly impressed with how quickly she mastered \n     and employed the critical skills of her new position.\n       To me, there is no better measure by which to evaluate a \n     judge than the standards of the former Chief Judge of the \n     U.S. District Court of Minnesota and nationally renowned \n     American jurist, Edward J. Devitt. A former Member of \n     Congress and World War II Navy hero, Judge Devitt was \n     appointed to the federal bench by President Eisenhower and \n     became one of the country's leading trial judges and teacher \n     of judges. A standard Jury Instruction textbook (Devitt and \n     Blackmun) as well as the profession's most coveted award \n     recognizing outstanding judges, the Devitt Award, bears his \n     name.\n       I recently had the honor of participating in the dedication \n     of a courtroom named for Judge Devitt. The judges and lawyers \n     who spoke in tribute to Judge Devitt very ably and \n     insightfully described the critical characteristics which \n     define and predict great judges. But rather than discuss \n     Judge Devitt's many decisions, particular rulings or the \n     ``sound bite'' analyses which could have been parsed from the \n     thousands of complex and fact specific cases which crossed \n     his docket, they focused on those ultimately more profound \n     and priceless judicial qualities which ensure that Article \n     Three judges with lifetime tenure uphold the Rule of Law with \n     fairness, courage and justice for all.\n       Teaching hundreds of new American judges over several \n     decades, Judge Devitt liked to use a ``nutshell version'' for \n     emphasis and because he always got right to the heart of \n     things. So he offered three rules:\n       I. ``Judging takes more than mere intelligence;\n       2. Always take the bench prepared. Listen well to all \n     sides, stay open as you are listening and recognize any pre-\n     conceptions that you may bring to the matter. Then, make a \n     decision and never look back;\n       3. Call them as you see them.''\n       Sonia Sotomayor would have gotten an ``A plus'' from the \n     ``Judge from Central Casting,'' as Judge Devitt was often \n     called by his peers.\n       A great part of Judge Devitt's legacy is his famous ``Ten \n     Commandments to Guide the New Federal Judge,'' which he gave \n     me, and which I passed on to Judge Sotomayor:\n       1. ``Be Kind;\n       2. Be Patient;\n       3. Be Dignified;\n       4. Don't Take Yourself Too Seriously;\n       5. Remember That a Lazy Judge Is a Poor One;\n       6. Don't Be Dismayed When Reversed;\n       7. Remember There Are No Unimportant Cases;\n       8. Don't Impose Long Sentences;\n       9. Don't Forget Your Common Sense; and\n       10. Pray For Divine Guidance.''\n       In my brief role as Judge Sotomayor's ``second seat'' on \n     the Southern District trial bench, I probably spent more time \n     with her in those first months than any other member of our \n     great Court. And I was delighted to observe and conclude that \n     she exhibited all the desired characteristics that Judge \n     Devitt prescribed for his ``students.''\n       Since 1992 I have followed Judge Sotomayor's career on the \n     bench both as a trial judge and later as a member of our \n     Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Along with my former \n     colleague judges and lawyers, we have seen her grow and \n     mature into a truly outstanding judge, who embodies all of \n     Judge Devitts's wise counsel and the most prized \n     characteristics of judicial courage, integrity, intelligence \n     and fair adjudication of the Rule of Law.\n       Judge Sotomayor's early demonstration of judicial \n     restraint, appropriate deference to the other two Branches of \n     government and her fidelity to upholding the rule of law can \n     perhaps best be seen in a 1998 case. Sitting as a District \n     Judge, she carefully heard a minimum wage lawsuit and, in \n     recognition of the limits of judicial power, she relied on \n     the statutory text and precedent to reach her decision: ``The \n     question of whether such a program should be exempted from \n     the minimum wage laws is a policy decision either Congress or \n     the Executive Branch should make.''\n       Judge Sotomayor will bring great legal as well as judicial \n     experience to the Supreme Court and will serve there with \n     distinction in the fine tradition of Judge Devitt. As the \n     only ``trial judge'' on the current Court, she will import an \n     immense wealth of experience which comes uniquely from judges \n     who preside over cases with witnesses, juries, real time \n     procedural and evidence rulings and the challenging (and \n     unpredictable) dynamics of a trial courtroom. It will also be \n     a very valuable asset for the Court to have a former criminal \n     prosecutor (it has only one now) who was widely respected by \n     judges, defense attorneys and law enforcement officers.\n       Most importantly, Judge Sotomayor will continue to \n     exemplify the ``Devitt Rules'' we want all our judges to \n     follow, and the courage, integrity and experience required to \n     protect the Rule of Law. The efforts by some to discredit the \n     Judge are far afield from the eminent jurist whom I know, and \n     I hope that no Senator will be misled or motivated by \n     partisan rancor to vote against someone who so fully fits the \n     measure of what we should want in a Supreme Court justice. I \n     hope you will consider her nomination expeditiously so she is \n     confirmed and prepared to participate in the Court's first \n     session on September 9, 2009.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Louis J. Freeh.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I enjoyed my colleague's remarks. I don't \nagree with him, but he is certainly a great colleague and we appreciate \nhim.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I cannot support the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court. I do so with regret because the prospect of a woman of \nPuerto Rican heritage serving on the Supreme Court says a lot about \nAmerica. Judge Sotomayor has achieved academic and professional \nsuccess, and I applaud her public service. But in the end, her record \ncreates too many conflicts with fundamental principles about the \njudiciary in which I deeply believe.\n  It did not have to be this way. President Obama could have taken a \nvery positive step for our country by choosing a Hispanic nominee whom \nall Senators could support. President Obama could have done so and I \nregret that he did not.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senators Leahy and Sessions, for conducting a fair \nand thorough confirmation hearing. Judge Sotomayor herself said that \nthe hearing was as gracious and fair as she could have asked for.\n  I evaluate judicial nominees by focusing on qualifications, which \ninclude not only legal experience but, more importantly, judicial \nphilosophy. Judge Sotomayor's approach to judging is more important to \nme than her resume. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord following my remarks an article that I published earlier this \nyear in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy. It is titled ``The \nConstitution as the Playbook for Judicial Selection'' and explains more \nfully the principles I will mention here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. HATCH. President Obama has described the kind of judge he intends \nto appoint. As a Senator, he said that judges decide cases based on \ntheir ``deepest values . . . core concerns . . . broader perspectives . \n. . and the depth and breadth of [their] empathy.'' As a presidential \ncandidate, he pledged to\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\nappoint judges who indeed have empathy for certain groups. And as \nPresident, he has said that a judge's personal empathy is an essential \ningredient in judicial decisions.\n  This standard is seriously out of sync with mainstream America. By \nmore than 3 to 1 Americans believe that judges should decide cases \nbased on the law as written, rather than on their own sense of fairness \nor justice. The American people reject President Obama's standard for \nthe kind of judge we need on the Federal bench.\n  At the Judiciary Committee hearing, Judge Sotomayor said that her \njudicial philosophy is simply fidelity to the law. While some of my \nDemocratic committee colleagues said that they wanted to avoid slogans, \ncodewords, and euphemistic phrases, they apparently accepted this one \nat face value. Unfortunately, it begs rather than answers the important \nquestions.\n  Some Senators on the other side of the aisle try to confine concerns \nabout Judge Sotomayor's record to a single case and a single phrase. \nThat political spin, I will admit, makes for a quotable sound-bite. But \neven a casual observer of this process knows that this political spin \nis simply not true.\n  Ironically, those who would narrowly characterize the case against \nconfirmation want us to confine our examination of Judge Sotomayor's \nrecord only to her cases while ignoring her speeches and articles. A \npartial review, however, cannot provide a complete picture. Appeals \ncourt decisions that are bound by Supreme Court precedent are not the \nsame as Supreme Court decisions freed from such constraints. Taking \nJudge Sotomayor's entire record seriously not only gives us more of the \ninformation we need, but also gives her the respect she deserves.\n  Debates over judicial nominations are debates over judicial power, \nand America's founders gave us solid guidance about the proper role of \njudges in our system of government. Judges interpret and apply written \nlaw to decide cases. While judges cannot change the words of our laws, \nthey can still control statutes and the Constitution by controlling the \nmeaning of those words. That would result in the rule of judges, not \nthe rule of law. To borrow Judge Sotomayor's phrase, judges would not \nhave fidelity to the law, but fidelity to themselves.\n  In September 2001, Judge Sotomayor introduced Justice Antonin Scalia \nwhen he spoke at Hofstra Law School. She repeated a legend about \nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes and Judge Learned Hand. Like Judge \nSotomayor, Judge Hand served on both the Southern District of New York \nand the Second Circuit. As they departed after having lunch, Judge Hand \ncalled out: Do justice, sir, do justice. Justice Holmes replied: That \nis not my job, my job is to apply the law.\n  Is it a judge's role to do justice or to apply the law? President \nObama says that a judge's personal empathy is an essential ingredient \nfor doing justice. At the hearing on Judge Sotomayor's nomination, one \nof my Democratic colleagues invoked what he called ``America's common \nlaw inheritance'' to describe Federal judges with broad discretion to \ndecide cases based on their personal notions of justice or fairness.\n  That may be the judiciary some of my colleagues would prefer, but it \nis not the judiciary America's Founders gave us. Federal judges are not \ncommon-law judges. They may not decide cases based on subjective \nfeelings they find inside themselves, but only on objective law they \nfind outside themselves. Thankfully, the American people overwhelmingly \nsay today what America's Founders said, that judges must follow the law \nrather than their personal empathy to decide cases.\n\n  The question is which kind of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor \nwill be. In one speech that she gave several times over nearly a decade \nwhile she was on the bench, she spoke directly about how judges should \napproach deciding cases. In this speech, she said that factors such as \nrace and gender affect how judges decide cases and, as she put it, \n``the facts I choose to see.'' She embraced the notion that there is no \nobjectivity or neutrality in judging, and that impartiality is merely \nan aspiration which judges probably cannot achieve, and perhaps should \nnot even attempt. She said that judges must decide when their personal \nsympathies and prejudices are appropriate in deciding cases.\n  Judge Sotomayor and her advocates have tried unsuccessfully to blunt \nthis speech's more controversial edges. Their claim that she used the \nspeech solely to inspire young lawyers or law students, even if true, \nis irrelevant because the speech is controversial for its content, not \nits audience.\n  My concern only grew after discussing this speech with Judge \nSotomayor during the hearing. Rather than adequately defend or disavow \nthese views, she presented a different, and contradictory, picture. I \nam not the only one who noticed. The Washington Post editorialized that \nJudge Sotomayor's attempts to explain away or distance herself from \npast statements ``were unconvincing and at times uncomfortably close to \ndisingenuous, especially when she argued that her reason for raising \nquestions about gender or race was to warn against injecting personal \nbiases into the judicial process. Her repeated and lengthy speeches on \nthe matter do not support that interpretation.''\n  In another speech just a few months ago, Judge Sotomayor addressed \nwhether judges may use foreign law to interpret and apply American law \nin deciding cases. The distinguished ranking member of the committee \nmentioned this as well. She said that foreign law ``will be very \nimportant in the discussion of how we think about the unsettled issues \nin our own legal system.'' She endorsed the idea that judges may, as \nthey interpret American law, consider anything, from any source, that \nthey find persuasive.\n  Once again, Senators discussed this issue with Judge Sotomayor at her \nhearing. And once again, she neither defended nor disavowed these \ncontroversial statements but presented a different, contradictory \npicture. In her speech, she hoped that judges would continue to consult \nwhat others have said, including foreign law, to ``interpret our law in \nthe best way we can.'' But in the hearing, she said that ``I will not \nuse foreign law, to interpret the Constitution or American statutes.'' \nIn her speech, she said that judges may use ideas from any source that \nthey find persuasive. But in the hearing, she said that foreign law \ncannot be used to influence a legal decision. These different versions \nare clearly at odds with each other.\n  Judge Sotomayor took a different tack in answering post-hearing \nquestions. She said that decisions of foreign courts may not serve as \n``binding or controlling precedent'' in deciding cases. The issue, \nhowever, is not whether a decision by the Supreme Court of France \nliterally binds the Supreme Court of the United States. Of course it \ndoes not. The issue is whether that foreign decision may influence our \nSupreme Court in determining what our statutes and the Constitution \nmean. And in her answers to post-hearing questions, Judge Sotomayor \nonce again said that decisions of foreign courts can indeed be ``a \nsource of ideas informing our understanding of our own constitutional \nrights.''\n  In these speeches, Judge Sotomayor described how such things as race, \ngender, life experience, personal sympathies, or prejudices affect \njudges and their decisions. That is certainly possible. But I waited \nfor her to say that judges have an obligation to eliminate the \ninfluence of these factors. I wanted her to say that because these \nthings undermine a judge's impartiality, judges must be vigilant to \nprevent their influence. That would have given me more solace about \nwhat Judge Sotomayor's phrase, fidelity to the law, really means. But \nshe never said it. Instead, she endorsed the notion that judges may \nlook either inside themselves to their empathy, or outside to foreign \nlaw, for ideas and notions to guide their decisions.\n  Turning to her cases, the Supreme Court has disagreed with Judge \nSotomayor in nine of the ten cases it has reviewed, three of them in \nthe most recent Supreme Court term alone. That is nine of her ten cases \nthey reviewed. And these were not close decisions, either. The total \nvote in the cases reversing Judge Sotomayor was a lopsided 52-19.\n  In one case, Judge Sotomayor had held that the Environmental \nProtection Agency could not consider cost-benefit analysis when \nadopting a regulation. The Supreme Court reversed\n\n[[Page S8747]]\n\nher, citing its own precedents extending back more than 30 years and \nholding that the EPA's use of cost-benefit analysis was well within the \nbounds of its statutory authority.\n  In another case, Judge Sotomayor had reopened part of a bankruptcy \nproceeding that had closed more than 20 years ago to resurrect a tort \nsuit. Justice Souter, whom Judge Sotomayor would replace, wrote the \nopinion for the Supreme Court's 7-2 decision reversing her.\n  In another case, Judge Sotomayor declared unconstitutional a State \nlaw providing for political party election of judges because she felt \nthe law did not give people what she called a ``fair shot.'' The \nSupreme Court unanimously reversed her, saying that traditional \nelectoral practice ``gives no hint of even the existence, much less the \ncontent,'' of the fair-shot standard Judge Sotomayor had invented.\n  In one case, the Supreme Court affirmed Judge Sotomayor's result but \nrejected her reasoning because her reading of the relevant statute \n``flies in the face of the statutory language.''\n  And in the one case where the Supreme Court affirmed both Judge \nSotomayor's result and reasoning, it did so by the slimmest 5-4 margin. \nThis is a very shaky record on appeal.\n  The Ricci v. DeStefano case, which has been mentioned quite a lot \naround here, is one of the cases in which the Supreme Court reversed \nJudge Sotomayor. The Court reversed her result by a 5-4 vote but \nunanimously rejected her reasoning. In this case, Judge Sotomayor \naffirmed the city of New Haven's decision to throw out the results of a \nfairly designed and administered firefighter promotion exam because too \nfew racial minorities passed it.\n  This case presents troubling questions of both process and substance. \nJudge Sotomayor initially used a summary order that did not have to be \ncirculated to the full Second Circuit. That bothered me a great deal, \nbecause judges know when they issue a summary order, the rest of the \njudges are not going to see it. She then converted it to a per curiam \nopinion that is permissible only when the law is entirely settled. The \nsummary order and the per curiam opinion were each a mere single \nparagraph and neither appears to be an appropriate vehicle for deciding \nthis challenging case.\n  On the merits, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits two \nkinds of discrimination. It prohibits disparate treatment, which is \nintentional, and disparate impact, which may be unintentional. \nDisparate treatment focuses on the motivation of an employment \ndecision, while disparate impact focuses on its effect. While \ndiscrimination cases typically involve one or the other, the Ricci case \ninvolved both. In this case, the city claimed it had to engage in \ndisparate treatment of those who passed the promotion exam because it \nfeared a disparate impact lawsuit by those who failed the exam.\n  I point out that this case involved both disparate treatment and \ndisparate impact because Judge Sotomayor and her advocates claim that \nher decision was based squarely on settled and longstanding Second \nCircuit and Supreme Court precedent. We have heard some of that here on \nthe floor tonight. Contrary to her statement to me at the hearing, \nhowever, her one-paragraph opinion cited no precedent at all. The only \ncase she cited was the district court opinion in that very case. But \nthe district court actually acknowledged that this case was the \nopposite of the norm. Rather than those failing an employment test \nchallenging the use of the results, in this case those who passed the \ntest challenged the refusal to use the results. None of the precedents \ncited by the district court involved this kind of case.\n  For this reason, six of Judge Sotomayor's Second Circuit colleagues \nbelieved that the full circuit should have reviewed her decision, \narguing that the case raised important questions of first impression in \nthe Second Circuit and the entire Nation. When it reversed Judge \nSotomayor, the Supreme Court similarly observed that there were few, if \nany, precedents in any court even discussing the issue in this case.\n  In a column published today in National Journal, the respected legal \nanalyst Stuart Taylor carefully analyzed whether Judge Sotomayor's \ndecision in Ricci was indeed compelled by precedent. We have all read \nStuart Taylor over the years. He is one of the most prescient \ncommentators and journalists with regard to the law. He concludes: \n``The bottom line is that Circuit precedents did not make Sotomayor \nrule as she did. Supreme Court precedent favored the firefighters. \nSotomayor's ruling was her own.'' I ask unanimous consent that Mr. \nTaylor's column appear in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. HATCH. In addition to claiming that her decision in Ricci was \ngrounded in either Second Circuit or Supreme Court precedent, Judge \nSotomayor offered at the hearing that the Sixth Circuit had addressed a \nsimilar issue in the same way. I can only assume she did so to imply \nthat if the Sixth Circuit independently came to the same conclusion in \na parallel case, then it would be difficult to say that Judge \nSotomayor's decision in Ricci is controversial.\n  I would first note that in Oakley v. City of Memphis, the Sixth \nCircuit actually analyzed the case, applied the law to the facts, and \nissued a real opinion. I wish Judge Sotomayor had done that in her \ncase. But more importantly, Judge Sotomayor failed to mention that the \nSixth Circuit case was issued 3 months after hers and, in fact, relied \nupon her decision as persuasive authority. That is no evidence that her \ndecision was procedurally or substantively sound.\n  Neither are her decisions on the Second Amendment right to keep and \nbear arms. Last year, in District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme \nCourt clearly identified the proper analysis for deciding whether the \nSecond Amendment binds States as well as the Federal Government. \nSeveral months later, Judge Sotomayor ignored that directive and clung \nto her previous insistence, following a different analysis the Supreme \nCourt had discarded, that the right to bear arms does not apply to the \nStates. She also held that the right to bear arms is so insignificant \nthat virtually any conceivable reason is sufficient to justify a \nweapons restriction.\n  When I asked her about these decisions at the hearing, she refused to \nacknowledge that the Supreme Court's so-called rational basis test is \nits most permissive legal standard. Yet this is practically a self-\nevident truth in the law, one that Judge Sotomayor herself cited and \napplied just last fall to uphold a weapons restriction in Maloney v. \nCuomo.\n  She likewise gave short shrift to the fundamental right to private \nproperty. In Didden v. Village of Port Chester, Judge Sotomayor \naffirmed dismissal of a property owner's lawsuit after the village \ncondemned his property and gave it to a developer. The Supreme Court, \nincorrectly in my view, had previously held in Kelo v. City of New \nLondon that economic development can constitute the public use for \nwhich the Fifth Amendment allows the taking of private property. In \nDidden, however, the village had only announced a general plan for \neconomic development. No taking of anyone's property had occurred. Mr. \nDidden sued only after the village actually took his property.\n\n  In yet another cursory opinion that for some reason took more than a \nyear to produce, Judge Sotomayor denied Mr. Didden even a chance to \nargue his case. She said that the 3-year period for filing suit began \nnot when the village actually took his property, but when the village \nearlier had merely announced its general development plan. In other \nwords, Mr. Didden should have sued over the taking of his property \nbefore his property had been taken. But had he done so then, he would \ncertainly have been denied his day in court because his legal rights \nhad not yet been violated. This catch-22 amounts to a case of dismissed \nif he did, and dismissed if he did not. Once again, Judge Sotomayor \ngave inadequate protection to a fundamental constitutional right.\n  In another effort to blunt the impact of such controversial \ndecisions, Judge Sotomayor's supporters attempt to portray her as \nmoderate by observing that on the Second Circuit, she agreed with \nRepublican-appointed colleagues 95 percent of the time. On the one \nhand, this is one of several misguided attempts to defend her by \nsuggesting that a calculator is all it takes properly to evaluate a \njudicial record. On\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\nthe other hand, however, this claim comes from the same Democratic \nSenators who voted against Justice Samuel Alito just a few years ago. \nOn the Third Circuit, he had agreed with his Democratic-appointed \ncolleagues 99 percent of the time over a much longer tenure. It shows \nhow specious some of the arguments are.\n  Let me return to where I began. I believe that Judge Sotomayor is a \ngood person. I respect her achievements and applaud her service to her \ncommunity, the judiciary, and the country. While appointment of the \nfirst Puerto Rican Justice says a lot about America, however, I believe \nthat appointing a Justice with her judicial philosophy says the wrong \nthing about the power and role of judges in our system of government.\n  A nominee's approach to judging is more important than her resume, \nespecially on the Supreme Court where Justices operate with the fewest \nconstraints. Judge Sotomayor has expressed particular admiration for \nJustice Benjamin Cardozo. His book on the judicial process contains a \nchapter titled ``The Judge as a Legislator'' in which he compares \njudges to legislators who decide difficult cases on the basis of \npersonal reflections and life considerations. That sounds very much \nlike President Obama's appointment standard and Judge Sotomayor's \nexpressed judicial philosophy. I believe it is inconsistent with the \nlimited role that America's founders prescribed for judges in our \nsystem of government.\n  My colleagues know that I take a generous approach to the \nconfirmation process and I believe some deference to the President of \nthe United States and his choice is appropriate. I have rarely voted \nagainst any judicial nominee and took very seriously the question of \nwhether to do so now. To that end, I studied her speeches, articles, \nand cases. I spoke with experts and advocates from different \nperspectives. I participated in all three question rounds during the \nJudiciary Committee hearing.\n  But in the end, neither general deference to the President nor a \nspecific desire to support a Hispanic nominee could overcome the \nserious conflicts between Judge Sotomayor's record and the principles \nabout the judiciary and liberty in which I deeply believe.\n  I was the one who started the Republican Senatorial Hispanic Task \nForce and ran it for many years, bringing Democrats, Independents, and \nRepublicans together in the best interest of the Hispanic community to \ntry to give them more of a voice. I feel pretty deeply about Hispanic \npeople, as I do all people.\n  I just want everybody to know that this took a lot of consideration \non my part to come to the conclusion I have. I wish President Obama had \ntaken a different course, but this is the decision I have to make in \nthis case. As I say, I like Judge Sotomayor. I particularly like her \nlife story and her wonderful family. I did not want to vote against her \nbut I think I have explained here some of the serious concerns I have.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n        The Constitution as the Playbook for Judicial Selection\n\n                            Orrin G. Hatch*\n\n       The Federalist Society plays an indispensable role in \n     educating our fellow citizens about the principles of \n     liberty, a task that is both critical and challenging. It is \n     critical because, as James Madison put it, ``a well-\n     instructed people alone can be permanently a free people.'' \n     \\1\\ The ordered liberty we enjoy is neither self-generating \n     nor self-sustaining, but is based on certain principles that \n     require certain conditions. Knowledge and defense of those \n     principles and conditions will be the difference between \n     keeping and losing our liberty.\n       This educational challenge, however, has perhaps never been \n     more daunting. We live in a culture in which words mean \n     anything to anyone, celebrities substitute for statesmen, and \n     people are no longer well instructed. Forty-two percent of \n     Americans do not know the number of branches in the federal \n     government, and more than sixty percent cannot name all three \n     \\2\\ Four times as many Americans say that a detailed \n     knowledge of the Constitution is absolutely necessary as say \n     they actually have such knowledge.\\3\\ Twenty-one percent of \n     Americans believe the First Amendment protects the right to \n     own a pet.\\4\\\n       A few factors contribute to this state of affairs. Most \n     people get their information about the legal system only from \n     television. Unless people sue each other or commit crimes--\n     habits we really should not encourage--they will likely have \n     no firsthand knowledge or experience to draw from. \n     Furthermore, people hold lawyers in low esteem. If you plug \n     the term ``lawyer joke'' into Yahoo, it returns a whopping \n     25.7 million hits, a number on the rise almost as fast as the \n     national debt. The problem with lawyer jokes is that most \n     lawyers do not think they are funny and most other people do \n     not think they are jokes. This low view of lawyers means \n     people have little motivation to learn more about what \n     lawyers and judges really do.\n       The media do not help this state of affairs. The Harvard \n     Journal of Law & Public Policy recently published an \n     excellent article by Michigan Supreme Court Justice Stephen \n     Markman,\\5\\ who served as my chief counsel when I chaired the \n     Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution in the \n     early 1980s. He describes how the media's penchant for \n     focusing on winners and losers significantly shapes and \n     distorts how people understand what judges actually do, often \n     for the worse.\\6\\\n       Nonetheless, the timing of this Essay is auspicious in \n     several respects. First, I write in the wake of two very \n     relevant Federalist Society student symposia, last year's \n     about the people and the courts \\7\\ and this year's about the \n     separation of powers.\\8\\ Second, President Obama has been \n     particularly clear from the time he was a candidate about his \n     intention to appoint judges who will exercise a strikingly \n     political version of judicial power.\\9\\ Third, he has already \n     started acting on that intention by making his first judicial \n     nominations.\\10\\ New Presidents typically make their first \n     judicial nominations in July or even August, yet the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee has already held a hearing on the \n     President's first nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals, and \n     the President sent two more nominees to the Senate just a few \n     days ago.\n       Mark Twain popularized the notion that there are three \n     kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.\\11\\ I \n     prefer Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's comment that you may \n     be entitled to your own opinion, but not your own set of \n     facts.\\12\\ Either way, I will statistically describe two \n     macro and two micro factors of the judicial confirmation \n     process to show its recent transformation before turning to \n     how it should be conducted going forward.\n       The two macro factors are hearings and confirmations. The \n     Judiciary Committee held hearings for fewer judicial nominees \n     during the 110th Congress than any Congress since before I \n     entered the Senate. This lack of hearings is not the result \n     of the Judiciary Committee's inability to multitask. Instead, \n     it is the result of a political choice, one that has been \n     reversed since the last election. The Judiciary Committee has \n     already held a hearing on President Obama's first appeals \n     court nominee, just two weeks after that nominee arrived in \n     the Senate.\\13\\ Under a Republican President, Judiciary \n     Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy waited an average of 197 \n     days to give an appeals court nominee a hearing.\\14\\ The last \n     election amounted to the political equivalent of Drano, as \n     the confirmation pipes are now wonderfully unobstructed and \n     flowing freely once again.\n       Some might assume that Republicans demonstrate such strong \n     partisan preference, but they would be wrong. Since I was \n     first elected, Democrats running the Senate have granted \n     hearings to forty-one percent more Democratic than Republican \n     judicial nominees. When Republicans run the Senate, the \n     partisan differential is less than five percent.\n       Moving from the Judiciary Committee to the Senate floor, \n     the second macro factor is confirmations. In the last eight \n     years, President Bush had the slowest pace of judicial \n     confirmations of any President since Gerald Ford. Last year, \n     the Senate confirmed fewer judicial nominees than in any \n     President's final year since 1968, the end of the Johnson \n     Administration. By comparison, when I chaired the Judiciary \n     Committee during President Clinton's last year in office, the \n     Senate confirmed twice as many appeals court nominees as it \n     did last year.\n       As with hearings, the picture is not the same when \n     Republicans are in charge. When Democrats run the Senate, \n     they confirm forty-five percent more Democratic than \n     Republican judicial nominees. When Republicans run the \n     Senate, the differential is only nine percent.\n       At the ground level, the two micro factors in the \n     confirmation process are votes and filibusters. The Senate \n     has traditionally confirmed most unopposed lower court \n     nominees by unanimous consent rather than by time-consuming \n     roll call votes. From 1950 to 2000 the Senate confirmed only \n     3.2 percent of all district and appeals court nominees by \n     roll call vote. During the Bush presidency, that figure \n     jumped to nearly sixty percent. The percentage of roll calls \n     without a single negative vote nearly tripled. And under \n     President Bush, for the first time in American history, the \n     filibuster was used to defeat majority-supported judicial \n     nominees.\\15\\ With all due respect to Mark Twain, I think \n     these numbers accurately give you at least a taste for the \n     partisan division and conflict that now characterize the \n     judicial confirmation process. It has become, to edit Thomas \n     Hobbes just a bit, quite nasty and brutish.\n       Turning from what has been to what should be, I believe we \n     can get on a better path by, as Madison emphasized in The \n     Federalist No. 39, ``recurring to principles.'' \\16\\ The \n     judicial selection process has changed because ideas about \n     judicial power have changed. My basic thesis is this: Our \n     written Constitution and its separation of powers define both \n     judicial power and judicial selection. They define the \n     judicial philosophy\n\n[[Page S8749]]\n\n     that is a necessary qualification for judicial service, and \n     they counsel that the Senate defer to the President when he \n     nominates qualified individuals.\n       Consider a judicial nomination as a hiring process based on \n     a job description. The job description of a judge is to \n     interpret and apply law to decide cases. This job description \n     does not mean whatever a President, political party, or \n     Senate majority wants it to mean. Our written Constitution \n     and its separation of powers set the judicial job \n     description. Interpreting written law must be different than \n     making written law. Because law written in statutes or the \n     Constitution is not simply words, but really the meaning of \n     the words, only those with authority to make law may \n     determine what the words of our laws say and what those words \n     mean. Judges do not have authority to make law, so they do \n     not have authority to choose what the words of our laws say \n     or what they mean. In other words, judges apply the law to \n     decide cases, but they may not make the law they apply. \n     Judges and the law they use to decide cases are two different \n     things. Judging, therefore, is about a process that \n     legitimates results, a process by which the law made by the \n     people and those they elect determines winners and losers.\n       The Constitution and its separation of powers compel this \n     judicial job description. This kind of judge is consistent \n     with limited government and the ordered liberty it makes \n     possible. Justice Markman's article describes what he calls a \n     ``traditional jurisprudence--one that views the \n     responsibility of the courts to say what the law `is' rather \n     than what it `ought' to be.'' \\17\\ Such a philosophy of \n     judicial restraint--an understanding of the limited power and \n     role of judges--is a qualification for judicial service. This \n     is the kind of judge a President should nominate.\n       Our written Constitution and its separation of powers also \n     define how the confirmation stage of the judicial selection \n     process should operate. The Constitution gives the power to \n     nominate and appoint judges to the President, not to the \n     Senate. The best way to understand the Senate's role is that \n     the Senate advises the President whether to appoint his \n     nominees by giving or withholding its consent. I explored \n     this role in more detail in the Utah Law Review a few years \n     ago in the context of showing that the use of the filibuster \n     to defeat majority-supported judicial nominees is \n     inconsistent with the separation of powers.\\18\\ One basis on \n     which the Senate may legitimately withhold its consent to a \n     judicial nominee, however, is that the nominee is not \n     qualified for judicial service. Qualifications include more \n     than information on a nominee's resume. And with all due \n     respect to the American Bar Association, their rating does \n     not a qualification determine. Instead, qualifications for \n     judicial service include whether a nominee's judicial \n     philosophy--his understanding of a judge's power and role--is \n     in sync with our written Constitution and its separation of \n     powers.\n       Judges, after all, take an oath to support and defend the \n     Constitution of the United States. To be qualified for \n     judicial service, a nominee must believe there is such a \n     thing, that the supreme law of the land is not simply in the \n     eye of the judicial beholder, and that judges need something \n     more than a legal education, a personal opinion, and an \n     imagination to interpret it.\n       I propose looking to the basic principles of our written \n     Constitution and its separation of powers to guide the \n     judicial selection process. For the President, those \n     principles require nominees with a restrained judicial \n     philosophy. For the Senate, they require deference to a \n     President's qualified nominees. Senators, of course, must \n     decide how to balance qualifications and deference. Our \n     written Constitution and its separation of powers, however, \n     provide normative guidance for the judicial selection \n     process. Presidents and Senators will have to decide, and be \n     accountable for, how they use or reject that guidance.\n       No matter how philosophically sound this proposal may be--\n     and I believe it is philosophically rock solid--it may \n     nevertheless be politically controversial. We have traveled a \n     long way from Alexander Hamilton describing the judiciary as \n     the weakest and least dangerous branch.\\19\\ We have traveled \n     a long way from the Supreme Court saying in 1795 that the \n     Constitution is ``certain and fixed; it contains the \n     permanent will of the people, and is the supreme law of the \n     land; it is paramount to the power of the Legislature, and \n     can be revoked or altered only by the authority that made \n     it.'' \\20\\ We have traveled a long way from the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee saying in 1872 that giving the \n     Constitution a meaning different from what the people \n     provided when adopting it would be unconstitutional.\\21\\\n       For a long time now, we have instead labored under Chief \n     Justice Charles Evans Hughes's notion that the Constitution \n     is whatever judges say it is.\\22\\ It has become fashionable \n     to suppose that the only law judges may not make is law we do \n     not like. Legal commentator Stuart Taylor correctly observes \n     that ``[l]ike a great, ever-spreading blob, judicial power \n     has insinuated itself into every nook and cranny.'' \\23\\ One \n     of my predecessors as Senator from Utah who later served on \n     the Supreme Court, George Sutherland, described the \n     transformation in 1937 as it was literally under way. He \n     warned that abandoning the separation of powers by ignoring \n     the distinction between interpreting and amending the \n     Constitution would convert ``what was intended as inescapable \n     and enduring mandates into mere moral reflections.'' \\24\\ \n     Less than two decades later, Justice Robert Jackson described \n     what he saw as a widely held belief that the Supreme Court \n     decides cases based on personal impressions rather than \n     impersonal rules of law.\\25\\\n       Judicial power and judicial selection are inextricably \n     linked. Sometimes the Senate can appear to produce a lot of \n     activity but take very little action. To some, that means the \n     Senate is the world's greatest deliberative body. To others, \n     it means that it produces a lot of sound and fury signifying \n     nothing. But I hope that the debate over President Obama's \n     judicial nominees will really be a debate over the kind of \n     judge our liberty requires. The debate should be about \n     whether judges should decide cases by using enduring mandates \n     and impersonal rules of law or by using their own moral \n     reflections and personal impressions.\n       President Obama has already taken sides in this debate. \n     When he was a Senator, he voted against the nomination of \n     John Roberts to be Chief Justice, stating that judges decide \n     cases based on their deepest values, their core concerns, and \n     the content of their hearts.\\26\\ On the campaign trail, he \n     pledged that he would select judges according to their \n     empathy for certain groups such as the poor, African \n     Americans, gays, the disabled, or the elderly.\\27\\ The real \n     debate is about whether judges may decide cases based on \n     empathy at all, not the groups for which they have empathy. \n     It is about whether judges may make law at all, not about \n     what law judges should make. Conservatives as well as \n     liberals often evaluate judges and judicial decisions by \n     their political results rather than by their judicial \n     process. But a principle is just politics unless it applies \n     across the board. Professor Steven Calabresi, one of the \n     Federalist Society's founders, wrote last fall that \n     ``[n]othing less than the very idea of liberty and the rule \n     of law are at stake in this election.'' \\28\\ He was right, \n     and they remain at stake in the ongoing selection of federal \n     judges.\n       Judges have no authority to change the law, regardless of \n     whether they change it in a way I like. I am distinguishing \n     here between judicial philosophy, which relates to process, \n     and political ideology, which relates to results. Senators \n     often reveal their view of judicial power when participating \n     in judicial selection, proving once again that the two are \n     inextricably linked. During the debate over Chief Justice \n     Roberts's nomination, for example, one of my Democratic \n     colleagues wanted to know whether the nominee would stand \n     with families or with special interests. She said the \n     American people were entitled to know how he would decide \n     legal questions even before he had considered them.\\29\\ \n     Another Democratic Senator similarly said that the real \n     question was whose side the nominee would be on when he \n     decided important issues.\\30\\ Would he be on the side of \n     corporate or consumer interests, the side of polluters or \n     Congress when it seeks to regulate them, or the side of labor \n     or management?\n       In this activist view of judicial power, the desired ends \n     defined by a judge's empathy justify whatever means he uses \n     to decide cases. This activist view of judicial power is at \n     odds with our written Constitution and its separation of \n     powers and, therefore, with ordered liberty itself. The \n     people are not free if they do not govern themselves. The \n     people do not govern themselves if their Constitution does \n     not limit government. The Constitution cannot limit \n     government if judges define the Constitution.\n       Terry Eastland aptly described the result of judicial \n     activism in a 2006 essay titled The Good Judge: ``The \n     people's text, whether made by majorities or, in the case of \n     the Constitution, supermajorities, would be displaced by the \n     judges' text. The justices became lawmakers.'' \\31\\ This \n     quotation highlights one of the many differences between God \n     and federal judges. God, at least, does not think He is a \n     federal judge. And it brings up the question of how many \n     federal judges it takes to screw in a light bulb. Only one, \n     because the judge simply holds the bulb as the entire world \n     revolves around him.\n       There is perhaps some reason for optimism. One poll found \n     last year that, no matter for whom they voted, nearly three-\n     quarters of Americans said they wanted judges ``who will \n     interpret and apply the law as it is written and not take \n     into account their own viewpoints and experiences.'' \\32\\ \n     This debate is indeed the one we should be having, whether \n     judges have the power to make law. When judges apply law they \n     have properly interpreted rather than improperly made, their \n     rulings may have the effect of helping or hurting a \n     particular cause, of advancing or inhibiting a particular \n     agenda. They may, at least by the political science bean \n     counters, be considered liberal or conservative. The point, \n     therefore, is not which side wins in a particular case, but \n     whether the winner is decided by the law or by the judge. \n     When judges interpret law, the law produces the results. \n     Thus, the people can choose to change the law. When judges \n     make law, judges produce the results and the people are left \n     with no recourse at all. That state of affairs is the \n     antithesis of self-government.\n       Let me close by saying that the effort to defend liberty \n     never ends. Andrew Jackson reminded us as he left office in \n     1837 that ``eternal vigilance by the people is the price of \n     liberty; and that you must pay the price if you wish to \n     secure the blessing.'' \\33\\ The approach I outline \n     actually joins an effort that began long ago and reminds \n     me of a resolution passed by the Senate Republican \n     Conference in 1997:\n\n[[Page S8750]]\n\n       Be it resolved, that the Republican Conference opposes \n     judicial activism, whereby life-tenured, unaccountable judges \n     exceed their constitutional role of interpreting already \n     enacted, written law, and instead legislate from the bench by \n     imposing their personal preference or views of what is right \n     or just. Such activism threatens the basic democratic values \n     on which our Constitution is founded.\\34\\\n       There you have it. Our written Constitution and its \n     separation of powers define both judicial power and judicial \n     selection. They require judicial restraint as a qualification \n     for judicial service and require Senate deference to a \n     President's qualified nominees. The weeks and months ahead \n     will provide opportunities to debate these principles and \n     their application. Nothing less than ordered liberty is at \n     stake. I know the Federalist Society will be right in the \n     thick of that debate.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       * United States Senator (R-Utah); J.D., University of \n     Pittsburgh School of Law, 1962; B.A., Brigham Young \n     University, 1959.

On file with Author.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n               [From the National Journal, Aug. 4, 2009]\n\n                         (By Stuart Taylor Jr.)\n\n            Did Precedent Make Sotomayor Rule Against Ricci?\n\n       Judge Sonia Sotomayor has not defended her most widely \n     criticized decision--the one rejecting a discrimination \n     lawsuit by 17 white firefighters, and one Hispanic, against \n     the city of New Haven, Conn.--as a just or fair result.\n       That would have been an uphill battle: Polls in June showed \n     that huge majorities of the public wanted the Supreme Court \n     to reverse Sotomayor's decision.\n       And as I've explained elsewhere, although the Supreme Court \n     split 5-4 in ruling for the firefighters in Ricci v. \n     DeStefano, all nine justices rejected the specific legal rule \n     applied by Sotomayor's three judge panel. That rule would \n     allow employers to deny promotions after the fact to those \n     who did best on any measure of qualifications--no matter how \n     job-related and racially neutral--on which blacks or \n     Hispanics did badly.\n       Instead of defending her panel's quota-friendly rule and \n     its harsh impact on the high-scoring firefighters, Sotomayor \n     and her supporters have argued that she essentially had no \n     choice. The rule that her panel applied had been dictated, \n     they say, by three precedents of her own court, the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit.\n       Some critics have expressed skepticism about this claim, \n     but the media have shed little light on its plausibility. I \n     seek to shed some below.\n       Because some of this gets technical, I'll begin with \n     critics' simplest rebuttal to Sotomayor's precedent-made-me-\n     do-it claim:\n       Even assuming for the sake of argument that the Sotomayor \n     panel's decision was dictated by the three 2nd Circuit \n     precedents, it is undisputed that the full 2nd Circuit could \n     have modified or overruled them if Sotomayor had voted to \n     rehear the case en banc, meaning with all active 2nd Circuit \n     judges participating. Instead, Sotomayor cast a deciding vote \n     in the 7-6 decision not to rehear the case, suggesting she \n     was satisfied with the ruling.\n       There is also ample reason to doubt that any of the three \n     2nd Circuit precedents actually required the Sotomayor panel \n     to rule as it did, as some politicized professors have \n     pretended.\n       Sotomayor fleshed out her vague testimony about the issue \n     in answers to senators' written questions. She quoted her 2nd \n     Circuit colleague Barrington Parker's concurrence, which she \n     and three other judges had joined, in the 7-6 vote not to \n     rehear Ricci. Judge Parker wrote:\n       There was controlling authority in our decisions--among \n     them, Hayden v. County of Nassau [in 1999] and Bushey v. N.Y. \n     State Civil Serv. Comm'n [in 1984]. These cases clearly \n     establish for the circuit that a public employer, faced with \n     a prima facie case of disparate-impact liability under Title \n     VII, does not violate Title VII or the Equal Protection \n     Clause by taking facially neutral, albeit race-conscious, \n     actions to avoid such liability.\n       To unpack the legal language: Title VII is the employment \n     discrimination portion of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Title \n     VII disparate-impact lawsuits are typically brought by blacks \n     or Hispanics who challenge as discriminatory employers' use \n     of objective tests on which those minorities do poorly. New \n     Haven's ostensible reason for denying promotions to the white \n     and Hispanic firefighters who had done well on qualifying \n     exams was fear of being hit with a disparate impact lawsuit \n     by blacks who had done poorly. And any black plaintiffs would \n     indeed have had a prima facie disparate-impact case, which is \n     legalese for proof that blacks had done much worse on the \n     tests than whites.\n       But Judge Parker gave short shrift to the fact that even \n     when plaintiffs have a prima facie case, an employer such as \n     the city ``could be held liable for disparate-impact \n     discrimination only if the examinations were not job related \n     and consistent with business necessity, or if there existed \n     an equally valid, less-discriminatory alternative,'' as the \n     Supreme Court stressed in Ricci.\n       In addition, Parker's reading of both Hayden and Bushey is \n     conspicuously overbroad. Their facts (especially Hayden's) \n     were quite different from those of Ricci. And Bushey has been \n     undermined by subsequent Supreme Court precedents and \n     legislation.\n       That's why Judge Jose Cabranes, in the main dissent from \n     the 2nd Circuit's 7-6 denial of rehearing en banc, began:\n       ``This appeal raises important questions of first \n     impression''--meaning questions not controlled by precedent--\n     ``in our circuit and, indeed, in the nation, regarding the \n     application of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal\n\n[[Page S8751]]\n\n     Protection Clause and Title VII's prohibition on \n     discriminatory employment practices.''\n       The question at the core of the case, Cabranes said, was: \n     ``May a municipal employer disregard the results of a \n     qualifying examination, which was carefully constructed to \n     ensure race neutrality, on the ground that the results of the \n     examination yielded too many qualified applicants of one race \n     and not enough of another?''\n       This and other questions raised by the case, Cabranes \n     continued, were ``indisputably complex and far from well-\n     settled'' and ``not addressed by any precedent of the Supreme \n     Court or our Circuit,'' including Hayden and Bushey.\n       Ricci differed from Hayden in three critical respects. \n     First, as Cabranes explained, Hayden had approved Nassau \n     County's ``race-conscious design of an employment \n     examination,'' which was achieved mainly by eliminating tests \n     of cognitive skills. Ricci, on the other hand, involved \n     ``race-based treatment of examination results'' (emphasis \n     added) to override local civil service laws under which \n     promotions are virtually automatic for the firefighters with \n     the best scores on job-related oral and written tests.\n       Second, Hayden stressed that the white plaintiffs ``cannot \n     establish that they were injured or disadvantaged'' by the \n     Nassau County test's race-conscious design. The Ricci \n     plaintiffs were very clearly injured: They were denied \n     promotions that they had done everything possible to earn \n     under New Haven's civil service laws, and thus were \n     ``deprived of the pursuit of happiness on account of race,'' \n     in the words of Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen.\n       Third, Hayden upheld the Nassau County exam's black-\n     friendly design in part ``to rectify prior discrimination'' \n     by the county against blacks seeking police jobs. Ricci \n     involved no claim of prior discrimination by New Haven \n     against blacks.\n       Bushey was a lawsuit by whites challenging New York State's \n     race-norming of scores--by substantially raising each \n     minority applicant's score--on a qualifying exam to become a \n     correction captain. The 2nd Circuit's mixed ruling in the \n     case was entitled to little or no weight as a precedent in \n     Ricci for at least four reasons:\n       While Bushey held that the state could use unspecified \n     ``race-conscious remedies'' to avert a lawsuit by minorities \n     who had done badly on a test, the 2nd Circuit ordered further \n     proceedings to determine whether the race-norming remedy \n     chosen by the state went too far, and violated Title VII by \n     ``trammel[ing] the interests of nonminority candidates.'' In \n     Ricci, the Sotomayor panel gave no weight at all to the \n     interests of non-minority candidates.\n       In a key provision of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, Congress \n     banned the sort of race-norming that the state had used in \n     Bushey. This provision stated broadly that employers may not \n     ``adjust the scores of, use different cutoff scores for, or \n     otherwise alter the results of employment-related tests on \n     the basis of race.'' Indeed, by throwing out (``altering''?) \n     the results of its test, New Haven arguably violated the 1991 \n     provision, as well as others, in Ricci itself.\n       Bushey noted that the white plaintiffs' initial claims that \n     their constitutional rights had been violated ``are not \n     before us,'' because on appeal they had relied solely on \n     their Title VII claims. In Ricci, ``significant \n     constitutional claims . . . of first impression [were] at the \n     core of this case,'' as Cabranes wrote. The Sotomayor panel \n     completely ignored them.\n       The high-scoring firefighters' constitutional claims in \n     Ricci were especially strong because landmark Supreme Court \n     decisions in 1989 and 1995 had washed away the foundations of \n     Bushey and another 2nd Circuit decision cited by Sotomayor \n     defenders, Kirkland v. New York State Department of \n     Correctional Services (1980). The 1989 and 1995 decisions \n     held for the first time that (respectively) state and federal \n     favoritism toward blacks is just as suspect under the \n     Constitution as favoritism toward whites. ``Any preference \n     based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a \n     most searching examination'' and be struck down unless \n     ``narrowly tailored'' to serve a ``compelling'' governmental \n     interest, according to the 1995 decision, Adarand \n     Constructors v. Pena.\n       The justices' constitutional rulings seem quite contrary to \n     the 2nd Circuit's approach not only in Bushey but also in \n     Ricci, in which--Cabranes suggested--Sotomayor and her allies \n     ``took the city's justifications at face value,'' ignoring \n     strong evidence that its decision to dump the test scores was \n     driven by racial politics, not legal principle. The result, \n     Cabranes said, was that ``municipal employers could reject \n     the results of an employment examination whenever those \n     results failed to yield a desired racial outcome--i.e. failed \n     to satisfy a racial quota.''\n       Later, in the Supreme Court's June 29 majority opinion in \n     Ricci, Justice Anthony Kennedy said it was unnecessary to \n     address the firefighters' constitutional claims because their \n     Title VII claims alone were sufficient to win the case. But \n     Kennedy stressed that there were ``few, if any, precedents in \n     the courts of appeals discussing the issue.''\n       The bottom line is that 2nd Circuit precedents did not make \n     Sotomayor rule as she did. Supreme Court precedent favored \n     the firefighters. Sotomayor's ruling was her own.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me confess that I feel totally \ninadequate standing here tonight and talking about the subject of the \nconfirmation of Judge Sotomayor. I am not a lawyer. I am amidst these \nbrilliant lawyers. I listened to Senator Hatch and Senator Sessions. \nThey have the kind of background where they can really get into this \nand look constitutionally and legally and evaluate, and I am not in \nthat position.\n  I would like to speak on this nomination for the following reasons. I \nwant to reaffirm my opposition to her confirmation.\n  I was the first Member of the Senate on the day she was nominated who \nannounced I would not be supporting her. I recognize, as Senator Hatch \nsaid, that she will be confirmed. We know that.\n  I remember what Senator Schumer, the senior Senator from New York, \nsaid shortly after she was first nominated. He made the statement that \nRepublicans are going to have to vote for her because they don't want \nto vote against a woman, vote against a Hispanic. He was right. But I \nwould suggest that after the hearing, that statement is not nearly as \ntrue as it was before the hearings because of some of the extreme \npositions she has taken.\n  I have to say that from a nonlawyer perspective, I look at it perhaps \ndifferently than my colleagues who are learned scholars in the legal \nprofession. A lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court requires not \nonly a respect for the rule of law but also for the separation of \npowers and an acknowledgment that the Court is not a place where policy \nis made. The Court is about the application of the law and not where \njudges get to make the world a place they want it to be. I saw that all \nthroughout the hearings I watched with a great deal of interest.\n  In May of 2005, Judge Sotomayor asserted that the ``court of appeals \nis where policy is made.'' She also wrote in a 1996 law review article \nthat ``change--sometimes radical change--can and does occur in a legal \nsystem that serves a society whose social policy itself changes.''\n  The Constitution is absolutely clear: Policy is made in the Halls of \nCongress, right here--that is what we do for a living--not in the \ncourtroom. Legislators write the laws. Judges interpret them. We \nunderstand that. Even those of us who are nonlawyers remembered that \nall the way through school. Sotomayor is correct that societies change, \nbut the policies that are made to reflect these changes are done \nthrough Members of Congress who are elected to represent the will of \nthe people.\n  Obviously, we are talking about a lifetime appointment. There is no \naccountability after this point. When judges go beyond interpreting the \nlaws and the Constitution and legislate from the bench, they overstep \ntheir jurisdiction and their constitutional duty. Allowing judges who \nare not directly elected by the people and who serve lifelong terms to \nrewrite laws from the bench is dangerous to the vitality of a \nrepresentative democracy. Simply put, judicial activism places too much \npower in the hands of those who are not directly accountable to the \npeople. That is what we are talking about, a lifetime appointment.\n  Judge Sotomayor has overcome significant adversity to achieve great \nsuccess, and I agree with Senator Hatch in his comments that we admire \nher for her accomplishments under adverse conditions. However, while \nher experiences as a Latina woman have shaped who she is as a person, \nthey should not be used, as she affirms, to affect her judicial \nimpartiality and significantly influence how she interprets the law and \nthe Constitution.\n  In 2001, Judge Sotomayor gave a speech at the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley in which she stated:\n\n       I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of \n     her experiences would more often than not reach a better \n     conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\n\n  She has on several occasions conveyed the same idea. Between 1994 and \n2003, she delivered speeches using similar language at Seton Hall \nUniversity, the Woman's Bar Association of the State of New York, Yale \nUniversity, the City University of New York School of Law. It is not a \nslip of the tongue once; this is a statement that has been reaffirmed \nand reaffirmed. Quite frankly, that was the reason for\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\nmy opposition back in 1998 when she was nominated to be on the circuit \ncourt of appeals. The statements she made show a very biased opinion \nthat someone who is not a lawyer sees and thinks should disqualify \nsomeone for the appointment.\n  She further stated in 1994, in a presentation in Puerto Rico, that:\n\n       Justice O'Connor has often been cited as saying that ``a \n     wise old man and a wise old woman reach the same conclusion'' \n     in deciding cases . . . [however] I am also not sure that I \n     agree with that statement . . . I would hope that a wise \n     woman with the richness of her experience would, more often \n     than not, reach a better conclusion.\n\n  That is pretty emphatic. There is no other way you can interpret \nthat. She thinks that a woman with her experience can make a better \nconclusion than a White male. I consider that racist. Sotomayor not \nonly suggests the possibility of judicial impartiality but also that \ngender and ethnicity should influence a judge's decision.\n  Furthermore, President Obama said that in choosing the next Supreme \nCourt nominee, he would use an empathy standard. While judges may and \nshould be empathetic people, they must be impartial judges first. If \nempathy was a guiding standard, with whom should a judge empathize? \nShould more empathy be shown to one race, one gender, one religion, one \nlifestyle? True justice does not see race, gender, or creed. We are all \nequal in the eyes of the law, and the law must be applied equally. That \nis why she wears a blindfold. It is supposed to be blind justice.\n\n  Rather than looking to factors beyond the law, judges must solely \nexamine the facts of the case and the law itself. Their ability to \nequally apply justice under the law is the standard by which we should \nselect judges. So we have two different standards right now with which \nI disagree. One is that judges should make policy and, secondly, that \ngender and ethnicity should influence decisions.\n  Another belief on which Judge Sotomayor and I fundamentally disagree \nis that American judges should consider foreign law when deciding \ncases. This probably concerns me more than any of the rest of them--the \nfact that we have this obsession in these Halls, in this Senate, that \nnothing is good unless it somehow comes from the United Nations or is \ncoming from some multinational origin.\n  In 2007, in the forward to a book--and I read this myself--titled, \n``The International Judge,'' Sotomayor wrote:\n\n       [T]he question of how much we have to learn from foreign \n     law and the international community when interpreting our \n     Constitution is not the only one worth posing.\n\n  This past spring, Judge Sotomayor gave an alarming speech at the ACLU \nwhich addressed this topic. She said:\n\n       [T]o suggest to anyone that you can outlaw the use of \n     foreign or international law is a sentiment that is based on \n     a fundamental misunderstanding, what you would be asking \n     American judges to do is to close their minds to good ideas. \n     . . .\n\n  No, Judge Sotomayor, it is sovereignty that we are talking about. \nStatements like these make it clear that President Obama has nominated \na judge to our highest Court who believes our courts should rely on \nforeign decisions when interpreting our Constitution. And I have to \nsay, whatever happened to sovereignty? This obsession with \nmultinationalism has to come to an end. I believe America will reject \nthis type of thought. Americans do not want the rest of the world \ninterpreting our laws, and neither do I.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Judge Sotomayor's record on the second \namendment is constitutionally outrageous. Maybe it is because I come \nfrom Oklahoma, but that is the thing I hear about more than anything \nelse down there, and my own kids, I might add.\n  I do not believe Judge Sotomayor can be trusted to uphold the \nindividual freedom to keep and bear arms if future second amendment \ncases come before her. I have received no assurances from her past \ndecisions or public testimony that she will be willing to fairly \nconsider the question of whether the second amendment is a fundamental \nright and thus restricts State action as it relates to the second \namendment. It is incomprehensible to me that our Founding Fathers could \nhave intended the right to keep and bear arms as nonbinding upon the \nStates and instead leave the right to be hollowed out by State and \nlocal laws and regulations. History and common sense do not support \nthis.\n  I have to tell you, this has been more of a concern in my State of \nOklahoma than anything else. I cannot confirm a nominee who believes \nthe second amendment is something other than a fundamental right and \ninstead treats it as a second class amendment to the Constitution. I do \nnot know what a second class amendment to the Constitution is. This is \nnot in line with my beliefs and not in line with the beliefs of the \nmajority of Americans--certainly from my State of Oklahoma.\n  Today, I am persuaded the confirmation hearings served only to \nhighlight many of my concerns. The numerous inconsistencies of her \ntestimony with her record have persuaded not only me but the American \npeople that Judge Sotomayor is not qualified to serve as a Justice on \nthe highest Court, the U.S. Supreme Court. I say that because a recent \nZogby Poll--and as several other polls have also consistently \nconfirmed--following the confirmation hearings revealed that only 49 \npercent of Americans support Judge Sotomayor's confirmation, with an \nequal number opposing it. This is significant because she played the \nrace card all the way through this thing and was talking about the \nHispanic effect. But the same poll showed that among Hispanic voters, \nonly 47 percent say they are in favor of her confirmation.\n  In other words, there are fewer people in the Hispanic community who \nare favoring her confirmation than in the non-Hispanic. These numbers \nare evidence of the fact that Judge Sotomayor has not gained the \napproval of the American people during her confirmation hearings, and \nshe certainly has not gained mine.\n  I was the first Member of the Senate to publicly announce my \nopposition to Judge Sotomayor after her nomination to the Supreme Court \non May 26. On that date, I stated I could not confirm her. In addition \nto all the above, there is another reason. While I do not often agree \nwith Vice President Biden, I do agree with his statement that once you \noppose a Federal court nominee, you cannot support that nominee for a \nhigher court because the bar is higher. I think that is very \nsignificant to point out here because there are several who are still \nserving today, as I am, who opposed her to the circuit court in 1998. I \nthink Vice President Biden is correct. As the standard goes up, once \nyou get to the U.S. Supreme Court, that is the end. So that should be \nthe very highest standard. So it is unconceivable that anyone who would \nhave opposed her in 1998 could turn around and support her now.\n  I have to say there are a lot of reasons I have pointed out. One is \njudges making policy. I object to that; I find that offensive. Gender \nand ethnicity should be a consideration; that is wrong. The \ninternational thing, that we have to go to the international community \nto see that we are doing the right thing in interpreting our \nConstitution; that is a sovereignty issue. The second amendment, that \nis a concern.\n  So even though Judge Sotomayor will be confirmed, it will be without \nmy vote. I would have to say for the sake of my 20 kids and grandkids \nthat I will oppose Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe there are a few minutes left \non this side of the aisle. I would just like to share a few thoughts. I \nsee Senator Brown is here and would also like to speak tonight. I think \nsome others may also.\n  One of the things that has been discussed tonight from my Democratic \ncolleagues is the great American ideal of equal justice under law. \nThose words are indeed chiseled on the face of the Supreme Court across \nthe street, and it has been invoked as a reason to support this \nnominee. But I would suggest that at its most fundamental level that is \none of the serious objections and concerns we have.\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\n  Lawsuits have parties. If you have empathy for one party, if you have \na sympathy for one party, if you have a prejudice that favors one \nparty, then that is not equal justice. In her own speeches and \nstatements, Judge Sotomayor has said: I accept the fact that my \nbackground, my sympathies, even my prejudices--those are her words--\nwill affect the facts, affect how I decide cases--that her background \nwill ``affect the facts I choose to see.'' These were not just speeches \ngiven one time but repeated over a period of a decade.\n  So it raises real questions about that because the oath that a judge \ntakes is a powerful thing. The oath reflects the ideal of American \njustice. And the oath says a judge will not be a respecter of persons. \nThe oath says a judge shall do equal justice to the poor and the rich \nalike. The oath says a judge will be impartial; that they will carry \nout their duties under the Constitution and under the laws of the \nUnited States--not above the laws of the United States. A judge is not \nabove the law. They are not empowered to utilize any of their personal \nviews, politics, morals, or values in the process of their judging to \nmanipulate the law, to carry out an agenda they may believe is the \ngreatest thing for all of America. They are not entitled to do that.\n\n  So from her speeches and her approach to the law, there is a great \nconcern to the extent of which I have not seen before in speeches and \nexpressions, in Law Review articles by this nominee that suggests an \nacceptance of the fact that her background and experiences, opinions, \nsympathies, and prejudices will affect her rulings.\n  She goes on to say: I accept the fact that my background will \n``affect the facts I choose to see.'' For a lawyer like myself who has \npracticed a good bit in Federal court, tried quite a few cases, this is \na stunning development that a judge is going to tell me: Well, I may \nnot see those facts because of my background, my sympathies, and my \nprejudices. That is what a judge puts on that robe for. The robe is to \nsymbolize they pull themselves apart from the everyday pressures that \nare on them, the everyday biases and prejudices; that they will be a \nneutral, fair, objective umpire and will call the balls and strikes, \ncall the game without taking sides, without trying to achieve a given \nresult. This is the ideal of American justice.\n  One of our colleagues said he objected because some of us were \nadvocating a strange and strained conservative orthodoxy, that we would \nnot vote for anybody who did not agree with some sort of philosophy \nlike that. What I said at the opening of the hearing was that I would \nnot vote for her, and no Senator should vote for any nominee, whether \nliberal or conservative, who was not committed--committed--as their \noath commits them, to setting aside personal values, opinions, and so \nforth, and rendering true justice based on the law and the facts, \nwhether they like the law or not.\n  So I think this is a big deal. They say: Well, you never confirmed a \nliberal Democrat, Sessions. You are a conservative Republican. But I \nwould. And I voted for quite a number of them under President Clinton. \nI expect I will vote for quite a number under President Obama. I voted \nfor 95 percent of President Clinton's nominees in the time I was in the \nSenate. It is not their politics. It is not the church they belong to. \nIt is not whether they go to church. It is not what their moral values \nare. It is when they get on that bench and they decide cases, are they \ngoing to follow the law and the facts? That is the question, and that \nis what we are looking for.\n  It is sort of surprising to see a nominee express repeatedly over a \nperiod of years a contrary view. And to suggest that, well, it may be \nan aspiration to be unbiased, but it is just a mere aspiration--and to \nexplicitly reject the classical formulation of a judge's role as \nexpressed by Justice O'Connor, when she said: A wise old woman and a \nwise old man should reach the same conclusion--well, that is what we \nalways have believed in America. Now we have this new theory that, \nwell, you can bring to bear your background, and you might reach a \nbetter conclusion because you have different experiences you can bring \nto bear. That is not our goal in America, in my view.\n  Our legal system is built on a belief that there is a right answer to \neven the most difficult cases, and judges ought to give their absolute \nbest effort to find that right answer. It is based on law and the facts \nand not what their personal views and values are. That is what we are \nall about. I think it is an important issue. And the activist, whether \nliberal or conservative, the activist judge allows those values and \nprejudices and political views and ideology to affect their rulings. It \ncauses them to find some way to achieve a result that furthers an \nagenda they believe in. That is not justice, that is politics.\n\n  When President Obama says he wants a judge who will show empathy, I \nask: Whom does he show empathy for? If you show empathy for one party, \nhaven't you had a bias against the other? Who got empathy in the \nfirefighters case? Was that equal justice under law--under law?\n  The Constitution says no one shall be deprived of equal protection of \nthe laws on account of their race. But the firefighters who passed the \ntest--a test that was never found to be defective, and the Supreme \nCourt found it was not found to be defective--they had that test thrown \nout because they didn't like the racial results of it. Isn't that \ndiscriminating against the people who worked hard and studied and \npassed the test?\n  Lieutenant Vargas testified before our committee. I asked him, and he \nsaid if everybody had studied as hard as he had, a lot more of them \nwould have passed. It was just a question of the commitment to learn \nthe things necessary to be a leader in a fire department where you send \npeople into life-and-death situations. This is not a little matter. You \nneed to know things.\n  So I don't want anybody to think that what we are doing is some \nstrange or strained approach to the law. I believe we are asking \nfundamental questions about law and justice in America and the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. Aren't we entitled to expect that this \nnominee, such as every other judge who has ever taken the bench in any \nFederal court in America, should be not mildly committed to the oath \nbut absolutely committed to the oath; committed to not being a \nrespecter of persons; committed to equal justice for the poor and the \nrich; committed to impartiality; committed to conducting their office \nunder the Constitution and under the laws of the United States and not \nabove it.\n  I think that is what we need to be looking for. I am afraid this \nnominee, based on several important cases and a plethora of speeches \nover a decade, doesn't meet the standard. I wish it weren't so. I \nthought things would get better at the hearing. I don't think they did. \nThat is my best judgment. So that is why I have concluded I cannot \nsupport her nomination.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am a father of daughters who were raised \nwith the belief that the United States is only as strong as its \ncommitment to combating prejudice and promoting equality under the law. \nIt is something I learned from my own mother. I am also a husband of a \nwoman whose parents' sacrifice allowed her to be the first in her \nfamily to go to college, opening a world of possibility grounded in the \nbasic American values of hard work and opportunity for all. It is with \nthem in mind and with appreciation for the confidence Judge Sonia \nSotomayor inspires that I am proud to support her to be the next \nAssociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor has cleared hurdle after hurdle to achieve the \npromise of the American dream. She has earned the admiration of her \npeers by demonstrating again and again her respect for the law, her \nrespect for the rule of law, and her dedication to its impartial \ninterpretation. For more than three decades, as we have heard on the \nfloor and we heard in committee, as a district attorney in New York, a \ncivil litigator in private practice, a Federal judge in the Second \nCourt of Appeals, Judge Sotomayor has shown that she is tough and she \nis fair and she is a thoughtful arbiter of justice. She will be an \noutstanding Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  During her confirmation hearings, Judge Sotomayor responded \nthoughtfully and thoroughly to a wide range of questions. In fact, she \nanswered more questions in depth than any nominee in\n\n[[Page S8754]]\n\nrecent history. Combined with first-class legal reasoning and \ndisciplined intellect, Sonia Sotomayor's life experiences will make her \na valuable addition to the Court.\n  She was raised in public housing in the Bronx. At age 9, she lost her \nfather, a factory worker. Raised by her mother, a nurse, she battled \nchildhood diabetes while excelling at every level in school. My best \nfriend also suffered from childhood diabetes. He lived with diabetes \nfor some 40 years. I know how it made him more disciplined, it made him \nmore compassionate, and if I could use the word, it made him more \nempathetic toward those around him. It made him an all-around better \nperson, it made him a better judge of character, and it made him more \nfair.\n  After graduating from our Nation's finest universities, Sonia \nSotomayor reached the heights of the legal profession. Each of these \nexperiences exposed her to the array of the American experience.\n  Current and former Supreme Court Justices from across the ideological \nspectrum have described how their personal experiences informed their \njudicial perspective. Judge Sandra Day O'Connor, nominated by President \nReagan, once said:\n\n       We're all creatures of our upbringing. We bring whatever we \n     are as people to a job like the Supreme Court. We have our \n     life experiences.\n\n  Empathy, perhaps?\n  Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative nominated by President Bush, \nsaid during his confirmation hearings:\n\n       When I get a case about discrimination, I have to think \n     about people in my own family who suffered discrimination \n     because of the ethnic background or because of religion or \n     because of gender. And I do take that into account.\n\n  Empathy, perhaps?\n  I don't recall when Judge Alito appeared in front of the Judiciary \nCommittee that people questioned his empathy and questioned his ability \nto do his job because of his background. Similarly, Judge Sotomayor's \nbackground and life experiences will impart a new sense of perspective \nto the Court.\n  As I hear this discussion of empathy and I hear this accusation of \nJudge Sotomayor being an activist judge, I think about who has sat on \nthe Supreme Court through much of this Nation's history. Most of the \npeople who sat on the Supreme Court were people of privilege. Most of \nthe people who sat on the Supreme Court were people who were born into \nprivilege. We have seen the Supreme Court, the highest Court in the \nland, particularly in recent years, side in case after case with the \nwealthy over the poor. We have seen them side with large corporations \nover workers. We have seen them side with the elite of our society over \nothers in our society. Maybe they decided that way because the Justices \ncame from privileged backgrounds themselves and that is the way they \nsaw the world around them. I don't hear those discussions on the floor. \nI didn't hear those discussions in the Senate Judiciary Committee from \nthose who oppose Judge Sotomayor's nomination.\n  Similar to Presidents Reagan and Bush and every President before, \nPresident Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor because he felt her views and her \ninterpretations of our Nation's law reflect the way forward for our \nNation. On issues ranging from criminal justice and labor and \nemployment, Judge Sotomayor has an extraordinary record of following, \ndefending, and upholding the rule of law as a Federal prosecutor, as a \ntrial judge, and as an appellate judge. Nearly every major law \nenforcement organization in this Nation, ranging from the Fraternal \nOrder of Police to the National Sheriff's Association to the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association, has endorsed her. The American Bar \nAssociation awarded its highest ratings when evaluating Judge \nSotomayor's judicial temperament and her treatment of all litigants. \nAnd the Judiciary Committee has received a letter of support for Judge \nSotomayor's nomination from the American Hunters and Shooters \nAssociation, an organization that advocates for second amendment \nrights. The association told us some in the firearm community have \nleveled a number of charges against Judge Sotomayor that do not pass \nthe truth test. They also wrote:\n\n       Conservatives should applaud Judge Sotomayor as a model of \n     judicial restraint on the Circuit Court, even if that \n     restraint has frustrated gun rights outcomes in the immediate \n     cases.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follow\n\n                                                  American Hunters\n\n\n                                       & Shooters Association,\n\n                                                    June 29, 2009.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: In 1991, President George H.W. Bush \n     appointed Judge Sotomayor to the U.S. District Court for the \n     Southern District of New York. Senator Al D'Amato (R-NY) led \n     the fight for her initial Senate confirmation, which was \n     approved by unanimous consent. Her later nomination to the \n     U.S. Appeals Court (Second Circuit) was made by President \n     Bill Clinton and also moved along by then Senator Al D'Amato. \n     She received strong bi-partisan support with a vote of 67-29.\n       Some in the firearm community have leveled a number of \n     charges against Judge Sotomayor that do not pass the truth \n     test. In the recent case of Maloney v. Cuomo, a unanimous \n     Second Circuit panel, which included Judge Sotomayor \n     acknowledged that the landmark ruling in District of Columbia \n     v. Heller confers an individual right of citizens to keep and \n     bear arms.\n       The Maloney court also explained, as the Heller majority \n     had, that earlier Supreme Court precedents had held that the \n     Second Amendment ``is a limitation only upon the power of \n     congress and the national government and not upon that of the \n     state.'' The panel noted that while Heller raises questions \n     about those earlier Supreme Court decisions, the Second \n     Circuit was obligated to follow direct precedent ``leaving to \n     the Supreme Court the prerogative of overruling its own \n     decisions.'' While we are disappointed that the Supreme Court \n     has not yet extended this right to the states, we note that \n     Conservative Judge Frank Easterbrook of the 7th Circuit \n     agreed with Sotomayor's ruling as being consistent with \n     precedent. Judge Sotomayor has established herself as a model \n     jurist in terms of respecting precedent. We suspect that her \n     critics from the leadership of several well-known gun \n     organizations are just as interested in supporting precedent \n     as she is, now that the precedent to be protected is clearly \n     enshrined within the Heller decision.\n       As the President of the American Hunters and Shooters \n     Association, I am eager to see the Supreme Court take up the \n     incorporation issue of the Second Amendment to the states. As \n     a gun owner in Maryland, it is my fervent hope that the \n     Supreme Court will extend the protections guaranteed by the \n     Second Amendment, as defined in the Heller decision, to the \n     citizens of the United States of America who reside outside \n     the District of Columbia, as it has with the First and Fourth \n     Amendments.\n       Our own views on gun ownership notwithstanding, it is the \n     role of the President, who was elected by a rather impressive \n     majority, to nominate and the Senate's duty to advise and \n     consent. The Senate would be wise to consent to this \n     nomination.\n       Conservatives should applaud Judge Sotomayor as a model of \n     judicial restraint on the Circuit Court, even if that \n     restraint has frustrated gun rights outcomes in the immediate \n     cases. As moderate progressives, we hope that the nominee \n     views the settled law in Heller as ripe for an activist \n     expansion by incorporation to the states in harmonizing the \n     different Circuit Court decisions.\n       On behalf of the American Hunters and Shooters Association, \n     we extend our strong support for the confirmation of Judge \n     Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Mr. President, Judge Sotomayor is a groundbreaking Supreme \nCourt nominee, who unfortunately is facing gratuitous, groundless \nmischaracterizations. She is to be commended for her exemplary conduct \nin the face of critical and vicious personal attacks. Unfortunately, we \nhave seen it all too many times. Judge Sotomayor is a woman and she is \nPuerto Rican. She is also a beloved daughter, sister, and aunt. She is \na highly respected judge, with more relevant experience than any member \nof the current Supreme Court--than any member of the current Supreme \nCourt.\n  Louis Brandeis, confirmed in 1916 as the Court's first Jewish \nnominee, faced massive distortions and mischaracterizations. Justice \nThurgood Marshall, confirmed in 1967 as the Court's first African-\nAmerican Justice, faced extraordinary personal attacks. Both Justice \nBrandeis and Justice Marshall made lasting legacies on the Court that \nensured our Nation's progress to meet the very Democratic ideals \nenshrined in our Constitution. I would offer that\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\ntheir background perhaps made them even better Justices.\n  President Obama was elected in a historic election, where the \nAmerican people turned pages of history to forge a new path for our \nNation. It is a new path shaped by common sense and compassion and \nbelief in the potential of our people and the greatness of our Nation. \nThe Supreme Court is a vital part of this path forward.\n  Exercising one of his most important powers, President Obama \nnominated someone who will help ensure that our Supreme Court honors \nthe Constitution and that every American is protected by it.\n  President Obama said:\n\n       What she will bring to this court is not only the knowledge \n     and experience acquired over the course of a brilliant legal \n     career, but the wisdom accumulated from an inspiring life \n     journey.\n\n  I congratulate Judge Sotomayor, her mother Celina, and the rest of \nthe Sotomayor family. I also congratulate Justice David Souter on his \nwell-earned retirement. Justice Souter's probing intellect and \nbrilliant legal mind deserve our Nation's sincere thanks and gratitude.\n  Commitment to the rule of law is the foundation of our Nation, where \ndemocratic values are enshrined in the Constitution that preserves and \nstrengthens our basic freedom. As Senators, one of our most important \nConstitutional responsibilities is to confirm a Justice of the Supreme \nCourt. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in confirming Judge Sonia \nSotomayor as the next Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \naccomplishments of the Simpson County Historical Society, which is \ncelebrating its 50th anniversary in September, making it one of the \noldest continuously operating historical societies in Kentucky.\n  The society's half century of promoting research and knowledge of \nhistory makes it one of south-central Kentucky's treasures. At the \nsociety's very first meeting in 1959, 37 individuals met in a private \nhome to discuss the creation of the organization.\n  For many years the society maintained a small collection at the \nGoodnight Library until members convinced the county to let them use \nthe old county jail and jailer's house as a headquarters. The facility \nnow serves as the Simpson County Archives and Museum. Their collection \ncontains thousands of items, including books, manuscripts, original \ndocuments and papers, pictures, county records, tapes, CDs, microfilm, \nmicrofiche, computers, and more.\n  The research materials, librarians and volunteers at the archives \nhave helped thousands of visitors connect to their past and learn about \ntheir genealogy.\n  The dedicated staff and volunteers at the society have made it very \nsuccessful. In 2006, Mary Garrett, Nancy Neely, Sarah Richardson, Sarah \nSmith, Beatrice Snider, Margaret Snider, and Dorothy Steers received \nthe Lifetime Presidential Volunteer Service Awards for over 4,000 hours \nof volunteer service.\n  The group not only preserves history, but gives much to the \ncommunity, for instance by supporting several historical markers in \nSimpson County and providing grants for schools and groups interested \nin preserving history. They also offer scholarships for students who \nwant to study history.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring, as listed \nbelow, the society and their officers for their hard work and \ndedication to the preservation and research of Kentucky's and Simpson \nCounty's history over the past 50 years and for many more years to \ncome:\n\n            Simpson County Historical Society Officers--2009\n\n       President Dr. James Henry Snider, Vice-President Jean \n     Almand, Secretary Jason Herring, Assistant Secretary Bonnye \n     Moody, Treasurer Commie Jo Hall, Librarian Kenny Lynn Scott, \n     Directors Katherine McCutchen, Emily Mayes, Sarah Jernigan, \n     Past President and Business Manager Sarah Jo Cardwell.

Mr. President, last night I rose to speak on health care \nreform.\n  Today, another 14,000 Americans lost their health insurance.\n  That is 14,000 Americans who had health insurance when I spoke on the \nfloor last night, but tonight each will go to bed fearing that if \nsomething happens to them or their family, they could lose everything--\ntheir home, their life savings, their economic security, gone.\n  Tomorrow, it will be another 14,000.\n  Another 14,000 the day after that.\n  And another 14,000 every single day until we finally pass real health \ncare reform.\n  Between now and when we return from recess, half a million Americans \nwill lose their insurance. Some will have preexisting conditions that, \nunder our current system, will prevent them from ever finding coverage \nagain. Some will have medical issues requiring expensive treatments \nthat they will no longer be able to afford. Some will end up in \nbankruptcy. Some will end up on public assistance. And some will end up \nin the emergency room with a sick child whose illness could have been \nprevented with a simple doctor's visit.\n  The tragedy caused by our broken health care system is ongoing. It is \nhappening right now. And when we come back from recess, I have every \nhope and expectation that we will be ready to work together to stop it.\n  I take my Republican colleagues at their word when they say they \ndon't want to stall this effort to death, they simply want \nbipartisanship.\n  The Affordable Health Choices Act, passed in the HELP Committee, \ndidn't win bipartisan support, but it is a bipartisan bill. It \nincorporates 161 Republican amendments, and reflects a spirited and \nrobust debate with participation from all sides--exactly the sort of \ndebate I expect we can have when we come back from recess.\n  We are not going to agree on every detail, and there will be times \nwhen we have to have a simple up-or-down vote and live with the \nresults. But surely we can all agree that the status quo isn't just \nunacceptable--it is unsustainable. That is why doctors and nurses, \ninsurance companies and drug companies, Democrats and Republicans--all \nsay we need reform.\n  Well, it is time for us to make that happen.\n  I believe that our bipartisan approach has yielded a good bill.\n  If you don't have health insurance, the Affordable Health Choices Act \nwill put it within reach by giving you a range of affordable options to \nchoose from. It forever banishes the term ``preexisting conditions'' \nfrom the American vocabulary.\n  If you have health insurance, the Affordable Health Choices Act will \nmake it less expensive by investing in preventive care to bring down \nthe long-term cost of keeping our citizens well, not to mention \neliminating waste and fraud from our system.\n  And if you like your doctor and your insurance plan, and you are \nworried about keeping it, the worst thing in the world you could do \nwould be to stand in the way of reform. The Affordable Health Choices \nAct guarantees that you won't see your insurance be taken away at the \nmoment you need it most or watch as it is priced out of your family's \nbudget.\n  Whether you have insurance or not, whether you like your health care \noptions or not, whether you are sick or healthy, Democrat or \nRepublican, working-class or a small business owner, reform is for you.\n  Let us take action on behalf of the 14,000 Americans who will lose \ninsurance tomorrow. Let us take action on behalf of the 45 million \nuninsured and the 30 million underinsured. Let us take action on behalf \nof the American people who are looking to us to succeed.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to the \nunique health care challenges faced by the 62 million Americans who \nlive in rural America.\n  If you took a snapshot of rural America, you would see a population \nthat is older, poorer, and has less access to health care than other \nplaces in the country. Because many rural residents are elderly, they \nneed more health care services.\n  However, rural residents have greater transportation difficulties \nreaching health care providers and often have to travel long distances \nto reach a doctor or hospital. Very few public transportation systems \nare available, and so many folks wait until they are very sick before \nturning to the health care system. This makes the already challenging \njob of managing chronic conditions even more difficult. Rural areas \nreport higher rates of chronic conditions, including heart disease and \ncancer. One contributing factor to these chronic conditions is the \nhigher obesity and smoking rates of children and adults who reside in \nrural areas.\n  Compounding the problem, rural residents also tend to be poorer and \nmake on average $7,000 less per year than their urban counterparts. \nNearly 24 percent of children who live in rural America are in poverty. \nPoverty affects the types of foods being offered at the dinner table as \nthe price of fruits and vegetables can often bust a tight food budget.\n  It can also force people to put off medical care. According to a \nrecent study, rural residents are more likely than their urban \ncounterparts to report having deferred care because of cost. It can be \na vicious cycle.\n  While health coverage is vitally important to these rural residents, \nthe greatest crisis is access to care. We could give health insurance \nto everyone, but if your county has no doctor or hospital, the best \ninsurance will make little difference. This is a simple concept, but an \nimportant one.\n  In rural America, the cornerstone of the health care delivery system \nis the critical access hospital. These hospitals, made up of 25 beds or \nless, provide the most basic access to medical services and serve as a \nrural safety net for emergency services. Of the 90 hospitals in \nNebraska, 65 of them are critical access hospitals. Clearly their \nimportance in rural America cannot be overstated.\n  However, it is difficult for many rural hospitals to keep their doors \nopen. One reason is that there is less patient volume than in many \nurban settings. In addition, Medicare payments to rural hospitals and \nphysicians are dramatically less than those to their urban counterparts \nfor equivalent services. This correlates closely with the fact that \nmore than 470 rural hospitals have closed in the past 25 years.\n  Rural areas also struggle to keep other aspects of their health care \ninfrastructure in place. For example, 20 percent of counties in \nNebraska do not have a local pharmacist who can fill prescription \nmedications for their residents. I could go on and on with a similar \nstory on home health services, long term care, durable medical \nequipment, and other critical health care services.\n  However, one of the biggest challenges facing rural America is \ndifficulty recruiting and retaining health care professionals. Medical \nprofessionals sometimes do not want to set up practice where doctors \nare few and major metropolitan hospitals require hours of travel. \nCurrently, 50 million Americans who live in rural America face \nchallenges in accessing health care. There are too few providers to \nmeet their basic primary care needs. According to the U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services, while a quarter of the population lives \nin rural areas, only ten percent of physicians practice there. There \nare over 2,000 health professional shortage areas in rural and frontier \nareas of all States and U.S. territories compared to 910 in urban \nareas. Ninety out of 93 Nebraska counties are facing health care \nprofession shortages in one or more areas of practice.\n  Unless something is done to address this problem, the situation will \nalmost surely become a crisis. This scenario is quickly appearing on \nthe horizon as rural America has a higher percentage of physician \ngeneralists who are nearing retirement than urban areas.\n  Fewer doctors and lack of health care access could decimate rural \nresidents and their rural communities. Young families will not move to \na place where they cannot access health care for their children, and \nolder residents will be forced to move to places where they can find \ncare.\n  This potential rural reality has major implications for the rest of \nthe country and will affect the health and\n\n[[Page S8757]]\n\nwell being of everyone. For example, rural America produces the food \nand the fiber that our country needs to survive. Young farmers and \ntheir families will not come back to live and work in an area where \nthey cannot receive health services should an accident or sickness \noccur. The farming profession is already a gamble and not having access \nto health care is something most people aren't willing to risk. If \npeople are forced to leave rural America due to lack of health care, \nthen a whole new set of challenges will arise that we are not currently \nprepared to address. Any health care solutions or reforms must account \nfor current rural health care system realities and future challenges.\n  I have long said that the best solutions originate outside the \nbeltway, the same holds true with health care. Blanket policies crafted \nfrom within the DC beltway do not always meet the needs of Nebraskans. \nIn fact, they often add additional burdens onto the current system and \ncompromise the ability to access quality health care.\n  That is why I encourage my colleagues crafting health care reform \nlegislation to incorporate the solutions offered in the Craig Thomas \nRural Hospital and Provider Equity Act. I am a sponsor of this \nlegislation and look forward to a number of its provisions being \nenacted.\n  Additionally, I hope any health care reform will offer critical \naccess hospitals flexibility in determining their bed count to account \nfor seasonal and emergency situations which might affect admissions \nrates. Any comprehensive legislation must address the unique payment \nissues facing rural hospitals like reimbursing them for lab services \nprovided in nursing homes and rural health clinics, and increasing \nMedicare payment rates for rural health clinics. Finally, legislation \nshould extend the rural community hospital demonstration project and \nprovide incentives to encourage providers to practice in physician \nscarcity areas.\n  The health care delivery system in rural America is already stressed. \nWe cannot afford a big mistake with health care reform, because if we \nget it wrong, the fragile rural health care delivery system may never \nrecover. Mark my words; if we enact policies that drive providers and \nfacilities out of business, no one is waiting in the wings to take \ntheir place. Therefore, I urge caution and thorough debate of all \nhealth care reform proposals as unintended consequences must be \nminimized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/04/senate-section/article/S8757-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING SENATOR NORM COLEMAN\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our former \ncolleague, Norm Coleman.\n  Norm once said, ``It is easy to criticize, particularly in a \npolitical season. But to lead is something altogether different. The \nleader must live in the real world of the price that might be paid for \nthe goal that has been.''\n  Norm Coleman is a leader. Norm or, more importantly, his character \nendured one of the most difficult elections in the history of the \nSenate, and came out standing taller in the eyes of many. It is not \neasy to lose. But it is so much harder to maintain your dignity in the \nface of defeat, which Norm has done.\n  Having spent most of his life as a Democrat, Norm is what we would \ncall a ``late bloomer.'' I also started out as a Democrat and voted for \nJimmy Carter in 1976. In 1996, Norm realized that the path of the \nDemocrat Party was paved for other people, not him. He joined the \nRepublican Party to share in our vision to keep taxes low, reform \neducation, and grow jobs.\n  Norm more than adhered to this vision while in the Senate; he became \na powerful voice on these issues. He also established himself as a \nfierce advocate for renewable energy. Norm fought for tax incentives \nthat would strengthen the development of renewable energy across our \ncountry. He saw renewable energy as the key to greater national \nsecurity and economic stimulus.\n  Norm also introduced legislation that would wean our Nation off our \ndangerous reliance on Middle Eastern oil by placing a greater emphasis \non increasing renewable fuel infrastructure and alternative fuel \ntechnologies. His legacy will continue to thrive as we move our country \ncloser to energy independence, through innovation, not government \nhandouts.\n  Norm's leadership did not end at the shores of our Nation. He \nestablished himself as a true voice in foreign policy issues by \nexposing the corruption that was rife throughout the U.N.'s Oil for \nFood program and becoming a fierce advocate for our servicemen and \nwomen.\n  However, all of this pales in comparison to the legacy that he will \nleave in Minnesota. Throughout his entire Senate career, he never lost \ntrack of the voices of his constituents and the promises he made to \nthem on the campaign trail.\n  His greatest legacy, perhaps, will be bringing hockey back to \nMinnesota. Minnesota will enjoy the fruits of his labor for years to \ncome.\n  I consider Norm a friend and someone whom I respect and admire.\n  Norm, we will miss you dearly. I wish you much success in the future \nknowing that great things lie ahead of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/04/senate-section/article/S8757-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING BILL ANTON\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a brave \nAmerican, William Anton. As a man of remarkable courage, strength, and \nconviction, Bill is receiving an extraordinary honor in the U.S. Army \nRanger community by being inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame. Bill \nwill go down in the history books as the first Nevadan to ever receive \nthis recognition.\n  As the son of an Army officer, Bill found his choice to continue the \nfamily tradition quite natural, but fate was needed to further solidify \nhis commitment.\n  An ROTC scholarship to the University of Nebraska put Bill on the \nfootball team, but a football-ending knee injury put Bill right where \nhe was supposed to be, as a fulltime Army cadet. Bill was soon promoted \nto cadet major general, making him the highest ranking ROTC cadet in \nthe United States with over 20,000 cadets under his command.\n  According to Bill, life has been a constant pursuit of challenging \nendeavors saying, ``In everything I've done, I always wanted to \nchallenge myself to see if I could accomplish the most demanding tasks \nor courses--whether it was in the Army or in my academic pursuits.''\n  And challenge himself he did. As a defender of our Nation's freedom \nin the Vietnam war, Bill guided the most decorated combat Ranger unit \nin Vietnam, Company H, Ranger, 75th Infantry, Airborne. While Vietnam \nwas seen as a controversial war back home, Bill's role to defend \nfreedom was never a doubt in his mind.\n  Bill joined the Rangers because they are one of the toughest military \norganizations in our Nation's history, and as a member of the Ranger \nHall of Fame, history will remember Bill as one of our greatest \nwarriors. For it was the Rangers that accomplished some of the most \ndemanding and impossible tasks, and as a member of this elite group of \nsoldiers, Bill exemplified their requirements of high intellect, \nphysical strength, stamina, and bravery.\n  Bill's own words describe him the best: ``My entire career was full \nof fond memories. I sought demanding assignments to challenge myself. \nServing my country as a professional soldier and Officer is the highest \nform of public service. It is full of selfless duty and devotion to our \nnation--defense of our people and the supreme document--the \nConstitution.

Mr. President, this morning I was saddened by the news\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\nthat my friend Jim Ingram, who served so well and courageously as \ncommissioner of the Department of Public Safety of Mississippi, had \npassed away. He lost a long battle with cancer.\n  Jim was a retired FBI agent who was in charge of the civil rights \nunit that supervised the investigation and assisted in the prosecution \nof crimes by Klansmen and others who were charged with violence and \nmurder in our State during the civil rights movement. He was a man of \ngreat courage, with a strong sense of purpose, whose warm and friendly \npersonality make him easy to like and respect. The people of my State \nwill long remember and appreciate his valuable contributions to peace \nand public safety.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of his obituary, as it appeared \nin today's Clarion-Ledger, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       James O. ``Jim'' Ingram, retired FBI agent and former \n     Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety, passed away \n     at Hospice Ministries in Ridgeland, Mississippi on Sunday, \n     August 2, 2009, after a long battle with cancer.\n       Visitation will be held at Christ United Methodist Church \n     in Jackson, Mississippi on Wednesday, August 5, 2009, from 5 \n     pm until 7 pm and from 9 am until 10:30 am on Thursday, \n     August 6, 2009. Reverend Vicki Landrum will officiate over \n     the service, which will be held at Christ United Methodist \n     Church on Thursday at 10:30 am. The burial service will \n     follow at Parkway Memorial Cemetery on Highland Colony \n     Parkway in Ridgeland, Mississippi.\n       Wright and Ferguson Funeral Home is assisting with the \n     arrangements. Born January 22, 1932, in Henryetta, Oklahoma, \n     Jim Ingram was a long time resident of the Jackson Metro \n     area. Jim Ingram joined the FBI in 1953, and was with the FBI \n     for over thirty (30) years in several capacities, such as \n     Deputy Assistant Director in Washington, with duties \n     supervising all FBI criminal investigations. He also was \n     Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the New York and Chicago FBI \n     offices. Mr. Ingram traveled worldwide for the FBI to places \n     such as France, Canada, Mexico, and most of Central and South \n     America. Some famous FBI cases which he commanded were: The \n     Guyana Jim Jones case where over 1,000 people committed \n     suicide at the request of their leader, Jim Jones, and the \n     investigation into the assassination of Federal Judge John H. \n     Woods in Texas, where a hired assassin killed the federal \n     judge. Drug lords were arrested for this crime.\n       Jim Ingram was also in charge of the FBI's Mississippi \n     Civil Rights Unit in the 1960's, supervising the \n     investigation and assisting in the successful prosecution of \n     Edgar Ray Killen and other Klansmen who killed the three \n     civil rights workers in the ``Mississippi Burning Case'' in \n     Neshoba County, Philadelphia, Mississippi. Mr. Ingram also \n     supervised the investigation and assisted in the prosecution \n     of James Ford Seale for violent deaths committed in \n     Mississippi. In June 1996, Mr. Ingram represented Mississippi \n     in a meeting at the White House hosted by the President and \n     Vice President on church burnings.\n       After retiring from the FBI, he served ten (10) years as \n     Senior V.P., Director of Security for Deposit Guaranty \n     National Bank. He served as Commissioner of Public Safety for \n     eight years commanding the Mississippi Highway Patrol, \n     Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics, and six other divisions. He \n     served the State's second longest tenure in this capacity and \n     said ``these were some of the happiest times of my life.'' He \n     was well known throughout the U.S. in law enforcement \n     receiving several awards such as being honored with the Civil \n     Rights Award in September 2006 in Boston, Massachusetts by \n     the International Association of Chiefs of Police for the \n     solution of the ``Mississippi Burning Case'' and was \n     appointed as a Member by the Harvard University Associates in \n     Police Science. Jim was active in the business community \n     having served as President of the Jackson Rotary Club, the \n     largest civic club in Mississippi.\n       Jim Ingram is survived by his loving wife, Marie, of 58 \n     years; his three sons, Steven W. Ingram and his wife, Brenda, \n     Madison, Mississippi, Stanley T. Ingram and wife, Terri, \n     Edwards, Mississippi, and James M. Ingram and wife, Janice, \n     Madison, Mississippi, and fifteen (15) grandchildren and \n     great grandchildren, all of whom have given him the love of \n     his life.\n       His three sons, Steve, Stan and Jim, stated their dad \n     enjoyed helping others. They have been amazed over the years \n     of the caliber of people across the U.S. that sought his \n     advice and wisdom. Their dad would tell them ``Kindness is \n     something you cannot give away. It always keeps coming \n     back.''\n       Before his death, Jim Ingram stated that he could never \n     repay the kindness shown to him, his wife Marie, and family \n     from neighbors, Peter DeBeukelaer and wife, Mireille, Dr. \n     Greg Fiser and wife, Robin, Billy Powell and his wife, \n     Barbara, Rusty Fulton and his wife, Sandy, Bob Lunardini and \n     his wife, Susan, and Federal Judge Neal O'Lack and his wife, \n     Rebecca.\n       Mr. Ingram gives special thanks to Dr. Cindy Wright and her \n     husband Sam Wright for their kindness and support. Special \n     thanks to the men and women of the FBI across the country and \n     to former SAC Joe Jackson, Col.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 100th \nanniversary of an Oregon icon the Tillamook County Creamery \nAssociation, makers of Tillamook Cheese.\n  Since 1909, this world-famous, farmer-owned cooperative has been \ndedicated to producing the highest quality cheeses and other products \nfrom local dairies that have thrived in the lush coastal valleys around \nthe community of Tillamook, OR. Tillamook Cheese is not just a \ncommercial enterprise. It is the proud symbol of a way of life that has \nbeen passed on for generations.\n  The members of the Tillamook County Creamery Association have been \nmainstays of the local and state dairy industries and committed \nstewards of the environment. They employ more than 600 people at two \nfactories in Oregon and have annual sales of nearly $400 million.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues from the great State of \nWisconsin, Tillamook is cheese. Over the years, the Tillamook County \nCreamery Association has won hundreds of awards, including six at the \n2009 Oregon Dairy Industries products contest and six at the 2008 \nNational Milk Producers Association. It has also been recognized by the \nPortland Business Journal for the third year in a row as one of \nOregon's ``Most Admired Companies.''\n  For decades, the Tillamook Cheese Factory has been a must-see stop \nfor millions of tourists who travel highway 101. In recent years, the \ncreamery association has expanded to other parts of the State, but its \ntraditions are deeply rooted in the pastures and dairies that make \nTillamook County and Tillamook Cheese what it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/04/senate-section/article/S8758-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/04/senate-section/article/S8758-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  In executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate a \nmessage from the President of the United States submitting a nomination \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/04/senate-section/article/S8758-4", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 3435.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe percentage depletion allowance for certain hardrock mines, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \neliminate from the Federal tax code the ``Percentage Depletion \nAllowance'' for hardrock minerals mined on Federal public lands. I want \nto thank Senators Cantwell, Feinstein, and Sanders for joining me in \nintroducing this legislation.\n  The Elimination of Double Subsidies for the Hardrock Mining Industry \nAct of 2009 would result in estimated savings of at least $250 million \nover 5 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Under this \nlegislation, half of these savings would be returned to the Federal \ntreasury and half would help address the serious contamination at the \nthousands of abandoned mines throughout the U.S.\n  Percentage depletion allowances were initiated by the Corporation \nExcise Act of 1909. That's right, these allowances were initiated 100 \nyears ago. Provisions for a depletion allowance based on the value of \nthe mine were made under a 1912 Treasury Department regulation, but \ndifficulty in applying this accounting principle to mineral production \nled to the initial codification of the mineral depletion allowance in \nthe Tariff Act of 1913. The Revenue Act of 1926 established percentage \ndepletion much in its present form for oil and gas. The percentage \ndepletion allowance was then extended to metal mines, coal, and other \nhardrock minerals by the Revenue Act of 1932, and has been adjusted \nseveral times since.\n  Percentage depletion allowances were historically placed in the tax \ncode to reduce the effective tax rates in the mineral and extraction \nindustries far below tax rates on other industries, providing \nincentives to increase investment, exploration, and output. The \nproblem, however, is that percentage depletion also makes it possible \nto recover many times the amount of the original investment.\n  There are two methods of calculating a deduction to allow a firm to \nrecover the costs of its capital investment: cost depletion and \npercentage depletion. Cost depletion allows for the recovery of the \nactual capital investment--the costs of discovering, purchasing, and \ndeveloping a mineral reserve--over the period during which the reserve \nproduces income. Under the cost depletion method, the total deductions \ncannot exceed the original capital investment.\n  Under percentage depletion, however, the deduction for recovery of a \ncompany's investment is a fixed percentage of ``gross income,'' namely, \nsales revenue from the sale of the mineral. Under this method, total \ndeductions typically exceed the capital that the company invested. The \nset rates for percentage depletion are quite significant. Section 613 \nof the Internal Revenue Code contains depletion allowances for more \nthan 70 metals and minerals, at rates ranging from 10 to 22 percent.\n  There is no restriction in the tax code to ensure that over time \ncompanies do not deduct more than the capital that they have invested. \nFurthermore, a percentage deduction allowance makes sense only so long \nas the deducting company actually pays for the investment for which it \nclaims the deduction.\n  The result is a double subsidy for hardrock mining companies: first \nthey can mine on public lands for free under the General Mining Law of \n1872, and then they are allowed to take a deduction for capital \ninvestment that they\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\nhave not made for the privilege to mine on public lands. My legislation \nwould eliminate the use of the Percentage Depletion Allowance for \nmining on public lands, while continuing to allow companies to use the \nreasonable cost depletion method for determining tax deductions.\n  My bill would also create a new fund, called the Abandoned Mine \nReclamation Fund. Half of the revenue raised by the bill, or \napproximately $125 million dollars, would be deposited into an \ninterest-bearing fund in the Treasury to be used to clean up abandoned \nhardrock mines in states that are subject to the 1872 Mining Law. \nThough there is no comprehensive inventory of abandoned mines, \nestimates put the figure at upwards of 100,000 abandoned mines on \npublic lands.\n  There are currently no comprehensive Federal or State programs to \naddress the need to clean up old mine sites. Reclaiming these sites \nrequires the enactment of a program with explicit authority to clean up \nabandoned mine sites and the resources to do it. My legislation is a \nfirst step toward providing the needed authority and resources.\n  In today's budget climate, we are faced with the question of who \nshould bear the costs of exploration, development, and production of \nnatural resources: the taxpayers, or the users and producers of the \nresource? For more than a century, the mining industry has been paying \nnext to nothing for the privilege of extracting minerals from public \nlands and then abandoning its mines. Now those mines are adding to the \nNation's environmental and financial burdens. We face serious budget \nchoices this fiscal year, and one of those choices is whether to \ncontinue the special tax breaks provided to the mining industry.\n  The measure I am introducing is straightforward. It eliminates the \nPercentage Depletion Allowance for hardrock minerals mined on public \nlands while continuing to allow companies to use the reasonable cost \ndepletion method for determining tax deductions.\n  Though at one time there may have been an appropriate role for a \ngovernment-driven incentive for enhanced mineral production, the \narguments in favor of a more reasonable depletion allowance that is \nconsistent with depreciation rates given to other businesses are \noverwhelming. This corporate subsidy is simply not justified.\n  I thank the following organizations for endorsing this legislation: \nEARTHWORKS, Environmental Working Group, Friends of the Earth, National \nWildlife Federation, Pew Environment Group, Taxpayers for Common Sense, \nTheodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Trout Unlimited, and the \nWestern Organization of Resource Councils.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1571. A bill to provide for a land exchange involving certain \nNational Forest System land in the Mendocino National Forest in the \nState of California, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Deafy \nGlade Land Exchange Act. This legislation would authorize a land \nexchange between the U.S. Forest Service and Solano County to help \nensure the continued operation of the juvenile correctional facility \nand add nearly 80 acres of wilderness quality land to the Mendocino \nNational Forest.\n  Nearly 10 years ago at the suggestion of the Forest Service, Solano \nCounty purchased more than 160 acres of wilderness quality land within \nthe Mendocino National Forest--known as Deafy Glade--with the intention \nof exchanging the land for the Fouts Springs Ranch. This legislation \nwould facilitate that exchange, so that the counties could own the land \nbeneath the facility they operate, and in exchange, the Forest Service \nwould acquire a wilderness quality inholding.\n  Solano County currently operates a youth correctional facility under \na Special Use Permit issued by the Forest Service on the Fouts Springs \nRanch, which covers approximately 82 acres within the boundaries of the \nMendocino National Forest. Solano County owns the infrastructure but \nleases the land from the Forest Service.\n  Solano County has operated the Fouts Springs Youth Facility pursuant \nto a joint powers agreement with Yolo and Colusa counties since 1959. \nThe program includes counseling and education, with the goal of giving \njuveniles the skills to successfully reenter their communities.\n  More than 20 California counties have placed juvenile offenders at \nFouts Springs for 6 month, 9 month, or one year periods. The program is \nviewed as a last resort for youth before being referred to a State \nprison.\n  Specifically, the legislation I am offering today would authorize the \ntransfer of Fouts Springs Ranch--approximately 82 acres--from the \nForest Service to Solano County; and the transfer of more than 160 \nacres of the Deafy Glade area in Mendocino National Forest from Solano \nCounty to the Forest Service.\n  The Fouts Spring youth correctional facility is in need of \nsubstantial upgrades, including the replacement of the main water line, \nelectrical system improvements, and renovation of one of the \ndormitories. However, the County has postponed investing in facility \nupgrades until the land exchange is finalized and ownership of the \nFouts Springs Ranch is transferred to the County.\n  Given the substantial investment already made by Solano County and \nthe importance of the youth rehabilitation services provided by Fouts \nSprings, I believe the time has come to finalize this land exchange.\n  This legislation would not only help ensure the continued operation \nof the Fouts Spring youth correctional facility but it would also add \nnearly 80 acres of wilderness quality land to the Mendocino National \nForest.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1571\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the city of Hermiston, Oregon, water recycling and reuse \nproject, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide more clean water for the City of Hermiston, for irrigators in \nthe area and for the Umatilla River. It is good for farmers, fish and \nin-stream flows.\n  My legislation amends the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act--P.L. 102-575--to authorize the City of \nHermiston, OR, to participate in what is known as the Title XVI water \nreclamation program. This long-standing U.S. Bureau of Reclamation \nprogram encourages the reclamation and use of municipal, industrial and \nagricultural waste water. In this case, the City of Hermiston will \ntreat municipal waste water and deliver it to a local irrigation \ndistrict--the West Extension Irrigation District--for agricultural use. \nMy bill is a companion bill to legislation already introduced for this \nsame purpose in the House of Representatives by Representative Greg \nWalden, H.R. 2714. As with other Title XVI projects, this legislation \nwould authorize the Bureau to assist the City in developing this \nproject and provide a cost-share of 25 percent for the project.\n  The current Hermiston Water Plant discharges ``Class C'' water that \ncan be used only for a limited amount of off-project pastureland \nirrigation or discharged into the Umatilla River. Beginning in December \n2010, a new National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System limit will \ngo into effect, changing the water temperature and pollutants \nrequirements of treated water being put back into the river. Although \nthe city is currently in compliance, once the new limits take effect, \nthe city's current plant will not allow the city to meet the new \nrequirements. As a result, the city will need to construct a new \ntreatment plant, but it would still have difficulty meeting the water \ntemperature requirements.\n  An upgrade of the plant would not only bring the city into compliance \nwith the new discharge requirements, but it would increase the quality \nof the recycled water output from ``Class C'' water to ``Class A'' \nwater, making it suitable for all irrigation needs, not just \npastureland. Further, the proposed new plant would be configured to \ndischarge its treated water to the West Extension Irrigation District, \na Bureau of Reclamation-supported irrigation project. This will \nsignificantly increase the amount of water available to the District \nand will have a beneficial, long-term impact on a regional farming \ncommunity that faces dwindling water supplies. Acreage available to \nutilize the city's recycled water discharge would increase from roughly \n550 acres to nearly 11,000 acres.\n  Finally, by ending the discharge of warmer, lower quality water into \nthe Umatilla River, the project will improve the habitat for wildlife \nand fish in the River, especially for endangered and threatened \nspecies. I am pleased that the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla \nIndian Reservation, which has fishing rights in the Umatilla River, \nsupports the city's efforts in this regard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 1574. A bill to establish a Clean Energy for Homes and Buildings \nProgram in the Department of Energy to provide financial assistance to \npromote residential-, commercial-, and industrial-scale energy \nefficiency and on-site renewable technologies; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1574\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Energy for Homes and \n     Buildings Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) homes and commercial or industrial buildings in the \n     United States consume significant quantities of energy, \n     including energy for electricity and heating, the generation \n     or combustion of which creates significant quantities of \n     greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (2) in most cases, energy efficiency is the most cost-\n     effective and rapidly deployable strategy for reducing \n     greenhouse gas emissions, energy demand, and the need for \n     long-distance transmission of energy;\n       (3) on-site renewable energy generation reduces greenhouse \n     gas emissions, demand on the electricity transmission grid, \n     and the need for long-distance transmission of energy;\n       (4) many energy efficiency measures and on-site renewable \n     energy generation systems produce a net cost savings over the \n     course of the useful life of the measures and systems, and \n     often over a shorter time frame, but the initial expense \n     required to purchase and install the measures and systems is \n     often a significant barrier to widespread investment in the \n     measures and systems;\n       (5) financial products, financing programs, and other \n     programs that reduce or eliminate the need for the initial \n     expense described in paragraph (4) can permit building owners \n     to invest in measures and systems that reduce total energy \n     costs and realize net cost savings at the time of the \n     installation of the measures and systems, defer capital \n     expenditure, and enhance the value, comfort, and \n     sustainability of the property of the owners; and\n       (6) State and local governments, utilities, energy \n     efficiency and renewable energy service providers, banks, \n     finance companies, community development organizations, and \n     other entities are developing financial products and programs \n     to provide financing assistance for building owners to \n     encourage the use of the measures and systems described in \n     paragraph (4), including programs that allow repayment of \n     loans under programs described in paragraph (5) through \n     utility bills, or through property-based assessments, taxes, \n     or charges, to facilitate loan repayment for the benefit of \n     building owners and lenders or program sponsors.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to encourage widespread \n     deployment of energy efficiency and on-site renewable energy \n     technologies in homes and other buildings throughout the \n     United States through the establishment of a self-sustaining \n     Clean Energy for Homes and Buildings Program that can--\n       (1) encourage the widespread availability of financial \n     products and programs with attractive rates and terms that \n     significantly reduce or eliminate upfront expenses to allow \n     building owners (including homeowners, business owners, \n     owners of multifamily housing, owners of multi-tenant \n     commercial properties, and owners of other residential, \n     commercial, or industrial properties) to invest in energy \n     efficiency measures and on-site renewable energy systems with \n     payback periods of up to 25 years or the useful life of such \n     a measure or system by providing credit support, credit \n     enhancement, secondary markets, and other support to \n     originators of the financial products and sponsors of the \n     financing programs; and\n       (2) help building owners invest in measures and systems \n     that reduce energy costs, in many cases creating a net cost \n     savings that can be realized in the short-term, and may also \n     allow building owners to defer capital expenditures and \n     increase the value, comfort, and sustainability of the \n     property of the owners.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Cost.--The term ``cost'' has the meaning given the term \n     in section 502 of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 \n     U.S.C. 661a).\n       (2) Direct loan.--The term ``direct loan'' has the meaning \n     given the term in section 502 of the Federal Credit Reform \n     Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661a).\n       (3) Loan guarantee.--The term ``loan guarantee'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 502 of the Federal Credit \n     Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661a).\n       (4) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Clean Energy \n     for Homes and Buildings Program established by section 6.\n       (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Energy.\n       (6) Security.--The term ``security'' has the meaning given \n     the term in section 2 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 \n     U.S.C. 77b).\n       (7) State.--The term ``State'' means--\n       (A) a State;\n       (B) the District of Columbia;\n       (C) the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\n       (D) any other territory or possession of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 5. CLEAN ENERGY FOR HOMES AND BUILDINGS GOALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall develop and \n     publish for review and comment in the Federal Register near-, \n     medium-, and long-term goals (including numerical performance \n     targets at appropriate intervals to measure progress toward \n     those goals) for--\n       (1)(A) a minimum number of homes to be retrofitted through \n     energy efficiency measures or to have on-site renewable \n     energy systems added;\n       (B) a minimum number of other buildings, by type, to be \n     retrofitted through energy efficiency measures or to have on-\n     site renewable energy systems added; and\n       (C) the number of on-site solar energy, wind energy, and \n     geothermal heat pump systems to be installed; and\n       (2) as a result of those retrofits, additions, and \n     installations--\n       (A) the quantity by which use of grid-supplied electricity, \n     natural gas, home heating oil, and other fuels will be \n     reduced;\n       (B) the quantity by which total fossil fuel dependence in \n     the buildings sector will be reduced;\n       (C) the quantity by which greenhouse gas emissions will be \n     reduced;\n       (D) the number of jobs that will be created; and\n       (E) the estimated total energy cost savings for building \n     owners.\n       (b) Estimates by Originators or Sponsors.--The Secretary \n     may rely on reasonable estimates made by originators of \n     financial products or sponsors of financing programs for \n     tracking progress toward meeting the goals established under \n     this section instead of requiring building owners to monitor \n     and report on the progress.\n\n     SEC. 6.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to ensure that \nexcess oil and gas lease revenues are distributed in accordance with \nthe Mineral Leasing Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nNaval Oil Shale Reserve Mineral Royalty Revenue Allocation Act. It is a \nbill designed to release mineral royalty receipts to Colorado where the \nreceipts were generated from gas development within this reserve on the \nwestern slope near Rifle, Colorado.\n  By way of background, in 1997, Congress transferred the federal Naval \nOil Shale Reserve lands in western Colorado from the U.S. Department of \nEnergy, DOE, to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, BLM, and directed \nthe BLM to begin leasing the oil and gas resources under these lands. \nThe Transfer Act also directed that the royalties recouped from this \nleasing program be set aside and the state portion not disbursed to \nColorado until the Interior Department and the DOE certified that \nenough money from the royalty receipts accrued to satisfy two purposes.\n  The first was to provide funding to clean up the Anvil Points site on \nthese lands. Anvil Points was an oil shale research facility that \noperated within the Naval Oil Shale Reserve for about 40 years. The \nfacility was operated by DOE at one point, and private industry \nperformed research there under contract. Waste material was produced at \nthis facility from oil shale mining and processing. That waste \naccumulated in a pile of about 300,000 cubic yards of spent oil shale \nand other material--including arsenic and other heavy metals--which \nrests on slopes below the facility.\n  The second purpose was for the reimbursement of certain costs related \nto the transfer.\n  Following the transfer to the BLM, this area experienced significant \nnatural gas leasing and, as a result, significant royalty revenue was \ngenerated.\n  On August 8, 2008, the DOI and DOE certified that adequate funds had \naccrued to accomplish the goals of cleanup and cost reimbursement and \nsubsequently allocated all royalty revenue generated after this date \naccording to the Mineral Leasing Act, which establishes that Colorado \nreceive a proportionate share.\n  However, considerably more revenue accrued than was necessary to \naccomplish the cleanup and cost reimbursement goals. This bill would \ndirect that this additional royalty revenue be allocated to Colorado \naccording to the formulas and processes established for the \ndisbursement of federal mineral royalties under the Mineral Leasing \nAct.\n  The bill also directs that the Colorado share of this remaining \nroyalty revenue be allocated to the two Counties directly impacted by \noil and gas leasing on the Naval Oil Shale Reserve lands--specifically, \nGarfield and Rio Blanco Counties. The bill further requires that the \nroyalties be used to address these impacts through activities such as \nland and water restoration, road repair, and other capital improvement \nprojects.\n  Based on figures provided by the BLM, there remains approximately $17 \nmillion in these accounts for Colorado's royalty revenue share. This \nbill would make Colorado whole and provide it with its rightful share \nof the remaining royalty revenue to address critical local needs and \nimpacts from the very leasing that produced the royalty revenue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was orderd to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1575\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF OIL SHALE RESERVE RECEIPTS.\n\n       Section 7439(f) of title 10, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3)(A) The moneys deposited in the Treasury under \n     paragraph (1) that exceed the amounts described in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) shall be \n     transferred by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance \n     with section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 191) to \n     the State of Colorado for use in accordance with subparagraph \n     (B).\n       ``(B) Amounts transferred to the State of Colorado under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be used by the State and political \n     subdivisions of the State for--\n       ``(i) conservation, restoration, and protection of land, \n     water, and wildlife resources affected by oil or gas \n     development activities in Garfield and Rio Blanco Counties in \n     the State;\n       ``(ii) repair, maintenance, and construction of State and \n     county roads in each of those counties; and\n       ``(iii) the conduct of capital improvement projects \n     (including the construction and maintenance of sewer and \n     water treatment plants) that are designed and carried out to \n     address the impacts of oil and gas development activities in \n     each of those counties.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Sanders, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1576. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish \na carbon incentives program to achieve supplemental greenhouse gas \nemission reductions on private forest land of the\n\n[[Page S8772]]\n\nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will establish a Forest Carbon Incentives Program to help \nAmerica's family forest owners slow climate change by increasing carbon \nsequestration and storage on private forestland. This will be critical \nfor our national climate change response, and will create important \neconomic opportunities for landowners across America. I want to thank \nmy colleagues, Senators Snowe, Collins, Sanders, Merkley, Wyden, Leahy \nand Schumer, with whom I have worked closely to draft this bill. I also \nwant to acknowledge Senator Stabenow, who has long provided leadership \non this issue of carbon sequestration.\n  This legislation is driven by a simple fact: we cannot achieve our \ngreenhouse gas reduction goals without comprehensive and effective \nutilization of U.S. forests for carbon sequestration. The U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency estimates that U.S. forests currently \nsequester a remarkable 10 percent of our annual U.S. carbon emissions. \nEven more remarkably, the EPA estimates that we could double this \nsequestration capacity to 20 percent of emissions with the right \nmanagement and conservation.\n  Unlike some of our emerging energy technologies, forest carbon \nsequestration is a climate strategy that is ready to go to work right \nnow on meeting our emissions reduction goals. We can immediately put \nforest owners to work on their lands undertaking activities to help \nmove us to that 20 percent sequestration goal, and create new revenue \nstreams for those small and family landowners to help them navigate \nthrough these troubled economic times.\n  One important pathway to achieve these forest carbon sequestration \ngoals will be through carbon offset markets. For those able to \nparticipate, carbon offset programs will provide important financial \nincentives for projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions while, at \nthe same time, helping to keep the costs of a climate program low. The \nopportunity to earn offset credits will create a financial incentive \nfor large forest landowners to undertake activities that increase \ncarbon sequestration and storage on their lands and that can be \nmeasured and verified with the precision necessary to meet rigorous \nenvironmental integrity requirements.\n  However, offset markets will not be easily accessible to the many \nfamily forest owners and other smaller landowners who do not have the \nnecessary economies of scale to effectively participate in offset \nmarkets. Offset projects come with many upfront and ongoing \ntransactional expenses that will undermine financial gains and \nconstrain the flexibility that family forest owners and other smaller \nscale landowners will require to participate.\n  Furthermore, there are some important types of carbon sequestration \nand storage activities, such as permanent conservation easements, that \nproduce real carbon gains over the long term but are hard to quantify \nwith the precision necessary for offset markets.\n  We also need to engage the full range of carbon strategies to meet \nour carbon sequestration goals, even if they cannot conform to the \nrequirements of offsets.\n  Engaging family forest owners in sequestration is no small piece of \nthe forest carbon equation--America's family forest owners control more \nthan half of all U.S. private forestland, with 119 million acres in \nownerships of 100 acres or less. We must create new tools to engage \nthese individuals in efforts to sequester carbon and provide economic \nopportunities to gain financial incentives for doing that work.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, our forests embody this diverse \nownership pattern and the unique opportunity to address climate change \nthrough forest carbon incentives. New Hampshire is the second most \nforested state in the nation, and more than 80 percent of that \nforestland is in private hands. We do have some large private \nownerships, including large blocks of working forestland. But most of \nour privately owned forestland is in small ownerships--averaging 37.5 \nacres. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 49 percent of New \nHampshire's forestland, 2,358,000 acres, is in family ownership, with \n124,000 family forest owners in the Granite State.\n  If these landowners could aggregate their capacity to store carbon on \nthe 2 million acres they own, they could make a significant \ncontribution to needed reductions in the presence of carbon dioxide in \nour atmosphere. Each year New Hampshire forests already take up by \nphotosynthesis 25 percent of the total CO2 emitted by the State from \nman-made sources.\n  But we can capture even more carbon in our Nation's forests with the \nright incentives like those in our proposed program. Creating \nincentives for forest carbon would represent a win-win for New \nHampshire and a win-win in every State in the Nation that has privately \nowned forested landscapes.\n  Simply, the Forest Carbon Incentives Program will provide financial \nincentives for small private forest owners to engage in carbon \nsequestration activities and help our country meet its desired carbon \nreduction goals. The Forest Carbon Incentives Program will be run \nthrough the U.S. Forest Service and State forestry agencies. These \nexperienced forest professionals will work with interested private \nforest owners to develop a ``climate mitigation contract'' for \nundertaking forest management activities that will increase carbon \nabsorption and storage. Incentives will be awarded on a straightforward \n``practices per acre'' basis, giving landowners a clear and simple \nagreement and reliable incentive payments. Carbon reductions achieved \nthrough these practices are not required to be permanently stored, so \nlandowners will retain more flexibility with future management \ndecisions. This simple and efficient program structure will enable \nlandowners at any scale to participate, especially family forest owners \nholding smaller parcels that are unlikely to participate in carbon \noffset markets.\n  The program will create additional incentive opportunities for \ninterested landowners to protect carbon gains achieved through a \nclimate mitigation contract. Landowners can gain ``bonus'' incentive \npayments for also undertaking management that addresses pests, fire, \nand other threats that could damage forests and release the carbon that \nhas been stored there. Landowners can also be paid for a permanent \nconservation easement that will assure that their lands in the program \nwill never be developed, thereby protecting the carbon in those \nforests.\n  This legislation already enjoys support from a broad spectrum of \nnational organizations that care about America's forests, such as the \nAmerican Forest Foundation, the National Association of State \nForesters, The Trust for Public Land, the National Wildlife Federation, \nand The Nature Conservancy among many others. Of equal importance, it \nhas earned broad support from local, state, and regional interest \ngroups, including the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire \nForests, New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association, Northland Forest \nProducts, Appalachian Mountain Club, and a host of other leading forest \norganizations in my home state.\n  America must use every tool available to address climate change, and \nshould especially favor strategies that are ready to go now and that \ncreate new economic opportunities. This legislation will provide both a \nmeaningful climate mitigation strategy and create real jobs in the \nwoods. I encourage my fellow Senators to consider it carefully.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1576\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

More than one and a half million Americans have earned the \nPurple Heart Medal, and this is just one more way we can honor their \nservice.\n  The Purple Heart Medal is awarded in the name of the President, and \nit designates those servicemembers who have been wounded in the service \nof our Nation during combat or an act of terrorism. Many recipients \nhave paid the ultimate sacrifice, and it is a symbol of true \nselflessness. The brave men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces today \nvolunteer knowing full well the hazards of their chosen profession. On\n\n[[Page S8779]]\n\nAugust 7, 2009, all Americans should be encouraged to learn about the \nsignificance of the Purple Heart, honor those selfless citizens who \nwear the award and bear the proud scars earned in service protecting \nand defending our Nation.\n  Today, there are approximately 550,000 Purple Heart recipients still \nliving in the United States. I am sure that each Member of this body \nknows someone in their respective States who is a Purple Heart \nrecipient, the family member of a recipient, or the friend of a \nrecipient. A day of recognition is the least we can do to honor those \nwho have been awarded this medal for serving our country.\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, I want to discuss the nomination of \nJudge Sotomayor to be Associate Justice. I want to begin by saying that \nI have a lot of respect for her. I think she is an incredibly talented \nindividual who has worked very hard and has had an extraordinary life \nstory. I am impressed with the way Judge Sotomayor was able to beat the \nodds and reach new heights. Unfortunately, as I voted in committee, I \nvote on the floor. I cannot support her nomination because of my \nconcerns with her judicial philosophy.\n  There are a number of qualifications a Supreme Court nominee should \nhave: a superior intellect, distinguished legal experience, integrity, \nproper judicial demeanor, and temperament. But the most important \nqualification of a Supreme Court nominee is truly understanding the \nproper role of a Justice as envisioned by our great Constitution. In \nother words, a Justice must have the capacity to faithfully interpret \nthe law and Constitution without personal bias or prejudice.\n  It is critical that judges have a healthy respect for the \nconstitutional separation of power and the exercise of judicial \nrestraint. Judges must be bound by the words of the Constitution and \nlegal precedent. Because the Supreme Court has the last word as far as \nwhat the lower court says, Justices are not constrained like judges in \nthe district and appellate courts. In other words, the Supreme Court \nand its Justices have the ability to make precedent. Because there is \nno backstop to the Supreme Court, Justices are accountable to no one. \nThat is why we must be certain these nominees will have the self-\nrestraint to resist interpreting the Constitution to satisfy their \npersonal beliefs and preferences. A nominee to the Supreme Court must \npersuade us that he or she is able to set aside personal feelings so he \nor she can blindly and dispassionately administer equal justice for \nall.\n  That is what I was looking for when I reviewed Judge Sotomayor's \nrecord. That is what I was looking for when I asked Judge Sotomayor \nquestions both at the hearing and in writing. Unfortunately, I now have \nmore questions than answers about Judge Sotomayor's judicial \nphilosophy. I am not convinced that the judge will be able to resist \nhaving her personal biases and preferences dictate her judicial methods \nwhen she gets to the Supreme Court.\n  I find it very troubling that President Obama is changing the \nstandard by which our country's Federal judges are selected. Instead of \nsearching for qualified jurists who can be trusted to put aside their \npersonal feelings in order to arrive at a result required by the law, \nPresident Obama has said he is looking for a judge who has ``empathy,'' \nsomeone who will embrace his or her personal biases instead of \nrejecting them.\n  This concept represents a very radical departure from the normal \ncriteria for selecting Federal judges and Supreme Court Justices. In \nhis statement opposing the confirmation of Chief Justice John Roberts, \nthen-Senator Obama compared the process of deciding tough cases in the \nSupreme Court--can you believe it--comparing it to a marathon. He said:\n\n       That last mile can only be determined on the basis of one's \n     deepest values, one's core concerns, one's broader \n     perspective on how the world works and the depth and breadth \n     of one's empathy. . . . Legal process alone will not lead to \n     you a rule of decision. . . . [i]n those difficult cases the \n     critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge's \n     heart.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from then-Senator Obama.\n  Until now, judges have always been expected to apply law evenhandedly \nand to reach the result that the law requires. When speaking about the \nlaw, lawyers and judges often talk about what the law is or what the \nlaw requires, instead of what the law should be. We expect judges not \nto confuse the two. We expect judges not to bend the law in order to \nreach a result that they would want personally instead of what the law \nrequires. We expect judges not to decide cases in favor of a particular \nlitigant because he or she may be more worthy of compassion. We don't \nask what the judge's heart says about a particular case of a legal \nissue. We ask what the law says.\n  A mandate of judicial empathy turns that traditional legal concept on \nits head in favor of a lawless standard. If empathy for a litigant's \nsituation becomes a standard for deciding cases, then there is no limit \nto the effect on American jurisprudence. If a judge's decision in the \nhard cases is supplied by the content of his or her heart, then that \ndecision cannot be grounded upon objective legal principles. If the \nlast mile that then-Senator Obama referred to is determined by a \njudge's deepest feelings instead of legal precedent, then the outcome \nwill differ based on which judge hears the case. Predictably and \nconsistently, hallmarks of the American legal system will be sacrificed \non the altar of judicial persuasion and compassion.\n  When a judge improperly relies on his or her personal feelings \ninstead of relying solely on the law, it leads to creation of bad \nprecedent. If a judge's decision is affected by his or her empathy or \nsympathy--whatever you want to say--for an affected party or group, \nthen the law of unintended consequences dictates that others will be \naffected in the future, beyond the present case, and they will be \njudged by a standard that should not be applied to them because of what \na previous judge did about personal sympathy instead of what the law \nsays.\n  Justice is blind. Empathy is not. Empathetic judges take off the \nblindfolds and look at the party instead of merely weighing the \nevidence in light of what the law is. Empathetic judges put their \nthumbs on the scales of justice, altering the balance that is \ndelicately crafted by the law. Empathetic judges exceed their role as \npart of the judicial branch and improperly take extraneous, nonlegal \nfactors into consideration. That is why President Obama's judicial \nstandard of empathy is problematic, and why we should be cautious in \ndeferring to his choices for the judicial branch.\n  Judge Sotomayor's speeches and writings reveal a judicial philosophy \nthat bestows a pivotal role to personal preferences and beliefs in her \njudicial method--although Judge Sotomayor attempted to spin away her \nstatements. At her confirmation hearing I had difficulty reconciling \nwhat she said at the hearing with statements she has repeated so often \nthroughout the years. That is because the statements made at the \nhearing and those speeches and law review articles outside the hearing \ncannot be reconciled.\n  Since 1994, the judge has given a number of speeches where she \nresponded to a remark by Justice O'Connor that a judge's gender should \nbe irrelevant to judicial decisionmaking process. Judge Sotomayor said \nthat she ``hope[d] that a wise Latina woman . . . would more often than \nnot reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that \nlife.''\n  This statement suggests, very contrary to the Constitution, that race \nand gender influence judicial decisions and that some judges can reach \na ``better conclusion'' solely on the basis of belonging to a \nparticular demographic.\n  When questioned about this issue, Judge Sotomayor initially stood by \nher words, saying that they were purposefully chosen to ``inspire the \nstudents to believe that their life experience would enrich the legal \nsystem,'' and that it was merely their context that ``ha[d] created a \nmisunderstanding.''\n  Even if that were the case, repeatedly misrepresenting to her \naudience one of the most fundamental principles of our judicial system \ndemonstrates inappropriate and irresponsible behavior for a judge. \nHowever, Judge Sotomayor proceeded to contradict those very words by \nsaying that she ``does not believe that any ethnic, racial, or gender \ngroup has an advantage in sound judging,'' and claimed that her \ncriticism was actually agreeing with Justice\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\nO'Connor's argument, saying the words she used ``agree[d] with the \nsentiment that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was attempting to convey.'' \nI fail to see how Judge Sotomayor can reconcile her views with those of \nJustice O'Connor because it is clear that they stand in direct \ncontradiction to each other.\n  The judge continued to confuse us, claiming that hers and Justice \nO'Connor's words ``literally made no sense in the context of what \njudges do.'' Assuming that Judge Sotomayor truly does agree with \nJustice O'Connor, then I find it troubling that she doesn't recognize \nthat it is important for judges to understand their gender and \nethnicity should have no bearing on their judicial decisions.\n  Moreover, the judge contradicted herself again when she later \nattempted to brush aside these remarks, claiming that they were a \n``rhetorical flourish'' and ``can't be read literally.'' However, if \nshe truly believed that these words ``fell flat,'' why would she \ncontinue to use the same words on at least four more separate \noccasions?\n  Some of my colleagues claim that the significance of Judge \nSotomayor's ``wise Latina'' statement has been exaggerated. \nUnfortunately, we are not concerned with just one statement. The judge \nhas a record of freely articulating a judicial philosophy at odds with \nthe fundamental principles of our legal system.\n  Justice Story once said that, without justice being impartially \nadministered:\n\n       Neither our persons nor our rights nor our properties can \n     be protected.\n\n  That is the end of Justice Story's quote.\n  In her opening testimony Judge Sotomayor appeared to agree with \nJustice Story, saying she seeks to strengthen ``faith in the \nimpartiality of our justice system.'' However, that statement is \ncontradicted by her long history of expressing skepticism toward \njudicial neutrality and impartiality. In at least four separate \nspeeches Judge Sotomayor said that ``the aspiration to impartiality is \njust that--it's an aspiration.''\n  It is easy for a nonlawyer like me to become very cynical when I hear \nthat. But when questioned about that statement, Judge Sotomayor argued \nthat she ``wasn't talking about impartiality [being] impossible'' and \ntried to reconcile her views as ``talking about academic question.''\n  In other speeches, the judge also expressed skepticism with Judge \nCedarbaum's belief that judges must transcend their personal sympathies \nand prejudices, saying that she ``wonder[ed] whether achieving that \ngoal is possible in all, or even most cases.''\n  That is enhancing my cynicism.\n  At the hearing, Judge Sotomayor failed to sufficiently explain those \ntroubling remarks. Instead, she departed from the clear meaning of her \nwords, arguing that they were actually intended ``to make sure that one \nunderstood that a judge always has to guard against those things \naffecting the outcome of a case.''\n  Once again, her contradictory interpretation of her own words makes \nme question her sincerity and candor with our committee.\n  In another speech in a law journal article, Judge Sotomayor declared \nthat she ``willingly accept[s] '' that judges ``must not deny the \ndifferences resulting from experiences and heritage, but attempt, as \nthe Supreme Court suggests, continuously to judge when those opinions, \nsympathies and prejudices are appropriate.''\n  So I am concerned that these words radically depart from the bedrock \nprinciple of judicial impartiality that judges swear to uphold when \nthey take their oath of office.\n  When questioned about these words, Judge Sotomayor made the far-\nfetched claim that her words were actually ``talking about the very \nimportant goal of the justice system to ensure that personal biases and \nprejudices of a judge do not influence the outcome of the case.'' Once \nagain, I fail to see how Judge Sotomayor can reconcile both of those \nstatements.\n  Furthermore, her statement is especially concerning within the \ncontext of other ideas she expressed in the same ``Raising the Bar'' \nspeech. That is her title of her speech, ``Raising the Bar.''\n  For example, Judge Sotomayor openly questioned whether ``ignoring our \ndifferences as women, men or even people of color, will do a disservice \nboth to the law and to society.'' Reason to be cynical, once again. \nThis is yet another example of an out-of-the-mainstream judicial \nphilosophy. The majority of Americans understand that allowing \nphysiological differences to influence judging is a disservice to the \nlaw and demonstrates a blatant lack of regard for the principle of \nblind justice.\n  At the hearing, the judge attempted to justify her words as simply \npart of an ``academic discussion.'' Contrary to the plain meaning of \nher words, she claimed that she was not encouraging or attempting to \nencourage the belief that ``personal characteristics'' and \n``experiences'' should drive the result.\n  These excuses ring hollow and contradict other parts of the same \nspeech where she declared, ``I accept there will be some differences in \nmy judging based on my gender and my Latina heritage.''\n  Similarly and even more concerning, she expressed in that speech on \nat least five other occasions that ``I accept the proposition that a \ndifference there will be by the presence of men and women, people of \ncolor on the bench, and that my experiences affect the facts I choose \nto see as a judge.''\n  When explaining those remarks at the hearing, the judge continued to \ndisplay troublesome evasiveness, claiming that she ``did not intend to \nsuggest that it is a question of choosing to see some facts or \nanother.''\n  Taken together, I remain unconvinced that Judge Sotomayor's history \nof freely delivered speeches demonstrates an appropriate understanding \nof the importance of approaching the law neutrally and upholding \njudicial impartiality. I am also concerned that over the past 13 years \nthe judge has articulated that judges play a role as a policymaker.\n  At a Duke University panel discussion she claimed that, ``The court \nof appeals is where policy is made.''\n  Likewise in her Suffolk University law review article, the judge \nembraced the notion that judges should encroach on the constitutional \npower of legislatures by changing the law to adapt to social needs. She \nlamented that ``our society would be straitjacketed were not the \ncourts, with the able assistance of the lawyers, constantly overhauling \nthe law and adapting to the realities of ever-changing social, \nindustrial and political conditions.''\n  And in the same article, the judge noted that ``a given judge or \njudges may develop a novel approach to a specific set of facts or legal \nframework that push the law in a new direction.''\n  I thought that was part of our checks and balances system of \ngovernment. That is why we had a separate legislature, to make policy. \nBecause if a Supreme Court Justice makes policy, they have got a \nlifetime position. You cannot vote them out of office, whereas if we \nmake wrong policy, our constituents have an opportunity at every \nelection to put us out on the street.\n  So not understanding the proper role of a Justice is a problem for \nme. Even more alarming is that the judge has, on multiple occasions, \nexpressed her own personal role in shaping policy in the bench. When \ndescribing the role of judges in a November 2000 speech before the \nLitigators Club, the judge stated, ``Our decisions affect not only the \nindividual cases before us, but the course of litigation and the \noutcomes of many similar cases pending. This fact has made me much more \naware of the policy impact of the decisions I have drafted or worked \non.''\n  In at least two other speeches, the judge told her audience, ``I wake \nup each morning excited about the prospects of engaging in the work \nthat fulfills me and gives me the chance to have a voice in the \ndevelopment of the law.''\n  These statements demonstrate either a lack of understanding or a \nblatant disregard for the proper constitutional role of judges. Rather \nthan seriously addressing this aspect of her judicial philosophy at her \nconfirmation hearing, the judge capriciously changed her views. She \nappeared to retract all of her previous statements by telling Senator \nCoburn that ``judges do not make law,'' and in responding to my \nquestions about vacuums in the law by saying that judges are ``not \ncreating law.''\n  I find these statements disingenuous because in her posthearing \nwritten responses, the judge endorsed her previous views by justifying \njudges who\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\n``apply broadly written statues by filling in gaps in the laws \naccording to their personal common sense.''\n  This is troubling because judges who fail to uphold their \nconstitutional role and impose their own policy preferences undermine \ndemocracy and undermine our checks and balances system of government.\n  Also, I was disturbed by Judge Sotomayor's general lack of candor at \nthe hearing. Throughout her testimony, she repeatedly contradicted \nstatements she had openly and unequivocally expressed on numerous \noccasions from her own bench. Even the Washington Post characterized \nJudge Sotomayor's hearing testimony as ``less than candid,'' and \n``uncomfortably close to disingenuous.''\n  That is not a Republican Senator making the statement, that is the \nWashington Post, one of the guardians of democracy, as the first \namendment allows newspapers to be.\n  For example, despite her 7-year history of telling at least six \ndifferent audiences that ``my experiences affect the facts I choose to \nsee as a judge,'' and, `` I accept there will be some differences in \njudging based on my gender and my Latina heritage,'' she also told us, \n``I do not permit my sympathies, personal views, or prejudices to \ninfluence the outcome of my cases.''\n  Likewise, when I questioned her about whether it was ever appropriate \nfor judges to allow their own identity politics to influence their \njudgment, the judge answered ``absolutely not.''\n  While I agree with her answer, it is still troubling and significant \nthat it completely contradicts her previously expressed views. I find \nit interesting that she appears to have had a sudden confirmation \nconversion.\n  I am also concerned about Judge Sotomayor's involvement with the \nPuerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund and her denials that she \ndid not work on matters in a substantive or policy role relative to \ncontroversial issues during her tenure at that organization.\n  During her supervision of this Defense and Education Fund, the \norganization took a number of radical positions on abortion, including \nthe view that abortions on demand could not be restricted for any \nreason; that taxpayers should be required to pay for abortions; and \nthat parents did not have the right to even be notified if their minor \ndaughter was going to get an abortion.\n  I find it hard to believe that the chair of the litigation committee \nof the organization had no substantive or policy involvement in the \nformulation of these legal briefs.\n  Even when asked whether these positions were extreme and allowed an \nopportunity to disavow them, Judge Sotomayor refused to do that.\n  I also was dismayed that the judge was not straightforward about her \nphilosophy toward the use of foreign law. In a recent speech before the \nACLU of Puerto Rico, the judge advocated and justified American judges \nusing such foreign law. She told her audience that, ``International law \nand foreign law will be very important in the discussion of how to \nthink about the unsettled issues in our own legal system.''\n  She went on to say, ``To suggest to anyone that you can outlaw the \nuse of foreign or international law is a sentiment that's based on a \nfundamental misunderstanding . . . nothing in the American legal system \nstops us from considering those ideas.''\n  As examples of using foreign law to strike down American statutes, \nshe favorably cited Roper v. Simmons and Lawrence v. Texas, saying the \ncourts were using foreign law to ``help us understand whether our \nunderstanding of our own constitutional rights fell into the mainstream \nof human thinking.''\n  However, at the hearing, Judge Sotomayor contradicted herself saying, \n``Foreign law cannot be used . . . to influence the outcome of a legal \ndecision interpreting the Constitution or American law.''\n  Which Sotomayor, comparing those two quotes, is going to judge from \nthe bench of the Supreme Court? In that same speech, Judge Sotomayor \nalso openly disapproved criticisms by Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas \non the use of foreign law saying she shared the ideas of Justice \nGinsburg that, ``Unless American courts are more open to discussing the \nideas raised by foreign cases, and by international cases, then we are \ngoing to lose influence in the world,'' and, ``foreign opinions . . . \ncan add to the story of knowledge relevant to the solution of a \nquestion.''\n\n  However, at the hearing, Judge Sotomayor reversed herself, claiming \nthat she ``actually agreed with Justice Scalia and Thomas on the point \nthat one has to be very cautious even in using foreign law with respect \nto things American law permits you to.''\n  So, once again, comparing those two statements, which Sotomayor view \nis going to be used on the bench of the Supreme Court? Once again, \neither Judge Sotomayor's beliefs were extremely short lived, or she \nfailed to openly present her true opinions during her hearings.\n  A few days after testifying that, ``Foreign law could not be used to \ninterpret the Constitution and the statutes,'' Judge Sotomayor \nadvocated her previous beliefs that, ``Decisions of foreign courts can \nbe a source of ideas in forming our understanding of our own \nconstitutional rights'' and ``to the extent that the decisions of \nforeign courts contain ideas that are helpful to that task, American \ncourts may wish to consider those ideas.''\n  Supporters of Judge Sotomayor discount her controversial statements \nand writings made over the years as a sitting judge and urge us to look \nat her judicial record. So I have had the opportunity to do that, and \nam still not convinced. I participated in the confirmation hearing and \nlistened to her discuss her cases. For the most part, Judge Sotomayor \nrefused to give a clear answer to our questions and in the end left us \nwith more questions than we had before the hearing started.\n  Most lawyers understand that hard cases say the most about a judge. \nAnd as we all know, the Supreme Court only takes hard cases. Yet those \nare the kinds of cases that raise the most concerns about the judge and \nwhat she will do if she is confirmed to the highest Court.\n  Statements she made at the hearing raise concerns that she will \ninappropriately create or expand rights under the Constitution. \nFurther, some of her cases raise questions about whether she will \nimpose her personal policy decisions instead of those of the \nlegislative or executive branch.\n  Moreover, Judge Sotomayor's record with the Supreme Court is \nunimpressive. When the Supreme Court reviewed her work, it rejected her \noutcome 8 out of 10 times and disagreed with her analysis on another \none of those cases. I am not sure a 1 in 10 record warrants elevation \nto the Nation's highest Court.\n  What is troubling to me is how Judge Sotomayor has handled cases of \nfirst impression or important constitutional issues that have appeared \nbefore her on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I am concerned that \nshe dismisses cases with cursory analysis in order to obtain a \npolitically desired result.\n  The firefighters case Ricci v. City of New Haven is a case that \nshould not be overlooked in an examination of Judge Sotomayor's \njudicial philosophy. Judge Sotomayor admittedly is opposed to and has \nlitigated against standardized tests because she believes they are \nracially biased. This is the background she brought to the Ricci case, \nwhich she dismissed without writing an opinion. But the fortunes of the \nfirefighters changed when Judge Cabrenas discovered the case by reading \nthe local newspaper. Judge Cabrenas recognized that a detailed analysis \nof this case would serve a jurisprudential purpose and wanted the \nSecond Circuit to reconsider it. The Second Circuit voted 7-6 not to \nreconsider this important case, with Judge Sotomayor casting the \ndeciding vote. One has to question whether Judge Sotomayor allowed her \npersonal biases against standardized test to seep into her \ndecisionmaking process. Although Judge Sotomayor continued her efforts \nto sweep this case under the rug, the firefighters, because Judge \nCabrenas highlighted the importance of the case in a dissenting \nopinion, were able to justify appealing to the Supreme Court.\n  The Supreme Court issued an opinion which held that there was no \n``strong basis in evidence'' to support the ruling made by Judge \nSotomayor. All nine Justices rejected the legal reasoning applied by \nJudge Sotomayor's three judge panel. Justice Alito summarized the case \nbest in his concurring opinion,\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\nwhere he stated ``a reasonable jury could easily find that the City's \nreal reason for scrapping the test results was not a concern about \nviolating the disparate impact provision of Title VII, but a simple \ndesire to please a politically important racial constituency.'' As \nsuch, ``Petitioners were denied promotions for which they qualified \nbecause of the race and ethnicity of the firefighters who achieved the \nhighest scores on the City's exam.'' As to Judge Sotomayor's expressed \nempathy for ruling against the firefighters, Justice Alito wrote:\n\n       the dissent grants that petitioners' situation is \n     ``unfortunate'' and that they ``understandably attract this \n     Court's sympathy.'' But ``sympathy'' is not what petitioners \n     have a right to demand. What they have a right to demand is \n     evenhanded enforcement of the law--of Title VII's prohibition \n     against discrimination based on race. And that is what, until \n     today's decision, has been denied them.\n\n  At the hearing, I wasn't persuaded by Judge Sotomayor's claims that \nshe followed precedent in reaching her decision. I also was not \nconvinced with Judge Sotomayor's explanation about why she dismissed \nthis case with no legal analysis. I was left with the impression that \nJudge Sotomayor either she didn't understand the importance of the \nclaims before her, or she issued a ruling based on her own personal \nbiases.\n  Some colleagues argue that her critics can only point to one \ncontroversial case over a 17-year career on the Federal bench. That is \nnot quite accurate, because there are several of her decisions that \nraise concerns.\n  For example, Judge Sotomayor issued another troubling decision in \nDidden v. Village of Port Chester, where Mr. Didden presented evidence \nthat local government officials attempted to extort him in exchange for \nnot seizing his property. When Mr. Didden refused to be extorted, the \nVillage took his property and gave it to another private developer. \nThis case was on the heels of the Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. \nCity of New London, which held that the government is not ``allowed to \ntake property under the mere pretext of a public purpose, when its \nactual purpose is to bestow a private benefit.'' Yet Judge Sotomayor \ndismissed Mr. Didden's claim with a one paragraph opinion.\n  I asked Judge Sotomayor about the Didden case, but wasn't satisfied \nwith her answers. First, she inaccurately characterized the Supreme \nCourt's holding in Kelo. I was also troubled with her failure to \nunderstand that her decision expanded the ability of State, local, and \nFederal governments to seize private property under the Constitution. \nFurther, she told me that she had to rule against Mr. Didden because he \nwas late in filing his claim. Mr. Didden had 3 years to file his claim. \nHe filed it January 2004, 2 months after he was approached with what he \nclassified as an extortion offer. Judge Sotomayor told us that Mr. \nDidden should have filed his claim in July 2002, before he was extorted \nand before he knew the city was going to take his property in November \n2003. This is simply not a believable outcome, especially in a one \nparagraph opinion, where it was never explained to Mr. Didden why the \ngovernment could take his property. I specifically asked her how Mr. \nDidden could have filed his claim before he knew he had a claim. Judge \nSotomayor did not answer this question directly, but the net result is, \nas Professor Somin stated, property owners in this situation will never \nbe able to have their day in court:\n\n       the panel's ruling that [the plaintiffs] were required to \n     file their claims before their property was actually \n     condemned creates a cruel Catch-22 dilemma . . . If [the \n     plaintiffs] had filed a Takings Clause claim before their \n     property was condemned, it would have been dismissed because \n     it was not yet ``ripe''). . . It is surely both perverse and \n     a violation of elementary principles of due process to rule \n     that the government can immunize unconstitutional \n     condemnations from legal challenge simply by crafty timing.\n\n  There might not be a decision more disturbing than Judge Sotomayor's \nsummary dismissal in Maloney v. Cuomo. If this summary dismissal is \nallowed to stand, the right to bear arms as provided for in the second \namendment will be eviscerated. Instead of carefully considering whether \nthe District of Columbia v. Heller case properly left open the question \nof whether owning a gun is a fundamental right, Judge Sotomayor in one \nparagraph held that it is settled law that owning a firearm is not a \nfundamental right. The Supreme Court noted in Heller that it declined \nto address the issue of whether owning a firearm was a fundamental \nright. At the hearing, I was concerned with Judge Sotomayor's \nexplanation of her holding that the second amendment is not \n``fundamental'' and her refusal to affirm that Americans have a right \nof self-defense. In my mind, and I think anyone who reads the second \namendment, when the Supreme Court does consider this issue, we will \nfind that Judge Sotomayor was once again on the wrong side of an \nopinion.\n  So based on her answers at the hearing and her decisions, writings \nand speeches, I am not convinced that Judge Sotomayor has the right \njudicial philosophy for the Supreme Court. I am not convinced that she \nwill be able to set aside her personal biases and prejudices and decide \ncases in an impartial manner based upon the Constitution. I am \nconcerned about Judge Sotomayor's dismissive handling of claims raising \nfundamental constitutional rights--I am not convinced that she will \nprotect those rights, nor am I convinced that she will refrain from \ncreating new rights. For these reasons, I must vote against her \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/04/senate-section/article/S8783-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
