Madam President, the Senate's confirmation hearing for \nGen. David Petraeus is now underway. Seeing Gen. Petraeus should remind \nall of us of the successful counterinsurgency campaign he led in Iraq \nand of the sacrifices made by coalition forces there before and after \nthe surge of forces in 2007. Regimental and brigade combat teams \nprotected the population and fought hard battles while a \ncounterterrorism campaign, led by General McChrystal, was conducted \nagainst insurgent leaders.\n  Today's hearing also reminds us of the divisive debate that preceded \nthat successful counterinsurgency campaign and of the skepticism and \ncriticisms leveled against General Petraeus by some of our colleagues \nacross the aisle at the time.\n  Fortunately, the critics did not prevail, either in their attacks on \nGeneral\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\nPetraeus or in their calls for a hasty withdrawal of troops based on \npolitical timelines rather than the security and stability of Iraq.\n  If we learned anything from that debate, it is that our national \nsecurity and the stability of the region outweigh short-term political \ncalculations.\n  It is clear that our Nation's efforts must be integrated in \nAfghanistan, just as they were in Iraq. It is worth remembering our \nforces in Afghanistan have been conducting a counterterrorism campaign \nfor more than 8 years, and this has been insufficient to keep the \nTaliban from regaining the momentum in Afghanistan. American and Afghan \nsecurity forces must do more to ensure the Afghan populace that it will \nbe protected, something undermined by withdrawal deadlines.\n  The surge of forces into Afghanistan ordered by the President is not \nyet complete. General Petraeus is the right General to command this \noperation and he should be confirmed quickly.\n  Madam President, my understanding is that the senior Senator from \nWashington has a unanimous-consent request she would like to propound.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I thank the Republican leader.\n  I came to the floor last week and spoke in support of S. 1237, which \nis the Homeless Veterans and Other Veterans Health Care Authorities Act \nof 2010, an extremely important and timely bill that will help many \nwomen, women with children, and men with children today who served our \ncountry, who have come home and do not have the support and services \nthey need and end up homeless on our streets. So I come to the Senate \nfloor today to urge our colleagues to pass this bill quickly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 360, S. 1237, the Homeless Veterans and \nOther Veterans Health Care Authorities Act; that the committee-reported \nsubstitute amendment be considered; that an Akaka amendment, which is \nat the desk, be agreed to; the substitute amendment, as amended, be \nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; that \nthe committee-reported title amendment be agreed to; and that the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill have to object on behalf of my colleague, Senator Coburn from \nOklahoma, he has some concerns about this legislation, particularly, as \nhe indicates in a letter I will ask to have printed in the Record, that \nit be paid for up front so the promises to America's veterans are, in \nfact, kept. So I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Senator \nCoburn to myself on this matter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2010.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am requesting that I be consulted \n     before the Senate enters into any unanimous-consent \n     agreements regarding S. 1237, the Homeless Veterans and Other \n     Veterans Health Care Authorities Act of 2010.\n       I strongly believe we must honor our commitment to our \n     nation's veterans as well as our taxpayers. This means we \n     must fulfill the promises made to veterans who made \n     sacrifices defending our freedom, but in a fiscally \n     responsible manner that doesn't bankrupt our country, \n     endangering those very freedoms for which they sacrificed.\n       This bill authorizes $3.4 billion in new spending over the \n     next five years. Yet, the legislation does not reduce \n     spending by other government programs to pay for this new \n     spending. At this time, when our nation is projected to add \n     more than a trillion dollars a year to our already \n     unsustainable $13 trillion national debt, it is irresponsible \n     to authorize any new spending that is not paid for because \n     the end result will either be a false promise to our veterans \n     or a lower standard of living for the children and \n     grandchildren of those veterans who will be burdened with the \n     debt.\n       I would like to pay for this legislation by reducing lower \n     priority and wasteful spending elsewhere in the government. \n     There are many options to do this, including:\n       Eliminating nonessential government travel which would save \n     $10 billion over ten years;\n       Reducing unnecessary printing costs of government documents \n     which would save $4.4 billion over ten years;\n       Disposing of unneeded and unused government property which \n     would collect up to $15 billion;\n       Eliminating bonuses to government contractors whose \n     projects are over budget or behind scheduled;\n       Collecting $3 billion in unpaid federal taxes from \n     government employees, including nearly $2.5 million owed by \n     Senate staff; and\n       Rescinding the $100 million increase Congress approved for \n     its own budget this year.\n       There are also hundreds of duplicative, outdated, and \n     wasteful programs that could be eliminated to pay for this \n     bill.\n       Several months ago, the Senate passed S. 1963, the \n     Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act, which \n     authorized $3.6 billion in new caregiver benefits for some \n     veterans. At that time, I warned that unless they bill was \n     paid for--which I offered amendments to do its--passage would \n     be ``an empty promise to veterans and benefits no one except \n     perhaps the career politicians who will claim credit for \n     doing something to help veterans without really having to \n     make any difficult choices.'' Unfortunately, I was right.\n       The same is likely to be true of this bill. It contains \n     billions of dollars of additional promises which are \n     unaffordable to taxpayers and uncertain for veterans in need.\n       Veterans and taxpayers should be weary of unpaid for, \n     election year promises made by Washington politicians. With \n     the percentage of Americans approving of Congress' \n     performance barely above single digits, more broken promises \n     and red ink will only bring greater disdain to this \n     institution.\n       I would, therefore, insist as a condition of my consent for \n     the passage of this bill that the new and expanded benefits \n     in this legislation be paid for upfront so the promises it \n     makes to veterans are kept.\n       Again, thank you for protecting my rights regarding S. \n     1237, the Homeless Veterans and Other Veterans Health Care \n     Authorities Act of 2010.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Tom A. Coburn, M.D.\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I again thank the Republican leader. I \nknow he is objecting on behalf of another Senator. I just wish to say \nthat this is such an important bill.\n  We had an amazing woman come and visit last week. Her name is \nNatalie, and she has two young children. She is living in Issaquah, in \nmy home State of Washington. She has been through some very tough \ntimes. She is a Navy veteran. She is a single mom. She came home from \nserving our country and ended up without a place to live, and they are \nnow living on the streets. She, like any mom, wanted to do everything \nshe could to take care of her kids and provide them the kind of quality \nof life every one of us does, but she could not find a stable job or \nincome and ended up on the streets.\n  Natalie became homeless in 2007 when she could not find work and had \nto move out of the house she was staying in.\n  Natalie wanted nothing more than to provide her two children with the \nstable and loving home every family deserves, so she fought to secure \ntransitional housing, and she was very fortunate to find a program \ncalled Hopelink in Washington State that gave her the support she \nneeded to get back on her feet.\n  Natalie is now back in stable housing, taking care of her children \nand advancing in her nursing career. She came to Washington, DC, last \nTuesday to help make sure no other family has to face the challenges \nshe overcame so bravely.\n  Unfortunately, not every family gets the support that Natalie's did.\n  Homeless women veterans and homeless veterans with children are two \nterribly vulnerable groups that are growing by the day.\n  Back in my home State of Washington, veterans service organizations \nand homeless providers have told me they are seeing more homeless \nveterans coming for help than ever before.\n  And unfortunately, more and more of these veterans are women, have \nyoung children, or both.\n  In fact, female veterans are between two and four times as likely to \nbe homeless as their civilian counterparts and they have unique needs \nand often require specialized services.\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\n  That is why I introduced the Homeless Women Veterans and Homeless \nVeterans with Children Act and it is why it's so important that we move \nquickly to pass it.\n  My bill would take three big steps forward toward tackling the \nserious problems facing this vulnerable group.\n  First of all, it would make more front-line homeless service \nproviders eligible to receive special needs grants.\n  This would help organizations in Washington State and across the \ncountry help support families like Natalie's.\n  It would also expand special needs grants to cover homeless male \nveterans with children as well as the dependents of homeless veterans \nthemselves.\n  And it would extend the Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans \nReintegration Program to provide: workforce training, job counseling, \nchild care services, and placement services to homeless women veterans \nand homeless veterans with children,\n  It is so important that we not just provide immediate support but we \nalso make sure our veterans have the resources and support they need to \nget back on their feet.\n  This is a very personal issue for me.\n  Growing up, I saw firsthand the many ways military service can affect \nboth veterans and their families.\n  My father served in World War II and was among the first soldiers to \nland on Okinawa. He came home as a disabled veteran and was awarded the \nPurple Heart.\n  Like many soldiers of his generation, my father did not talk about \nhis experiences during the war. In fact, we only really learned about \nthem by reading his journals after he passed away.\n  And I think that experience offers a larger lesson about veterans in \ngeneral. They are reluctant to call attention to their service, and \nthey are reluctant to ask for help.\n  That is why we have got to publicly recognize their sacrifices and \ncontributions.\n  It is up to us to make sure that they get the recognition they have \nearned.\n  And it is up to us to guarantee they get the services and support \nthey deserve.\n  This bill passed through the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee with \nstrong bi-partisan support.\n  Because supporting our veterans should not be about politics, it \nshould be about what kind of country we want the United States to be. \nAnd about what our priorities are as a nation.\n  That is why I am proud to stand here today: for Natalie, her \nchildren, and families just like hers across the country.\n  At this time, with our economy struggling--it is a very tough time, \nparticularly for our veterans who are returning home--the most \nvulnerable population today is our women because many of the \ntransitional housing and projects for our veterans don't have \nfacilities for women or for women with children or, as a matter of \nfact, for men who are veterans coming home to young children.\n  So this is an extremely important piece of legislation. This had \nbipartisan support coming out of our committee. I will keep coming to \nthe floor to ask for unanimous consent because I cannot go home and \nlook at someone who served our country with distinction and honor who \ntoday is living on the street because the Senate is objecting. I will \njust let my colleagues know I will keep working on this because it is \nthe right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5505-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to give the Senate a \nreport on the gulf oilspill.\n  Mother Nature is now developing hurricane and it is very likely \nwithin a couple of days of reaching hurricane strength, which is 75 \nmiles per hour or greater, but Mother Nature is smiling on us in that \nit is going on a more westerly track. It will probably go into the \ncoast at northern Mexico, possibly southern Texas, but it will keep it \naway from heading into the area to the east of Louisiana where the \noilspill is. Of course, if it had gone on that trajectory, then one of \nthe worst nightmares would be that it takes all that oil on the \nsurface, and in the rage of a hurricane, the counterclockwise rotation \nof the winds would take that right on to shore over the barrier \nislands, into the bays and estuaries where oil, once contaminating all \nthe marsh grasses, becomes so difficult to get out.\n  The effects of that we don't know. It could be for years to come, \njust as we don't know the effects of the subsurface oil that is there, \nthat the scientists have identified, that BP denies, that even some of \nour Federal officials in NOAA deny. We are waiting on their report. Of \ncourse, we won't know the effects of that for years. We have a lot of \nuncertainty here. But at least for the moment, the hurricane is not \nbearing down on the oilspill, although let me remind my colleagues that \nwe have a very active hurricane season coming up.\n  What it is going to do, this first hurricane, is make the seas choppy \nand the waves large, even that far away. As a result, the skimming \noperations are going to be thwarted.\n  That brings me to the topic of the skimming operations.\n  I am grateful, since the U.S. Navy had identified 27 additional small \nskimmers that are stationed in ports around the country, that those \nhave now been tasked to come to our inland waterways that are calm \nwaters such as ports so that when the oil comes through the passes, \nthrough the inlets and gets into those calm water bays, we will have \nthose skimmers there positioned to try to get it skimmed up before it \ngets into the marsh grasses. But why did it take so long? Why, of the \n27, have only 9 been put on trailers and are on their way to the gulf? \nWhy are the remaining 18 having to go through the legal ramifications, \nwhich I understand the law is the law, not to be completed until June \n30, which is tomorrow, but why wasn't this done weeks ago? Because \npeople do not have the sense of urgency that we do down on the gulf \ncoast. They are not seeing their lives destroyed and their livelihoods \neliminated and their culture completely changed.\n  Of course, the effects of this for years, with 60,000--now people are \nfinally getting around to acknowledging that it is 60,000--barrels of \noil a day gushing into the gulf. It is filling up the gulf. It is \naffecting us and our way of life.\n  There are how many States on the gulf? Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and the big one, with the most coastline, Florida, my native \nland. How many is that? That is five. The remaining 45 States are not \naffected. They can see it nightly on the TV. They can rant and rave, \nand they can see that gusher that continues. It is there on TV for us \nto see, and we can be mad about that. But unless one lives there and \nunderstands the daily effect on people's lives, they can't get that \nsense of outrage we have. So is it any wonder I have such impatience \nwhen five of my counties on the gulf coast have submitted requisition \nforms for the moneys they have advanced and they still have not been \npaid? Is it any wonder I have a sense of outrage when I see people lose \nincomes because cancellations are coming in on a daily basis? Is it any \nwonder I have a sense of outrage when I see local governments not being \nable to plan on their budgets because they don't know what their local \ntax revenue is going to be because of a diminution of business? Is it \nany wonder those of us on the gulf have a sense of outrage as we see \nthe fear, the trepidation, the anxiety about the future about what \ntheir livelihoods are?\n  I am going down to the White House now to talk about the one thing we \ncan make something good come out of this travesty, and that is the \nfuture of trying to wean ourselves from our dependence on oil by \naggressively going after\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\nalternative energy sources. I hope out of this tragedy that will be one \nof the outcomes and that it will be led vigorously. But that sense of \noutrage I don't see. I am going to try to express it in the next few \nmoments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

BYRD\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to the floor this morning to pay \nmy respects to a most amazing man who the Senate Chamber has lost, \nSenator Robert C. Byrd. It certainly is a sad day for the Senate, for \nall the people of West Virginia who loved this man so much, and for the \nentire country, as we mourn the loss of the Nation's longest serving \nSenator.\n  Robert C. Byrd was a historian, a poet, and he truly was a master of \nthe Senate. We have heard a lot about this remarkable man. A lot of it \nbears repeating today. He was the longest serving Member in the history \nof this institution. He had courage. He had humility. He had \nintelligence. He had a vision that helped lead the Senate for many \nyears. But he also showed us that one can change over time and admit \ntheir wrongs and move on and fight for what they believe is right.\n  His principled stands are what I will remember most about him. I was \nso proud, back in 2002, to stand with him and a total of 23 Senators \nwho voted against the Iraq war. I will not forget how strong he was, \nreminding us that as a country we do not have to act out of fear. I was \nproud to stand with him many times since then, when he would knowingly \nwink at me and remind us of the 23 who stood tall in the Chamber that \nday.\n  His floor speeches were legendary. I remember so many times \nthroughout my tenure with him as he railed on the floor about whatever \npassion he had at the moment, whether it was his little dog he would \ntell us a story about or some part of history he wanted to remind us \nof, always with a point at the end. I remember his compassion as he \nspoke, and his flailing arms. He always reminded us that we are human \nbeings here. He had a true way with words, and he literally wrote the \nbook on the Senate. Most importantly, he protected this institution \nfrom every attack.\n  To his very last days here he was weighing in on proposed changes to \nthe filibuster rule, a rule he played a central part in reforming three \ndecades ago.\n  But the true honor of serving with Senator Byrd came from his \npersonal touch. I personally so remember my very first meeting many \nyears ago with Senator Byrd. I came here as a brandnew Senator in 1993. \nI wanted to serve on the Appropriations Committee, the committee he \nchaired. It is a very powerful committee. It was a big ask for a \nfreshman Senator coming in. I was told that in order to get that seat, \nI would have to call him up and ask for a personal meeting. That was \npretty intimidating, coming here brandnew and asking for a meeting with \nthe chair of the entire Appropriations Committee.\n  He granted the meeting. I remember walking over to the Capitol to his \noffice and not knowing what to expect. I couldn't have known what to \nexpect because, when I walked in, I found this warm, wonderful, cordial \nhuman being. He regaled me with stories from his youth and talked about \nbeing a coal miner's son and the poverty he grew up in. He showed me \nhis fiddle he was so proud of but that he played no more. He told me \npoetry he recited from memory. I remember sitting in his office and \nthinking: I can't believe I am sitting here with a part of history. \nThen, of course, he grilled me on my stance on the balanced budget \namendment and the line item veto before he said: Yes, I would like you \nto serve on my committee.\n  I have been so proud to serve on that committee with him ever since. \nHe taught me so much about protocol, about managing legislation, about \nthe rules of the Senate, about respect. Yes, respect was what I think I \nlearned from him most. He was a taskmaster. He believed passionately in \nthe rules of the Senate, but he also believed in working together for \nthe common good.\n  In the first year I was here, Senator Hatfield, Republican from \nOregon, and Senator Byrd were the chair and ranking member on the \nAppropriations Committee. Senator Byrd called and asked me to come to \nlunch in his office with a small group of Senators, with Senator \nHatfield and myself and several Democrats and Republicans. I was so \nhonored to be asked, and I came over not knowing what to expect. \nSenator Byrd and Senator Hatfield, a Republican and Democrat, a chair \nand a ranking member of the most powerful committee, the Appropriations \nCommittee, sat and talked to us about what they felt was being lost \nfrom the Senate and that, as new Members, it was our responsibility to \nreturn the Senate to. That was respect and listening to each other. \nThey told us in words about how ``one year I might be chair,'' said \nSenator Byrd, ``but I know full well an election will change things and \nSenator Hatfield will become chair. So we better work together, and we \nbetter respect each other, as we put our bills together. Because you \nnever know when you are going to be in the minority or the majority.''\n  Their words were powerful. But even more powerful was sitting there \nlistening to these two gentlemen, a Republican and Democrat, listen to \neach other, laugh together, have lunch together, and pass on a lesson \nto those following us about what we all need to be when we call \nourselves United States Senators.\n  Senator Byrd earned many titles over the years: majority whip, \nmajority leader, chairman of the Appropriations Committee. But I know \nthe title he cherished the most was husband. His love of his family \ntrumped everything else.\n  I so remember one time my husband, who lives out in the State of \nWashington--as my colleagues know, I travel home every weekend to be \nwith my family--one weekend my husband came out here to be with me. \nWhy? Because it was our anniversary. I was going to be here voting so \nhe traveled here from Washington State and came into the Capitol. As he \nwas coming in, I met him. Senator Byrd happened to be leaving the \nSenate Chamber. He saw my husband and he welcomed him and said: What \nare you doing out here in the other Washington? My husband said: It is \nour anniversary. Senator Byrd said: Well, which anniversary is it?\n  Rob said to him: It is our thirty-second. Senator Byrd paused and \nnodded, and he said: That is a good start.\n  He had been married for 67 years. He was going home to be with his \nwife. That is a moment I will cherish, because it sets in perspective \nall that I know about Senator Byrd. He taught by example. He taught by \nwords. He knew humor and how to use it. But most of all, he had respect \nfor every one of us here.\n  He was a gentleman. He certainly was tough. But he treated everyone \nwith dignity and respect. Everyone here on this floor has been molded \nby his presence. We have learned so much from him, and he will be \nmissed.\n  But I know for certain his work and his passion and his spirit will \nnever be gone from this Senate he loved so much, and I know as I walk \non this Senate floor, I will try and remember, as he taught me so well, \nrespect of others above all.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining in morning \nbusiness on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much.\n  Madam President, yesterday I joined Senator Murray and others in \ngiving my tribute to Senator Byrd, and I will not repeat my remarks. \nBut I look forward to other Members coming to the floor with their own \nmemories and reminiscences of this great man who served this Nation and \nthe State of West Virginia so honorably for so long and the fact that I \nwas honored to serve with him for 14 years in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5506-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5506-S5508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I know an issue that was always \nimportant to Robert Byrd was the working men and women of West \nVirginia. If there was one thing that innervated him and inspired him, \nit was the memory of his youth and growing up in the\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\nmost impoverished circumstances where he could not attend college and \nhad to go to work straight out of high school. It was not until many \nyears later that he completed college and law degrees as a Member of \nthe Congress. It was an extraordinary feat to be able to achieve that.\n  I think of him when I think of the bill we considered last week \nbecause it was a bill that tried to help struggling families across \nAmerica in the midst of this recession. We tried to extend unemployment \nbenefits for those who are out of work across America. The estimates \nrange from 8 million to 14 million Americans--people who had a job and \nare now out of a job through no fault of their own. There are an \nestimated five unemployed people for every available job. So it is not \na situation, which some have said, where there is a lack of effort on \ntheir part. It is a very hard thing to find a job.\n  I have visited unemployment offices in Chicago, in Springfield, and \nall over my State and met with these people, many of whom are \ndesperate. They put out their resumes online in an effort to try to get \nan opportunity for a job and just cannot get any response whatsoever. \nThey spend day after weary day going through the want ads and going \nthrough the Internet postings in the hope of finding something.\n  What we have tried to do is to say to families in this distress: We \nare going to give you a helping hand so you can survive. That was a \nmajor part of this bill. We were going to extend unemployment benefits \nacross America for an additional 6 months, until the end of the year. I \nwish I could say the economy was turning around more quickly, and it is \nnot necessary, but I think we know better. We know many families \nwithout these unemployment benefits just cannot make it.\n  We had a vote last week on unemployment benefits for unemployed \nAmericans, out of work through no fault of their own, and could not get \na single Republican to vote for it--not one. Not one Republican would \nvote for cloture so we could move to passage of that bill.\n  There were many things in the bill, but that one hit home this \nweekend when a friend of mine, a woman whom I have known for a number \nof years now, called me. I respect her so much. I met her at a drug \nrehab facility far away from my home in a corner of our State. She had \nbeen addicted to crack, but for the last 8 years she has been drug-\nfree. She is a single mom, and she has three children living in her \nhome. One of her daughters has a little boy who is 4 months old.\n  She called me over the weekend and said: I can't find a job. I keep \nlooking, and I can't find a job. Now they are going to cut off the \nutilities to my home.\n  That is the reality of what a vote on the Senate floor means in the \nreal world. I wonder sometimes how some of my colleagues can \nconsistently decide they are not going to vote to support these \nAmerican families. I struggle to understand how we can be spending \nbillions of dollars in an effort to rebuild Afghanistan, to try to put \nthese people back on their feet and give them a future, and turn our \nbacks on our own. That is what happened.\n  This bill had many provisions in it, but that one hit home. There was \nanother one. There was a provision in this bill to send money to the \nStates to help them pay for Medicaid. Medicaid is health insurance for \npoor and unemployed people. Of course, there are more demands for \nMedicaid because so many people are out of work. The States are \nstruggling to provide the medical assistance these families need, and \nmany of us believed it was only fair that we in Washington try to help \nthese States through these difficult times by sending this money back \nto the States.\n  Not a single Republican--not one--would vote to help us help the \nGovernors in States that are struggling to pay these medical bills for \nthe unemployed and poor in their State. It just strikes me that we have \nan obligation to our own--to our American family--and that obligation \nis being ignored by those who vote against it.\n  During the course of the day and this week Senators from the \nRepublican side of the aisle are likely to come to the floor and ask \nthat specific provisions in that bill pass. They do not want to help \nthe unemployed, they do not want to help provide medical care for the \npoor and unemployed, but they have tax provisions they want to pass. \nSome of them I agree with; some of them are very important and valuable \nto us. But it seems to me only fair that if we are going to consider \nthese provisions, we consider the whole bill.\n  So as they are making unanimous consent requests to pick out the \npiece they like in the bill, I will be making a unanimous consent \nrequest to pass the bill in its entirety--not just the tax provisions \nthat help families but also help businesses and corporations, but also \nto make sure we help those who need a helping hand.\n  I often wonder why the Republicans would oppose helping the \nunemployed. Traditionally, it has been a bipartisan issue. We have said \nif a disaster hits some part of our country, we will rally behind that \npart of our country. It has happened in Illinois. I have come to the \nfloor of the Senate and the House when we have faced a natural \ndisaster, whether it was a flood or a tornado or whatever it happened \nto be. Colleagues of mine from far-flung places across the United \nStates have said: We will be there to help you because tomorrow may be \na day when we need help too. We pitch in together to help one another. \nYet when it comes to this bill to help those who are unemployed across \nAmerica, they resist it. I try to get into the bill to try to \nunderstand why the Republicans oppose helping those who have lost their \njobs through no fault of their own, why the Republicans oppose basic \nhealth care for people who are in the most dire circumstances.\n  It turns out that some of it has to do with the tax policy that is in \nthis bill. You see, one of the things we are doing is closing the \nloophole that allows American businesses to ship jobs overseas. Yes, \nthere are rewards in America's Tax Code for corporations that decide to \nclose down their plants in Galesburg, IL, or in the State of New \nHampshire, and move them overseas. It makes no sense. Why would we \ncreate tax incentives, financial incentives for American corporations \nto shut down in the United States and build overseas?\n  This bill closes those loopholes, and I can tell you, some of the \nbiggest corporations in America are angry about it. They want to have a \nhelping hand to move good-paying jobs overseas. Well, they are not \ngoing to get a helping hand from this Senator and a lot of others. Yet \nthere are some on the other side of the aisle who happen to agree with \nthat position.\n\n  This bill also has tax incentives to help small businesses. For \ngoodness' sake, if we will ever get out of that recession, it will be \nbecause small businesses get back on their feet and hire more people. \nThis is a good bill which the Republicans refuse to support. I do not \nknow how we can go home for the Fourth of July weekend, take a week off \nafterwards, and ignore the obvious: that while we are at home with our \nfamilies, other families will be asking themselves basic questions \nabout whether they will have their gas or electricity cut off in their \nhomes.\n  That is the reality of what we are facing.\n  I take a look at the estimated number of people who will lose their \nunemployment compensation because of this vote by the Republicans \nagainst extending unemployment compensation, and throughout the month \nof June it will mean some 80,000 people in my State of Illinois will be \nlosing this kind of help. It is also a fact in States such as \nCalifornia, 255,000 people; Florida, 115,000 unemployed will have their \nbenefits cut off; 40,000 in Indiana; 107,000 in Pennsylvania; 95,000 in \nNew York; 65,000 in Texas; 33,000 in Wisconsin. The numbers are huge in \nthese States. Yet the Republicans refuse to give us one vote in support \nof moving this forward--this bill to help those who are out of work and \ncreate a better environment to create jobs in America.\n  I often wonder if this is part of some campaign strategy to try to \nslow down the economic recovery in the hopes that it has some political \nadvantage, but that is a very cynical analysis and I believe most \nSenators on both sides of the aisle pray that our recovery comes sooner \nrather than later.\n  But we need their votes to show it. We need for them to step up and \ngive us the support on the Senate floor to pass this jobs bill, a bill \nwhich they defeated last week, without a single Republican supporting \nit--not one.\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\n  Well, many of them have said publicly they want to have another \nchance to vote on some parts of it, and I am open to the suggestion. \nBut when I look at this bill in its entirety--the tax cuts, the help to \nsmall businesses, the closing of these tax loopholes, the help to the \nStates--I think all of these things are an important and timely package \nof things we need to do across America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Then I yield the floor.\n  Since I see no Republican seeking time in morning business, I ask \nunanimous consent to speak for 3 additional minutes, and to extend the \nsame 3 minutes on the Republican side, if they care to use it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, one of the greatest assets in my part of \nthe world would be Lake Michigan. If you ask the people of Chicago: \nWhat do you think is the greatest thing about the city of Chicago, in a \nrecent survey they overwhelmingly responded it is Lake Michigan because \nit is so beautiful, and we are fortunate to be near it and take \nadvantage of it, using beaches and being out on boats, and mainly \nlooking out the window at this magnificent lake, which I get a chance \nto do when I go up to the city.\n  So when the issue of the future of Lake Michigan and the question \nabout whether it is going to be the victim of invasive species comes \nup, we take it seriously. I do not know how many years ago some people \ndecided a very wise thing to do would be to import into the United \nStates a fish called the Asian carp. So they brought in this Asian \ncarp--and I believe it was in the State of Arkansas, though I do not \nwant to pick on them; I think this is true--and they were going to \nraise these carp for some reason, and there was some flooding and the \ncarp ended up in the Mississippi River. Now they are all over the \nMississippi River and those tributaries leading to it.\n  Well, if we follow the Mississippi River north from Arkansas and make \na right-hand turn north of St. Louis and head up the Illinois River, we \nare on our way up Lake Michigan. That is the route the Asian carp have \nbeen following.\n  Well, they are all over the Illinois River on their way up to Lake \nMichigan. These are fish which grow to enormous sizes and suck up \neverything in sight on which other fish would live. So they are an \ninvasive species that is a danger to other species of fish, and there \nhas been a great fear for a long time they would reach Lake Michigan \nand change its future as a fishery.\n  So I joined with Republican Congresswoman Judy Biggert, and we \nstarted pouring in millions of dollars 10 years ago to stop this fish. \nThis fish is insidious. It just grows by leaps and bounds and attacks \npeople. Hard to imagine, isn't it? Boaters going down the Illinois \nRiver will see these fish jumping out of the river at the boaters. It \nis a danger. I have seen videos, and I know it is.\n  This is an aggressive species of fish that can destroy Lake Michigan. \nSo Congresswoman Biggert and I built electronic fences that create an \nelectrical shock at points in the river to stop the fish from moving \ntoward Lake Michigan. We have done that twice. We now think we have to \ndo it more. There is a real concern not only in Chicago and Illinois \nbut around Lake Michigan, the surrounding States, about how successful \nthis effort is going to be.\n  Last week, we continued to fish and look for these Asian carp, and we \nfound one in Lake Calumet, just miles from Lake Michigan. From my point \nof view, that was a wake-up call. Somehow a fish had reached the other \nside of the electronic barrier. I do not know if it was dumped in Lake \nCalumet--we are doing some studies to find out--or whether it migrated \nthere.\n  Regardless, what I am doing with Senator Debbie Stabenow of the State \nof Michigan is introducing legislation today calling on the Army Corps \nof Engineers to take a serious, comprehensive look at ways to avoid any \ncontamination of Lake Michigan from this fish.\n  These studies usually take forever. Senator Stabenow and I are \nencouraging the corps to move on them very quickly.\n  Secondly, I have written to the White House and have spoken with the \nPresident's Chief of Staff about appointing a coordinator who will try \nto bring together all the Federal agencies that are dealing with this \ninvasive species, the State and local efforts, and coordinating them to \nbe more effective and focus on stopping this fish moving forward.\n  We are trying to also increase the amount of money being spent to \nbuild fences and more electronic barriers to stop these fish from their \nmigration toward Lake Michigan.\n  This is critical for us to do for the future of Lake Michigan and the \nGreat Lakes. It is something we have worked on for years. We will \ncontinue to work on it. We take it very seriously.\n  I thank Senator Stabenow for joining me in that effort, and I \nencourage all the Senators from the Great Lakes area, if they would \nconsider it, to join us as cosponsors.\n  Madam President, I see the Senator from Missouri has taken the floor \non the Republican side. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5508-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5508-S5509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CLEAN ENERGY\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, today Members of the Senate will go to the \nWhite House to meet with President Obama on energy legislation. There \nis general agreement among Republicans that we need to do more to \npromote clean energy and reduce our dependence on foreign energy \nsources. We also need real reform of our oilspill protection laws and \nagencies.\n  However, today I talk about where we disagree, and that is on the \nDemocratic proposal to impose a national energy tax related to carbon \nemissions.\n  The President will try to convince Senators and the public to impose \na national energy tax. Of course, he will use fancy terms such as \n``pricing carbon.'' But if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, \nthen it is a duck, and this duck is an energy tax.\n  One form the Democratic national energy tax will take is a tax on \ngasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Senator Hutchison and I just released a \nnew report documenting the size of the gas tax in the Kerry-Lieberman \ncap-and-trade bill. My colleagues can find it on our office Web sites.\n  The Kerry-Lieberman cap-and-trade bill includes a $3.4 trillion gas \ntax--with a ``t.'' That is an average of $90 billion a year.\n  The number is so large because Americans consume a lot of fuel--over \n200 billion gallons a year. Putting a price on the carbon in this fuel, \nas Democrats and President Obama want to do, will impose a massive new \ntax increase on the American people. You don't have to take my word for \nit. Anyone can add up the cost of this new gas tax. We used all \npublicly available government information, such as the fuel consumption \ndata from the U.S. Energy Information Agency and carbon pricing \nestimates from the Environmental Protection Agency. The rest is just \nsimple addition and multiplication--multiplication and multiplication \nand multiplication--combining how much fuel we will use with the carbon \ntax rate they propose.\n  The $3.4 trillion figure is based on EPA's estimates of future carbon \nprices. By law, as proposed by Kerry-Lieberman, the gas tax could be as \nhigh as $7.6 trillion if carbon prices hit the price ceilings in this \nbill.\n  Kerry-Lieberman's $3.4 trillion total gas tax will include a $1.9 \ntrillion gasoline tax on families, workers, and small businesses, a \n$1.1 trillion diesel tax on farmers, truckers, and businesses, and a \n$425 billion jet fuel tax on airline passengers.\n  Of course, politicians do not want to admit they support a new \nmultitrillion-dollar gas tax. They use code words such as ``pricing \ncarbon'' or ``requiring the purchase of allowances.''\n  They also try to take advantage of the current disasters, such as the \ngulf oilspill, to impose a new gasoline tax. I say we should be \npunishing BP, not the American people, with a new gas tax. A gas tax \nwill not stop the oil from leaking, it will not clean up the oil that \nhas been spilled, and it will not do anything to restore the \nenvironment in the coastal areas where that oil will hit.\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\n  To quote an MIT economist highlighted this week:\n\n       People are kidding themselves to believe that penalizing \n     carbon will significantly shrink oil imports or the need for \n     offshore drilling.\n\n  EPA's recent analysis of Kerry-Lieberman confirms this, showing that \nU.S. fuel consumption would decrease by only \\1/2\\ percent by 2050.\n  All we do with a new gas tax is take trillions of dollars from \nAmerican families and workers with no real impact on our oil \ndependency. In fact, the thing that has slowed gasoline consumption in \nthe United States has been the recession. When people are out of work \nand businesses are not selling and work is not being done, then \nconsumption goes down. Is that how we want to reduce dependence on \nforeign oil and reduce pollution? I say not.\n  Sponsors say a portion of these funds is going to the highway trust \nfund. However, this bill sends less than 2 percent of its value to the \ntrust fund, or only a few billion dollars per year by my calculations. \nEven that will end in 2040.\n  Sponsors also point to their refund program where they claim they \nwill give back two-thirds of the carbon tax revenues the government \nwill take in. How many trust the Federal Government to return tax \nrevenue to us once they get their tax-and-spend fingers on it? They \nhave schemes that will send that money to politically favored groups. \nThat is what has happened in the past, and that is what will happen in \nthe future.\n  While they give back two-thirds of the revenues, the government still \nkeeps one-third of the tax. One-third of a $3.4 trillion gas tax means \nAmerican families and workers, even if they got it back on a fair pro \nrata basis--which nobody believes they will--Americans will still face \n$1.1 trillion in net new taxes from the gas tax.\n  You know something funny must be going on when big oil actually \nsupports this bill. You heard me right; big oil supports this bill. BP, \nShell, and ConocoPhillips actually helped draft Kerry-Lieberman. Do my \ncolleagues know why they did that? They are not worried about a tax on \ngasoline because they know every single penny will be shifted to the \nconsumers with their profit margins added. It may not be a bad deal for \nthe gas and oil companies, but it is a bad deal for all of us as \nconsumers.\n  Big oil knows they can pass most of the new tax on to consumers, so \nthey are not worried about it. But Senator Hutchison and I remain \ndeeply worried about families, farmers, truckers, small businesses, and \nfliers who will pay this $3.4 trillion gas tax.\n  There is a better way. We can come together on new incentives for \nhybrid and electric cars, nuclear power, advanced fuels such as \ncellulosic ethanol and biomass, and even higher fuel efficiency \nstandards for vehicles. But what we should not do is punish American \nfamilies, farmers, workers, and businesses with a $3.4 trillion gas \ntax.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5509-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5509-S5511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 5569\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor once again to \nask all of my colleagues to come together, Democrats and Republicans, \nas Americans to do something we should have done weeks ago: reauthorize \nthe National Flood Insurance Program.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program is a vital, necessary program to \nprovide flood insurance to our citizens around the country to help \nprotect their homes and property. Yet it was allowed to expire on June \n1. So for almost a month, we have not had a national flood insurance \nprogram.\n  What does that mean? That means there have been thousands of real \nestate closings that have been held up, unable to move forward. There \nare thousands of first-time and other home buyers who want to go to \ntheir closings, who are excited about everything that means, but \nbecause of politics up here, because of that getting stuck in the mud--\neven though substantively it should be completely noncontroversial--\nthey cannot go to their closings, and all of this in the midst of an \nextremely serious recession. We should never allow this sort of lapse \nin the program, but when unemployment nationally is almost 10 percent, \nwhen we need every real estate closing we can get our hands on to help \nmove the economy along and to try to get it to a better place, this is \nthe last moment we should allow this program to expire.\n  As we all know, this reauthorization has been held hostage, and there \nis no more accurate way to describe what has been going on. It is \ncompletely noncontroversial. It is completely motherhood and apple pie. \nFor that reason, it was taken hostage and put in the so-called \nextenders bill, which, overall, was very controversial and which had a \nlot of objectors, particularly because it balloons deficit and debt \nsignificantly--by tens of billions of dollars. I have asked several \ntimes over the last several weeks for that gamesmanship to stop, for \nthe hostage to be released and for us to pass on a bipartisan basis the \nextension of the National Flood Insurance Program on its own.\n  That was rejected. Over those several weeks, one version of extenders \nafter another was also rejected. There were four, maybe five different \nversions of that bill which came to the Senate floor, and none of them \nachieved the required 60 votes to move forward. So the necessary \nextension of the National Flood Insurance Program languished for days \nand then weeks and now almost a month.\n  With so many versions of the so-called extenders bill failing, let's \njust get back to doing the right thing on this vital program. Let's \ntake this specific measure--the reauthorization of the National Flood \nInsurance Program--and pass it into law. The House has already done \nthat. The Democratically controlled House has done exactly that--passed \na full reauthorization through the end of the fiscal year. So let's \ntake their bill and pass it and solve this problem and allow these \nclosings to happen, give a little boost to the economy when we need \nevery boost we can get. Certainly, people in the real world across \nAmerica support that. As evidence of that, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a letter of strong support that the Senate \ntake immediate action on H.R. 5569, which is signed by many different \nreal estate and related business organizations that want to see those \ncrucial real estate closings resume again.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 25, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: We \n     respectfully request the Senate take immediate action and \n     approve H.R. 5569 that passed the House of Representatives \n     yesterday and would reauthorize and extend the National Flood \n     Insurance Program (NFIP) through September 30, 2010.\n       The flash floods this year that inundated Oklahoma City, \n     ripped through the Southwest and damaged residences from \n     Montana to Tennessee are a grim reminder of the threat posed \n     by flooding. Furthermore, the NFIP is the only protection for \n     Gulf Coast property owners who face the threat of flooding by \n     oil-tainted water as a result of the massive leak in the Gulf \n     of Mexico.\n       The NFIP protects 5.5 million Americans. Unfortunately, no \n     new policies have been offered to property owners who need \n     coverage since the program expired on May 31, 2010. This is \n     the third time this year Congress has allowed the NFIP to \n     expire. The timing of this latest expiration--a day before \n     the start of the hurricane season on June 1--could not have \n     been worse for coastal residents and impaired real estate \n     markets.\n       While we agree with many members of Congress the NFIP is in \n     need of meaningful reform, America's property owners depend \n     on this important federal program administered with the help \n     of the property casualty insurance industry. Since the \n     program expired, those who need insurance can't get it. Those \n     who have it can't increase coverage. And anyone trying to buy \n     property that requires federal flood insurance is out of \n     luck--creating yet another disruption in a struggling real \n     estate market.\n       Every day of delay in reauthorizing the NFIP contributes to \n     the confusion and risk\n\n[[Page S5510]]\n\n     for families in the real world. The purchase of a new flood \n     insurance policy in general carries a 30-day waiting period \n     before it goes into effect (except for real estate \n     transfers), so even if Congress acts today, a property owner \n     seeking coverage could be without coverage well into July.\n       A long term extension is vital to provide needed certainty \n     to homeowners and small businesses that depend on the program \n     for flood damage protection, to protect our residential and \n     commercial real estate markets from serious harm during a \n     very difficult economic time, and to provide stability for \n     the companies and agents that sell and administer the NFIP \n     policies to millions of consumers across the country. We \n     respectfully request that you act now and pass H.R. 5569 \n     TODAY--homeowners and businesses across the country simply \n     cannot wait.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Hotel and Lodging Association, American \n           Insurance Association, American Land Title Association, \n           American Resort Development Association, Building \n           Owners and Managers Association, CCIM Institute, The \n           Chamber Southwest LA, Credit Union National \n           Association, Financial Services Roundtable, Greater New \n           Orleans Incorporated, Independent Community Bankers of \n           America, Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of \n           America, Institute of Real Estate Management, Mortgage \n           Bankers Association, National Apartment Association, \n           National Association of Federal Credit Unions, National \n           Association of Home Builders, National Association of \n           Realtors, National Multi-Housing Council, National \n           Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, Property \n           Casualty Insurers Association of America.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Again, the National Flood Insurance Program has universal \nbipartisan support. This extension does not increase the deficit. It is \nnot a spending and debt issue. It has only been taken hostage in these \nlarger battles over other matters. Let's release this hostage and do \nthe right thing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 5569, which was received from the House--this \nbill extends the authorization of the National Flood Insurance Program \nuntil September 30--that the bill be read a third time and passed and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And I will object at the end of this reservation.\n  We had an opportunity to pass flood insurance last week, and not a \nsingle Senator from Senator Vitter's side of the aisle would vote for \nthe package because it provided unemployment compensation for 1.2 \nmillion Americans who are out of work, including 10,000 in the State of \nLouisiana. I believe for that reason the Republicans voted against it. \nThey did not want to extend unemployment benefits. Flood insurance was \nin there, and they wouldn't vote for it. So after I object, I will \noffer a unanimous-consent request, and the Senator from Louisiana will \nget a chance to pass flood insurance as part of the entire package. So \nI object to this unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, here we go again--the \nsame old gamesmanship. Through the Chair, let me correct my \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois. The reason that bill was \nobjected to by all Republicans, as well as some Democrats, was not the \nextension of unemployment insurance. If that is his understanding, let \nme explain to him, through the Chair, that his understanding is \ncompletely wrong. In fact, I have stood here on the Senate floor and \nsuggested a UC to separate that part of the bill as well and to pass \nit. But the objection of many Senators, including mine, is the \nballooning of the deficit and the debt, which every single version of \nthat bill did by tens of billions of dollars, the original version by \napproximately $180 billion.\n  So, Mr. President, my distinguished colleague's understanding is \nexactly wrong, and here we go again. My distinguished colleague and his \nleadership on the Democratic side have had multiple opportunities to \nattempt to pass a version of this bill--four or five versions; I have \nlost count. Each and every time, they did not get the necessary votes, \nincluding not getting certain Democratic votes.\n  So can we finally, after going through that exercise, after allowing \nthe National Flood Insurance Program to lapse for almost a month now, \ncan we finally do the right thing and pass this noncontroversial \nprogram on its own, as Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic majority in \nthe House have done?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Louisiana yield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want some clarification because I \nthought I heard the Senator say something. Is the Senator saying that \nif we offer a separate measure on the floor which reauthorizes the \nNational Flood Insurance Program--and let's add in there, for example, \nthis $8,000 home buyer credit we have talked about for more real estate \nclosings, the extension of the home buyer credit, which was passed on \nthe floor--and unemployment compensation as an emergency expenditure, \nis the Senator from Louisiana saying he would vote for that package?\n  Mr. VITTER. If that package is paid for. I will be happy to produce \nall of the pay-fors. I will be happy to produce ways to responsibly pay \nfor that package. If that package is handled responsibly that way, \nabsolutely yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Then we are still at loggerheads because unemployment \ncompensation has been offered as emergency spending throughout this \nrecession, and now I am not sure where the Senator's pay-fors would \ncome from, but that creates a problem.\n  Mr. VITTER. To reclaim my time, they have been offered over and over. \nI will be happy to offer them. There are ways to solve that problem. \nBut in the meantime, can we pass a necessary program, the cessation of \nwhich is holding up real estate closings all around the country and \nhurting an already ailing economy when we are experiencing almost 10 \npercent unemployment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to make a unanimous-consent \nrequest, I notify my colleague from Louisiana. This unanimous-consent \nrequest will extend and reauthorize the National Flood Insurance \nProgram, the reason he came to the floor. It includes the provisions \nthat are also part of the earlier discussion about the extenders \npackage. It is a lengthy list and many of these are traditional annual \nreauthorizations of a number of provisions in the Tax Code that \nencourage research and development, the development of biofuels, and \nthat sort of thing.\n  It also includes, for the record, $33.7 billion in emergency spending \nto extend unemployment compensation benefits to the end of the year. It \nwould help 10,700 residents of the State of Louisiana who currently are \nbeing cut off from unemployment compensation. It includes $16 billion, \npaid for, that is going to be given to the States to help them deal \nwith the costs of Medicaid in this recession. It has the provision in \nthere for the so-called Medicare doc fix and a number of other \nprovisions.\n  I am going to give the Senator from Louisiana an opportunity to \nextend the National Flood Insurance Program by agreeing to the \nfollowing unanimous consent:\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Chair lay before the Senate the \nMessage from the House on H.R. 4213, the American Jobs and Closing Tax \nLoopholes Act; that the Senate move to concur with the House amendment \nto the Senate amendment to H.R. 4213 with the Baucus amendment No. \n4386; that the motion to concur with an amendment be agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving my right to object and I will \nobject in a minute, I guess this exchange is at least useful because it \nillustrates the gamesmanship that is continuing to go on. My \ndistinguished colleague is giving me this opportunity. My distinguished \ncolleague is holding a gun to my head, trying to say you have to vote \nto balloon the deficit, trying to say you have to vote for other \nirresponsible action if you simply want a necessary program for your \nState and the Nation, which does not cost anything in terms of \nincreased deficit spending, to move forward. I thank my distinguished \ncolleague for holding the\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\ngun to my head for that wonderful opportunity, but I reject it and I \nthink the American people reject it, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5511-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I come to my seat today on the floor of \nthe Senate to take a few minutes to share my thoughts on the late \nSenator Robert Byrd and his tragic death a few days ago. I come with a \nperspective different than those who served with him for decades \nbecause this is my first term in the Senate. I was elected in 2004.\n  In our caucus, which then was in the majority, we were asked to take \nresponsibility for presiding, just as the current Presiding Officer is \ndoing today. The day I picked was Friday mornings, not knowing we would \nnot be here on a lot of Friday mornings except for a normal business \nsession. But I did it on every Friday morning. For 2 years I presided \nover the Senate from about 10 in the morning until about 12:30 in the \nafternoon.\n  Friday morning is the day Robert Byrd would come to the floor of the \nSenate and share and reshare some of his great speeches. I was here to \nlisten to the entire speech on the tribute to mothers on Mother's Day. \nI heard him, oftentimes, talk so wonderfully about his lovely wife. I \nheard him talk about the Roman Empire, its rise and its fall. I heard \nhim make speeches on the rules of the Senate, the details that no one \nin this room could ever come close to.\n  But, for me, the most important contribution of the Senator from West \nVirginia was the fact it didn't matter how experienced you were or what \nyour party was, if you had a question on the rules of the Senate, you \ncould go to the seat of Senator Byrd and you could get an answer that \nyou could put in the bank. He loved sharing his knowledge. He loved the \ninstitution of the Senate. He never saw it from a partisan standpoint, \nhe always saw it from a traditional and an institutional standpoint.\n  There will be a lot of great tributes paid to Senator Byrd over the \nnext few days and they will all be well deserved. I certainly share in \nthe sympathy that all extend to his extended family for this tragic \nloss. But many in this Senate today and many who served in the years \nsince he was first elected have benefited from the wisdom and \n``gentleman-ness'' that Robert Byrd represented. He is a tradition in \nthe Senate. He is a tradition in the State of West Virginia. He will be \nmissed, but I will be forever thankful to Robert Byrd for what he took \nthe time to share with me, to help me understand the ways of the \nSenate. He truly was a Senator's Senator and I extend my sympathy to \nhis family and the people of West Virginia on the tragic loss of this \ngreat Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5511-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we continue the important work of the \nSenate this week on a number of important bills, one of them being the \nsmall business package that is before this body now, we are always \nmindful, as we come to the floor with the beautiful flowers on Senator \nByrd's desk, of the great loss we are all experiencing. His colleagues \nhere and in his home State of West Virginia, the Nation and, as you \nknow, many people around the world are mourning the death of a great \nSenator, a very well-known Senator, a very well-respected Senator, and \na very historic figure.\n  So as we all do our work today, it is with heavy hearts that we work. \nI told my staff today walking into the building, it seems so empty and \nparticularly quiet, and it is because of the great respect this Senator \nenjoyed in his life and now enjoys in his death.\n  But as even Senator Byrd would say if he were here, the work of the \nSenate, which he loved very much, needs to go on because it is the work \nof the people in a very special way. It is in that spirit that I come \nto the floor to briefly talk about a bill we are attempting to move to.\n  It is a major piece of legislation. It has three distinct components. \nIt has been in shape and in the works for many months now. A part of \nthis bill has come out of the Small Business Committee. I am extremely \nproud, as the chair of that committee, that the package we have \ncontributed has been built on strong, solid bipartisan support. In \nfact, many of the provisions came out of our committee 17 to 0 or 17 to \n1 or 18 to 0. We have had tremendous cooperation on the part of my \nranking member, Senator Snowe, who has been to the floor several times \nin the last couple of weeks, joining me in talking about the importance \nof focusing the congressional efforts and Congress's efforts on small \nbusiness, on Main Street.\n  We have spent a lot of the last year and a half dealing with the big \ncompanies, the big companies on Wall Street, the big banks, the big \ninsurance companies, the big health care companies. We have had to deal \nwith it because it has been in a state of crisis where Wall Street was \ngoing to collapse, the financial structures were collapsing. We had to \nact quickly. The health care tragedies or stresses were clearly \nvisible, and we had to work our way through that. But now it is time \nfor this Congress, at this time, this summer, to focus on small \nbusiness, because these are the businesses on the front line of the \nbattle against this recession. And this is a battle. It is a battle to \nend this recession, to fight and win our way back to prosperity. Much \nof this can be accomplished if we would focus on the businesses in our \nneighborhoods, on Main Street, on the farm-to-market road, the small \nbusiness owners driving those pickup trucks, delivering supplies and \nequipment all over America, in urban areas and in rural areas.\n  We would be very much helped if we could get our minds and our hearts \non them, because they are going to be the ones that lead us out of this \nrecession. Small firms created 65 percent of all new jobs from 1993 to \n2009. It was true in the early 1990s. It was probably true if you would \ngo back to the 1980s, probably true in the 1970s. It is true today. Job \ncreation is not going to come 1,000 jobs at a time. It comes one at a \ntime, two at a time, or three new jobs in small businesses all over \nAmerica.\n  What we do here on tax policy, on strengthening the Small Business \nAdministration, on freeing up capital for them, is going to make the \ndifference between whether this recession comes to an end. So I am \npleased about the work that has been done.\n  A portion of our bill has come through the Small Business Committee. \nA portion of the bill has come through the Finance Committee. I have to \ntake my hat off to the Senator from Montana, Max Baucus, and his \nranking member, Senator Grassley, former Chairman Grassley, from Iowa. \nThey have worked nonstop and overtime on a number of bills that have to \ndo with our Tax Code. But they have set aside this special time for \ntheir committee to work on tax relief, tax extensions, tax relief for \nsmall businesses to add to this package.\n  So it is a portion of tax cuts and tax relief for small businesses \nthat is so\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\nimportant, to strengthen the Small Business Administration programs \nthat we know have been effective, not just throwing money at government \nprograms but targeting the government programs that we know work \nbecause we have studied them, and we have gotten reports from not just \nthe government bureaucrats--and there are many good ones here--but we \nhave been hearing from businesses: Senator, this works for me. Can you \nget us more of it? That is what this bill is about.\n  Then finally there is a piece that has come from the leadership, from \nthe President himself, from the White House, through the Treasury \nDepartment, to say: What can we do to leverage some assets of the \nFederal Treasury to create a $30 billion lending pool, not for the big \nbanks--they have gotten enough of our money and enough of our \nattention, as far as I am concerned--but the small banks on Main \nStreet. There are 8,000 of them. They are the ones that need a little \nhelp, a little financing to help them, not on their bottom lines in \nterms of their stability because they are quite stable. I am extremely \nproud of our small banks around this country that did not go belly up. \nThey are strong. They have money to lend. We want to give them some \nadditional funding to lend.\n  I am proud that the Independent Bankers Association has sent us a \nletter, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n ICBA and 28 State Community Bank Associations Urge Prompt Passage of \n                    Small Business Lending Fund Bill\n\n       Washington, DC, (June 15, 2010).--The Independent Community \n     Bankers of America (ICBA) and 28 affiliated state \n     associations sent a letter to House Banking Committee \n     Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) and Ranking Member Spencer \n     Bachus (R-Ala.) today urging prompt passage of the proposed \n     Small Business Lending Fund Act of 2010 (H.R. 5297). ICBA \n     said that the $30 billion in capital provided by the Small \n     Business Lending Fund (SBLF) could help community banks \n     provide as much as $300 billion in additional small business \n     lending.\n       ``On behalf of ICBA's nearly 5,000 members and our state \n     partner community banking associations, we strongly support \n     the proposed Small Business Lending Fund and urge prompt \n     passage of this important legislation,'' said Camden R. Fine, \n     ICBA president and CEO. ``The nation's 8,000 community banks \n     are well-positioned because of their established \n     relationships with small businesses in their communities to \n     use the fund to get credit flowing.''\n       Under H.R. 5297, interested banks with less than $1 billion \n     in assets could receive capital investments up to 5 percent \n     of their risk-weighted assets, and those with between $1 \n     billion and $10 billion in assets could receive up to 3 \n     percent. The SBLF has important incentives to encourage \n     greater small business lending by reducing the dividend rate \n     community banks pay on the capital as they increase their \n     lending.\n       ``ICBA firmly supports the central purpose of the program \n     to spur further lending to small businesses by means of \n     community banks,'' said Jim MacPhee, ICBA Chairman and CEO of \n     Kalamazoo County State Bank, Schoolcraft, Mich. ``We applaud \n     the new program's focus on getting funds to Main Street small \n     businesses using Main Street community banks. We urge all \n     members of Congress to vote for H.R. 5297.''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Independent Community Bankers Association has sent \nto Senator Snowe and me a strong recommendation. They say: On behalf of \n5,000 members and our State partner community banking associations, we \nstrongly support the proposed Small Business Lending Fund, and urge \nprompt passage of this important legislation. The nation's 8,000 \ncommunity bankers are well positioned because of their established \nrelationships with small businesses in their communities to use the \nfunds to get credit flowing.\n  Under the proposal that is being brought to the floor today, banks \nwith less than $1 billion in assets could receive capital investments \nup to 5 percent of their risk-weighted assets, and those with between \n$1 billion and $10 billion in assets could receive up to 3 percent.\n  We know community banks are the ones that small businesses do go to, \nsome with more success than others, and that is a speech for another \nday. But I do know there are a number of bankers who say: Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Snowe, we want to lend to our small businesses, and \nif you can help us with a few things, we could do a better job.\n  In addition, we also know that small businesses use their credit \ncards for capital. We also know our small businesses go to family \nmembers. They dig into their own savings to find the money needed to \ninitiate or support their business. We also know they go to their \nuncles and aunts. Financing through family members has been a \ntraditional way that small business owners use, and credit unions.\n  So everything we can do now--we cannot have a relief to the great \nuncle and aunt bill. That is a little bit out of our reach. But we can \nhelp our small banks, our small business agencies. We can look hard on \ncredit card companies and their practices and make sure they are doing \nright by businesses. We are trying to do all of that one step at a \ntime.\n  Let me take a minute or two to explain a few pieces of this bill. \nThis is one of the most important components. This chart is startling. \nTwo of the most important programs that SBA operates are the 7(a) and \n504 loan programs. These are the loan programs that all of the Federal \nGovernment--these are the programs that focus most directly on small \nbusiness loans in America. They allow a 90-percent guarantee and allow \nthe waiver of fees.\n  We did this, when the recession started, so a small business could go \ninto a bank and say: I have got a great idea. I want to expand; even \nthough my neighborhood is a little bit in the doldrums, and even though \nmy product is not in great demand today, I think it will be in the \nfuture. Can I have a loan? And the bank officer says: Well, we do not \nquite have money for you. But let me look in the 7(a) program. They can \nget a 90-percent loan backed up by the Federal Government, and these \nloans can be made without fees.\n  This is how low we were in 2008. We were only down to $200 million in \nloans back in 2008. You can see through the recession how low this was. \nWhen we acted, we acted back here in 2009 and started doing some \nincreased guarantees, reducing the fees. It worked. We spiked the \nnumber of loans up to almost $1.2 billion.\n  But as you can see, Congress's actions have a direct effect on this \nlending to small business. Look here. Now we are down below where we \nwere 2 years ago. This bill will move this number back up, and this \nbill will help this number stay up. This represents thousands of loans \nto small businesses, without which they cannot create the jobs that we \nneed and the country needs to get us out of the recession. This is a \nvery important component of our bill. I am very proud of that \ncomponent.\n  One more chart we will show. This is a startling chart. I have used \nthis several times. I hope people understand the potential for growth. \nThere is real potential here.\n  Right now in America, 1 percent of small businesses export. Think \nabout that. We are only 4 percent of the world's population, so 96 \npercent of everybody else lives somewhere else. The market is very big \noutside of America, although we are a very important market. So we can \nhelp our small businesses learn to be better exporters. With the \nInternet, now it becomes so possible for them to export products, with \nfirst day, short delivery times, all on-time delivery from airplanes, \ntrains, trucks that can deliver products everywhere. Plus, there are so \nmany ideas now with services. The small business here that has a great \nidea on the Internet, it becomes a great idea in Vietnam or in Korea or \na country in Africa. They can sell those products. So this bill does a \ngreat deal, with Senator Snowe's help, where she did pioneering work in \nthis area to help us give technical assistance to more small businesses \nand help them become experts on exporting so they can keep the money, \nthe profits, and the jobs right here at home.\n  My colleague has been good about waiting, but I wanted to share a few \nof the aspects of this important bill. We are going to be voting I hope \ntoday at about 2 o'clock or so. We hope to get the 60 votes necessary \nto move to this package.\n  As a manager of this package, I can say Senator Baucus as well, we \nare open to amendments people might want to have to perfect it. But we \nbelieve this is a very good, solid package to bring up. It is time that \nwe focus on the small businesses of America. They deserve our best \nefforts between now\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\nand the end of the year or as long as it takes. They have not gotten \nthe attention they deserve. So if we can get 60 votes, we may not be \nable to get all our work done this week, but we believe in the next \ncouple of weeks we can get the work done on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, yesterday I had the opportunity to be in \nPensacola, FL, to look at the impact the oilspill is having on my home \nState of Florida. I went out in the morning and walked on the beach and \nsaw, unfortunately, the oil that has spewed across our beautiful beach \nin Pensacola, one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Not only \ndid I see the scattering of droplets of oil across the beach first \nthing in the morning, I also saw what I will call not just tar balls \nbut tar rocks--rocks the size of grapefruit that had emulsified, almost \npetrified, and found their way to the shore.\n  Later in the day, I also took another trip to the beach to the place \nwhere we get naturally occurring tidal pools just a few feet from where \nthe ocean meets the coastline. In those pools, I could see oil that had \nseeped into the sand. Now we are to the point where the oil is seeping \ninto the sand faster than it can be cleaned up. The fear is, as the \nsand washes over that oil, it will be buried and we will continue to \ndiscover it for months and perhaps years on end. What effect it will \nhave on the beaches and our ecosystem is unknown.\n  This spill has been going on for 71 days. Throughout this time, I \nhave been calling upon greater Federal response to this tragedy in the \ngulf--most importantly, the need to have more skimmers off of our \nshoreline. Amazingly, we have not deployed the full panoply of assets \nwe have in this country to protect our beaches, to protect our coastal \nwaterways, to protect our estuaries. One would think every skimmer in \nthe United States would be in the Gulf of Mexico. One would think every \nforeign skimmer that has offered assistance would be deployed off our \nshores. But one would be incorrect in thinking that because it is not \nthe case.\n  When I met with the President 2 weeks ago today in Pensacola, I urged \nhim to bring more skimmers to the gulf coast. At that time, we had \nabout 32 skimmers off the coast of Florida. That number fell to 24 \nshortly thereafter. It is now, according to the State of Florida, up to \n89, according to the incident report today. That is an improvement. The \nFeds say there are 130. The State number and the Fed number have never \nmatched, so somewhere between 89 and 130 skimmers are off the coast of \nFlorida.\n  We believe there are about 400 skimmers in the Gulf of Mexico alone. \nThat number may sound like a lot, but when one thinks of an area going \nall the way from Louisiana to Panama City, FL, we look out on the \nbeach, and we don't see a single one.\n  How many skimmers are available to be deployed? We found out last \nweek there are skimmers remaining. As of June 21, in the United States, \nthere were 2,000 skimmers remaining. It sounds as if that is in \naddition to the 400 in the gulf right now. From Texas, district 8, \nthrough the Florida, Georgia, South Carolina district, which is \ndistrict 7, there are 850 skimmers in whole or in part not being \ndeployed. That makes absolutely no sense.\n  I have been calling for weeks now for this government, this \nadministration to sign an Executive order releasing all skimmers in the \nUnited States to come to the Gulf of Mexico to clean up the oilspill.\n  When I talked about this issue with the President, I said to him: We \nneed to get all these skimmers now. If there are 2,000, they need to be \nin the gulf. They need to be steaming toward the gulf now. There should \nbe an armada of skimmers off the beaches of Florida, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and Louisiana.\n  The response I got was: Some of these skimmers have to stay in place \nin case there is an oilspill.\n  That is like saying: We can't send a firetruck to your house because \nthere may be a fire burning someplace else. That is not much solace to \nyou if your house is burning down.\n  There is some good news. We have found out that as of yesterday, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard, along with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, have issued an emergency order. The \norder is signed by Admiral Papp from the Coast Guard and Lisa Jackson, \nAdministrator of EPA. It is a temporary suspension of certain oilspill \nresponse time requirements to support the Deepwater Horizon oilspill, \nthe urgently needed immediate relocation of nationwide oilspill \nresponse resources to the Gulf of Mexico. It also calls upon the Navy, \nwith which I met earlier last week, to release assets it has.\n  There are legal restrictions that require these skimmers to be in \ncertain places around the country if there is a certain amount of \ntraffic--for example, commercial traffic, the ports, or whatever. We \nneed to keep skimmers in place. This order, which we have been calling \non for weeks, releases those skimmers. It says it is done because there \nis an urgent need. It is not so urgent when we do it on day 70. It is \nwelcomed, but it wasn't done urgently. It says, on page 9 of this \norder, that this was done in response to a memorandum Admiral Watson of \nthe Coast Guard did on June 16 saying there was an urgent need to \nreallocate skimmers. I am glad to see that because that is the day \nafter I met with the President in Pensacola. I am glad the President \ngot the word out to the Coast Guard and got them to start working on \nthis order. We got it done. So we hope we will now see skimmers from \naround the country making their way to the gulf.\n  I have a list today of these 2,000 skimmers and where they are \nlocated. I am going to come to the floor every day we are here and \ntrack these skimmers to make sure they are getting where they need to \ngo. It is only through efforts by myself and others in the Senate who \nhave called this out, who have said: Where are these skimmers, that we \nhave gotten the sense of urgency to get them there, albeit not so \nurgently when it has taken 70 days. That is the issue of the domestic \nskimmers. Help is on the way. The rule has been signed. We are \nappreciative of that. We will see if those skimmers make it there \nanytime soon. We need them there because the oil is washing up on the \nshores. It is not only oil washing up, it is failure. It is failure \nbecause these skimmers were not in place earlier.\n  I wish to talk about a second topic, which is international \nassistance. I came to the floor last week with a picture of this \nvessel, the Swan. It was offered on May 6 to the United States from a \nDutch company, Dockwise. It had the capacity of soaking up 20,000 tons \nof oil a day, nearly 6 million gallons of oil a day. The Federal \nGovernment never got back to this Dutch company. Instead, an American \nship was used. We are glad to see that. We want American ships used. \nBut that ship only had one-twentieth the capability of this ship. My \nresponse is, use all of them. Use every one we can. Our country in our \ngoodness is the first to respond when there is a disaster someplace \nelse. Whether it is a typhoon, an earthquake, America, through the \ngoodness of the hearts of our people, goes forward and gives help. When \nother countries are offering us assistance, even when we have to pay \nfor it, we should be taking it. This ship never got used. How much oil \nwould have been sucked up by the Swan if it was in the gulf doing its \njob? How much oil would have been off the beaches of Florida, Alabama, \nMississippi, and Louisiana if this ship was doing its job? This is an \nemblem of an opportunity missed. Now this ship is no longer available.\n  There were something like 56 offers of assistance from foreign \ncountries and associations, and only 6 were accepted by the government. \nThey tell us the Jones Act--a law that prohibits foreign flag ships--is \nnot the reason we are not getting these ships in. They tell us the \nJones Act only applies to 3 miles in, coastal waterways. Therefore, it \nis no prohibition to bringing these ships in. One, that is not what \nthese folks think because they didn't get their ship in, and two, I \ndon't care what the reason is, whether it is the Jones Act or some \nother law, these ships should be here. This is not a Republican issue \nor a Democratic issue; this is an issue of competence. These ships \nshould be there.\n  Let me show you the next ship we have a chance at, and hopefully we \nwon't mess this up. The Swan was a\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\nvery big ship. This ship is aptly named ``A Whale.'' It is the world's \nlargest skimmer, if reports are correct. It is making its way from \nVirginia to the Gulf of Mexico. The skimming capacity of this ship is \nat least 250 times that of the modified fishing boats currently \nattempting to skim the gulf. This one ship can skim as much as 250 of \nthe skimmers that are in the gulf now in a single day. The vessel's \ncapacity is sufficient to draw in as much as 500,000 barrels of oil. \nThe Swan could do 20,000 barrels. This is 500,000 barrels of oil per 8- \nto 10-hour cycle. This is the mother of all skimmers. It is like the \nsize of an aircraft carrier. We do not know yet whether this ship is \ngoing to be allowed in the gulf to skim up oil. It is beyond belief, it \nis beyond comprehension that we would not use this ship and ships like \nit to get the job done.\n  I will be doing everything I can to make sure A Whale or any other \nship of this size can be in the Gulf of Mexico to help us. We want the \ndomestic assets. We want the small skimmers we have now. The ones \ncoming from the Navy can fit on the back of a truck or fit in a plane \nor on a railcar. They are small. We are happy to have them, but they \npale in comparison to the size of A Whale, reportedly the world's \nlargest skimmer. I ask the President, why aren't we letting this ship \nin the gulf to skim up the oil? It is beyond belief. It is beyond \ncomprehension.\n  I will continue to come to the Chamber every day we are here to talk \nabout this issue, about foreign ships that can help, about domestic \nships being deployed, until we stop the oil from spilling on the bottom \nof the gulf, until we clean up all the oil that is in the gulf right \nnow. It is impacting the lives of Floridians. When I was in Pensacola \nyesterday and talked to everyday Floridians, I could see the anguish in \ntheir eyes. I could see the stress and hear it in their voices. People \nmove to Florida because they love the water. Ninety percent of \nFloridians live within 10 miles of the water. They have more \nrecreational boaters than any State in the Union, more coastline than \nany State in the continental United States. It is part of our way of \nlife. Every resource available should be used to keep this oil from \ncoming ashore.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kaufman are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n  In Praise of Eileen Harrington, Lois Greisman, Allen Hile, Stephen \n          Warren, Carolyn Shanoff, and Lawrence DeMille-Wagman\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about some other great \nFederal employees. Many of the great achievements I have hailed from \nthis desk concern grand challenges relating to our national security, \ndomestic tranquility, or our economic recovery. Today, I wish to \nrecognize a team of highly skilled, highly motivated Federal employees \nwhose achievement has positively affected the daily lives of average \nAmericans.\n  In 2003, six outstanding employees of the Federal Trade Commission \nworked together to implement the National Do Not Call Registry. \nAmericans used to be plagued--I can remember it always seemed to happen \naround dinnertime--by telemarketer solicitations, which always seemed \nto come just when you least wanted them. The six men and women I am \nhonoring today brought relief to families across the country by \nimplementing the Do Not Call Registry. Led by Eileen Harrington, the \nteam consisted of Lois Greisman, Allen Hile, Stephen Warren, Carolyn \nShanoff, and Lawrence DeMille-Wagman. They all brought to the table a \nstrong background in a number of fields, including law, marketing, and \nbusiness.\n  The FTC's Do Not Call Registry launched 7 years ago this week quickly \nbecame a hit. Within the first 4 days, 10 million Americans registered \ntheir phone numbers. Just a year after it launched, a poll found--this \nis incredible--91 percent of adults had heard of the registry and--can \nyou believe it--over half had already signed up. When Eileen and her \nteam won the 2004 Service to America medal for citizen services, the \nregistry had nearly 60 million numbers. That was in 2004. Today, that \nhas risen to over 150 million.\n  To turn a good idea into a great program, the team spent several \nmonths designing and implementing the Do Not Call Registry as part of \nthe FTC's rulemaking process. It required the participation of many at \nthe Consumer Protection Bureau, the Economic Bureau, and the General \nCounsel's Office. Information system experts and legal minds worked \nclosely together with senior executives, and they were joined by \nfinancial analysts and congressional relations staff. Once the policy \nhad been crafted, there was a period of public comment, which saw over \n64,000 suggestions on how to improve the registry, many of which were \nadopted in the final program.\n  In the 7 years since the Do Not Call Registry was launched, it has \nbecome one of the most successful government programs in terms of the \nnumber of Americans it has affected positively in such an incredibly \nshort period of time.\n  I am also proud to share with my colleagues that all of the members \nof the FTC's ``do not call'' team are still serving in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Eileen Harrington remained at the FTC for a few years and in 2009 was \nappointed as the Chief Operating Officer for the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  Stephen Warren served as Chief Information Officer at the FTC until \n2007, when he moved over to the Department of Veterans Affairs as \nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information Technology.\n  Lois Greisman leads the FTC's Division of Marketing Practices within \nthe Consumer Protection Bureau, and her responsibilities include \nenforcing the rules against telemarketing fraud and online investment \nschemes.\n  Also with the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection is Carolyn Shanoff, \nwho today serves as the Associate Director for Consumer and Business \nEducation. In this role, she has been instrumental in the fight against \nidentity theft.\n  Allen Hile and Lawrence DeMille-Wagman are also still at the FTC. \nAllen serves as Assistant Director, and Lawrence works as an attorney.\n  We are all very fortunate that accomplished men and women such as \nthese choose to stay in government and continue working on behalf of \nthe American people. I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing \nthe great work of the FTC ``do not call'' team and thanking them on \nbehalf of all Americans for their important work. They are all truly \ngreat Federal employees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank \nthe Senator from Delaware for those comments in his weekly update on \nFederal employees and the great job they are doing. In the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we know quite a few of them \nwho are doing outstanding work, even something that would surprise \nAmerica; that is, cooperation between agencies that is outstanding. So \nI thank the Senator for his efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5514-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, in jest, I said to my Republican friends \nthat I had kind of practiced this because we hadn't filled up the tree \nmuch at all. I say that seriously. We have had an open process here. \nYou can compare it to what went on in the previous Congress, and it has \nbeen very open. I hope we can get into an amendment process. We will go \nback and forth. We will try to have some amendments that will \nstrengthen this bill. This is a bipartisan bill, as indicated by the \nvote that took place to get us to this. The Republicans were given this \namendment last night. They have had ample opportunity to look it over. \nIf they have things they want to do to try to improve it, we on this \nside of the aisle want to approach this on a bipartisan basis. This is \na jobs bill to create jobs where most jobs are created, by small \nbusinesses, as 85 percent of all jobs are created by small business. \nThat is why we are here focused on this today. I hope this doesn't \nbecome a partisan exercise. It should not. The Small Business Committee \nhas operated for a long time on a bipartisan basis. Snowe was chairman, \nLandrieu was the ranking member. Now it is just the opposite. Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley have always worked on a bipartisan basis. I \nhope we can move forward on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an \n     optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.\n\n  The great recession has been a difficulty, to say the least.\n  Today we are looking for the opportunity.\n  One opportunity--and our first priority--is to create new jobs.\n  This is no easy task. Over the course of the great recession, more \nthan 8 million jobs have been lost. But we must not shy away from this \nopportunity.\n  The first step Congress took to create jobs was to pass the Recovery \nAct in February of 2009. In their latest report on the Recovery Act, \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that the Recovery \nAct has added 1.2 to 2.8 million people to America's payrolls.\n  And in March, Congress passed the HIRE Act. The HIRE Act includes a \npayroll tax exemption for new hires. That act will help to bolster job \ncreation in the coming months.\n  These actions are working. In April, we learned that the economy \nadded 290,000 jobs. And while we added fewer jobs than expected last \nmonth, May marked the fifth consecutive month of job growth. Since the \nbeginning of 2010, the American economy has created more than half a \nmillion jobs.\n  We are also beginning to see economic growth. Just a year ago, in the \nfirst quarter of 2009, the economy was shrinking at a rate of 6.4 \npercent. In the first quarter of this year, however, the economy grew \nat a rate of 3.2 percent.\n  This was the third consecutive quarter of growth after four straight \nquarters of decline.\n  In just 1 year, the economy went from freefall to sustained growth.\n  These signs are encouraging. But we still have work to do.\n  Mr. President, 15 million Americans remain unemployed. The national \nunemployment rate is still near 10 percent. The Congressional Budget \nOffice does not expect unemployment to reach its ``natural state'' of 5 \npercent until 2016.\n  Plainly, we must act. We must work to create jobs.\n  In America, the private sector is the backbone of innovation and job \ncreation. And within the private sector, small businesses are the \nprincipal engine of job creation.\n  Over the past 15 years, small businesses have generated two-thirds of \nall new jobs. That is about 12 million new jobs.\n  But the great recession hit small business especially hard. Over the \ncourse of the recession, small firms have accounted for 64 percent of \nnet job losses.\n  We need to focus on small business, as we seek to create jobs. When \nwe help small businesses, we help to get Americans back to work.\n  The first way that we can help small business is by promoting access \nto capital.\n  Today, only half of small businesses seeking a loan are able to get \nthe credit that they need, and nearly a quarter receive no credit at \nall.\n  Compare this to 2005, when 90 percent of small employers had their \ncredit needs met, and only 8 percent were unable to receive credit at \nall.\n  It is clear that small businesses are facing major obstacles to \ngetting capital.\n  That is why our small business bill includes a provision to \ncompletely eliminate the tax on the sale of certain small business \nstock purchased this year. This proposal would provide a powerful \nincentive to invest in small, entrepreneurial firms, right now.\n  We have also included a provision that would allow small businesses \nto carry back for 5 years their unused general business tax credits \nfrom this year. That is quite a bit. Current law is 1 year.\n  And we have included another provision that would allow certain small \nbusinesses to use these general business credits against the \nalternative minimum tax. These provisions would free up business \ncapital for expansion and job growth.\n  And another provision would temporarily shorten the holding period of \nassets after a C corporation converts to an S corporation. This \nprovision would allow small businesses to increase liquidity by selling \nassets that would otherwise be subject to an additional layer of tax.\n  We can also help small businesses by stimulating investment. Small \nbusinesses need to make capital investments to improve and expand.\n  One way to boost investment in equipment is by increasing the amount \nand types of property that small businesses can write off immediately, \nrather than expense over time. In this weak economy, the ability to \ndeduct the costs of assets in the year that they are incurred provides \nan immediate benefit for small businesses.\n  Our bill also includes an extension of bonus depreciation. This \nprovision would help small businesses that purchase equipment to write \noff those purchases more quickly. The proposal would also help the \nbusinesses that sell the equipment. Bonus depreciation sparks \ninvestment, increases cash flows, and creates jobs.\n  Our small business bill also includes two provisions to promote \nfairness and protect small businesses from costs that could slow \nbusiness growth and development.\n  First, the act modifies the penalties for small businesses that \nunknowingly\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\ninvest in something that the IRS considers to be a tax shelter. \nBusinesses can be subject to penalties of up to $300,000 for investing \nin a tax shelter. A penalty that large can severely jeopardize the \nsuccess of a small business. Our bill would limit the penalty in \nrelation to size of the investment.\n  Our bill also promotes fairness by allowing business owners to deduct \nagainst self-employment tax the cost of health insurance in 2010 for \nthemselves and their family members. Current law does not permit the \nself-employed to deduct the cost of health insurance for themselves and \ntheir family members in calculating self-employment tax. But health \ncare for employees receiving coverage through an employer is generally \ntax free. So our bill would put the self-employed on a more equal \nfooting.\n\n  Our small business bill includes provisions aimed at promoting \nentrepreneurship. According to a recent report, from 1980 to 2005, \nnearly all net job creation occurred in firms less than 5 years old. In \nfact, without startups, net job creation would have been negative \nalmost every year for the past three decades.\n  As our economy emerges from the great recession, we need to ensure \nthat American entrepreneurs have the resources, the financing, and the \nopportunities they need to create jobs and realize their dreams. Our \nbill would help promote entrepreneurship by temporarily increasing the \namount of startup costs that could be deducted. This would free capital \nthat could be used to invest in other aspects of business.\n  Our bill would devote more than $5 million to the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to expand opportunities for U.S. small businesses in \nforeign markets. This would help American goods and services to reach \nnew customers around the world, this would create jobs right here at \nhome, and this would help the USTR to enforce our trade agreements to \nensure American startups can compete on a level playing field.\n  Our bill is all paid for. No deficit spending here--all paid for. Our \nbill would reduce the tax gap, promote retirement preparation, and \nclose tax loopholes.\n  Today, we must find opportunity in a difficulty. The great recession \nhas been a major difficulty for American workers and small businesses, \nbut we can seize a major opportunity by helping small businesses and \ngetting Americans back to work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important small business jobs \nbill.\n\n\n                    National Flood Insurance Program\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to speak in morning \nbusiness about the National Flood Insurance Program and talk about the \nimportance of extending the National Flood Insurance Program as a \ntropical storm--that could be a hurricane--is growing in the Gulf of \nMexico and moving toward my home State of Texas.\n  We all know the Gulf of Mexico has had a lot of trauma, and the \npeople who live all along the gulf have suffered quite enough. Now we \nhave a situation in which tropical storm Alex is gaining strength off \nthe coast of south Texas. Winds are gusting upwards of 70 miles per \nhour, and it could reach hurricane strength at any point. Texas \ncommunities from Padre Island to Matagorda Bay are under a hurricane \nwarning. The National Weather Service is calling for up to 20 inches of \nrain in some parts of our State and is warning communities to brace for \nlife-threatening flash floods and mud slides.\n  However, at this very time, thousands of Texas homeowners are left \nvulnerable to the damage this storm could wreak on their homes and \nproperty. Why? The National Flood Insurance Program lapsed at the end \nof May, which means homeowners are currently unable to take out new \npolicies. Allowing a lapse in federally backed flood insurance is \nunacceptable at any time, but the failure to extend it at the outset of \nhurricane season is unthinkable.\n  The very purpose of the National Flood Insurance Program is to make \nsure coastal residents and other flood-prone communities can purchase \nreliable, federally backed flood insurance. The program allows \nhomeowners to purchase flood insurance policies in areas where private \ninsurance is hard--and in some cases impossible--to get.\n  Since residents in some areas are required to have it in order to \nclose on home purchases, many gulf coast families cannot close on \nmortgage contracts. My Houston office received 200 calls yesterday from \npeople who were in the process of closing on homes which required flood \ninsurance protection to be shown before they could close, and they \ncannot get the flood insurance because it is not available out of the \nprivate sector and this program has lapsed. Today, it is the Federal \nGovernment that is standing in the way of these people being able to \nclose on a contract.\n  Because of previous devastating storms, including Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita, the National Flood Insurance Program has incurred billions of \ndollars in claims and is in an economically tenuous position. I have \nsupported legislation to revise and update this program. It needs to \nmeet the demands of today while still providing access to flood \ninsurance coverage to Americans living in floodplains--Americans who \nare trying to do the responsible thing. They are trying to purchase \ninsurance. It is not available in the private market, and we need to \nhave that kind of opportunity for people to be able to purchase their \nown insurance for them to be able to close on homes, of course, and to \nbe able to protect themselves from damages. These are people who do not \nwant to have to file claims against the Federal Government. They want \nto be able to purchase their own insurance and know they have it.\n  In 2008, I, along with an overwhelming majority of my colleagues in \nthe Senate, supported the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act \nof 2007. Unfortunately, despite big support in the Senate and in the \nHouse, our two Chambers failed to resolve our differences. Therefore, \nit has operated in limbo ever since, surviving only in short-term \nextensions.\n  Now there is a bill to extend the National Flood Insurance Program \nthrough September 30. It has been approved in the House and was sent to \nthe Senate. It is currently being held up.\n  My colleague from Louisiana, Senator Vitter, offered a unanimous \nconsent request this morning to bring up this House bill, pass it in \nthe Senate, and send it to the President. It would have extended the \nflood insurance program until September 30 so that people could buy \ninsurance, know they would be covered, be able to close on their homes, \nand be able to get coverage while we continue to hammer out the \ndifferences in a long-term extension of the program.\n  Unfortunately, there was an objection raised to the House bill going \nthrough the Senate. It is so important that we do this. I asked the \nreason for the objection. I asked one of my colleagues on the other \nside: Why was this objected to?\n  The answer was: Is it more important than the tax extenders bill?\n  I cannot say it is more important because we do need to extend \nunemployment insurance, but they are not mutually exclusive. We can do \none or the other; we can do both. There is no objection to the \nsubstance of the bill. No one on the other side of the aisle objects to \nthe bill. They just want to pass the extenders package. We want to pass \nthe extenders package too. We want it to be paid for.\n  We can do this. It is so important and so timely. It is timely \nbecause people are not able to close on contracts. Mortgage companies \nare saying: Our hands are tied. You have to show that you have this \nflood insurance to close, and there is no flood insurance available on \nthe private market. The National Flood Insurance Program has not been \nextended.\n  This is one that Congress can resolve. We are going to be here for a \nfew more days this week. We can do this. I implore my colleagues: \nPlease, let's unanimously consent to letting this bill go through. The \nHouse has passed it unanimously.\n  A hurricane is headed right now for the Gulf of Mexico. It is time to \nallow our responsible citizens who want to purchase flood insurance to \nbe able to do so in a responsible way.\n  We certainly need to modernize the National Flood Insurance Program, \nand I will work tirelessly to make that happen. But with a storm \napproaching right now, we need to extend this program until the end of \nthe hurricane season. We do not want people to have\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\nto flood into the government after the fact when they are desperate, \nnot knowing if they are going to get coverage. We do not want them to \nhave to come to the Federal Government and ask for claims to be \nprocessed. Let them cover themselves so they can deal with the issue, \nknowing exactly what their coverage is. That is not too much to ask for \nthe residents of the gulf coast.\n  I hope the majority leader and the majority will work with us to \nbegin to address this issue in a timely way. The House has passed this \nbill unanimously. I urge my colleagues in the next 2 days to please \nallow the National Flood Insurance Program to be extended until \nSeptember 30, a bill that has unanimously passed the House and surely \nshould be able to go through the Senate since there is no substantive \nobjection to this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, when I think of Senator Byrd and all of \nour great memories of him, it reminds me of how important it was to him \nto understand what people are going through in their lives--in this \neconomy, certainly. I know if he were here, he would be on the floor, \nspeaking about the importance of helping people who have lost their \njobs--people who, through no fault of their own, have gotten caught in \nthis economic tsunami, who find themselves maybe one step away from \nlosing their house after they lost their job, probably lost their \nhealth insurance. Maybe they are in the midst of foreclosure right now \nbecause they lost their job and cannot pay their house payment.\n  These are families who are counting on us to understand, as Senator \nByrd always did, what it is like to be a middle-class family, a working \nfamily, where the breadwinner has lost their job or the breadwinner can \nno longer bring home the bread--the food, gas for the car, pay the \nelectric bill--because they have lost a job.\n  We know there are five people today looking for every one job that is \navailable. That used to be worse. It used to be six people looking for \nevery one job. We are beginning to see things turn. When President \nObama took office, as we know, we were losing about 750,000 jobs every \nmonth. By focusing on the recovery, by investing in people, by \ninvesting in making things in this country, by focusing on job training \nas well as helping people without jobs, we have been able to turn that \naround. There were zero jobs lost at the end of the year and now we are \ngaining jobs.\n  But even though it is turning around, we are still in a situation \nwhere we have five people, five Americans who are looking for every one \navailable job. The e-mails and the phone calls I get truly are \nheartbreaking. They are from people who have worked all their lives. \nThese are not people who, as some have said, are lazy. These are people \nwho have worked hard all their lives and they have done nothing but \nplay by the rules--take care of their families, followed the law, put a \nlittle bit aside to send their kids to college. They want to have a \ngood American life, what they have worked hard for as their American \ndream.\n  Unfortunately, because of a lot of factors in the global economy--too \nmuch, in the last decade, of folks paying attention to cheap prices and \nnot American jobs and losing jobs overseas, not enforcing our trade \nlaws or not focusing on making things here in this country--we have a \nsituation where people have lost their jobs. Then, when you add to that \nwhat happened on Wall Street--where people lost savings, pensions, \n401(k)s, and maybe their job; when credit dried up and small businesses \ncould not get loans or manufacturers couldn't get the help they \nneeded--people found themselves in a disastrous situation through no \nfault of their own.\n  They did not create the Wall Street crisis. They were not the ones \nwho decided whether to enforce our trade laws. They weren't the ones to \ndecide whether we as a country were going to invest in American \nmanufacturing. But they are taking the brunt of it.\n  We have talked for 8 weeks now, 8 weeks to pass a bill that is a jobs \nbill, to invest in jobs in the economy and to continue help for people \nwho are out of work through no fault of their own. Boy, they hope it is \ntemporary. They surely hope it is temporary and we hope it is \ntemporary.\n  Despite 8 weeks and a tremendous amount of negotiation, we have not \nbeen able to get the votes to stop a filibuster. We have come up short \nevery time. I am hopeful this week we will be able to get beyond that. \nThe people in Michigan are desperately hopeful. They are also \ndesperate. They are also angry that we have not been able to get beyond \nthis partisan wrangling to be able to actually help them keep a roof \nover their head and keep food on the table for their families. We will \nhave another opportunity, I hope this week, to change that. It is \nabsolutely critical that we do.\n  There are a lot of people who are not down in the weeds about what is \ngoing on legislatively; are not following closely what is happening \nhere--but they know this: They know they need help. They want to know \nwho is on their side and who is willing to understand and come forward \nand appreciate what families across this country are going through. I \nhope this week we are going to be able to say to them that finally this \nSenate gets what is happening to families and we are going to extend \nthe temporary assistance that has been needed for so many families \nthrough unemployment insurance.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment Senator \nKerry and I will be offering as an amendment to the small business jobs \nbill. This amendment is to correct something we do not want the IRS \nenforcing right now. Senator Kerry and I have 72 Members who have \ncosponsored our bill that we will be offering as an amendment. There is \noverwhelming bipartisan support for this. I thank Chairman Baucus and \nRanking Member Grassley for committing to work with Senator Kerry and \nmyself to get this issue addressed.\n  The need for the amendment is based on a little-noticed provision \nthat was added in 1989. It has to do with cell phones and similar \ndevices that are treated as what the IRS has known as ``listed \nproperty,'' along with computers and automobiles. As a result, \nemployees and employers must keep detailed records of all calls made on \ntheir employer-issued cell phones, indicating whether they are personal \nor business related, or have the value of the phone included as taxable \nincome. This law is a good example of the Government attempting to \nmicromanage the economy and why they shouldn't. Government is not good \nat keeping up with the private sector.\n  Twenty years ago, cell phones were bulky, they were cumbersome and \nexpensive, they were the size of a brick and weighed almost as much. \nWhen given by businesses to employees, they were considered to be an \nexecutive perk or a luxury item and were often hardwired to the floor \nof a car.\n  During the past 20 years, of course, cell phones and mobile \ncommunications devices have become incredibly small and cheap, and \ntheir use has skyrocketed. Cell phones and other mobile communications \ndevices are now part of daily business practices at all levels. As a \nmatter of fact, they are part of almost every American's daily life. \nThey are an extension of the office for many employees and everyone \nrecognizes the real motivation of employers is being able to call their \nemployees at any time and at any place. The cost of providing coffee \nper employee today is likely higher than the per-employee cost of a \ncell phone or personal device. The mobile cell phone amendment updates \nthe tax treatment of cell phones and mobile communications devices by \nrepealing the requirement that employers maintain these overly \nburdensome, detailed usage logs. Outdated tax laws such as this must be \nupdated to reflect 21st century realities, and this bipartisan \namendment would do exactly that.\n\n  This is a small but important measure that we should be able to enact \ntoday to help small businesses, nonprofits, colleges, and employees use \ntoday's technology for business without interference from yesterday's \nregulation. This proposal was included in the President's budget, and \nif you need\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\nmore reasons to vote for this bill, talk to the Internal Revenue \nCommissioner, Doug Shulman, who released a statement that supports \nrepeal of the current IRS cell phones reporting rules.\n  In his statement Commissioner Shulman states that:\n\n       The current law, which has been on the books for many \n     years, is burdensome, poorly understood by taxpayers, and \n     difficult for the IRS to administer consistently.\n\n  Let me quickly summarize what we are doing. Basically, everybody who \ngets a cell phone from their employer, we don't want them to pay tax on \nthat cell phone as some kind of a perk. If you think about how bills \nare paid today with cell phones, you have a monthly usage charge. You \ndon't get charged per cell phone call as it used to be in the old days \nwhen cell phones were very expensive. People buy plans per month, so \nmany minutes you get with those plans. For virtually everybody who gets \na cell phone from a company, that is the way those plans are purchased \ntoday. We need to simplify the Tax Code. This is a very minor provision \nbut an important provision because you don't want, all of a sudden, \nwhen you are going back through an IRS audit, to have to go back years \nand years and go through every one of your cell phone records and \ndetermine whether that was a personal phone call, was this a business \nphone call, and what percentage now, and having to figure all that out.\n  This is a simplification of the Tax Code. It is the right thing to \ndo. It is a very simple thing to do. As soon as the amendment process \nis figured out, we will be offering this as one of the first amendments \nto the small business tax bill.\n  Once again, it has been a pleasure working with my colleague Senator \nKerry on this bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, spoke \na few moments ago about the amendment we hope we can consider shortly, \nthe Kerry-Ensign amendment on cell phones. That amendment deals with \nwhen an employer gives a cell phone to an employee. The question is, Is \nthat compensation to the employee or is that an investment by the \nemployer? Under current law, the IRS expects taxpayers to document how \nmuch they use the company's cell phone for business and how much they \nuse it for personal use. I think most people don't keep these records. \nFrankly, most of my colleagues don't believe they should have to. This \namendment says businesses should not have to bear this onerous \nrecordkeeping burden anymore. It is a commonsense amendment. It has \nbroad bipartisan support. I urge colleagues to support it at the \nappropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Conrad are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I wish to address my colleagues for a \nfew minutes about the pending legislation that was recently introduced \nby my chairman and friend, Senator Baucus of Montana. This bill is \ntargeted at creating jobs by providing targeted relief to our Nation's \njob engine, and that happens to be small businesses.\n  Our Nation is currently facing challenging economic times, as we have \nnow for about 20 months. While there have been some signs of \nimprovement, such as the recent growth of our gross domestic product, \njob losses continue to mount and many hard-working Americans are \nstruggling to make ends meet. According to our Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, around 8 million jobs have been lost since our economy \nofficially slipped into recession in December of 2007. The unemployment \nrate is currently 9.7 percent, which is simply an unacceptable level.\n  Small businesses in particular have been hit hard, with most job \nlosses being attributed to businesses with fewer than 500 employees. \nAccording to the ADP national employment data, from December of 2007 \nthrough May of this year, small businesses with fewer than 500 \nemployees saw employment decline by 6.4 million, while businesses with \n500 or more employees saw employment decline by 1.66 million. According \nto this data, small businesses--those with fewer than 500 employees--\naccounted, then, for nearly 80 percent of the decline in employment \nduring that period of December 2007 through May 2010.\n  The lack of job creation continues despite aggressive actions taken \nat the Federal level to stabilize the economy. This includes the \nenactment of the TARP bill, also the $800 billion stimulus bill, and \nmore recently a bill we termed the ``HIRE Act.'' However, these bills \nwere all missing a critical ingredient for spurring job creation; that \nis, substantial tax relief targeted at small businesses. The reason for \nthat is most small businesses hire or do not hire according to what \ntheir cash flow is. When taxes are high, there is less cash flow or \nwhen tax policy is in a state of flux, as right now--what is it going \nto be this year because of sunsets this year--that uncertainty causes \nbusinesses not to be as aggressive as they normally might be in hiring.\n  While President Obama and my Democratic colleagues agree that small \nbusinesses create 70 percent of the jobs in our economy, less than one-\nhalf of 1 percent of the stimulus bill was tax relief for small \nbusinesses--in other words, not putting the money where it would do the \nmost good.\n  The HIRE Act, which the Democratic leadership sold as a so-called \njobs bill, did not fare much better in providing tax relief to our \nNation's job engine. There was only one provision directed solely to \nsmall business tax relief. That was a provision I supported that \nincreased expensing equipment purchased by small businesses. But it is \na very small provision, and it only gave small businesses what they \nhave already been getting for the last couple of years. That provision \nwas only $35 million out of a $21 billion bill.\n  With the recent introduction of the small business tax relief bill, \nit looks as if this body is finally starting to get serious about \ntackling unemployment through a true jobs bill, compared to previous \nstimulus or jobs bills promoted by the majority.\n  This small business bill has a rather modest cost of about $12 \nbillion to $15 billion. It is targeted at job creation by providing \nsmall businesses incentives to invest in new equipment, expand their \noperations, and ultimately hire new employees.\n  The bill includes provisions that would encourage businesses to \ninvest in new equipment and real property by increasing the amount of \ncapital expenditures small businesses can expense. For equipment, the \namount that can be expensed is increased to $500,000, and for real \nproperty it is $250,000.\n  Moreover, it encourages investment by providing additional first-year \nbonus depreciation. It promotes entrepreneurship by increasing the \namount allowed as a deduction for startup expenditures. It would \nincrease access to capital by allowing 100 percent of gain from \ninvestment and qualified small business stock to be excluded from \nincome and taking the general business tax credit out of the \nalternative minimum tax for sole proprietorships, for flowthroughs and \nnonpublicly traded C corporations with $50 million or less of annual \ngross receipts. It also increases access to capital by extending the 1-\nyear carryback for general business credits to a 5-year carryback for \nsmall businesses.\n\n  Finally, the bill promotes small business fairness by limiting harsh \npenalties that have been imposed on small businesses by the IRS and \nequalizing the tax benefits for health insurance that self-employed \nindividuals may receive to those received by employees.\n  While this small business bill would go a long way in informing small \nbusinesses Congress is very serious about\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nreducing the burdens imposed on them, many businesses continue to \nstruggle and will not hire new employees simply because it is the \nstated policy goals of Congress.\n  According to the most recent survey from the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses--and we refer to that organization around here \nas the NFIB--when businesses are asked what the single most important \nproblem facing their business is, the No. 1 answer is lack of sales, \nbut this is closely followed by taxes and then by government regulation \nand redtape.\n  I have a chart here from the most recent NFIB survey listing the top \nproblems facing small businesses, and you can see there, as I said, \nthat first is poor sales; secondly, taxes; and then government \nregulation and redtape being the hindrances to small businesses \nexpanding to create the jobs small businesses can create. Consequently, \nyou can see tax policy is very important because, as I said, small \nbusinesses tend to operate out of cash flow to a greater extent than \ncompanies with equity and stock.\n  The small business community is currently being strangled by a \nclimate of uncertainty. Whether we are speaking about cap and trade--\nsome people refer to that as cap and tax--that will drastically \nincrease energy costs or about health care reform that will require \nsmall businesses to offer health benefits that will increase the cost \nof labor or about the call for tax increases on so-called wealthy \ntaxpayers earning over $200,000, that will largely fall on the backs of \nsmall businesses. Whether you are talking about any of these three--or \nmore that I could mention--there is a great deal out there that causes \nsmall businesses to stop and think of whether now is the time to expand \nand hire new workers.\n  Taxpayers earning above $200,000 are frequently identified as coupon \nclippers by many of my friends on the other side of the aisle. A \ndisproportionate level of business activity is attributable to small \nbusinesses owned by that group, and we have a chart here that shows \nevidence of this linkage. This chart is based upon Gallup survey data \nshowing that over half of the larger small businesses--the ones with \nthe good share of the workforce--are controlled by taxpayers who are \ntargeted by the other side's marginal rate hikes. Twenty-seven percent \nof the medium-sized small businesses are controlled by taxpayers \ntargeted by as much as a 17-percent marginal rate hike.\n  The owners of the smallest of the small business community are also \naffected. You see from the chart that it provides an example of how a \nfairly typical small business owner would be impacted by the increase \nin just the two marginal tax rates, which is the proposal of the \nPresident and I assume something we are going to be dealing with \nbetween now and the end of the year because everything sunsets on \nDecember 31. And I can tell you that nobody wants to be out there \ncampaigning this fall with the largest tax increase in the history of \nthe country happening without even a vote of the people and \nparticularly as it is going to hit middle-income taxpayers.\n  So you have this possibility whether it is Congress legislating, in \nthe higher tax brackets, higher taxes or whether it is just the tax \nincrease going into effect without a vote of Congress. You can see here \nin the charts that a small business owner who is married and has two \nchildren, who has $500,000 in taxable income could see a $19,600 tax \nhike. That is a 13-percent increase in taxes.\n  One way Congress can try to put some certainty back into the lives of \nsmall businesses and entrepreneurs is by dealing with the unfinished \ntax legislation business. As this chart shows--and I think I brought \nthis chart to the floor at least four times in the last 3 weeks I have \nbeen addressing this issue of taxes--there are four major pieces of \nlegislation dealing with expired or expiring tax provisions that have \nyet to be addressed by this Congress, meaning between now and \nadjournment this December.\n  I have talked about this unfinished tax legislation business several \ntimes over the past few weeks, but I cannot stress enough how important \ndealing with these time-sensitive matters is for the business community \nbecause one of the reasons they are not hiring is because of the \nuncertainty that is out there--what is Congress going to do and when \nare they going to do it? Without certainty in tax policy, businesses \nare unable to plan for the future, and many businesses are in a holding \npattern waiting to see what Congress will do. So it is quite obvious \nthis is very bad for the economy and it will not be an environment for \njob creation. The list of unfinished tax legislative business includes \neverything we have here, but I will mention them: the tax extenders, \nwhich are overdue by over a half year; it also includes the alternative \nminimum tax patch; another area is the death tax; and the final area is \nthe 2001 and 2003 tax rate cuts.\n  I am going to discuss that policy today and its implication for small \nbusinesses because until we get small businesses confident of the \nfuture and willing to spend money and invest, we are not going to \ncreate jobs. And that is a big void that is out there--not that this \nSenator is the only one saying so. Many Senators on the other side, \nincluding the leader of the Senate, have said that 70 percent of new \njobs are created by small businesses.\n  As important as the AMT patch and the death tax are, they are dwarfed \nby the impact of this fourth package of expiring tax provisions--the \n2001 and 2003 rate cuts. This was a bipartisan tax relief package. I \nget so tired of people talking about the Bush tax cuts from the \nstandpoint that it was an entirely Republican-driven effort with no \nsupport from the other side of the aisle. There were a large number of \nSenators in the then-Democratic minority--which soon became a majority \nbecause of the switching of one Senator from a Republican to a \nDemocrat--who helped push through this bipartisan tax relief enacted in \n2001.\n  Under statutory pay-as-you-go, the amount permitted in this area by \nthe budget of last year is about $1.4 trillion. It covers about 80 \npercent of extending all the marginal tax rates and family tax relief \nfrom the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan plans. That number makes sense \nbecause the bipartisan tax relief plan cuts taxes for virtually every \nAmerican family who pays income tax.\n  How significant and how widespread is that tax relief, you may ask. \nThis chart, drawn not by Republicans or Democrats but by the \nCongressional Budget Office data, sheds some light on that very point I \nbring up. In other words, the significant and widespread tax relief is \nvery dramatic for most Americans.\n  The line above measures the effective tax rate paid by the top 5 \npercent of taxpayers. What is significant about that 5 percent is this \nis where the small business owner tax hit occurs. This group roughly \nrepresents those taxpaying families with incomes over $250,000. Under \nthe Democratic leadership's budget, this line will go back up to where \nit was in the year 2000. So you can see where the white vertical line \ngoes is where we were in the year 2000. And this is also where the \nPresident's budget and the statutory pay-as-you-go regime would take \nthe raise.\n  People on my side of the aisle--Republicans--believe this significant \ntax increase will be a mistake. We hope we will be able to debate this \npolicy in the House and Senate, in committees and on the floor. That \nwas, after all, the process we followed when the bipartisan tax relief \nplans were passed in 2001, 2003, and 2005. We will point out, as we did \nthen, that the tax increase falls primarily on the backs of small \nbusinesses.\n  Data from the Joint Committee on Taxation--and these are the \nnonpartisan official congressional scorekeepers on tax issues the way \nthe CBO is on spending issues--shows that 44 percent of the flowthrough \nbusiness income will be hit with the increase in the top two tax rates \nproposed by the President and the Democratic congressional leadership. \nA lot of this income is concentrated in the larger small businesses I \nhave referred to here earlier, particularly those of up to 500 \nemployees.\n  This hits small businesses particularly hard since most small \nbusinesses are organized, as I have said, as flowthrough entities. So \nit will increase taxes on a single small business owner who makes more \nthan $200,000 per year even if they plow all their income back into \ntheir small business to keep paying their workers or hire additional \nworkers.\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\n  The top marginal rate on small business owners will rise by almost 17 \npercent. Democrats and Republicans agree that small businesses are the \nkey job creators of the past and the future. President Obama correctly \npointed out that small businesses create 70 percent of the new jobs.\n  The rest will also hit investment hard. The top capital gains rate \nwill rise by 33 percent. The top dividend rate could nearly triple. All \nof this is set to occur, not at some far distant future point, it \noccurs about a half year from right now.\n\n  We all hope the economy is on a path to recovery, but does this heavy \ntax increase on small business owners and investment ever make sense? \nEven the most liberal Members on the other side might wonder whether it \nmakes sense. Do we think the private sector will grow if we hit small \nbusiness investors this hard 6 months from now? And think of the \nuncertainty between now and then. They are not going to do anything.\n  I remember that this President, between his election and January 20 \nwhen he was sworn in, decided that going into a recession--or by then \nin a recession--even though he campaigned on a promise of increasing \ntaxes on higher income people, it was not the right thing to do at that \ntime of a recession.\n  Last December the President had some of us down to talk about jobs, \nhelping turn the economy around, getting people hired. When he called \nupon me I offered him that same advice that he decided by himself 12 \nmonths before, that being in a recession was no time to increase taxes. \nWe were in a recession still in December of 2009, as we were in \nDecember of 2008, and we still have 9.7 percent unemployment. The \nPresident could help the economy if he would announce, as he did before \nbeing sworn in, that even though I campaigned on a platform of \nincreasing taxes on higher income people, now is not the time to do it. \nBut he seems inclined to increase taxes, even though it is detrimental \nto job creation, particularly job creation by small business.\n  You can see, then, that the bipartisan tax relief brought, at the \ntime we passed it, the effective rate down with respect to the bottom \n95 percent of the taxpayers as well. That is the bottom line of my \nchart right here. So it was a tax cut across the board for almost every \nAmerican. I stress this because some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle may be thinking to themselves: Sure, this is true for \nincome taxes. But what about other Federal taxes, such as Social \nSecurity, which make up a large percentage of taxes paid by lower and \nmiddle-income individuals? This chart is not just a depiction of \nFederal income taxes; this includes all Federal taxes. This includes \nSocial Security, other payroll taxes and excise taxes frequently \nreferred to by my colleagues on the other side as ``regressive taxes.''\n  Even including all Federal taxes over the last 30 years, the top 5 \npercent of income earners have paid a lot higher effective tax rate \nthan the bottom 95 percent. It has been that way no matter which party \nhas controlled the White House, Congress, or both the White House and \nCongress. It shows something that you would never know if you listen to \nthe rhetoric of the majority Members of this body or even listen to the \npunditry on the left and some in the media.\n  Here is what it shows: A progressive income tax system is deeply \nembedded in our culture. The bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and \n2003 made the system yet more progressive. These plans brought the \nrates down for the bottom 95 percent of the taxpayers, as you can see \nhere on the bottom line. The 2001 and 2003 tax relief plans dropped the \neffective tax rates for tax-paying families under $250,000 to their \nlowest levels in a generation. This is the current law, the current \nlevel of taxation.\n  In about a half year these rates will pop back up for all of these \ntaxpayers. That is the checkered line going across there. That is where \nthey are going to return to. The President, as powerful as he is, \ncannot unilaterally hike or cut taxes. He needs a bill from Congress to \ndo that.\n  On our side, we want all the tax relief made permanent. We want the \nopportunity to debate and to amend a bill that deals with this basic \nlevel of taxation, the basic level of taxation where the solid lines \ntake us both for high-income people and low-income people; otherwise, \nthey go back up to the checkered line there. This is unfinished \nbusiness that affects virtually every American taxpayer.\n  It is clear that over the last 3\\1/2\\ years, Republicans do not \ncontrol this Congress. We cannot decide the fate of the marginal rate \ncuts. It will have a fiscal consequence. There are pretty significant \nfiscal consequences, but if the Democratic leadership wants to keep \nthese levels of taxation low, then they have to deal with the fiscal \nconsequences.\n  Alternately, the Democratic leadership can raise taxes and claim the \nrevenue. Not changing the law by failing to act is the same as raising \nrates on virtually every American taxpayer. But they will have to \nexplain to those taxpayers why they raised taxes by almost 10 percent \non average.\n  In the 2006 election almost 4 years ago, the American people provided \nthe Democratic leadership with control of this Congress. In the \nelection 18 months ago, the American people provided the Democratic \nleadership the largest majorities that any one party has had in this \nbody in more than a generation. They also provided the Democratic \nleadership with a President of their party. The Democratic leadership \nspent the period of 2001 to 2006 thwarting efforts to make the \nbipartisan tax relief of 2001 and 2003 permanent--which, if they had \nnot fought it, would be permanent law and we would not have this \nuncertainty that keeps small business from hiring and expanding.\n  Upon assuming control, the majority has spent 3\\1/2\\ years with no \nlegislation to make permanent or even extend the marginal rate cuts and \nfamily tax relief packages. My friends in the Democratic leadership \nneed to step to the plate. We have had budget and statutory pay-as-you-\ngo, we have debated and voted on the breadth and composition of the \nmarginal rate cuts and family tax relief in those contexts. No \nlegislative action whatsoever. No House committee or floor action. No \nSenate committee or floor action--as you can see by my ``to do'' list.\n  The Democratic leadership needs to step to the plate. Blaming former \nPresident George W. Bush and the Republican Congresses of many sessions \nago is no substitute for running this time-sensitive tax legislative \nbusiness through the legislative process. Put forward some proposals. \nLet's debate those proposals. Let's allow for amendments. Do the \npeople's business. It is time to fill in each of these boxes with a \ncheckmark instead of an X.\n  Fiscal history shows us that raising these marginal rates on small \nbusinesses by as much as 17 percent will not necessarily improve the \nfiscal picture. The relationship between higher rates and higher \nrevenue is tenuous at best.\n  I have a chart that tracks this history for over 50 years, I believe. \nYes, for 55 years and, who knows, maybe farther back than that. \nTaxpayers are not automatons. Small business taxpayers will respond \ndramatically to higher rates. I am afraid the response will not help \nthe economy. It will not mean expansion. It could mean contraction. \nThis is not the right signal to send if we want businesses to create \nmore jobs.\n  I want to emphasize this chart. You can see, over a period of 55 \nyears, the red line is the revenue coming into the Federal Treasury \nfrom all Federal taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product. Then \nyou can see over that 55 years we have had varying years of high \nmarginal tax rates and lower marginal tax rates. It was 93 percent \nunder Eisenhower, down to a low of 28 percent under Ronald Reagan, back \nup to 35 percent for several years as a result of the Bush tax \nincrease, continued by the Clinton tax increase. Then with the 2001 \nbill you see it go down, the marginal tax rates, to 35 percent from 39 \npercent.\n  What that ought to tell you is that the people of this country are \nsmarter than we are here in the Senate. We can think we are going to \nincrease marginal tax rates and bring in a lot of revenue. But the \npeople of this country who have the capability of deciding whether they \nare going to invest and create jobs and invest so they can make more \nmoney have decided that they are only going to send so much money to \nWashington, DC, for those of us in the Congress to decide how the \nresources of this Nation are divided.\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\n  You can have 93-percent tax rates or you can have a low of 28-percent \ntax rates, but you still get about the same amount coming in. So we \nought not fool ourselves that we can direct to this country that we are \ngoing to force you to pay more taxes with higher marginal tax rates, \nbecause the people in this country have the ability to decide that they \nare going to work and produce or is it worth working and producing if \nyou have high marginal tax rates and then maybe decide not to work and \ninvest so hard and maybe take a life of leisure--more so. But you find \nwhen you reduce marginal tax rates you get more economic activity from \nit. You get more economic activity from it because, quite frankly, we \nin this Congress, 535 of us, when we decide what to do with the \nresources of this country it does not do as much economic good as when \nyou leave the money in the pockets of 137 million taxpayers and they \ndecide whether to spend or whether to save or to spend and save and how \nto save it and what to spend it on. It creates more jobs.\n  I hope we look at helping small business. The bill before us is a \ngood bill with solid initiatives for small business. I compliment my \nfriend Chairman Baucus for diligently pressing these issues. They would \nbe even more effective if we could address the uncertainty a small \nbusiness faces on the tax front.\n  When it comes to whether small business can do a better job of \ncreating employment or whether government can do it, I wanted to ask \nthe question: How many jobs did the stimulus bill create?\n  Here we were, February of 2009, passing an $800-some billion stimulus \nbill supposedly to keep employment under 8 percent, and it has not been \nunder 9\\1/2\\ percent for well over a year. That is government, through \nstimulus, trying to create jobs--and not enough in the private sector, \nby the way.\n  So in recent weeks, a number of my colleagues have come to the floor \nto proclaim the success of this massive, now I guess it adds up to a \n$862 billion stimulus bill that Congress enacted in February of 2009. \nSimilar statements were made earlier this very day.\n  Although the number of private sector jobs has increased by only half \na million since 2009, my friends on the other side continue to insist \nthe stimulus bill has created millions of new jobs. So I would like to \nsee how they justify those claims. The stimulus bill requires certain \nrecipients of stimulus funds to report the number of jobs they have \ncreated or saved or, more accurately, they report the number of jobs \nfunded with stimulus dollars. The stimulus bill also requires the \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, to issue a quarterly report on those \nnumbers.\n  CBO is careful to point out that the number of jobs being reported by \nstimulus recipients is not a comprehensive estimate of the economic \nimpact of the stimulus bill. CBO says the actual numbers could be \nhigher or lower. According to CBO:\n\n       Estimating the law's overall effect on employment requires \n     a more comprehensive analysis than the recipients' reports \n     provide.\n\n  For this analysis, CBO relies upon computer models. In other words, \nCBO does not look at the actual jobs data; instead, it looks at a model \nof the economy. CBO is very upfront about this to all of us.\n  CBO used a computer model to predict how many jobs the stimulus bill \nwould create before it was enacted into law. Now that the stimulus bill \nis law, CBO is using a computer model to tell us it did just what they \nsaid the model would do, create jobs. Why would CBO rely upon a model \ninstead of actual data?\n  According to CBO:\n\n       Data on actual output and employment . . . are not as \n     helpful in determining [the stimulus bill's] economic effects \n     . . . because isolating those effects would require knowing \n     what path the economy would have taken in the absence of the \n     law. Because that path cannot be observed, there is no way to \n     be certain about how the economy would have performed if the \n     legislation had not been enacted.\n\n  In other words, CBO does not know how much better or worse the \neconomy would have been if the stimulus bill had not been enacted. That \nmeans CBO does not know how much better or worse the economy is now as \na result of the stimulus bill.\n  So, basically, CBO is saying: Trust us--or more specifically, trust \nour model. But if the model was wrong to begin with, then it is still \nwrong. According to CBO, their model relies on historical relationships \nto determine estimated ``multipliers'' for each category of taxes and \nspending in the stimulus bill. The problem is, there is no way to know \nwhether these historical relationships remain constant over time or \nwhether they change under different economic circumstances. In short, \nthe jobs numbers attributed to the stimulus bill are based on \nassumptions that may or may not have any basis in reality.\n  The bottom line is this: CBO cannot be cited as an authority for the \nproposition that the stimulus bill actually created jobs. All CBO has \ndone is confirm that its model, and I repeat, CBO's model, projected \njobs would be created from the stimulus bill.\n  CBO has not confirmed that the stimulus bill actually created jobs. \nWhat we do know is that in 18 months, since the $862-plus billion \nstimulus bill went into effect, the private sector has added a \nrelatively small number of new jobs, about half a million. This is a \nsmall portion of the number of new jobs asserted by my friends on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I want to make the Record very clear on this very important point.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am here to speak to the bill that is \npending before us. Small businesses are the cornerstone of New \nHampshire's economy, just as they are the cornerstone of the economies \nof so many of our States.\n  Over 96 percent of employers in New Hampshire are small businesses \nwith fewer than 500 employees, 96 percent. The economic recovery of New \nHampshire depends on the ability of those small businesses to invest in \ntheir future, to grow their businesses, and to hire new workers.\n  But right now many of these small businesses are hurting and they \ncontinue to have trouble accessing credit, the credit they need to help \nturn our economy around. While community banks in New Hampshire have \nincreased their lending, I consistently hear from small businesses that \nthey still need additional working capital.\n  Last year my office organized a financing fair to bring together \nlenders and small businesses who need financing. Over 500 people showed \nup. That is a crowd in New Hampshire. Wherever I go in the State, small \nbusiness owners tell me they have run out of financing options. In some \ncases their only choice is to turn to credit cards, their personal \ncredit cards where they pay exorbitant interest rates to get the \nworking capital they need to keep their businesses growing.\n  That is why we need to quickly pass the Small Business Jobs Act. This \nlegislation will help small businesses in New Hampshire and across the \ncountry access the credit they need to create jobs and to weather this \neconomic storm. I am very proud of the work of my committee. As the \nPresident knows, the Small Business Committee does great work. It is \nled by Chairman Landrieu and Ranking Member Snowe.\n  They have worked and we have worked on this committee to fashion \nbipartisan measures to strengthen critical SBA programs for small \nbusinesses. This afternoon I want to talk about two of those provisions \nin particular that I think will provide tangible credit solutions for \nsmall businesses in New Hampshire.\n  Many creditworthy small businesses have mortgages on their property \nthat are coming due in the next year. In normal times these businesses \nwould simply refinance those mortgages at reasonable rates. But with \ncommercial real estate lending so tight, and real estate values \nfalling, the only option for many businesses is to refinancing at very \nhigh rates. This drains them of the cash they need to pay for their \nworkers and buy new inventory.\n  For small businesses that cannot refinance at all, they face \nforeclosure even though they may have never missed a payment on their \nloan. The\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\nSmall Business Jobs Act will change an existing SBA program in a way \nthat makes sense. It will change the 504 program to help small \nbusinesses refinance these mortgages at low rates. This will free up \ncapital for these small businesses to hire workers and to make other \ninvestments to grow their operations, and we can do this in this bill \nat no cost to the taxpayer.\n  In New Hampshire, this will help small businesses of all kinds: \nmanufacturers, hotels and restaurants, doctors offices, and many \nothers. This will help them retain hundreds of jobs that would \notherwise be lost due to a lack of credit availability. In some cases, \nit will stop businesses from having to close their doors altogether.\n  This bill will also increase the maximum loan limit of the Express \nLoan Program. This is another important provision of this bill that \nwill help small businesses in New Hampshire get the working capital \nthey need. The Express Program is popular with small business lenders \nin New Hampshire because it cuts redtape and provides a streamlined \nprocess for approving loans.\n  Unlike traditional 7(a) loans, lenders can use their own paperwork \nfor SBA Express Loans, making it easier for them to quickly get capital \ninto the hands of small businesses. Currently, however, Express Loans \nare capped at $350,000. The Small Business Jobs Act will increase the \nloan limit to $1 million, making additional working capital available \nto small businesses.\n  I thank Senators Landrieu and Snowe for working with me to include \nthis important provision. I am also pleased that the bill includes \nPresident Obama's initiative to provide over $30 billion for two new \nlending funds for small business owners.\n  I am hopeful the small business lending fund and the State small \nbusiness credit initiative will provide community banks with the \ncapital cushion they need to expand lending to small businesses.\n  This bill also lowers taxes on small firms, providing over $12 \nbillion in tax cuts to help free up capital so small companies can \ninvest in their future. These tax cuts are fully paid for, and they \nwill not add to the deficit. The Small Business Jobs Act will help \nprovide the boost that small businesses in New Hampshire and across the \ncountry need so desperately so they can create jobs and help continue \nto grow our economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Honoring Our Armed Forces Sergeant Joseph Caskey\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to talk about the war in \nAfghanistan, and, unfortunately tonight, as I begin my remarks, I have \nto report on yet another death of a soldier killed in action in \nAfghanistan. Yesterday, in Pennsylvania, we lost another marine. This \ntime the marine was from West View, PA, Allegheny County, the county in \nwhich most people know the city of Pittsburgh is. SGT Joseph Caskey, 24 \nyears old, was on his second tour and was killed in action.\n  If the counting is right in terms of the number killed in action from \nPennsylvania, he is likely the fiftieth killed in action from \nPennsylvania. We have about 260 who have been wounded. That number may \nbe higher, but that is the most recent number I have seen. Sergeant \nCaskey gave us, as Abraham Lincoln said so eloquently so many years \nago, the last full measure of devotion to his country. And like so many \nothers--hundreds and hundreds who have died in the conflict in \nAfghanistan, and those who died in Iraq and so many other conflicts--we \nmourn his loss and we commend his service, but I think we also, at the \nsame time, must recommit ourselves to making sure we are putting this \nconflict on the floor of the Senate; that we debate it more; that we \ntalk about it more, so that we get the policy right. I am going to \nspeak a little while tonight about that.\n  In terms of the lethality or the focus we have on those who have lost \ntheir lives, June is the deadliest month on record for coalition \nforces. I wish we didn't have to report on that. I wish those of us who \ncome to the floor periodically to talk about the war and to talk about \nindividuals from our States who have perished--who have either been \nkilled or who are suffering from grievous injuries--could come and talk \nabout some other milestone in the life of that person--a soldier such \nas 24-year-old Sergeant Caskey. I wish I could come and report about \nsome other milestone in his life instead of the news about his death.\n  But we have to talk more about this war. We have to make sure we are \ndebating it more. One of the things that we know has just transpired is \na change in command. Today, the Senate Armed Services Committee--and \nthe Presiding Officer is a member of that committee--voted in favor, \nthank goodness, of General Petraeus's nomination to be the Commander of \nthe ISAF forces in Afghanistan. I think to say this is bipartisan is an \nunderstatement. We know that President Obama has chosen a man worthy of \nthis job, and we are fortunate that he has once again accepted the call \nto action and accepted this new responsibility.\n  I spoke today by telephone with General Petraeus and covered a number \nof issues dealing with a whole range of foreign policy and security \nissues, including some of those pertinent to the conflict in \nAfghanistan. I have full confidence, as I know so many others in this \nChamber and across the country do, in his leadership. I have full \nconfidence that he will be able to implement a strategy that \ncontributes to the overall security of Afghanistan and also a strategy \nthat will train the Afghan security forces and create the kind of \npolitical space the Afghan Government needs to provide security and \nservices to its people.\n  This new command by General Petraeus, upon confirmation--it has not \nbeen voted on in the Senate, but I will be voting for him, and I know \nhe will receive a great vote--will bring a new opportunity to assess \nwhere we are in the fight, and it is good that we do that. The news, \nunfortunately, is not all that encouraging lately. We continue to face \na host of challenges in Afghanistan.\n  A Washington Post newspaper report this week cited allegations of \nblatant and rampant corruption within the senior ranks of the Afghan \nGovernment. The report detailed examples where government officials \nblocked corruption investigations and ordered investigators to remove \nnames from case files. That is just one problem. Secondly, there were \nallegations of individuals preventing the arrest of senior officials \nand not acknowledging evidence against businessmen accused of helping \nAfghan elites to move millions of dollars out of the country.\n  This was a published report. These are allegations, and we hope they \nare not true, but if they are, we have much deeper problems than we \nthought maybe even a couple of days ago. These\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\nare serious allegations that require a serious and thorough \ninvestigation and scrutiny. Those who are accused of these crimes \nshould be prosecuted upon the review of the evidence.\n  As I have said in the past about this conflict, our success will be \ndetermined by a belief among Afghans that justice can be delivered by \nits government. The people of Afghanistan have a right to expect honest \ngovernment officials working on behalf of the public good, working on \nbehalf of the people, not to enrich themselves, not to provide \nadvantages for the elite in Afghanistan, not just to provide advantages \nfor the wealthy but to make sure that the people are the beneficiaries \nof a clean, honest government and the kind of effective services that \nthe people should have a right to expect.\n  The people also have a right to expect a police force capable of \nprotecting the population against criminals. They do have that right. \nThey also have a right to a fair and efficient system of justice in \nAfghanistan, capable of delivering verdicts based upon the rule of law \nand not according to the barbaric code embraced by the Taliban. \nUnfortunately, today, we don't yet see a government in Afghanistan that \nis fully capable of providing this kind of justice. So we have to \nmonitor what is happening there. We have to make sure we see results \nand not just rhetoric. We have to see the reality of progress on \nsecurity, on justice, on the delivery of services--not just the \naspiration but the delivery of results.\n  As we consider the nomination of General Petraeus--and as I mentioned \nbefore, a nomination I fully support--I hope this nomination will be \none of the reasons we will have a more substantial discussion or debate \nabout the policy here in the Senate. That is where that debate should \ntake place, as it takes place in the House and outside of the Capitol \nand across America. We should have in the Senate a debate or a \nreengagement of the debate about this policy. We owe it to our fighting \nmen and women to do nothing less than that, to be committed to \nexamining every aspect of the conflict in the weeks and months ahead. \nWe must continue to ask and get answers to the tough questions on \nsecurity, on governance, and on the delivery of services, to mention \nthree broad areas of review, analysis, and, of course, inquiry.\n  As allegations of Afghan Government corruption emerge, oversight is \nessential when we hear these allegations. If the Afghan national police \nand army are not hitting their recruitment and training targets, for \nexample, we need to know why. The American people and the Afghan people \nhave a right to expect that we and the Afghanistan leadership, starting \nwith President Karzai, get answers to those tough questions about the \nsecurity, and especially about the army and the police.\n  I spoke yesterday of my commitment, and the commitment of so many \nothers in this Chamber, to helping stem the flow of ammonium nitrate \ninto Afghanistan from its neighbors, particularly Pakistan and the \ncountries of central Asia. This deadly ingredient is used in most of \nthe IEDs found in Afghanistan--bombs which have grown more powerful in \nrecent months. We are now getting reports of the destructive power of \nIEDs not only to kill and to maim our troops who happen to walk near \none of these explosive devices but to literally lift up an MRAP--this \ngreat vehicle we have been able to produce that lessens the chances \nthat an explosion under the vehicle will kill someone. The explosions \nare now so great that they have been lifting up the MRAP and flipping \nit on its head and killing or gravely injuring troops not because the \nbottom technology and the engineering wonder that has saved so many \nlives is giving out, but because the vehicle itself is being lifted up \nand then smashed down in a way we couldn't even imagine maybe even a \nyear ago or months ago.\n  As I mention the impact of ammonium nitrate as the destructive \ningredient in the IEDs, it so happens that Sergeant Caskey, the marine \nI spoke of earlier from Pennsylvania, who we believe is the fiftieth \nsoldier killed in action in Afghanistan, was killed by an IED, as so \nmany others--hundreds and hundreds--have been killed in that manner.\n  This concern about ammonium nitrate is just one of a series of \nregional concerns that we have with respect to the conflict in \nAfghanistan. Pakistan has recognized the severity of the threat posed \nby the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban. The Pakistani forces have suffered \nheavy losses within their own borders, and I respect the commitment \nthey have shown as the struggle continues. While the battle has been \ntough and difficult, we will need more help from the Pakistani people \nand their security forces in the weeks and months and years ahead.\n  We have no better military leader to take on this challenge at this \ntime than General Petraeus. As we confront this enormous challenge, our \ncountry has called upon him again and he has answered affirmatively to \nthat call. I believe General Petraeus has the experience, the \nknowledge, the insight, and of course the respect of not only leaders \nin the military but also leaders in the region and, of course, he has \nthe respect and support of the American people. So we should be happy \nand affirmative about that part of the story even as we confront \nallegations of corruption, even as we confront more and more troops \nwounded and killed in action, even as we confront the challenge of this \npolicy.\n  The minimum we must do in the Senate is to make sure that the \noversight we provide, the debates we engage in, and all of the work \nthat we do in the Senate that relates to this policy, at a minimum \nattempts to justify and to be equal to the commitment of our troops. \nTheir job is so much more difficult than our job. We don't have to put \nour lives on the line. We debate and we learn and we try to move the \npolicy forward, but the least we should do is to have a debate that \nmatches or at least attempts to be equivalent to the sacrifice that \nthey display every day.\n  When we think of our troops, we mourn, of course, those who have been \nkilled in action, and we also remember and salute and celebrate the \ncontributions of those who have served and who come home with an \ninjury, sometimes grievously wounded.\n  Of course, we remember and salute those who serve and, fortunately, \nwith the blessing of God, are not killed or not wounded and they can \ncome home and be reunited with their families, with their communities.\n  We remember all those, as Abraham Lincoln said a long time ago: ``Him \nwho has borne the battle.'' Of course in 2010 we are talking about him \nand her, those who have borne this battle.\n  We have a long way to go as it relates to this policy but, as we are \nthinking tonight of the hope we have in General Petraeus's leadership, \nthe confidence we have in his ability and his commitment--he is a \npatriot like few others--even as we are hopeful about that we remember \nthose who lost their lives, such as Sergeant Caskey, of West View, PA, \nand so many others who have served, and their families, who have loved \nand lost.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am here today to pay respects to Senator \nByrd, whose desk is now adorned with a black cloth and flowers. I know \nwe will all long remember Monday as the day we received some very sad \nnews, for on that day, as the morning began, we each learned in our own \nway that our good friend and colleague Robert Byrd had passed away just \na few hours earlier. It should not have been a sudden shock. We all had \ntime to prepare for this moment. We knew he had been having a period of \nill health, but it still seemed as if he would be here forever. That is \nthe kind of man Robert Byrd was.\n  A man of great gifts, he loved the written word and could recite his \nfavorite poems from memory--at length. It was amazing how many \nspeeches, reflections, and famous quotations were there at his command, \nin his quiver, ever ready and waiting for him to recite so he could \nemphasize an important point about an issue that needed to be made. \nThat is the kind of man Robert Byrd was.\n  While it is true he was the longest serving Member of Congress in \nhistory, he was so much more than that. He was the historian of the \nSenate who knew more about our roots as a legislative body than anyone \nelse. He was a master legislative craftsman, and whenever he spoke, we \nall listened carefully to see what he had to say about the matter we \nhad taken up for deliberation. That is the kind of man Robert Byrd was.\n  No one had more respect and regard for the Senate and our legislative \ntraditions and procedures than he did. He knew the rules, he knew why \nthey were crafted that way, and he knew how to make good use of them to \nfurther the agenda he believed to be in the best interests of the \npeople of our Nation. Once again, that is the kind of man Robert Byrd \nwas. That is why it is so difficult to sum up his life in just a few \nwell-chosen words.\n  There is no greater tribute we can pay to Robert Byrd than for the \nspirit of friendship and camaraderie, which were staples of his Senate \nservice, to bring us all to the Senate floor to express our regrets and \nsend our condolences to his family. It will also give us a chance to \nshare our memories of someone we will never forget.\n  I will always remember the orientation he organized for the incoming \nclass of new Senators each session for as long as he was able. Besides \na strong historical welcome, he presented each of us with one volume of \nhis four-volume history of the Senate. If we read it and were able to \nanswer questions about it, then--and only then--would\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\nwe get the other three volumes. I remember asking him how he wrote \nthem. He said he presented all of it as a series of floor speeches \ndelivered without any notes, with most corrections made simply to clear \nup what the floor reporters thought they heard. He had a photographic \nmemory, and that made it all possible. Perhaps it came from his years \nof study of the violin. In any event, it made him a better speaker \nbecause he spoke slowly and deliberately, carefully editing his \nsentences as he spoke. His style created a natural bond between himself \nand the listener, and that is what made him such a styled and gifted \ncommunicator.\n  It may be a cliche, but he was a southern gentleman through and \nthrough. He had no tolerance for any rude or impolite conduct on the \nfloor. He instructed and expected all of us to be courteous and \nrespectful--not because of politics but because of the great \ninstitution of which we are a part. He knew what a great honor and a \nprivilege it is to serve in the Senate, and he expected everyone else \nto realize it as well and to act accordingly.\n  When you presided over the Senate, he expected you to pay attention \nto each speaker. Sometimes, the Presiding Officer is the only one in \nthe Chamber. There was a time when there was a telephone under the \nPresiding Officer's desk. As the story goes, Senator Byrd was speaking \nwhen the phone under the desk rang. When the Presiding Officer answered \nit, Senator Byrd made sure to make him aware of the importance of \ncourtesy in such a situation. The Presiding Officer then said: \n``Senator Byrd, the phone is for you.'' That is when the phone was \ntaken out and a rule went into effect that no electronic devices were \nto be used on the Senate floor.\n  Then there were his special speeches. He always commemorated each \nholiday the evening before a recess would begin. Each speech was very \npoetic and, in fact, usually had some poem he had memorized years \nbefore that would come to mind and be recited from memory. He was good \nat it, so good that we looked forward to his poetic observations on the \npassing of time.\n  That unique speaking style of his also helped him to build a good \nrelationship with our pages. His ``going away'' speech for each \ngraduating class often left many of them in tears. Their fondness for \nhim only grew when they learned that if the Senate was in session after \n10 p.m., they had no early morning classes the next day. They were \nalways delighted, therefore, when the hour grew late and Senator Byrd \nrose to speak. They knew he could easily add the 10 or 15 or even 30 \nminutes needed to get them past 10 o'clock and a welcome reprieve from \nthe early morning classes.\n  My favorite speech Senator Byrd gave happened when I was presiding. \nOver the previous weekend, he had visited some of his grandkids and \nasked about their studies. He was a firm believer in education and was \nan example of lifelong learning himself. One of his grandkids had \nshared a math experience with him. He was so surprised, he asked to see \nthe math book. He brought the book to the floor to read parts of it to \nus. He was distressed at how math had migrated into a social textbook. \nHe pointed out that you had to get to page 187 to find anything that \nresembled the math he had learned. The parts prior to that were social \ndiscourse. Anyone who heard the speech would remember his indignation.\n  I remember being at an interparliamentary trip held in West Virginia \nhosting the British Parliament. We went to a mountain retreat for \ndinner. Senator Byrd welcomed them and then got out his violin and \nshared some fiddle music he thought was appropriate for the occasion. \nHe was very good.\n  Senator Byrd was an expert on the rules of the Senate. At our \norientation, he encouraged us to learn the rules. Because of his \nencouragement and as a way to learn the rules, I volunteered often to \nchair the Senate floor. Following his instructions, I brought a list of \nquestions with me since during the quorum calls you can ask questions \nof the captive-audience Parliamentarian.\n  I once saw a Senator come to the floor to debate an amendment, and \nSenator Byrd was there to debate against it. The Senator wanted to \nrevise his amendment. For half an hour, the Senator tried different \ntactics to change his amendment, and Senator Byrd thwarted every \nattempt. The Senator was frustrated. He asked for a quorum call, and he \nleft the floor.\n  At that point, I asked the Parliamentarian if there was any way the \nSenator could have changed his amendment. The Parliamentarian explained \nthat all he had to do was declare his right to revise his amendment. I \nasked why the Parliamentarian did not tell him that. What I learned is \nthe Parliamentarian can only give advice when asked. My first stop at \nthe Senate floor often is at the Parliamentarian as a result.\n  During much of Senator Byrd's career, he was either the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee or the ranking member. He was very good \nabout taking care of orphan miners. Those are primarily coal miners \nwhose companies have gone out of business owing benefits. After a \ncouple of lessons from the Senator, I worked with him to take care of \nthe orphan miner health problem in a bill that speeded up mine \nreclamation in many States, extended an expiring tax on coal companies \nwith their guarded permission, and then released impounded trust fund \nmoney promised by law to the States for the impacts the States put up \nto produce the Nation's energy, as well as take care of the orphan \nminers.\n  At another time, Senator Isakson and I worked with Senators Byrd, \nRockefeller, and Kennedy to make the first changes in mine safety law \nin 28 years. He was very proud of the difference he was able to make in \nthe lives of coal miners back home, and he never forgot them whenever \nwe were debating an issue that might have an impact on their lives.\n  In the days and weeks to come, I can think of no greater compliment \nwe could pay another Senator or greater tribute we can pay to Senator \nByrd than to watch someone in action on the Senate floor who develops \nand implements a well-drawn strategy and say: That is the way Robert \nByrd would have done it.\n  For my part, I will always remember the great love Senator Byrd had \nfor our Constitution. I do not think anyone knew it better or more \ndetailed than he did. When I was mayor of Gillette, I began a habit of \ncarrying around a copy of the Constitution with me. I discovered that a \nlot of us knew what it said but not too many of us had a grasp for the \ndetails. It had a lot of meaning for me right from the start because it \nrepresents the blueprint from which our Nation and system of government \nwere constructed. Then when I came to the Senate, I came to know the \nConstitution in a completely different way. It was now my job \ndescription, as Senator Byrd put it. So I always kept it handy.\n  I have no doubt that Senator Byrd had a similar reaction years before \nmy own. I am sure he knew the better he understood our Constitution and \nthe procedures of the Senate, the more effective he would be as a \nSenator. He knew the importance of understanding the rules of our \nlegislative process in every detail. The better he became at mastering \nthe process by which our laws were made, the better he knew he would be \nat producing the outcome he was committed to achieving for the people \nof West Virginia and the Nation. I am sure that is why he always \ncarried a copy with him.\n  The line-item veto was passed before I got to the Senate, but Senator \nByrd had sued to have it stricken. Most of his Senate career had been \nas chairman of the Appropriations Committee or the ranking member. He \npointed out that Congress, according to the Constitution, is supposed \nto make spending decisions, not the President. He always pointed out \nthat we do not work for the President of the United States; we work \nwith the President as a separate but equal branch of government. He \nwould guard us against infringement by the President using the third \nbranch of government, and he was successful.\n  Although his life was marked by many triumphs, he was not without his \npersonal tragedies. I have always believed that the work we do begins \nat home, and that is why I will never forget the strength of his \nmarriage and what a tremendous loss it was for him when his wife passed \naway. No one knew Robert Byrd better than she did, and without her by \nhis side life became ever more difficult. His health began to fail.\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\n  I remember going to his wife's funeral. It was very well done. When \nmy wife and I were on our way home, we commented that the endearing and \nastounding thing about the funeral was that it was about her. He made \nsure her achievements, her family, her efforts and successes were the \nfocus. As famous as Senator Byrd was, the comments that were made that \nday were about her and not about him. That says a lot about the \nrelationship they had.\n  Although his health was declining, he was here as often as he was \nable, an active part of the day-to-day workings of the Senate. He would \nnot and could not take it easy, no matter what anyone told him. His \nheart was in the Senate; his soul was in West Virginia. To stop what he \nloved to do was for him and the people back home unthinkable.\n  One of Senator Byrd's favorite quotations comes to mind today. He \nloved the Bible and quoted from it often. When going through a \ndifficult time in his life, he remembered the words from the Book of \nEcclesiastes:\n\n       To everything there is a season and a time for every \n     purpose under heaven.\n\n  Now Senator Byrd has come to another time, as he has reached the end \nof his seasons on God's green Earth. He will be greatly missed, and he \nwill never be forgotten.\n  I cannot conclude my remarks without paying a final tribute to \nSenator Byrd by recalling his love of poetry and the written word. We \ncan all remember the way he would enjoy sharing a favorite verse with \nus, much like this one. Although the author is unknown, I am certain \nSenator Byrd would not only recall it but know it well:\n\n     Life is but a stopping place,\n     A pause in what's to be,\n     A resting place along the road,\n     To sweet eternity.\n\n     We all have different journeys,\n     Different paths along the way,\n     We all were meant to learn some things,\n     But never meant to stay.\n\n     Our destination is a place,\n     Far greater than we know.\n     For some the journey's quicker,\n     For some the journey's slow.\n\n     And when the journey finally ends,\n     We'll claim a great reward,\n     And find an everlasting peace,\n     Together with the Lord.\n\n  My wife Diana joins in sending our heartfelt sympathy to his family \nand many friends and for all the people who worked for him and with him \nover the years. We will miss him--the knowledge he had, the \ninstitutional memory he had, the experiences and history he had been a \npart of and in many instances was the main participant--the leader. \nProbably only once in the history of a country does someone like this \ncome along. If he were here, he would deny it but be pleased if we \nnoted the similarity of what he had done to what had been done in the \nancient Roman Senate about which he often talked.\n  In the end for Senator Byrd it was never about how much time he spent \nin the Senate or on Earth but how well he used the time he was given.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the loss of our \nsenior colleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd. Senator Byrd, I had the \nprivilege and honor of serving with for over 24 years in the Senate. I \nbelieve this body has lost a giant.\n  For more than five decades, Robert C. Byrd served his country, fought \nto protect the institution of the Senate, and worked tirelessly for the \npeople of West Virginia. The people of West Virginia were never very \nfar from the mind of Robert C. Byrd. I know because I worked with him \nevery day for 24 years. Senator Byrd and his passing leave a tremendous \nvoid for this body and for the Nation. He will be greatly missed.\n  Senator Byrd was a great man, an exceptional person, somebody who had \nlost his parents and, through sheer will, made himself into a great \nman. He was a legend in the Senate, the longest serving Senator in the \nhistory of the United States and the longest serving lawmaker in \ncongressional history. The people of West Virginia elected him to the \nSenate an amazing nine times and three times before that to the House \nof Representatives. He served in almost every leadership post in the \nSenate, including twice as majority leader and for almost two decades \nas chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He took an incredible \n18,500 votes, a record which will never be broken. At least that is my \nforecast. I do not know how anybody will ever break a record of 18,500 \nvotes.\n\n  Senator Byrd may be remembered most as the protector of the \ninstitution of the Senate. This is an institution he loved. More than \nthat, this is an institution he revered as part of the constitutional \nstructure of this country. He believed it had a special place in \ndefending the Constitution of the United States. He believed it played \na special role in preventing unwise legislation from becoming law, and \nhe believed it deeply.\n  He knew more about Senate history and Senate rules and procedures \nthan any other Member, and he used that knowledge skillfully to defend \nthis institution and to ensure it continued to function in a manner \nconsistent with what the Founding Fathers intended. Senator Byrd did \nnot come to those beliefs lightly. He came to those beliefs after the \nmost thorough and very rigorous study of our history. He was a master \norator. How many of us can remember Senator Byrd coming to this floor \nand having Members come to the floor to listen to him because very \noften his speeches were a history lesson--and not just drawn from \nAmerican history but from world history, going back to the Roman \nEmpire? When he was in really high excitation, he loved to go through \nthe various Roman emperors and what brought them down, what led to the \ndecline of the Roman Empire, and what lessons we could draw from that.\n  His speeches were riddled with quotes from great leaders, references \nto American history and law, and descriptions of that ancient Roman \nSenate--much of it from memory. How many times did I hear Senator Byrd \nstand in that spot or in the leader's spot and recite from memory a \nlengthy poem or a speech from history? What a remarkable, remarkable \nman. The extent and the breadth of his knowledge was truly amazing.\n  Senator Byrd was also an expert on budget matters. In fact, he was \none of the principal authors of the 1974 Budget Act which established \nthe congressional budget process. He created and vigorously defended \nthe Byrd rule, which bears his name--a budget rule designed to stop the \nabuse of the fast-track reconciliation process.\n  Let me just remind my colleagues of something Senator Byrd did during \nthe Clinton administration when the administration had a health care \nproposal that was bogged down. It could not pass because it would \nrequire 60 votes in the Senate, and there were not 60 votes to be had. \nThe administration wanted to use the reconciliation process, the fast-\ntrack process that allows legislation to be passed with only a simple \nmajority. Senator Byrd said no, under no circumstances would he permit \nthat to happen because he believed that was a violation of the whole \nbasis of the reconciliation process which he had been involved in and \nwhich he had helped design and which was put in law solely for deficit \nreduction, in his view. He believed any other use was an abuse of the \nprocess--the process of reconciliation. So he said no to the President \nof his own party on that President's No. 1 domestic priority.\n  There is a lesson in that for all of us. When we were in the midst of \nthe consideration of using the reconciliation process for that purpose \nduring the Clinton administration years, Senator Byrd told me, as a \nmember of the Budget Committee: Senator, always remember partisanship \ncan go too far. Our obligation, our first obligation, is to the Nation \nand to this institution. If that means we have to disagree with the \nPresident of our own party, so be it.\n  I hope colleagues learn from that lesson as well. Partisanship can go \ntoo far.\n  As the Budget Committee chairman, I had the privilege and honor of \nworking particularly close with Senator Byrd after he joined the \ncommittee in 2001. The original idea of the Budget Committee was that \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee would serve there, the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee would serve there, and the chairmen of \nother relevant major committees would serve there so that the Budget \nCommittee would put together the priorities of the United States. \nSenator Byrd had an acute understanding of that history.\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\n  But also Senator Byrd never forgot who sent him to Washington. He \ntenaciously fought for West Virginia throughout his career and ensured \nhis small, rural State had a powerful voice in the Halls of the \nCapitol. He never forgot where he came from. I remember well his \nexchange at a Budget Committee hearing in 2002 with then-Treasury \nSecretary Paul O'Neill, and Senator Byrd proudly and emotionally \ndescribed his own humble upbringing because Senator Byrd came from very \nstraightened circumstances. He came from a very modest background. He \nwas an orphan. In fact, he carried a name which was not his birth name. \nHis birth name was a different name than Robert C. Byrd. But when \nrelatives took him in, they gave him their family name.\n  Robert C. Byrd remembered those earliest days. He remembered what it \nwas to struggle. He remembered what it was to have very little. He \nremembered what it was to wonder where your next meal was coming from \nand whether you were going to have a roof over your head. Senator Byrd \nremembered, and he was faithful to those memories.\n  Senator Byrd loved his wife Erma. He loved his daughters Mona and \nMarjorie and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n  I want to say to the members of the family, Senator Byrd was \nintensely proud of you. I hope the children and grandchildren will get \nthat message, that Senator Byrd was intensely proud of each and every \none of you. He spoke about you often and in loving terms, and you \nshould know that.\n  Of course, we all know he loved his little dog Billy, and he loved \nhis dog Trouble. In fact, I think he had multiple dogs named Trouble.\n  Senator Byrd loved West Virginia, he loved this institution, and he \nloved our country. I am deeply saddened by the passing of Senator Byrd. \nHis immense knowledge and his spirit will be missed. His values will be \nmissed. But I am comforted in knowing that our friend Robert is now \nreunited with his beloved wife Erma. I know his legacy will live on in \nthis body and this Nation forever.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during a recordbreaking six decades of public \nservice, Senator Byrd served this Nation with diligence and spirit. As \na legislator, Senator Byrd had many notable qualities, particularly his \nlegendary oratory skills and his masterful knowledge of Senate \nprocedure. Having authored a four-volume history of this Chamber, he \nunderstood its nuances and intricacies, and he was an articulate \nspokesman for protecting procedural rules.\n  Senator Byrd kept a copy of the Constitution in his pocket, and he \ncould recite it from memory. He was always first to remind us that the \nFramers intended the Senate to be different from the House of \nRepresentatives and to stand as a bastion of individual and minority \nrights. He celebrated these distinctions serving as they do the \nfundamental principle of checks and balances within the legislative \nbranch.\n  At a recent Rules Committee hearing, Senator Byrd said:\n\n       The Senate is the only place in government where the rights \n     of a numerical minority are so protected. The Senate is a \n     forum of the States, where regardless of size or population, \n     all States have an equal voice. . . . Without the protection \n     of unlimited debate, small States like West Virginia might be \n     trampled. Extended deliberation and debate--when employed \n     judiciously--protect every Senator, and the interests of \n     their constituency, and are essential to the protection of \n     the liberties of a free people.\n\n  Senator Byrd's insights, expertise, and constitutional scholarship \nwill truly be missed. They are a great part of his legacy, one that I \nhope will be honored for generations.\n  On a personal note, I will mention that while Senator Byrd and I did \nnot share a perspective on many matters of public policy, we had a \ncommon appreciation for bluegrass music. I always enjoyed talking with \nhim about that subject. He was a talented fiddler, playing on stage, on \ntelevision, and while campaigning for office. He even recorded an album \nentitled ``Mountain Fiddler.'' He gave me a copy, and I was very \nimpressed with his skill.\n  Robert Byrd's knowledge, his hard work, his high spirit, and \ndedication to the people of West Virginia will always be remembered. My \nwife Caryll and I extend our thoughts and prayers to his family.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I, too, wish to say some words on the \npassing of our good friend and former leader, Robert C. Byrd.\n  It is difficult to sum up in words the thoughts and feelings one has \nfor a departed friend whom one has known so long. I had the pleasure of \nserving with Senator Byrd my entire career in the Senate. I knew, I \nliked, and I respected Robert C. Byrd for more than 30 years.\n  It is doubly difficult to put into words thoughts that adequately \nreflect such a presence in the Senate. Robert C. Byrd was a singular \nSenator. He was a Senator's Senator. There was no title he prized more \nthan that of ``Senator.''\n  When I came to the Senate, Robert C. Byrd had succeeded my mentor, \nMike Mansfield, as majority leader. As Robert Byrd was fond of noting, \nhe served as majority leader and then minority leader and then back as \nmajority leader. He saw the leadership of the Senate from both sides, \nand his experience seasoned his leadership.\n  As proud as he was to earn the title of ``Senator,'' he was even more \nproud that as a Senator he represented the people of his State. I \ndeeply believe that is one of the finest things one can say about a \nfellow Senator. For more than 50 years, he was a strong voice for the \npeople of West Virginia.\n  Robert Byrd was a strong voice for democracy. He knew the rules of \nthe Senate better than any person alive. He fought to preserve the \ntraditions and customs of what he truly believed is the world's \ngreatest deliberative body.\n  As my colleagues know, Robert Byrd cast more votes than any other \nSenator in the history of our Republic. I can recall when he cast his \n18,000th vote. That vote just happened to have been on a motion to \ninvoke cloture on an amendment offered by this Senator. The Senate did \nnot invoke cloture that day. That is the way the Senate's rules often \nwork. No matter the outcome, Senator Byrd was foremost in the defense \nof those rules. And Senator Byrd was foremost in the defense of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Senator Byrd was a student of history more than any other Senator. \nThose of us who were here will not soon forget Senator Byrd's series of \naddresses to the Senate on the history of the Senate. And those of us \nwho were here will not soon forget his series of addresses on the \nSenate of the Roman Republic. He knew that Senate too.\n  Senator Byrd was a teacher. I can recall meeting with Senator Byrd on \na highway bill. He and I both long believed passionately in the \nimportance of our Nation's highways. At this one occasion, I recall \nbeing impatient about enacting the highway bill on which we were \nworking. I can also recall the sage advice Senator Byrd gave me about \nthe process, about the procedures, and about the personalities of how \nto get that bill through the Senate. As I look back on that meeting, I \nthink of all the occasions Senator Byrd took the time to teach others \nof us about the Senate. He taught his fellow Senators. He taught \nvisiting dignitaries from other countries.\n  I might add parenthetically that it was not too many years ago when \nhe was visiting Great Britain with some Senators and meeting with some \nParliamentarians in Great Britain, and the subject of British monarchs \ncame up, and it was only Senator Byrd who knew them all. He stood up, \nand he gave the name of every British monarch and the dates they \nserved, up to the present. No other person in the room, including the \nmembers of the British Parliament, could do so. Robert C. Byrd did.\n  He taught class after class of Senate pages.\n  Robert Byrd will leave a legacy in the laws of the United States. He \nwill leave a legacy in the rules and precedents of the Senate, and he \nwill leave a living legacy in all the people who learned about the \nSenate at the knee of this great master.\n  Robert Byrd was an orator. One might say he was the last of a breed. \nHe spoke in a style that recalled his roots before microphones and \namplification. He spoke memorably. He spoke like orators used to speak.\n  Many of us recall celebrated speeches of Robert C. Byrd. I will read \nan extended quotation from one speech that\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\nsums up Robert Byrd's strong feelings for the Constitution and the \nSenate he loved so well.\n  On October 13, 1989, many of us gathered to hear Robert C. Byrd \nspeak. This is what Robert C. Byrd said:\n\n       Mr. President, I close by saying, as I began, that human \n     ingenuity can always find a way to circumvent a process. . . \n     . But I have regained my faith. We are told in the \n     Scriptures: ``Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy \n     fathers have set.''\n       The Constitution is the old landmark which they have set. \n     And if we do not rise to the call of the moment and take a \n     stand, take a strong stand against our own personal interests \n     or against party interests, and stand for the Constitution, \n     then how might we face our children and grandchildren when \n     they ask of us as Caesar did to the centurion, ``How do we \n     fare today?'' And the centurion replied, ``You will be \n     victorious. As for myself, whether I live or die, tonight I \n     shall have earned the praise of Caesar.''\n\n  And Robert C. Byrd concluded:\n\n       As [Aaron] Burr bade goodbye to the Senate over which he \n     has presided for 4 years, this is what he said. And I close \n     with his words because I think they may well have been \n     written for a moment like this. He said: ``This House is a \n     sanctuary; a citadel of law, of order, and of liberty, and it \n     is here--it is here--in this exalted refuge--here, if \n     anywhere, will resistance be made to the storms of political \n     phrensy and the silent arts of corruption; and if the \n     Constitution be destined ever to perish by the sacrilegious \n     hands of the demagogue or the usurper, which God averts, its \n     expiring agonies will be witnessed on this floor.''\n\n  So today, Mr. President, I will close my words for my friend, Robert \nC. Byrd, noting that in life he was victorious. As for myself, whether \nI succeed or not, whether I live or die, today I can count no greater \npraise than to say I served with Robert C. Byrd.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the remarks that were given by \nmy colleague from Montana about Senator Byrd were certainly \nappropriate, and I know anytime we lose one of our Members who has been \nsitting with us for so long, there is a void to fill.\n  What I appreciated about Senator Byrd is how much he respected the \nSenate itself and protected the rights of the Senate against anyone who \nhe believed overstepped the rights of the Senate and the decorum and \nprotocol of the Senate. He was truly a defender of this body. He loved \nit, and I think we all respected him for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5529-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5529-S5532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about our departed \ncolleague.\n  This week the Senate lost its longest serving Member not only of the \nSenate but of the Congress. More than that, the Nation lost a true \nservant of the people.\n  From humble beginnings, Senator Byrd was, first and foremost, a \nchampion for the people of West Virginia. Throughout his many years of \nservice, there has been no greater student, teacher, and protector of \nthe Senate institution. Senator Byrd was not only a guardian of the \nSenate institution, he was a guardian of the rights our Nation holds \ndear, which is why his most constant companion was the Constitution of \nthe United States in his pocket.\n  I had the opportunity, when I first arrived in the Senate in 1990, to \nwork on the acid rain trading provisions in the Clean Air Act. It was \nknown as the Byrd-Bond amendment. We called it the Bond-Byrd amendment \nback in Missouri. The acid rain trading system has worked because there \nwas technology available. The cost enabled the equitable sharing of the \nmajor utilities which had to install expensive equipment that provided \nmore benefit than they needed so they could sell off the other parts of \ntheir credits to smaller companies that could not afford to install \nexpensive equipment. That was just a small success for Senator Byrd.\n  He was a true champion. He will be missed on the Senate floor. My \nthoughts and prayers are with Senator Byrd's family, his staff, and the \npeople of West Virginia.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I stand today with my colleagues with a \nvery heavy heart to express my condolences to the Byrd family and to \nthe people of West Virginia for losing a great American patriot. It is \na very sad day for America, for West Virginia, and for the Senate.\n  For all of us who knew Senator Byrd, we knew he had five great loves: \nthis country, the Constitution, the Senate, the people of West \nVirginia, and his beloved wife Erma.\n  Senator Byrd was my mentor and my teacher. When I arrived in the \nSenate, I was the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her \nown right. He took me under his wing and taught me the rules of the \nSenate.\n  He said to me:\n\n       Senator Mikulski, he or she who knows the rules will rule. \n     And you will know how to do it.\n\n  His advice to me--when I asked him how to be successful in the \nSenate--was this:\n\n       Senator Mikulski, stay loyal to the Constitution and stay \n     loyal to your constituents and you will do okay.\n\n  From the very first day, he wanted me to succeed. He was so \nwelcoming. He made sure I became a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and he helped me learn how to use my position to meet the \nday-to-day needs of my constituents and the long-term needs of our \nNation.\n  Senator Byrd's career was remarkable. We all know the facts: the \nlongest serving Member of Congress in history, the majority leader in \nthe Senate, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, President pro \ntempore of the Senate, elected nine times to the Senate. Yet he never, \never forgot where he came from. He represented the people of West \nVirginia.\n  Born in poverty in the coalfields of West Virginia, raised by an aunt \nand uncle, he was born with four great gifts: a deep faith, a love of \nlearning, a strong work ethic, and always saluted the fact that he was \nborn in the United States of America, where someone who was, by all \nintents and purposes, an orphan could become a U.S. Senator. He worked \nas a gas station attendant, as a meat butcher, and a welder--I might \nadd, a welder in the Baltimore shipyards. He went to night school for \ncollege and law school while he was in the Senate.\n  Senator Byrd wrote and passed many laws, but most important to him \nwas that he was an appropriator. He used his position to help the \npeople of West Virginia, and he did not apologize for that. He brought \njobs, roads, and opportunity to one of the poorest States in the \nNation. He did not call it pork; he called it opportunity. And this \nSenator would certainly agree with him.\n  But Senator Byrd also voted his conscience and encouraged other \nMembers to do the same. In his 18,000 votes, he was most proud of his \nvote against the Iraq war. He was one of 23 Senators, and I joined him \nin that vote. At that time, it was deeply unpopular. Those of us who \nvoted against the war were vilified. But we did the right thing, though \nit was not easy.\n  If you love the Senate, you love Bob Byrd. He often reminded us that \nthe legislative branch is a coequal part of the government. He fought \nhard against those who wanted to give up Senate prerogatives, such as \nthe line-item veto. No one understood Senate procedure better and no \none protected Senate traditions more than Senator Bob Byrd.\n  He wanted to pass it on. With the new Senators, he gave each one of \nus a lecture on the Constitution and gave us a copy of the \nConstitution. He wanted us to know it and to love it in the way he did. \nHe also taught us the decorum of the Senate--yes, the decorum of the \nSenate--and how, through our processes and procedures, it was meant to \npromote civility among us.\n  To me, as I said, he was a wonderful teacher. I remember going to him \nwhen I was ready to offer my first amendment on the floor, and I asked \nfor his advice on how I could present it and how I could not, quite \nfrankly, be rolled. He gave me good, concrete advice. On the day I \noffered my first amendment, there was Senator Byrd in the background. \nHe was always there. As I said, Senator Byrd always had my back. I was \nso grateful for having his advice and having his encouragement.\n  He lived an extraordinary life and left an extraordinary legacy. He \nstood for citizenship, not partisanship. And maybe that is what we \nshould all do. Follow the Constitution. Stay loyal to our Constitution. \nStay loyal to our Constitution and our constituents. Use the rules of \nthe Senate to promote civility and good government. And also make sure \nthat at the end of the day,\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\nwe respect the opportunity and greatness of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I mourn the passing of Senator Byrd, but his legacy will live on in \nthe rules and the traditions and the many bills he sponsored.\n  The people of West Virginia have had great Senators. Senator \nRockefeller is a great Senator. And Senator Byrd will always be \nremembered, that he built a ``bridge to somewhere'' for all of the \npeople of West Virginia.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I see the roses on the desk of our \ncolleague from West Virginia, as I did in the Armed Services Committee \nmeeting I left a few minutes ago and will return to shortly. It makes \nme think that what we do here on a day-to-day basis seems very small \ncompared to the legacy Senator Byrd has left us over his many years as \nthe longest serving Member of Congress. We will do our best in the time \nwe have to honor his legacy and thank him today and every day going \nforward for what he has done for this institution. He kept the flame. \nHe understood the importance of this body constitutionally, and he \nunderstood that the rules and procedures of this body were its \nlifeblood and really understood them and recognized them more than \nanyone else who has served in this Chamber and spent his life's work \nprotecting them and memorializing them. To him, we owe a great \ncommendation.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nSenator and a friend and mentor of mine, Senator Robert C. Byrd. When I \nlook at his desk, a place from which he spoke such powerful words so \nmany times, it is hard to believe he will not be on the floor of the \nSenate speaking powerfully about what he believed in--the people of \nWest Virginia and the great issues of our day. He will be sorely \nmissed.\n  He was orphaned as a child and grew up poor. He often told us about \nhis foster father, who was a coal miner, who had to work hard to scrape \ntogether food and shelter for their family. He always spoke of working \nmen and women and those who were working hard and having a hard time \nmaking ends meet. I know his heart was always with them.\n  From a young age, Senator Byrd learned the importance of hard work, \ndedication, and perseverance--skills that would serve him well \nthroughout his long and very distinguished life.\n  After graduating from high school at the top of his class in 1934, he \nmarried his high school sweetheart Erma. Many of us knew her, and those \nwho didn't knew of her because he would speak continually about the \nlove of his life, his sweetheart Erma. After school, he went on to work \nat a number of odd jobs. He worked as a butcher during the Great \nDepression, earning less than $15 a week. He worked as a gas station \nattendant. During World War II, he was a welder in a shipyard in \nBaltimore. But he never forgot his childhood and where he came from. He \nknew how education had transformed his own life, and he never stopped \ntrying to give every American that same opportunity.\n  After high school he couldn't afford to go to college. But after he \nwas elected to the House of Representatives in 1953, he put himself \nthrough law school--the only Member of Congress ever to do that while \nin office. He joked that Erma put three children through school, \nhimself and their two daughters.\n  His wife was the most important person in the world to him, and I \nknow he was deeply saddened when Erma died in 2006, as were all of us \nwho served in the Senate with him at that time.\n  He was a great mentor, a great friend, a great advocate for working \nfamilies of Michigan and of America. I was proud to join with him many \ntimes as we fought for American workers, whether they were mine workers \nin West Virginia or auto workers in Michigan.\n  He loved West Virginia, the people and the landscape. One of his \nfavorite Bible verses was from the Psalms:\n\n       I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh \n     my help.\n\n  In my office I proudly display a painting that Senator Byrd gave to \nme, which he painted himself while working in Baltimore so he could \nremember those hills and mountains of his childhood. Today, when I see \nthat painting, I remember that Senator who gave so much for the people \nof West Virginia and the people of America. I was proud to stand with \nhim as one of the 23--as he reminded me frequently--the 23 who opposed \nthe original war in Iraq and stood up for our men and women who have \nbravely served us around the world as well.\n  Senator Robert C. Byrd--the Senate is a better place because of him \nand he will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, 10 years ago I gave my maiden \nspeech on the floor of the Senate. I was at a desk on the far side of \nthe Chamber. In the course of that speech, I happened to mention that \nit was my maiden speech. I had been here about a month. I went on. I \ncan even remember the subject. It was the deficit, since we were in a \nunique position that we actually had a surplus in the Federal \nGovernment and I did not want to see that surplus piddled away. I \nstarted talking about the budget and why it was necessary to keep the \nsurplus, to utilize the surplus to pay down the national debt over a \n10-year period.\n  Some minutes later, after I had said this was my maiden speech, all \nof a sudden the doors to the Chamber flung open and in came Senator \nRobert Byrd. As I was giving this first speech on the floor of the \nSenate, the greatest deliberative body in the world, he went over to \nhis desk--the one that is draped with black cloth, and upon it sits the \nvase of flowers to note his passing--he sat there and he looked at me \nand listened to the rest of that oration.\n  As I concluded, the Senator from West Virginia rose and said: Will \nthe Senator from Florida yield?\n  And I said: Of course I yield.\n  He proceeded, off the top of his head, from that incredible, detailed \nmemory, to lay out the history of maiden speeches on the floor of the \nSenate. He had been back in his office, and he had heard me, in the \ncourse of the audio from the television, say this was my maiden speech. \nHe came up and went into this long discourse about the importance of \nmaiden speeches and who were the ones who had given them and how long \ninto their service as a new Senator they had waited to give them.\n  Later on, as we were debating that budget, the great orator from West \nVirginia took the floor and began talking about a tax cut the Senate \nwas considering; a tax cut he voted against, and so did this Senator \nfrom Florida. The Senator from West Virginia talked about this tax cut \nthat was going to be a staggering $1.6 trillion. This is what the great \nsenior Senator from West Virginia said. ``That is $1,600 for every \nminute since Jesus Christ was born,'' Senator Byrd declared. He went on \nto say, ``If we go for this big tax cut . . . that money . . . is \ngone.''\n  We all like tax cuts, but what we have to have is a balance of tax \ncuts and spending cuts, given the position then that we had a surplus, \nand how to responsibly use that surplus to pay down the national debt. \nWhat we have is a reversal of that. We, of course, have a huge deficit \nbecause the revenues are not coming in to match the expenditures and, \nthus, additional problems that have accrued from not listening to the \nSenator who sat in that black-draped desk. No one else spoke like \nSenator Byrd or was as original as he was.\n  As we mark the passing of our dear colleague who, it has been said \nmany times, was the longest serving Federal lawmaker since the founding \nof the Republic, as we mourn his passing, many will remember the \nSenator from West Virginia by the numbers and by the records he set. He \nmade history. He brought depth and grace to the Senate. He is forever \nenshrined as a major part of its history.\n  I can tell you that 10 years ago, we freshmen had the blessing of \nbeing tutored--no, more than tutored; we were students, we were pupils \nof the master teacher. He taught us the rules, so important to the \nconduct of business in this body. But he taught us something more. He \ntaught us decorum. He taught us how to preside as the Presiding \nOfficer. He taught us that it is respectful that when you are \npresiding, you absolutely listen to the speaker. He taught us so much.\n  He was elected to no fewer than nine terms. He served first in the \nHouse for 6 years. He had cast over 18,000 votes. He presided over both \nthe longest session of the Senate and the shortest. We had no fewer \nthan 12 Presidents since he first took office.\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\n  But the numbers do not tell the full story. Robert Byrd was one of \nthe greatest advocates for just plain folks and especially if they came \nfrom West Virginia. He gave them his all, after his first and foremost \nlove, his devotion to his wife Erma. In the spirit of Thomas Jefferson, \nRobert Byrd always put public service ahead of personal fortune.\n  On my desk in my Senate office, as I would suspect on many other \nSenators' desks, are copies of Senator Byrd's addresses on the history \nof the Senate--more than 100 of those speeches delivered over a 10-year \nperiod. Those are the only books that are set on my personal desk with \nbook ends of two American eagles. That study has been called the most \nambitious study of the Senate ever undertaken. Every day, those books \nremind me of the living history of this institution and its vital role \nin our democracy.\n  Senator Byrd made rare and noble contributions to his family, his \nfriends, his State, his country, and to this Senate. He was, in a \nliving person, the walking history book of the Senate, which he could \nrecite. Now, as he has gone on to the ages, he will be known as the \nhistorian of the Senate. And now forever for history, he will be one of \nthe major parts of the Senate's history.\n  We mourn his passing, we miss him personally, we grieve for his \nfamily, and we are thankful there was a public servant who surely the \nLord would say: Well done, thy good and faithful servant.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ncolleagues as we mourn the death and celebrate the life of a man who \ntouched all of ours; a man who loved his country, loved the Senate, and \ndedicated his life to preserving its traditions; a man who above all \ncherished his State and who every day considered it his highest honor \nto represent her people.\n  On Monday morning, Senator Robert Byrd took his rightful place in our \nhistory books as a titan of the Senate. On Thursday we will honor him \nas his body lies in state in this Chamber where he served longer than \nany other Senator in our history. Today, we grieve his loss with his \nfamily and with the entire country.\n  My family's history with Senator Byrd goes back many years. My \nfather, before he became Secretary of the Interior, served with Senator \nByrd, then Congressman Byrd, in the House of Representatives. A half \ncentury later, my father's honor became my own. I am proud to have had \nthe privilege of serving in this Chamber with Senator Byrd, of \nexperiencing firsthand his distinguished service and remarkable career.\n  Senator Byrd will be remembered for many things. He will be \nremembered for his historic length of service; for his rise from humble \nroots to the pinnacles of political power; for his encyclopedic \nknowledge of Senate rules and procedure; and for his love of his wife \nof 68 years, Erma.\n  What I will remember Senator Byrd for is his willingness to stand up \nand fight for what he believed in. Two of the most pressing issues of \nthe past decade are perfect examples--the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nFrom the very beginning, Senator Byrd was a voice of opposition to the \nIraq war. He delivered what will become one of his most memorable \nspeeches in the days leading up to the Senate's vote to authorize its \nfunding. He spoke out against a war at a time when any opposition to \nthe President's path meant putting his own political future in \njeopardy. But he did not waiver.\n  Here is part of what he said:\n\n       No one supports Saddam Hussein. If he were to disappear \n     tomorrow, no one would shed a tear around the world. I would \n     not. My handkerchief would remain dry. But the principle of \n     one government deciding to eliminate another government, \n     using force to do so, and taking that action in spite of \n     world disapproval is a very disquieting thing. I am concerned \n     that it has the effect of destabilizing the world community \n     of nations. I am concerned that it fosters a climate of \n     suspicion and mistrust in U.S. relations with other nations. \n     The United States is not a rogue nation, given to unilateral \n     action in the face of worldwide opprobrium.\n\n  Eight years and thousands of American lives lost later, his words \nread as prophetic.\n  But he didn't stop there. Last year--this time with his party holding \nthe reins of power in both the White House and the Congress--he did the \nsame thing. Seven years had passed, and Senator Byrd was older and more \nfragile than ever before. None of that stopped him from getting to the \nSenate floor that day. How did I know this? I had a front row seat as \nthe presiding officer of the Senate that day.\n  This time, he questioned the proposed buildup of troops in \nAfghanistan--a proposal I myself had questioned many times as well. \nHere is what Senator Byrd said:\n\n       I have become deeply concerned that in the 8 years since \n     the September 11 attacks, the reason for the U.S. military \n     mission in Afghanistan has become lost, consumed in some \n     broader scheme of nation-building which has clouded our \n     purpose and obscured our reasoning.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       . . . President Obama and the Congress must reassess and \n     refocus on our original and most important objective--namely \n     emasculating a terrorist network that has proved its ability \n     to inflict harm on the United States.\n\n  Time will tell if Senator Byrd's concerns about Afghanistan prove as \nprescient as those he expressed about Iraq almost a decade ago. Time \nalso will tell if we heed those concerns.\n  What is clear is that Senator Byrd understood the importance of \nasking the tough questions, regardless of their impact on himself \npersonally or professionally. In this regard, we could all learn a \nlittle bit from Senator Byrd.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will agree with me when I say this \ninstitution, this country, this democracy lost a powerful advocate this \nweek, and all of us in this Chamber lost a good friend.\n  Today I join with my colleagues in expressing my deepest sympathy to \nSenator Byrd's family for their loss and remembering a man whose legend \nand legacy will endure beyond us all.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes talking \nabout a truly great Federal employee, and that is Senator Robert C. \nByrd.\n  He personified all the things I try to talk about once a week, \nbecause Robert Byrd was a Federal employee. Robert Byrd was a creature \nof the U.S. Senate. Robert Byrd had his family, and he was a great \nfamily man, but the Senate was also his family, and he cared about \neverybody here.\n  I remember the first time I ever had contact with Senator Byrd was in \n1972. On election day in 1972, Joe Biden, a 29-year-old candidate for \nthe U.S. Senate, was elected to the Senate running against one of the \nmost popular officials we ever had in the State of Delaware, a \nwonderful public servant and Federal employee, Caleb Boggs, who had \nbeen a Congressman and Governor before he became a Senator.\n  Just 6 weeks later, on December 18, when his wife and two sons and \ndaughter were bringing their Christmas tree home, the car was hit by a \ntractor trailer and Senator Biden's wife and daughter were killed.\n  Shortly after that, my church, St. Mary Magdalen in Wilmington, DE, \nhad a memorial service for his wife and daughter. I will never forget, \nit was a dark night. It was in December. It was just an ugly night out. \nThe church was full, and it was a very moving ceremony. After it was \nover, I found out that Senator Robert Byrd had driven himself to \nWilmington, DE, come into the church, stood in the back of the church \nfor the entire service, and then turned around and drove home. And \nthere are hundreds of stories like that where Robert Byrd demonstrated \nhis great love for the Senate and for the people of the Senate.\n  There are traditions he instilled in the Senate and traditions he \nkept alive in the Senate. I remember when he was majority leader, I \nwill tell you what, there were lots of things that just never happened \nbecause Senator Byrd was going to make sure we stuck to the traditions \nof the Senate. So I wish to recognize Senator Robert Byrd as a great, \ngreat Federal employee.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join all Americans in mourning the \npassing of Senator Robert C. Byrd. For more than five decades, Senator \nRobert Byrd served his home State, his beloved West Virginia, with a \ndedication that is unsurpassed in our Nation's history.\n  Senator Byrd was legendary for that commitment to his State, for his \noutstanding service as both the Senate's majority and minority leader, \nand for his staunch defense of the U.S. Constitution throughout his \nmany years of public service.\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\n  When I arrived in the Senate, Senator Byrd was in the midst of his \nsixth term, President pro tempore of the Senate, chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and already a giant of the institution. It was \nan honor to work beside him in this body.\n  Senator Byrd was the longest serving Member of Congress in our \nNation's history, elected to an unprecedented ninth term in the Senate \nin 2006. It was a long road from his humble beginnings in rural West \nVirginia to his long and distinguished service here. Along the way, \nSenator Byrd's life was characterized by hard work and a steely \ndetermination.\n  And of all the things he was determined to do, perhaps the most \nsignificant was his determination to get an education. Senator Byrd \nprized education, and fought to get one for himself despite difficult \nodds. That long effort culminated in Senator Byrd earning his law \ndegree, after 10 years of night classes as he served in Congress by \nday. He was 46 years old when he graduated, and President John F. \nKennedy presented him with the diploma.\n  He shared that love of learning as a champion of continuing \neducation, and through the establishment of the Robert C. Byrd Honors \nScholarship Program, which provides scholarships to high school seniors \nwho show promise of continued excellence in postsecondary education.\n  Senator Byrd was dedicated to the Senate and served an invaluable \nrole as a historian of the institution. He wrote a distinguished \nmultivolume history of the Senate, and also authored several other \nbooks. In fact when I drafted my proposed constitutional amendment on \nSenate vacancies, I consulted one of his volumes on Senate history. He \nhad written a chapter on the 17th amendment to the Constitution that \nwas very helpful in putting the issue of Senate vacancies in a \nhistorical context.\n  As a student of Senate history, both the U.S. Senate and the Roman \nSenate, he was also a passionate defender of the powers of the \nlegislative branch. One would expect no less of a man so devoted to our \nConstitution. Senator Byrd was eloquent as he spoke about the need to \nstand up for our Constitution and its principles here in the Senate, \nand faithfully carried a copy of the Constitution with him every day. \nHe was very proud of his efforts to encourage students to learn more \nabout this document and our great democracy.\n  In Senator Byrd's lifetime of leadership, he worked on so many \nimportant issues. As the Senate's majority leader, he helped to lead \nthe fight against the undue influence of money in politics in an effort \nwith then-Senator David Boren of Oklahoma. Together they sponsored \ncampaign finance legislation and worked to pass it in what has been \ndescribed as ``one of the most extraordinary exhibitions of \nperseverance on the Senate floor, as Byrd led the Senate through eight \nunsuccessful votes to end a filibuster.'' While that legislation \nstalled, it was one of the efforts that paved the way for later \nreforms, and I am grateful for his efforts.\n  I respected him for that, and for so many of the principled stands he \ntook during our service together, including his opposition to the Iraq \nwar. He brought tremendous wisdom and insight to our work here and I \nknow how much those gifts will be missed.\n  Robert C. Byrd was a man who sought to learn every day of his life, \nand in turn taught all of us a great deal. He taught us about our \nnation's history, about the people he represented, and about the \ninstitution of the Senate he loved. While Senator Byrd's passing is a \nloss for the nation, his legacy of innumerable achievements will live \non for many, many years to come. My thoughts are with his family and \nmany friends today.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on Monday, we lost a colleague and dear \nfriend with the passing of Senator Robert C. Byrd. My deepest sympathy \ngoes out to his family, friends, dedicated staff, and the people of \nWest Virginia. Senator Byrd was truly a giant among Senators. His \npresence will be greatly missed.\n  Few have had the command of history that Senator Byrd possessed, and \nI suspect none have matched his knowledge of the U.S. Constitution and \nthe Senate in which he served. Senator Byrd never passed up the \nopportunity to give a history lesson, delivering impassioned speeches \npeppered with poetry, lessons from ancient Rome, and his unique \nunderstanding of the workings of this Chamber. He also never forgot to \nremind us of the importance of Mother's Day, the beauty of the first \nday of spring, or how devoted he was to his beloved wife Erma.\n  Senator Byrd held fiercely to his beliefs. Yet, he had the humility \nand wisdom to change beliefs he realized were wrong. History will \nremember Senator Byrd, not only for his numerous records of service, \nbut for his unwavering commitment to education, public infrastructure, \nand the State of West Virginia.\n  This year, 19 outstanding high school students from my home State of \nSouth Dakota joined the ranks of thousands of Robert C. Byrd Honors \nScholarship recipients that are furthering their education, in part, \nbecause of Senator Byrd's belief in the value of higher education. He \nembodied that belief in his own life, earning a law degree while \nserving in Congress and striving to continue learning each day.\n  Senator Byrd also understood the value of investing in the small, \nsometimes overlooked communities of his State. Where others saw \n``pork,'' he saw jobs, opportunities, and hope for hard-working \nAmericans. He understood--better than most--that without roads, clean \nwater, and reliable utilities, rural communities will struggle to reach \ntheir full potential.\n  Though he would later ``walk with Kings, meet Prime Ministers and \ndebate with Presidents,'' Senator Byrd never forgot his roots in the \nhills of West Virginia. West Virginia lost a true champion, but his \nmark on the State will last far longer than even his half century in \nCongress.\n  I am honored to have served with Senator Byrd. This institution is a \nbetter place for his time here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5532-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5532-S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECTING AFGHAN CIVILIANS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we take stock of the changes made last \nweek by President Obama to the military command in Afghanistan, there \nis a related issue that has been discussed in the press that is of \nparticular concern to me.\n  I believe the President's decision to replace General McChrystal was \nthe right decision. The published comments of the general and his aides \nwere unquestionably insubordinate. They portrayed extraordinarily poor \njudgment and disrespect, and a deterioration of discipline that was \nunacceptable.\n  But putting aside those matters, I believe General McChrystal's \ncommand was notable for his recognition, to an unprecedented extent, of \nthe importance of protecting the lives of innocent Afghan civilians for \nthe safety of U.S. troops and to improve the chances of success of the \nmission.\n  Before General McChrystal's tenure, the need to do more to reduce \ncivilian casualties was discussed, particularly after each incident \nwhen civilians were inadvertently killed or injured. But far too little \nwas done about it. The frequent reliance on air power in areas where \ncivilians were present caused many innocent casualties. Whole villages \nwere destroyed. Wedding parties were wiped out. Night raids also often \ncaused civilian deaths or injuries, as well as widespread anger and \nresentment towards U.S. troops who were perceived as disrespectful of \nAfghan customs.\n  General McChrystal implemented stricter rules of engagement to reduce \nthese tragic incidents. While in some cases these rules have limited \nour troops' actions, they do not prevent soldiers from acting in self-\ndefense when there is a real or perceived threat. There is no basis, as \nfar as I am aware, military or otherwise, to criticize these efforts to \nprotect civilian lives. Indeed, I believe more can still be done, \nparticularly to prevent such unfortunate incidents at roadblocks and \ncheckpoints, where those killed have, with few exceptions, turned out \nto be unarmed civilians who posed no threat. Their deaths caused great \nsuffering for their families, and incited support for the Taliban in \ntheir communities.\n  Reducing civilian casualties, and by doing so winning the support of \nthe Afghan people, is essential. In late April, the people of the town \nof Gizab, north of Kandahar, took up arms and ousted the Taliban. This \nis encouraging, but it is unlikely to continue to occur if the\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\nUnited States and our ISAF partners are perceived by the civilian \npopulation as another invader.\n  I have my own concerns with the President's strategy in Afghanistan, \nwhich I will discuss at a later time. But today, as General Petraeus \nprepares to assume command of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, it is \nfortunate, I believe, that he knows from Iraq that winning the support \nand respect of the local population means much more than the cliche it \nhas become. Progress in Afghanistan depends on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5533-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the great joys of my job as Senator \nis working with non-profit organizations dedicated to improving the \nlives of all Americans. I would like to take a moment to salute one \nsuch organization, the Fraternal Order of Eagles.\n  The Fraternal Order of Eagles is an international nonprofit \norganization with over 1 million members worldwide. Established in \n1898, the Fraternal Order of Eagles has truly made the lives of people \nacross the world better by raising millions of dollars to combat cancer \nand heart disease, help children living with disabilities, and support \nthe elderly.\n  Two years ago, over 700 delegates representing the Fraternal Order of \nEagles voted by unanimous consent to commit $25 million to the \nUniversity of Iowa to create the world's premier diabetes research \ncenter. Already a world leader in medical and diabetes research, the \nUniversity of Iowa has the unique ability to fully maximize every \ndollar being donated. But that isn't the only reason the Fraternal \nOrder of Eagles selected the University of Iowa to receive these funds; \nboth the Eagles and the University of Iowa have had a tradition of \nhelping those in their communities and beyond for over a century.\n  One of the missions of the Fraternal Order of Eagles is to lessen the \nills of mankind, and I can't think of a more appropriate way to do that \nthan to join in the fight against diabetes. In the United States, over \n23 million children and adults already suffer from the diabetes, with \nan additional 1.6 million adults being diagnosed every year. It is said \nthat an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and perhaps \nnowhere is that more applicable than in the case of diabetes. Unlike \nother chronic diseases which do not appear until later in life, \ndiabetes does not spare the young. Almost 200,000 Americans below the \nage of 20 suffer from diabetes. It was recently predicted that one in \nthree children born in 2000 will eventually suffer from diabetes if \ncurrent rates continue. The health care cost associated with caring for \nthese patients is enormous, amounting to over $170 billion in 2007. But \nthe costs to patients and their loved ones who suffer from diabetes are \neven greater. Patients with diabetes are subject to an increased risk \nof blindness, kidney failure, high blood pressure, need for \namputations, nerve damage, and premature death. The potential benefits \nof a cure for diabetes are truly outstanding, and that is why donations \nsuch as the one made by the Fraternal Order of Eagles are so important \nto improving the lives of all Americans.\n  Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ``Life's most persistent and urgent \nquestion is: What are you doing for others?''

Mr. President, a few months ago, my colleagues and I \npassed a landmark health insurance reform bill.\n  President Obama signed it into law, and together we ushered in a new \nera of transparency, accountability, and cost savings for the American \npeople.\n  Now, these reforms will go a long way towards fixing our broken \nhealth care system.\n  They will restore responsibility to the insurance market, and impose \ncommonsense regulations, to ensure that every American can get a fair \ndeal.\n  Some of these provisions have already gone into effect. Others will \ntake time to implement correctly.\n  But as we move swiftly to translate this legislation into reality, we \nneed to be mindful of those who would take advantage of this period of \ntransition.\n  Already, there are reports that some health insurance companies have \ndrastically increased their rates, using our reform law as an excuse.\n  I recently heard from Charles, a small business owner from Plano, IL, \nwho reported that his employees will see their premiums go up by an \naverage of almost 28 percent next year.\n  And some folks will have to pay an arbitrary increase of 35 percent--\neven though their benefits haven't changed yet.\n  That is because a few big insurance companies have chosen to hike up \ntheir profits before our health reform law requires them to improve \ntheir services as well.\n  Now, there is nothing wrong with making an honest buck.\n  But these abusive increases will make it harder for ordinary folks \nand small businesses to get coverage in the short term.\n  There is no question that they violate the spirit of our reform law--\nso I believe we need to take action.\n  It is time to close this loophole, so big companies must compete with \nothers in an open marketplace--and so they can be held accountable for \nunreasonable rate hikes.\n  That is why I am proud to support the Health Insurance Rate Authority \nAct.\n  This legislation would require insurance companies to justify major \nincreases in their premiums--a power that already resides with \nregulators in a handful of States.\n  Our bill would merely bring similar regulatory authority to a \nnational level, in response to numerous claims of abuse all across the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, this wouldn't put insurers out of business or prevent \nthem from making an honest profit, but it would increase transparency, \nrestore accountability, and ensure that these corporations can remain \nsolvent.\n  In my home State of Illinois, some insurers must already supply rate \nincrease information to the State department of insurance.\n  But under current law, regulators are powerless to rein in obvious \nabuses when they occur.\n  And as a result, small business owners like Charles--and countless \nfolks in the individual market--are held hostage to the same corporate \nagendas that led us to pass a health reform law in the first place.\n  This is unacceptable. We need to pass the Health Insurance Rate \nAuthority Act, to keep insurance providers in check until the full \neffects of the new law have taken hold.\n  I would urge my colleagues to join with me in standing up to the \ninsurance giants.\n  Let's give regulators the authority to approve or deny excessive rate \nhikes, so we can make sure every American can get a fair deal--starting \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5533-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5533-S5534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DONALD J. RUHL\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this weekend, the citizens of Greybull, \nWY gather to dedicate a monument at the Donald J. Ruhl Memorial \nCemetery. This monument is the culmination of the hopes, dreams and \nhard work of dozens of people in the community. A true American hero \nwas laid to rest in their cemetery, and these committed individuals \nwanted his memory to be honored forever. Donald served our Nation \nduring World War II as a marine. His bravery and ultimate sacrifice \nearned him our Nation's most distinguished recognition, the Medal of \nHonor.\n  Donald J. ``Johnny'' Ruhl, enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve on \nSeptember 12, 1942. Immediately going on active duty, the new recruit \nused his lifelong experience with firearms to qualify as a \nsharpshooter, and demonstrated his endurance by becoming a combat \nswimmer. Following his exemplary performance at boot camp, Private Ruhl \nvolunteered for Parachute Training School. At the conclusion of this 5-\nweek training, Ruhl was promoted to private first class and assigned to \nfurther training in New Caledonia.\n  He first saw combat at Bougainville, but it was his actions at Iwo \nJima that truly demonstrated his heroism. In February 1945, Johnny \ndeparted from\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\nSaipan aboard the USS LST 481, headed for the shores of Iwo Jima. \nPrivate First Class Ruhl displayed his courage from the onset of D-day \nat Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945. Johnny recognized his role early on \nin the battle attacking a group of eight Japanese soldiers single-\nhandedly. Private First Class Ruhl confirmed his valor and bravery by \nrisking his own life to rescue a marine wounded ahead of the front \nline--ensuring that the man was transported to an aid station, \nregardless of the threat to Ruhl.\n  Ruhl continued to establish his commitment to the cause by returning \nfrom the aid station to voluntarily investigate an abandoned Japanese \ngun emplacement. With boundless courage, he prevented the enemy from \nregaining possession of the valuable site by occupying the position \nthroughout the night. On February 21, Johnny demonstrated his true \nselfless nature. As Company E, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, 5th Marine \nDivision pushed forward on their quest to capture Mount Suribachi, \nPrivate First Class Ruhl along with his platoon guide, pressed their \nposition to the top of a Japanese bunker. As the marines prepared to \nfire upon the enemy troops, a grenade landed between them. While \nnotifying the platoon guide, Ruhl dove onto the grenade, absorbing the \nfull detonation with his body. This sacrifice saved the lives of all of \nthe nearby marines. Thanks in great part to this selfless act, Company \nE was able to raise an American flag on the top of Mount Suribachi.\n  In awarding Private First Class Ruhl the Medal of Honor posthumously, \nPresident Truman recognized Johnny's efforts, stating ``An indomitable \nfighter, PFC Ruhl rendered heroic service toward the defeat of a \nruthless enemy.'' . . . Certainly Truman was correct when he continued \npraising Ruhl's dedication to our Nation and his fellow marines, ``. . \n. his valor, initiative and unfaltering spirit of self-sacrifice in the \nface of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest \ntraditions of the United States Naval Service.''\n  PFC Donald J. Ruhl embodied the Marine Corps motto, Semper Fidelis, \ncommitting his life, and his death, to loyalty to the Corps and his \ncountry. The community of Greybull has done well to recognize this \nhero. They have demonstrated their faithfulness to his memory by \nrenaming his eternal resting place. His gift to our country will never \nbe forgotten--in passing his memorial, we will forever know that Donald \nJ. Ruhl gave all so our country could remain free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5534-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIONAL HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECSTASIA MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nHereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiecstasia--HHT--Month to raise awareness \nof this public health threat and encourage greater prevention, \ndiagnosis and treatment efforts.\n  Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiecstasia, HHT, also referred to as \nOsler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome, is a complex genetic blood vessel disorder \nthat affects approximately 70,000, or 1 in 5,000, Americans. It is \ncharacterized by irregular blood vessel growths, or telangiectases, in \nthe nasal mucosa, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and skin of the face \nand hands, as well as artery-vein malformations--AVMs--in the major \norgans including the lungs, brain, and liver. If left misdiagnosed or \nuntreated, HHT can result in considerable morbidity and mortality.\n  It is estimated that 20 to 40 percent of debilitating and life-\nthreatening complications and sudden death due to these ``vascular time \nbombs'' are preventable. Twenty percent of those with HHT, regardless \nof age, suffer death or disability. HHT has been subject to \nunderreporting for many years. Approximately 90 percent of the HHT \npopulation is not yet diagnosed and is at risk for sudden rupture of \nthe blood vessels in major organs in the body, such as the brain and \nlungs, and other complications due to nosebleeds and gastrointestinal \nbleeding.\n  It is my hope that efforts throughout the month of June will increase \nawareness of HHT and mitigate the preventable health threats posed by \nthis disorder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5534-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 TRIBUTE TO COLONEL CLARENCE S. PARKER\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Isakson, today to honor the accomplishments of COL \nClarence S. Parker of Valdosta, GA, in the Record of the Senate.\n  For most of his life, Colonel Parker has been a dedicated pilot. In \n1940, when the United States was on the brink of war, Colonel Parker \nwas prepared to fight for his loved ones and his nation. A native of \nHouston, TX, Colonel Parker began his lengthy career in aviation while \nenrolled as a student at the University of Houston.\n  After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Colonel Parker entered the \nU.S. Army Air Corps in January of 1942. He completed military flight \ntraining and was commissioned in September of that year. During World \nWar II, Colonel Parker was an instructor pilot at Waco Army Airfield, \nprimarily in the BT-13 and the P-40 aircraft. He flew during the early \nphases of the Berlin Airlift, and later ascended to a position of \nleadership as the chief of flight procedures from 1948 until the end of \nthe airlift. In 1950, he returned to the U.S. to serve at the Pentagon \nin the U.S. Air Force Headquarters and also at Tyndall Air Force Base \nin Florida. Following service in Vietnam, he finished his military \ncareer as wing commander at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, GA, \nflying T-37 and T-38 aircraft.\n  Following his retirement in 1971, Colonel Parker made Valdosta, GA, \nhis home. He became heavily involved in the operations and upkeep of \nthe Valdosta Municipal Airport and began a second career in banking. \nDuring his tenure as chairman of the airport authority from 1987 to \n2005, he was instrumental in earning funding for several major \nconstruction projects, including a project to lengthen the main \ninstrument runway to 8,002 feet.\n  Colonel Parker remains an active pilot with over 7,500 hours of \nflight time. He continues to work with the Valdosta-Lowndes Chamber of \nCommerce to benefit the flying activities at both Moody Air Force Base \nand in the Valdosta civil aviation community. Additionally, he remains \na consultant to the Valdosta-Lowndes County Airport Authority.\n  Colonel Parker has enjoyed a career that is extraordinary in length, \nquality of service, and leadership. For these reasons, he has been \nselected to receive the Federal Aviation Administration's Wright \nBrothers Master Pilot Award. The Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award \nrecognizes pilots who have maintained safe flight operations for 50 or \nmore consecutive years. We can think of no higher award for a pilot, \nand we are proud to recognize Colonel Parker for his receipt of the \nWright Brothers Master Pilot Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5534-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SARAH MARGARET AKER\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand access to medication therapy management services under the \nMedicare prescription drug program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the \nMedication Therapy Management, MTM, Expanded Benefits Act of 2010, with \nmy colleague from Minnesota, Senator Franken.\n  A recent analysis conducted by the New England Healthcare Institute \nestimates that the overall cost of medication nonadherence is as much \nas $290 billion per year. According to a recent article published in \nthe New England Journal of Medicine, over $100 billion is spent \nannually on avoidable hospitalizations because patients do not take \ntheir medications correctly.\n  Not only does nonadherence cost our system billions of dollars, \nnonadherence to medication regimens also affects the quality of life \nfor seniors and may lead to early death. The elderly typically take \nmany more prescription medicines than the general population and \ntherefore are at greater risk for problems associated with improper use \nof medications. For example, the same New England Journal of Medicine \narticle I just reference found that better adherence to \nantihypertensive treatment alone could prevent 89,000 premature deaths \nin the U.S. annually.\n  With as much as one half of all patients in the U.S. not following \ntheir doctors' orders regarding their medications, medication therapy \nmanagement could help reduce some of the wasted health care costs in \nour system.\n  North Carolina has implemented some very successful MTM programs.\n  The Asheville Project, which focuses on diabetes, asthma, and \ncardiovascular disease, has seen improved health outcomes and \nsignificant savings among city employees since it began in 1997. For \nexample, in the Asheville Project's diabetes MTM Project, they have \nseen a decrease in medical costs of between $1,622 to $3,356 per \npatient per year; a decrease in insurance claims of $2,704 per patient \nin year 1 and a $6,502 decrease in year 5; a 50 percent decrease in use \nof sick days; and increased productivity gains estimated at $18,000 \nannually.\n  In 2007, the North Carolina Health and Wellness Trust Fund Commission \nlaunched an innovative statewide program, Checkmeds NC, to provide MTM \nservices to North Carolina seniors. During the program's first year, \nmore than 15,000 North Carolina seniors and 285 pharmacists \nparticipated. The seniors bring all of their prescriptions, over-the-\ncounter medicines, vitamins and supplements to the pharmacy to be \nthoroughly reviewed in a one-on-one session. The pharmacist follows up \nand educates the patient about his or her medication regimen. The \nprogram saved an estimated $10 million, and countless health problems \nwere avoided.\n  During consideration of health care reform, I was pleased to have \nsuccessfully secured language in the bill that built off these North \nCarolina models and implemented MTM nationally for seniors suffering \nfrom two or more chronic conditions.\n  The bill I am introducing today takes MTM one step further. \nSpecifically, this bill would expand MTM eligibility to seniors with \nany chronic condition that accounts for high spending in our health \ncare system, such as heart failure and diabetes. Currently, only 12.9 \npercent of Part D beneficiaries are eligible under the MTM criteria for \nmultiple chronic conditions. However, of those, more than 85 percent \nhave chosen to participate in the benefit. Clearly this program is very \npopular and widely utilized by those who are already eligible. By \nexpanding eligibility to more seniors, MTM will certainly result in \nMedicare savings.\n  The bill also ensures access to MTM for seniors at a pharmacy or with \na qualified health care provider of their choice.\n  To ensure pharmacists and health care providers are able to provide \nMTM to seniors, this bill ensures they are appropriately reimbursed for \ntheir time and service. This provision will permit pharmacies and other \nhealth care providers to spend considerable time and resources \nevaluating a person's drug routine and educating them on proper usage--\nall critical components of a successful MTM program.\n  Finally, this bill would establish standards for data collection to \nevaluate and improve the Part D MTM benefit.\n  The value of MTM is widely known and discussed. I am proud that North \nCarolina is a leader in this arena. Expansion of MTM to more seniors \nwill no doubt improve their overall health, while at the same time \nreducing waste in our health care system.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I am proud today to be joining Senator \nHagan in introducing the MTM Expanded Benefits Act.\n  We all know that prescription drugs are an essential part of health \ncare. What a lot of people don't know is that only about 50 percent of \nAmericans typically take their medicines as prescribed. This means that \ntoo often, the benefits of these important therapies aren't fully \nrealized. According to a recent article in the New England Journal of \nMedicine, over $100 billion is spent annually on avoidable \nhospitalizations because patients don't take their medications \ncorrectly.\n  The MTM Expanded Benefits Act would help improve the care for seniors \nby increasing access to the medication therapy management benefit--also \nknown as MTM--in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program.\n  Medication therapy management is a proven set of services that helps \npatients get the best possible results from their medications. MTM \nservices are provided by pharmacists who work with patients and their \nhealth care providers to make sure that seniors are taking medications \nas they should be. Through MTM, patients get focused education to make \nsure they understand their medications--what conditions the drugs treat \nand how to avoid drug interactions that can make medications less \neffective or even dangerous.\n  It is not uncommon for a Minnesota senior who has diabetes to be \ntaking 10 or more medications that are prescribed by multiple \nproviders. But right now under Medicare, you would have to have at \nleast four chronic conditions before you would become eligible for MTM. \nThat just doesn't make sense to me.\n  Under the MTM Expanded Benefits Act, seniors with any chronic \ncondition could benefit from MTM. The bill would increase the number of \npeople eligible for MTM, helping more seniors to access the life saving \nand money-saving services.\n  Congress recognized the value of MTM when it required Medicare Part D \ndrug plans to offer the service as part of the Medicare Modernization \nAct of 2003. Furthermore, State Medicaid Programs, including ours in \nMinnesota, use MTM to maximize the value of their pharmacy benefits. As \nwe reform our health care system and provide insurance coverage to more \nAmericans, it makes sense to ensure that MTM becomes more widely \nadopted throughout our health care system.\n  And MTM isn't just good for patient health, it also saves money. A \nUniversity of Minnesota study showed that when patients were able to \nconsult with a pharmacist to determine their optimal medication \nregimen, total health expenditures decreased from $11,965 to $8,197 per \npatient. The reduction in total health expenditures exceeded the cost \nof providing MTM services by more than 12 to 1. That is huge.\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\n  The elderly typically take many more prescription medicines than the \ngeneral population and therefore are at greater risk for problems \nassociated with improper use of medications. Improving the Medicare MTM \nbenefit will help our Nation's seniors get the most out of their \nmedications while also helping to reduce costs through appropriate \nmedication use and improved outcomes. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe MTM Expanded Benefits Act and help support efforts to improve the \nprescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Tester, \n        and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 3550: A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish within the Environmental Protection Agency a Columbia Basin \nRestoration Program; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak to legislation I am \nintroducing today, with my colleagues, Senator Crapo of Idaho, Senators \nBaucus and Tester of Montana, and Senator Wyden, from my home state of \nOregon, to protect and restore the Columbia River Basin.\n  The Columbia River Basin is the great river system that defines the \nPacific Northwest. It runs 1,243 miles from Columbia Lake in British \nColumbia to its mouth at Astoria, OR, the first permanent European \nsettlement west of the Rocky Mountains. Its basin drains 258,000 acres \nin seven states, including many of great geological provinces of the \nWest: the Yellowstone Plateau; the Rocky Mountains; the volcanic Snake \nRiver Plain; Hells Canyon, America's deepest canyon; the basalt plains \nand high desert of eastern Oregon and Washington; the majestic Columbia \nRiver Gorge; the volcanic slopes of the Cascade Mountains; and the \ntemperate rain forests of the Coast Range.\n  The Columbia River's tributaries are the major rivers of the \nNorthwest. The Snake River, its longest tributary, runs more than 1,000 \nmiles from near the continental divide in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park to \nits mouth with the Columbia in eastern Washington. The Clark Fork is \nMontana's largest river by volume, draining much of western Montana and \nturning into the Pend Oreille River in Idaho before it flows into the \nColumbia just across the border in Canada.\n  It is also the lifeblood of our economy and has been the foundation \nof a trade-based economy stretching back thousands of years, even \nbefore European settlement. Today it is the cornerstone of the region's \nshipping network, with ports dotting the river as far upstream as \nLewiston, Idaho, the farthest inland seaport in the west. It was once \nthe world's largest wild salmon run, with as many as 30 million salmon \nreturning to spawn in our rivers, and is still a foundation for much of \nour commercial and recreational fishing industries and an important \nsource of fish for many of our Indian tribes.\n  The Columbia River Basin is the backbone of our energy system, with a \nnetwork of dams that provide the majority of the region's electricity, \nmore electricity than any other river in the country generates. Indeed, \nwhen we measure generating capacity, we talk about 100- and 200-\nMegawatt capacity wind farms and we talk about 600- and 800-Megawatt \ncoal plants. Well, the Grand Coulee dam in central Washington state has \na capacity of 6,800 Megawatts. It was the availability of low-cost \npower that brought the industrial era to the Northwest and brought a \nhost of benefits to our rural residents, from rural electrification to \nirrigation for agriculture, as memorialized in the 1940s by Woody \nGuthrie. About four million acres of income-producing farm and ranch \nland across the Pacific Northwest are irrigated by the Columbia River, \ncontributing $10 billion to our economy every year.\n  Unfortunately, the Columbia River Basin is also a river basin that \nfaces serious challenges. Our rivers are severely polluted. When EPA \ncompleted its Columbia River Basin Fish Contaminant Survey, the agency \nlooked for 131 chemicals in fish tissues that could be taken up by \nhumans because of contamination entering the food chain. The study \ndetected 70 percent of the chemicals EPA was looking for. All 11 \nspecies of fish they tested had some level of contamination in their \ntissue.\n  The contamination in these fish poses a health problem for people \nthroughout our region, but it is the Indian tribes, our neighbors who \nhave made this basin their home for thousands of years--including the \nWarm Springs, the Nez Perce, the Umatilla, and the Yakama--who are \namong the most affected. A survey conducted by the Columbia River \nIntertribal Fish Commission found that tribal members consume between 6 \nand 10 times as much fish as the national average. High consumption \nrates exist among all tribal members consuming fish as well as among \nspecific high-risk groups, including breastfeeding women.\n  In addition, the salmon and steelhead, upon which the tribes and the \nfishing communities of the Northwest have so long depended, are in \nserious decline.\n  The good news is that stakeholders across the region are working to \nclean up and restore the river. Since the Lower Columbia River estuary \nwas added to the National Estuary Program, a robust partnership \ninvolving 28 cities, 9 counties, and the states of Oregon and \nWashington has come together to coordinate habitat restoration and \ntoxic contamination reduction in that part of the basin. The EPA has \ncoordinated stakeholders throughout the basin, including the states of \nIdaho and Montana and tribal governments, working to improve toxic \npollution monitoring and reduce and clean up contamination.\n  But more needs to be done.\n  While EPA has designated the Columbia River Basin as one of the \nnation's Great Water Bodies and has an active program in the basin, it \nis the only one of these Great Water Bodies that doesn't receive \ndesignated appropriations to support its restoration. Unlike the \nChesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes, where Congress has authorized and \nfunded restoration programs, the Columbia River Basin has no such \nprogram.\n  It is in that context that I introduce today, along with Senate \ncolleagues from the Northwest, the Columbia River Basin Restoration Act \nof 2010. The bill establishes a clear stakeholder-driven process to \noversee implementation of toxic contamination reduction plans. It \ndirects EPA to provide technical support to a Working Group of \nstakeholders representing important constituencies and representing \nevery geographic area in the Basin, and it allows those stakeholders to \nprioritize projects to implement toxic contamination reduction and to \npropose those projects to the EPA for funding.\n  We have also included an important component related to the Flathead \nRiver Basin in this bill. As my colleague the senior Senator from \nMontana can tell you, the Flathead is an amazing pristine gem of a \nwater body on the far eastern edge of our basin. It forms the western \nand southern boundaries of the world's first international peace park, \nGlacier-Waterton, and it contains Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater \nlake in the West. Senator Baucus has made protecting the Flathead Basin \na major focus and has discussed it many times in our work together on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, and we have been working \ntogether for several months now to make sure we could protect the \nFlathead River Basin in this bill. I am glad we were able to include \nhis provision to do so.\n  I would particularly like to thank my colleague Senator Crapo from \nour neighboring State to the east. Senator Crapo and I have been able \nto work together in a true collaborative partnership to propose what we \nbelieve will be an effective, stakeholder-driven program to help our \nconstituents reduce toxic contamination in waterways that matter so \nmuch to them, and to do so in ways that our constituents design and \nprioritize. This bill reflects the interests and concerns of people \nfrom every State in the Northwest, and we will continue to hear and \naddress their interests and concerns as the legislative process \ncontinues.\n  I am proud to stand with my colleagues from the Northwest today as we \nintroduce this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3550\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Columbia River Basin \n     Restoration Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific \n     Northwest by volume;\n       (2) the river is 1,253 miles long, with a drainage basin \n     that includes 259,000 square miles, extending to 7 States and \n     British Columbia, Canada, and including all or part of--\n       (A) multiple national parks;\n       (B) components of the National Wilderness Preservation \n     System;\n       (C) National Monuments;\n       (D) National Scenic Areas;\n       (E) National Recreation Areas; and\n       (F) other areas managed for conservation.\n       (3) the Columbia River Basin and associated tributaries \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Basin'') provide \n     significant ecological and economic benefits to the Pacific \n     Northwest and the entire United States;\n       (4) traditionally, the Basin includes more than 6,000,000 \n     acres of irrigated agricultural land and produces more \n     hydroelectric power than any other North American river;\n       (5) the Basin--\n       (A) historically constituted the largest salmon-producing \n     river system in the world, with annual returns peaking at as \n     many as 30,000,000 fish; and\n       (B) as of the date of enactment of this Act--\n       (i) supports economically important commercial and \n     recreational fisheries; and\n       (ii) is home to 13 species of salmonids and steelhead that \n     area listed as threatened species or endangered species under \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);\n       (6) the Lower Columbia River Estuary stretches 146 miles \n     from the Bonneville Dam to the mouth of the Pacific Ocean, \n     and much of that area is contaminated with toxic chemicals;\n       (7) the Middle and Upper Columbia River Basin includes \n     1,050 miles of the mainstem Columbia River upstream of the \n     Bonneville Dam, including the 1,040 miles of the largest \n     tributary, the Snake River, and all of the tributaries to \n     both rivers;\n       (8) toxic contamination in the Basin poses a significant \n     threat to the environment and human health;\n       (9) the nuclear and toxic contamination at the Hanford \n     Nuclear Reservation and the toxic contamination at Superfund \n     sites throughout the Basin present an ongoing risk of \n     contamination throughout the Basin;\n       (10) polychlorinated biphenyls (commonly known as ``PCBs'') \n     and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that have been found in \n     the tissues of salmonids and their prey at concentrations \n     exceeding levels of concern;\n       (11) legacy contaminants, including PCBs and \n     dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, the pesticide commonly known \n     as ``DDT'', were banned in 1972, but are still detected in \n     river water, sediments, and juvenile Chinook salmon;\n       (12) pesticides and emerging contaminants, such as \n     pharmaceutical and personal care products, have been detected \n     in river water and may have effects including hormone \n     disruption and impacts on behavior and reproduction;\n       (13) the Environmental Protection Agency's Columbia River \n     Basin Fish Contaminant Survey detected the presence of 92 \n     priority pollutants, including PCBs and DDE (a breakdown of \n     DDT), in fish that are consumed by members of Indian tribes \n     in the Columbia River Basin, as well as by other individuals \n     consuming fish throughout the Columbia River Basin, and a \n     fish consumption survey by the Columbia River Intertribal \n     Fish Commission showed that tribal members were eating 6 to \n     11 times more fish than the estimated national average of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (14) toxic contamination in the Middle and Upper Columbia \n     River Basins have a direct impact on water quality in the \n     Lower Columbia River Estuary, and reducing toxic \n     contamination in the Middle and Upper Columbia River Basin \n     can have significant benefits for human health and for fish \n     and wildlife throughout the entire Basin; and\n       (15) with regard to the Flathead River Basin, in the \n     easternmost portion of the Columbia River Basin--\n       (A) the Flathead River Basin--\n       (i) has high water quality and aquatic biodiversity;\n       (ii) supports endangered species and species of special \n     concern listed under United States and Canadian law;\n       (iii) contains Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake \n     in the western United States;\n       (iv) is an important wildlife corridor that is home to the \n     highest density of large and mid-sized carnivores and the \n     highest diversity of vascular plant species in the United \n     States; and\n       (v) supports traditional uses such as hunting, fishing, \n     recreation, guiding and outfitting, and logging;\n       (B) the Flathead River originates in British Columbia and \n     drains into the State of Montana;\n       (C) such transboundary waters are protected from pollution \n     under the Treaty Relating to the Boundary Waters and \n     Questions Arising Along the Boundary Between the United \n     States and Canada, signed at Washington on January 11, 1909 \n     (36 Stat. 2448; TS 548) (commonly known as the ``Boundary \n     Waters Treaty of 1909'');\n       (D) in 1988, the International Joint Commission determined \n     that the impacts of mining proposals on the environmental \n     values of the Flathead River Basin, including on water \n     quality, sport fish populations, and habitat, could not be \n     fully mitigated;\n       (E) the Flathead River forms the western and southern \n     boundaries of the world's first International Peace Park, \n     Waterton-Glacier, which was inscribed as a World Heritage \n     Site in 1995 under the auspices of the World Heritage \n     Convention, adopted by the United Nations Educational, \n     Scientific, and Cultural Organization General Conference on \n     November 16, 1972;\n       (F) at the 33rd session of the World Heritage Committee in \n     2009, Decision 33 COM 7B.22 (Annex 3) 2009, the World \n     Heritage Committee urged Canada in 2009 not to permit any \n     mining or energy development in the Upper Flathead River \n     Basin until the relevant environmental assessment processes \n     have been completed and to provide timely opportunities for \n     the United States to participate in environmental assessment \n     processes; and\n       (G) on February 18, 2010, British Columbia and Montana \n     entered into a memorandum of understanding--\n       (i) to remove mining and oil and gas development as \n     permissible land uses in the Flathead River Basin;\n       (ii) to cooperate on fish and wildlife management;\n       (iii) to collaborate on environmental assessment of \n     projects of cross border significance with the potential to \n     degrade land or water resources; and\n       (iv) to share information proactively.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Merkley, Senator \nTester, Senator Crapo, and others to introduce the Columbia River Basin \nRestoration Act of 2010. The bill authorizes much needed funds to \nimplement toxics reduction projects throughout the basin, and it \nauthorizes next steps in our longstanding effort to protect and \npreserve the transboundary Flathead Basin. The Columbia River Basin is \none of the great water basins along our border with Canada that binds \nour two nations together. The river spans about 1,200 miles and travels \nthrough 14 dams from Columbia Lake, British Columbia all the way to the \nPacific Ocean. Several of the major subasins of the Columbia are \nlocated in Montana, including the Kootenai, the Flathead, the Clark \nFork, the Blackfoot, and the Bitterroot. Toxics contamination is a \nproblem in several of these subasins, and I am very pleased to be a \ncosponsor of the Columbia River Basin Restoration Act of 2010, which \nwill authorize much needed resources to address toxics contamination.\n  The Columbia River Basin Restoration Act of 2010 also includes the \nTransboundary Flathead Basin Protection Act of 2010. This part of the \nbill addresses the unique needs of one of the areas that I love about \nMontana. Everyone who experiences the North Fork of the Flathead in \nnorthwestern Montana is awed by its pristine waters, larger-than-life \nlandscapes, and breathtaking views. With its headwaters in British \nColumbia, the North Fork of the Flathead River forms the western \nboundary of Glacier National Park--it is one of the last untouched \nplaces on our continent.\n  For decades, the North Fork has been threatened by oil and gas and \nmining proposals in British Columbia. For the last 35 years, I have \nbattled these proposals, one by one. After 35 years of work, we are \nbeginning a new chapter of international cooperation in our efforts to \nprotect the North Fork.\n  In February of this year, British Columbia and Montana announced \ntheir intent to prevent mining, oil and gas, and coalbed methane \ndevelopment in the North Fork on the lands they control. This \nmemorandum of understanding was a great foundation for additional \nefforts to establish protections that are permanent. Since 90 percent \nof the North Fork watershed is Federally-owned, Federal action is \nneeded on the southern side of the U.S.-Canadian border.\n  So, on March 4, Senator Tester and I introduced the North Fork \nWatershed Protection Act, S. 3075, which bans future mining, oil and \ngas, and coalbed methane development on Federal lands in the watershed. \nThe bill enjoys support from business and conservation interests alike \nfrom all over the State, including the Kalispell Chamber, Whitefish \nMountain Resort, the Billings Rod and Gun Club, and a long list of \nothers. This breadth of support shows the importance of the North Fork \nfor Montana's economy as well as our State's outdoor heritage.\n  There are some current leases in the area that have been dormant \nsince the late 1980s, when a court decision found that they were \nimproperly issued. Senator Tester and I have been engaged in active \ndiscussions with the current owners to retire these old leases. On \nApril 28, I was proud to announce that ConocoPhillips, the primary \nleaseholder in the North Fork watershed, elected to voluntarily \nrelinquish its interest in 108 Federal oil and gas leases covering \napproximately 169,000 acres, representing 71 percent of the leased area \nin the North Fork watershed. On June 2, we announced that Chevron \ndecided to voluntarily relinquish its interest in 11,000 acres of \nleases in the Flathead watershed. To date, we have managed to retire \nthe primary interest in 180,000 acres in the North Fork watershed, free \nof charge to the American taxpayer.\n  These actions are further evidence of the consensus that exists \nbetween the United States and Canada and among businesses and \nconservationists, that the withdrawal of these Federal lands from \nleasing is the only path forward.\n  The transboundary Flathead section of the Columbia River Restoration \nAct of 2010 authorizes the next phase of our efforts to protect the \nFlathead. Just yesterday, the White House issued a statement that \nduring the G20 meeting in Toronto, President Obama and Prime Minister \nHarper discussed the transboundary Flathead, recognizing the memorandum \nof understanding between British Columbia and Montana and exploring \nways that the two governments can cooperate to ensure sustained \nprotection of the North Fork. Senator Tester and I asked the President \nto discuss this issue with the Prime Minister on June 9th, and we are \nvery pleased that the two made this a priority in light of the agenda \nat the G20. This commitment from the highest levels of government sets \nthe stage for four-party talks between the United States, Canada, \nBritish Columbia, and Montana to establish permanent protections.\n  The Columbia River Basin Restoration Act of 2010 takes three key \nsteps to move things forward in the Flathead. Before I walk through \nthose, it is important to recognize that this is an authorization bill. \nIt authorizes specific actions by the Federal Government and authorizes \nappropriations in support of those actions. It is important to remember \nthat Congress works in a two-step process--first the authorization, \nthen, once signed into law, appropriations follow.\n  The bill authorizes the President to take steps to preserve and \nprotect the transboundary Flathead River Basin. It is clear that the \nPresident has authority under the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909, the \nClean Water Act, and other statutes to take steps to prevent water \npollution and protect wildlife in the transboundary Flathead. This \nsection requires that the President act to meet these goals and \nprovides explicit authority for the President to negotiate with Canada \nto ensure permanent protection for the North Fork and Glacier-Waterton \nNational Park.\n  The bill authorizes the President, acting through appropriate \nagencies, to participate in cross-border collaborations and \nenvironmental assessments with Canada. Federal agency participation in \nsuch assessments is anticipated in the MOU between British Columbia and \nMontana, and our bill provides the authority for this to occur. \nFinally, the bill authorizes grants for baseline environmental studies, \nanalysis of environmental impacts of any proposed projects, \nimplementation of transboundary cooperative efforts, and other projects \nto protect and preserve the transboundary Flathead River Basin.\n  Funds for these and other purposes in the Columbia River Restoration \nAct of 2010 would be provided through the appropriations process, once \nthis bill is signed into law.\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\n  Mr. President, I want to reflect for a moment on how far we have come \nin Montana in efforts to protect the North Fork. In 1975, during my \nvery first term in the House of Representatives, I introduced a bill to \ndesignate the Flathead River as a Wild and Scenic River. It was \ndesignated a Wild and Scenic River in 1976.\n  For me, that began a lifelong effort to protect the North Fork. At \nthat time I said:\n\n       A hundred years from now, and perhaps much sooner, those \n     who follow us will survey what we have left behind.\n\n  The retirement of current oil and gas leases in the Flathead, the \nEnergy Committee's very positive hearing on April 28 on S. 3075, the \nNorth Fork Watershed Protection Act 2010, President Obama's action \nyesterday with Prime Minister Harper, our introducing of this \nbipartisan legislation today and its eventual passage are all steps in \na decades-long process to protect this gem of the continent.\n  I know that if we continue to cooperate with Canada, that if we can \nall keep our eye on the ball of long-term protection for the North \nFork, that every Montanan, every American, and every Canadian who \nfollows us will have the opportunity to share our feeling of awestruck \nwonder that such a place still exists, almost untouched by the modern \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/29/senate-section/article/S5544-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5544-S5545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 573--URGING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE \n    STRATEGY TO ENSURE STABILITY IN SOMALIA, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. Franken) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 573\n\n       Whereas Somalia has been without a functioning central \n     government since 1991, resulting in lawlessness and an \n     increasingly desperate humanitarian situation;\n       Whereas, despite the return of the internationally \n     recognized Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to Mogadishu \n     and ongoing diplomatic efforts through the Djibouti Peace \n     Process, supported by the United Nations, there has been \n     little improvement in the governance or stability of southern \n     and central Somalia, and armed opposition groups continue to \n     exploit this situation;\n       Whereas the traditional mediation role played by Somali \n     elders has been eroded as the dynamics of conflict and the \n     proliferation of weapons make it difficult to influence \n     warring parties;\n       Whereas, since 2007, armed violence has resulted in the \n     deaths of at least 21,000 people in Somalia and the \n     displacement of nearly 2,000,000 people, including over \n     500,000 refugees in Kenya, Yemen, Ethiopia, Eritrea, \n     Djibouti, Tanzania, and Uganda;\n       Whereas the United Nations estimates that 3,200,000 people, \n     or 43 percent of the population of Somalia, are in need of \n     humanitarian assistance and livelihood support to survive;\n       Whereas the United Nations reports that almost 1,000,000 \n     displaced Somalis in need of aid cannot be reached by United \n     Nations refugee and food agencies because of growing \n     insecurity and the threat of kidnappings to staff;\n       Whereas local humanitarian organizations are trying to meet \n     the needs of the Somali people by restoring basic social \n     services in urban and rural communities, which places them on \n     the front lines of the conflict and make them vulnerable \n     targets for killings, kidnappings, or being accused of \n     working for foreign governments;\n       Whereas al Shabaab, which has been designated as a foreign \n     terrorist organization by the Department of State, and other \n     armed groups continue to wage war against the Transitional \n     Federal Government in Mogadishu and one another to gain \n     control over territory in Somalia;\n       Whereas al Shabaab has claimed responsibility for many \n     bombings--including suicide attacks--in Mogadishu, as well as \n     in central and northern Somalia, typically targeting \n     officials of the Government of Somalia and perceived allies \n     of the TFG;\n       Whereas, according to Human Rights Watch, al Shabaab is \n     subjecting inhabitants of areas under its control in southern \n     Somalia to executions, cruel punishments, including \n     amputations and floggings, and repressive social control;\n       Whereas the human rights situation in Somalia has \n     dramatically worsened over the past several years with \n     increased numbers of killings, torture, kidnappings, and \n     rape;\n       Whereas the 2009 Department of State Country Terrorism \n     Report notes that ``Somalia's fragile transitional Federal \n     government, protracted state of violent instability, its \n     long, unguarded coastline, porous borders, and proximity to \n     the Arabian Peninsula, made the country an attractive \n     location for international terrorists seeking a transit or \n     launching point for operations in Somalia or elsewhere'';\n       Whereas the situation in southern and central Somalia, \n     particularly the activity of al Shabaab, poses direct threats \n     to the stability of Puntland and Somaliland regions, as well \n     as the stability of neighboring states and the wider region;\n       Whereas al Shabaab leaders have stated their intent to \n     provide recruits and support for al Qaeda in the Arabian \n     Peninsula in Yemen;\n       Whereas the Government of Eritrea has provided military and \n     financial support for armed opposition groups, including al \n     Shebaab, in part as a proxy front in its continuing tensions \n     with Ethiopia;\n       Whereas, according to the most recent report by the United \n     Nations Somalia Monitoring Group, arms, ammunitions, and \n     military or dual-use equipment continue to enter Somalia at a \n     fairly steady rate, primarily from Yemen and Ethiopia;\n       Whereas, in July 2009, the Department of State confirmed \n     that, in addition to other support for the TFG, it had \n     provided cash to purchase weapons and ammunitions for the \n     TFG's efforts ``to repel the onslaught of extremist forces \n     which are intent on destroying the Djibouti peace process'';\n       Whereas, according to most recent report by the United \n     Nations Somalia Monitoring Group, ``[d]espite infusions of \n     foreign training and assistance, government security forces \n     remain ineffective, disorganized and corrupt--a composite of \n     independent militias loyal to senior government officials and \n     military officers who profit from the business of war and \n     resist their integration under a single command'';\n       Whereas, on April 24, 2010, President Barack Obama issued \n     an executive order to sanction or freeze the assets of \n     militants who threaten, both directly and indirectly, the \n     stability of Somalia, as well as individuals involved in \n     piracy off Somalia's coast;\n       Whereas, in March 2009, at a hearing of the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Government Affairs of the Senate, \n     Andrew Liepman, Deputy Director of Intelligence at the \n     National Counterterrorism Center, noted that ``[s]ince 2006, \n     a number of U.S. citizens [have] traveled to Somalia, \n     possibly to train in extremist training camps'';\n       Whereas, in September 2009, at a hearing of the Committee \n     on Homeland Security and Government Affairs of the Senate, \n     the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Michael \n     Leiter testified that ``the potential for al-Qaeda operatives \n     in Somalia to commission Americans to return to the United \n     States and launch attacks against the Homeland remains of \n     significant concern''; and\n       Whereas the extraordinary and ongoing crisis in Somalia has \n     enormous humanitarian consequences and direct national \n     security implications for the United States and our allies in \n     the region: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the urgency of addressing the threats to \n     United States national security in Somalia and the conditions \n     that foster those threats;\n       (2) reaffirms its commitment to stand with all the people \n     of Somalia who aspire to a future free of terrorism and \n     violence through advancing political reconciliation and \n     building legitimate and inclusive governance institutions;\n       (3) recognizes the difficult, but very important, work \n     being done by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) \n     to help secure parts of Mogadishu, and reaffirms its support \n     for the mission;\n       (4) calls on the Transitional Federal Government in \n     Somalia--\n       (A) to cease immediately any use of child soldiers;\n       (B) to ensure better accountability and transparency for \n     all received security assistance;\n       (C) to renew its commitment to political reconciliation; \n     and\n       (D) to take necessary steps toward becoming a more \n     legitimate and inclusive government in the eyes of the people \n     of Somalia;\n       (5) calls on all actors and governments in the region, \n     particularly the Government of Eritrea, to play a productive \n     role in helping to bring about peace and stability to \n     Somalia, including ceasing to provide any financial or \n     material support to armed opposition groups in Somalia;\n       (6) welcomes efforts by the President to bring greater \n     focus and resources toward understanding and monitoring the \n     situation in Somalia;\n       (7) urges the President to develop a comprehensive strategy \n     to ensure that all United States humanitarian, diplomatic, \n     political, and counterterrorism programs in Somalia and the \n     wider Horn of Africa are coordinated and making progress \n     toward the long-term goal of establishing stability, respect \n     for human rights, and functional, inclusive governance in \n     Somalia;\n       (8) urges the President and Secretary of State, as part of \n     a comprehensive strategy--\n       (A) to provide greater support for a range of diplomatic \n     initiatives to engage clan leaders, business leaders, and \n     civil society leaders in Somalia and the Somali Diaspora in \n     political reconciliation and consensus-building;\n       (B) to ensure better oversight, monitoring, and \n     transparency of all United States security assistance \n     provided to the TFG;\n       (C) to increase and strengthen the United States diplomatic \n     team working on Somalia, including the appointment of a \n     senior envoy,\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\n     and to ensure that these officials have the necessary \n     resources, access, and mandate;\n       (D) to pursue opportunities for periodic, temporary United \n     States Government travel to Somalia, consistent with any \n     security concerns;\n       (E) to expand and deepen our engagement with the regions of \n     Somaliland and Puntland and other regional administrations in \n     order to promote good governance, effective law enforcement, \n     respect for human rights, and stability in these regions;\n       (F) to explore, in consultation with the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, increased options for pressuring individuals, \n     governments, and other actors who undertake economic \n     activities that support armed opposition groups and violence \n     in Somalia; and\n       (G) to develop, in consultation with the Administrator of \n     the United States Agency for International Development, \n     creative and flexible mechanisms for delivering basic \n     humanitarian assistance to the people of Somalia while \n     minimizing the risk of significant diversion to armed \n     opposition groups.\n\n

and\n       (D) does not extend credit support to loans that exceed a \n     principal amount of $20,000,000.\n       (d) Additional Considerations.--In making a determination \n     that a State other credit support program is eligible for \n     Federal contributions to, or for the account of, the State \n     program, the Secretary shall take into account the following \n     additional considerations:\n       (1) The anticipated benefits to the State, its businesses, \n     and its residents to be derived from the Federal \n     contributions to, or for the account of, the approved State \n     other credit support program, including the extent to which \n     resulting small business lending will expand economic \n     opportunities.\n       (2) The operational capacity, skills, and experience of the \n     management team of the State other credit support program.\n       (3) The capacity of the State other credit support program \n     to manage increases in the volume of its small business \n     lending.\n       (4) The internal accounting and administrative controls \n     systems of the State other credit support program, and the \n     extent to which they can provide reasonable assurance that \n     funds of the State program are safeguarded against waste, \n     loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation.\n       (5) The soundness of the program design and implementation \n     plan of the State other credit support program.\n       (e) Federal Contributions to Approved State Other Credit \n     Support Programs.--A State other credit support program \n     approved under this section will be eligible for receiving \n     Federal contributions to, or for the account of, the State \n     program in an amount consistent with the schedule describing \n     the apportionment of allocated Federal funds among State \n     programs delivered by the State to the Secretary under the \n     allocation agreement.\n       (f) Minimum Program Requirements for State Other Credit \n     Support Programs.--\n       (1) Fund to prescribe.--The Secretary shall, by regulation \n     or other guidance, prescribe Program requirements for \n     approved State other credit support programs.\n       (2) Considerations for fund.--In prescribing minimum \n     Program requirements for approved State other credit support \n     programs, the Secretary shall take into consideration, to the \n     extent the Secretary determines applicable and appropriate, \n     the minimum Program requirements for approved State capital \n     access programs in section 3205(e).\n\n     SEC. 3207.

and\n       (D) does not extend credit support to loans that exceed a \n     principal amount of $20,000,000.\n       (d) Additional Considerations.--In making a determination \n     that a State other credit support program is eligible for \n     Federal contributions to, or for the account of, the State \n     program, the Secretary shall take into account the following \n     additional considerations:\n       (1) The anticipated benefits to the State, its businesses, \n     and its residents to be derived from the Federal \n     contributions to, or for the account of, the approved State \n     other credit support program, including the extent to which \n     resulting small business lending will expand economic \n     opportunities.\n       (2) The operational capacity, skills, and experience of the \n     management team of the State other credit support program.\n       (3) The capacity of the State other credit support program \n     to manage increases in the volume of its small business \n     lending.\n       (4) The internal accounting and administrative controls \n     systems of the State other credit support program, and the \n     extent to which they can provide reasonable assurance that \n     funds of the State program are safeguarded against waste, \n     loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation.\n       (5) The soundness of the program design and implementation \n     plan of the State other credit support program.\n       (e) Federal Contributions to Approved State Other Credit \n     Support Programs.--A State other credit support program \n     approved under this section will be eligible for receiving \n     Federal contributions to, or for the account of, the State \n     program in an amount consistent with the schedule describing \n     the apportionment of allocated Federal funds among State \n     programs delivered by the State to the Secretary under the \n     allocation agreement.\n       (f) Minimum Program Requirements for State Other Credit \n     Support Programs.--\n       (1) Fund to prescribe.--The Secretary shall, by regulation \n     or other guidance, prescribe Program requirements for \n     approved State other credit support programs.\n       (2) Considerations for fund.--In prescribing minimum \n     Program requirements for approved State other credit support \n     programs, the Secretary shall take into consideration, to the \n     extent the Secretary determines applicable and appropriate, \n     the minimum Program requirements for approved State capital \n     access programs in section 3205(e).\n\n     SEC. 3207.

Changes in the amount of small business lending \n     shall be measured against the average amount of small \n     business lending reported by the eligible institution in its \n     call reports for the 4 full quarters immediately preceding \n     the date of enactment of this Act, minus adjustments from \n     each quarterly balance in respect of--\n\n       (I) net loan charge offs with respect to small business \n     lending; and\n       (II) gains realized by the eligible institution resulting \n     from mergers, acquisitions or purchases of loans after \n     origination and syndication; which adjustments shall be \n     determined in accordance with guidance promulgated by the \n     Secretary; and\n\n       (iii) during any calendar quarter during the initial 2-year \n     period referred to in clause (ii), an institution's rate \n     shall be adjusted to reflect the following schedule, based on \n     that institution's change in the amount of small business \n     lending relative to the baseline--\n\n       (I) if the amount of small business lending has increased \n     by less than 2.5 percent, the dividend or interest rate shall \n     be 5 percent;\n       (II) if the amount of small business lending has increased \n     by 2.5 percent or greater, but by less than 5.0 percent, the \n     dividend or interest rate shall be 4 percent;\n       (III) if the amount of small business lending has increased \n     by 5.0 percent or greater, but by less than 7.5 percent, the \n     dividend or interest rate shall be 3 percent;\n       (IV) if the amount of small business lending has increased \n     by 7.5 percent or greater, and but by less than 10.0 percent, \n     the dividend or interest rate shall be 2 percent; or\n       (V) if the amount of small business lending has increased \n     by 10 percent or greater, the dividend or interest rate shall \n     be 1 percent.\n\n       (B) Basis of initial rate.--The initial dividend or \n     interest rate shall be based on call report data published in \n     the quarter immediately preceding the date of the capital \n     investment under the Program.\n       (C) Timing of rate adjustments.--Any rate adjustment shall \n     occur in the calendar quarter following the publication of \n     call report data, such that the rate based on call report \n     data from any one calendar quarter, which is published in the \n     first following calendar quarter, shall be adjusted in that \n     first following calendar quarter and payable in the second \n     following quarter.\n       (D) Rate following initial 2-year period.--Generally, the \n     rate based on call report data from the eighth calendar \n     quarter after the date of the capital investment under the \n     Program shall be payable until the expiration of the 4\\1/2\\-\n     year period that begins on the date of the investment. In the \n     case where the amount of small business lending has remained \n     the same or decreased relative to the institution's baseline \n     in the eighth quarter after the date of the capital \n     investment under the Program, the rate shall be 7 percent \n     until the expiration of the 4\\1/2\\-year period that begins on \n     the date of the investment.\n       (E) Rate following initial 4\\1/2\\ -year period.--The \n     dividend or interest rate paid on any preferred stock or \n     other financial instrument issued by an eligible institution \n     that receives a capital investment under the Program shall \n     increase to 9 percent at the end of the 4\\1/2\\-year period \n     that begins on the date of the capital investment under the \n     Program.\n       (F) Limitation on rate reductions with respect to certain \n     amount.--The reduction in the dividend or interest rate \n     payable to Treasury by any eligible institution shall be \n     limited such that the rate reduction shall not apply to a \n     dollar amount of the investment made by Treasury that is \n     greater than the dollar amount increase in the amount of \n     small business lending realized under this program. The \n     Secretary may issue guidelines that will apply to new capital \n     investments limiting the amount of capital available to \n     eligible institutions consistent with this limitation.\n       (G) Rate adjustments for s corporation.--Before making a \n     capital investment in an eligible institution that is an S \n     corporation or a corporation organized on a mutual basis, the \n     Secretary may adjust the dividend or interest rate on the \n     financial instrument to be issued to the Secretary, from the \n     dividend or interest rate that would apply under \n     subparagraphs (A) through (F), to take into account any \n     differential tax treatment of securities issued by such \n     eligible institution. For purpose of this subparagraph, the \n     term ``S corporation'' has the same meaning as in section \n     1361(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (H) Repayment deadline.--The capital investment received by \n     an eligible institution under the Program shall be evidenced \n     by preferred stock or other financial instrument that--\n       (i) includes, as a term and condition, that the capital \n     investment will--\n\n       (I) be repaid not later than the end of the 10-year period \n     beginning on the date of the capital investment under the \n     Program; or\n       (II) at the end of such 10-year period, be subject to such \n     additional terms as the Secretary shall prescribe, which \n     shall include a requirement that the stock or instrument \n     shall carry the highest dividend or interest rate payable; \n     and\n\n       (ii) provides that the term and condition described under \n     clause (i) shall not apply if the application of that term \n     and condition would adversely affect the capital treatment of \n     the stock or financial instrument under current or successor \n     applicable capital provisions compared to a capital \n     instrument with identical terms other than the term and \n     condition described under clause (i).\n       (I) Requirements on financial instruments issued by a \n     community development financial institution loan fund.--Any \n     equity equivalent capital issued to the Treasury by a \n     community development loan fund receiving a capital \n     investment under the Program shall provide that the rate at \n     which interest is payable shall be 2 percent per annum for 8 \n     years.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Each year, many people in the United States are injured \n     by defective products manufactured or produced by foreign \n     entities and imported into the United States.\n       (2) Both consumers and businesses in the United States have \n     been harmed by injuries to people in the United States caused \n     by defective products manufactured or produced by foreign \n     entities.\n       (3) People in the United States injured by defective \n     products manufactured or produced by foreign entities often \n     have difficulty recovering damages from the foreign \n     manufacturers and producers responsible for such injuries.\n       (4) The difficulty described in paragraph (3) is caused by \n     the obstacles in bringing a foreign manufacturer or producer \n     into a United States court and subsequently enforcing a \n     judgment against that manufacturer or producer.\n       (5) Obstacles to holding a responsible foreign manufacturer \n     or producer liable for an injury to a person in the United \n     States undermine the purpose of the tort laws of the United \n     States.\n       (6) The difficulty of applying the tort laws of the United \n     States to foreign manufacturers and producers puts United \n     States manufacturers and producers at a competitive \n     disadvantage because United States manufacturers and \n     producers must--\n       (A) abide by common law and statutory safety standards; and\n       (B) invest substantial resources to ensure that they do so.\n       (7) Foreign manufacturers and producers can avoid the \n     expenses necessary to make their products safe if they know \n     that they will not be held liable for violations of United \n     States product safety laws.\n       (8) Businesses in the United States undertake numerous \n     commercial relationships with foreign manufacturers, exposing \n     the businesses to additional tort liability when foreign \n     manufacturers or producers evade United States courts.\n       (9) Businesses in the United States engaged in commercial \n     relationships with foreign manufacturers or producers often \n     cannot vindicate their contractual rights if such \n     manufacturers or producers seek to avoid responsibility in \n     United States courts.\n       (10) One of the major obstacles facing businesses and \n     individuals in the United States who are injured and who seek \n     compensation for economic or personal injuries caused by \n     foreign manufacturers and producers is the challenge of \n     serving process on such manufacturers and producers.\n       (11) An individual or business injured in the United States \n     by a foreign company must rely on a foreign government to \n     serve process when that company is located in a country that \n     is a signatory to the Convention on the Service Abroad of \n     Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial \n     Matters done at The Hague November 15, 1965 (20 UST 361; TIAS \n     6638).\n       (12) An injured person in the United States must rely on \n     the cumbersome system of letters rogatory to effect service \n     in a country that did not sign the Convention on the Service \n     Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or \n     Commercial Matters. These countries do not have an \n     enforceable obligation to serve process as requested.\n       (13) The procedures described in paragraphs (11) and (12) \n     add time and expense to litigation in the United States, \n     thereby discouraging or frustrating meritorious lawsuits \n     brought by persons injured in the United States against \n     foreign manufacturers and producers.\n       (14) Foreign manufacturers and producers often seek to \n     avoid judicial consideration of their actions by asserting \n     that United States courts lack personal jurisdiction over \n     them.\n       (15) The due process clauses of the fifth amendment to and \n     section 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution \n     govern United States courts' personal jurisdiction over \n     defendants.\n\n[[Page S5622]]\n\n       (16) The due process clauses described in paragraph (15) \n     are satisfied when a defendant consents to the jurisdiction \n     of a court.\n       (17) United States markets present many opportunities for \n     foreign manufacturers.\n       (18) In choosing to export products to the United States, a \n     foreign manufacturer or producer subjects itself to the laws \n     of the United States. Such a foreign manufacturer or producer \n     thereby acknowledges that it is subject to the personal \n     jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in at least one \n     State.\n\n     SEC. 4002. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) foreign manufacturers and producers whose products are \n     sold in the United States should not be able to avoid \n     liability simply because of difficulties relating to serving \n     process upon them;\n       (2) to avoid such lack of accountability, foreign \n     manufacturers and producers of foreign products distributed \n     in the United States should be required, by regulation, to \n     register an agent in the United States who is authorized to \n     accept service of process for such manufacturer or producer;\n       (3) it is unfair to United States consumers and businesses \n     that foreign manufacturers and producers often seek to avoid \n     judicial consideration of their actions by asserting that \n     United States courts lack personal jurisdiction over them;\n       (4) those who benefit from exporting products to United \n     States markets should expect to be subject to the \n     jurisdiction of at least one court within the United States;\n       (5) exporting products to the United States should be \n     understood as consent to the accountability that the legal \n     system of the United States ensures for all manufacturers and \n     producers, foreign, and domestic;\n       (6) exporters recognize the scope of opportunities \n     presented to them by United States markets but also should \n     recognize that products imported into the United States must \n     satisfy Federal and State safety standards established by \n     statute, regulation, and common law;\n       (7) foreign manufacturers should recognize that they are \n     responsible for the contracts they enter into with United \n     States companies;\n       (8) foreign manufacturers should act responsibly and \n     recognize that they operate within the constraints of the \n     United States legal system when they export products to the \n     United States;\n       (9) United States laws and the laws of United States \n     trading partners should not put burdens on foreign \n     manufacturers and producers that do not apply to domestic \n     companies;\n       (10) it is fair to ensure that foreign manufacturers, whose \n     products are distributed in commerce in the United States, \n     are subject to the jurisdiction of State and Federal courts \n     in at least one State because all United States manufacturers \n     are subject to the jurisdiction of the State and Federal \n     courts in at least one State; and\n       (11) it should be understood that, by registering an agent \n     for service of process in the United States, the foreign \n     manufacturer or producer acknowledges consent to the \n     jurisdiction of the State in which the registered agent is \n     located.\n\n     SEC. 4003.
