Madam President, I listened to the majority leader. He \ndid have a pretty good summary of the amendments we are aware of at the \nmoment, all of which are significant. It is good that we will have a \nchance to get a vote on most or all of those.\n  During his campaign, the President said he would not sign any non \nemergency spending until the American people had at least 5 days to \nreview it on the White House Web site.\n  So there is no reason for us to rush through this Omnibus \nappropriations bill when the White House has already promised it won't \nsign it without the requisite 5-day review.\n  Besides, we have known about the Friday deadline for months so any \npressure to rush this bill is completely manufactured.\n  The responsible way forward is not to rush through another giant \nbill, but for the House to prepare a short-term CR so we have time to \nstudy and debate the Omnibus on the floor.\n  Back in January, Republicans urged the President to move the Omnibus \nbefore the stimulus. It is now obvious why.\n  The Omnibus contains funds for 122 programs that were already funded \nin the stimulus. It also represents an 8 percent increase over last \nyear's regular appropriations, twice the rate of inflation.\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\n  What all this means is that at a time when most Americans are \ntightening their belts, Washington is going out and buying a bigger \none.\n  Just consider the deficit. When we passed the last CR, the deficit \nwas $460 billion. In January, the CBO estimated this year's deficit \nwould be $1.2 trillion. Now after the past month, we expect the deficit \nto be $1.6 trillion.\n  Now consider some of the recent spending we have done or are \ncontemplating doing around here. Some of us are still dizzy from the $1 \ntrillion stimulus. We are trying to conceptualize the $3.6 trillion \nbudget the President sent us last week. We are bracing for the \npotentially quarter-trillion housing plan that goes into effect \ntomorrow, and we are thinking about the $1 to $2 trillion we expect to \nbe asked to spend on the financial sector.\n  So we won't be rushed to spend another $410 billion without the \nrequisite review.\n  We need to slow down and make sure the American people understand how \nwe intend to spend their tax dollars. The Omnibus is a massive bill \nthat demands our close attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/03/senate-section/article/S2650-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2650-S2651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to address some of the comments \nmade by the Republican leader.\n  First, the bill that is being considered was on the official public \nWeb site of the House of Representatives a week ago. It has been \navailable for at least that period of time. As a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, most of the contents of what we are \nconsidering were passed by the committee last year in October and \nNovember. To argue that this is a surprise is wrong. It has been \navailable for scrutiny, for review, for a long period. That is why many \nof us believe we should move forward with it as quickly as possible.\n  Second, this argument that the stimulus, which was supposed to be \nadditive, to put money into the economy that otherwise would not go \ninto the economy, is a reason not to pass this bill is to ignore the \nobvious. This bill funds the Government. This bill makes certain that \nwhen it comes to the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, \nEnergy, related issues, financial services, Interior, Labor, EPA, State \nDepartment, Transportation, Homeland Security, and so many others, we \nare going to provide for the basic appropriations and budgets for these \nagencies.\n  I understand--I hope all Senators understand--that these agencies \nneed to do their work, whether or not the economy is strong. We need to \nbe putting this money into these agencies to continue their ordinary \nbusiness. That is essential.\n  I also am troubled every day to hear a chorus from the Republican \nside of the aisle about deficits. Let's remember the facts. When \nPresident Bill Clinton left office, he had managed to balance the \nbudget each year for 3 years. He left to President George W. Bush a \nsurplus. At that point, the debt of the United States, accumulated from \nthe beginning of the Republic until that moment, was about $5 trillion. \nPresident George W. Bush was handed an economy that was strong, a \nbudget surplus, and a national debt of $5 trillion. Eight years later, \nwe all know the state of the economy. We certainly know that the \nnational debt under George W. Bush doubled. It went from $5 to $10 \ntrillion in a matter of 8 years.\n  We know what happened. When it came to the budgets, the Republicans \nand President Bush decided they would use a little sleight of hand. Do \nyou know how much money was included in the budgets of President Bush \nfor the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? The answer is zero. Every year \nthey would take the cost of these wars off the budget and say: It is \nemergency spending so we are not going to budget for it. So not only \ndid they double the national debt, not only did they drive us deeply \ninto deficit each year, they did it in a way that most of us would \nagree was at least concealment, instead of being honest and open with \nthe people.\n  Now comes President Obama, inherits an economic recession, the likes \nof which this country has not seen for 75 years. He says we have to \nmove and move quickly with the stimulus package. In 3 weeks and 2 days \nafter being sworn in as President, he passes it, thanks to three \nRepublican Senators who finally would join with us in moving forward to \ndo something about the economy rather than only complain. Then he says \nwe need to pass the ordinary budget which was not passed under the \nprevious administration. That is what this bill is.\n  I urge colleagues to take a look at this as undone business from the \nprevious administration and the previous Congress that we have to get \ndone this week while the temporary spending measures for our Government \ncontinue.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The minority leader indicated somehow or suggested that \nthis is some new information, some large piece of legislation brought \nto the floor of the Senate without much scrutiny. Isn't it the case \nthat the appropriations bills that are included in this omnibus were \npassed out of each individual subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee, most of them worked on for months, then passed out of the \nsubcommittee, and then worked on in the full committee and, in most \ncases, passed unanimously by Republicans and Democrats? This is the \nnormal funding of Federal agencies that should have been done last \nyear. It wasn't, for a lot of reasons. It is now being packaged into an \nomnibus bill to get done. But the ingredients of that bill are not \nsomething new.\n  Isn't it the case that most of these individual bills were passed in \na bipartisan basis, many of them unanimously, after having been worked \non for some months? There is nothing strange in here, is there?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response to the Senator from North Dakota through the \nChair, he is a fellow member of the Appropriations Committee. He has \ndescribed the process exactly. The small, relatively small \nappropriation which I manage in the Senate Appropriations Committee \nincludes a plus up, an increase in the funding for several key \nagencies, one of which is the Securities and Exchange Commission. If \none watched ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday night and heard about Bernard \nMadoff and criticisms of the SEC dropping the ball, not hearing the \nwhistle being blown, we have to change that. We have to make sure the \nSEC is a regulatory agency that has the resources it needs to deal with \nan ever-expanding area of jurisdiction. The same thing is true for the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission which also deals with futures \nand derivatives and the like. We have to make certain they have \nresources, and they have an increase in this budget to be the policemen \non the beat. I put money in there as well for the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission. It was not that long ago we were frightened by the \nprospect of lead toys that might endanger our children. This agency is \nfinally growing into the 21st century responsibility it has.\n  These are areas where we have increased funding so that government \ncan be vigilant and helpful and we can avoid economic disasters so that \ninvestors' and savers' money can be carefully reviewed.\n  This was all debated in the subcommittee. It was brought forward in \nthe full committee. In most cases it received full committee review \nmonths ago. Today we are trying to get the homework we should have done \nlast year done and moved forward. We have so many important things to \ndo.\n  I will speak for a minute or two more, if I may, on a related issue.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Illinois will excuse me and \nrespond to an additional question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The point that is going to be discussed on the floor \ntoday and this week on this appropriations bill is very important. I \njust received the votes on the individual bills that have now been \npackaged together. If I might read them, the appropriations bill for \nAgriculture, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, nutrition \nprograms, farm programs, and so on, passed 29 to\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\n0 by the full Appropriations Committee. That passed on July 18 of last \nyear. Commerce, Justice, and Science passed, on June 19, 29 to 0, funds \nfor Justice programs and so on. Energy and Water, which is the \nsubcommittee I chair, passed 29 to 0. Financial Services passed, 29 to \n0. Homeland Security passed 29 to 0. Virtually all of them passed \nunanimously.\n\n  To give you an example, in my subcommittee--that passed it \nunanimously, with Republicans and Democrats, by the subcommittee and \nthe full Appropriations Committee--I, for example, in one account cut \n$100 million. Why? Because I felt that was not needed. I cut from \nprevious years' expenditures $100 million. Now, if this piece of \nlegislation fails, that extra $100 million is going to be spent by that \naccount. It shouldn't be, in my judgment, but will be.\n  I used some of that money to increase carbon capture so we can \nprotect the environment and continue to use coal. We have to find a way \nto capture carbon and decarbonize the use of coal. I invested some of \nthat money in carbon capture research and technology. But these are the \nkinds of things that if we defeat this legislation--we have what is \ncalled a continuing resolution. That will be the first amendment this \nmorning. That continuing resolution means we are effectively on \nautopilot, and the things that have been cut, the spending that has \nbeen cut in these subcommittees, and the spending that has been added \nbecause things need doing, that will be voided and we will instead be \non an autopilot with previous years' judgments having prevailed when, \nin fact, all these bills passed the subcommittee, with the exception, I \nbelieve, of two of them. One was 28 ``yes'' and 1 ``no'' by the full \nAppropriations Committee, and the other was 26 ``yes'' and 3 ``no.'' \nWith those two exceptions, every other piece of legislation that is \nincluded in this omnibus was passed unanimously by Republicans and \nDemocrats in the full Appropriations Committee of the Senate.\n  Isn't it the case that to suggest somehow this is some mysterious \nbill that has not been seen, has not been considered, has not been \nheard, has not been reviewed--that is just not the case. This has been \navailable since last June and July, and most of it passed unanimously \non a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response to the Senator from North Dakota, through the \nChair, what has changed? To have the Republican leader come before us \ntoday and say: Well, this has not been on the Web site of the Senate \nfor the requisite 5 days, when I mentioned it has been on the House Web \nsite for 7 days, it has passed the House in its entirety.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota indicated, it has been debated at \nlength and passed unanimously, for the most part--Democrats and \nRepublicans--without objection, voting for all the contents. And now \nthere is objection from the Republican side of the aisle.\n  The obvious question is, What has changed? What is different? Well, \nthere is only one thing different. We have a new President, a new \nPresident and a new administration, facing an economic struggle, a \nPresident who is asking for help from both sides of the aisle that we \nshould give. We need to work together. He was not successful in finding \nHouse Republicans to support him in the efforts for the stimulus \npackage. Only a handful voted for this measure when it came up in the \nHouse on the Republican side. We are hoping that at least some will \nfinally step forward on the Republican side to pass this bill to keep \nthe Government operating.\n  What good does it do for us to shortchange the Securities and \nExchange Commission at this moment in history, when we all know our \nsavings, our retirement investments, 401(k)s, IRAs, are in peril \nbecause of a descending stock market, where there is question about the \nconfidence that consumers, investors have in this agency? I put \nadditional funds in there, through my appropriation, to make certain we \nhave the integrity which we deserve in this marketplace; the same for \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  Those who would argue, as Senator McCain does in his continuing \nresolution amendment, that we do not need additional resources in these \nkey agencies that protect investors and savers, they are just plain \nwrong. A vote for the McCain amendment is a vote to go back further to \nthose days when these agencies were not up to the challenges they face. \nSome of that was conscious, where they ignored demands and warnings \nrelated to Mr. Madoff and others. Some was inadvertent in the CFTC, \nwhere they did not have the people and the equipment and the computers \nand the technology to follow these trades.\n  How in the world can we, in good conscience, say we are not going to \nadequately fund these agencies, while millions of American families \ncount on us to do that? They make the choice on investments. They trust \nus to make certain those investments are transparent and there is \naccountability.\n  I would say to my friend from North Dakota, when we went through \nthis, month after month, week after week, day after day in the \ncommittee, we had bipartisan support all the way. Now that we have a \nnew President of a different political party, the other side of the \naisle is raising questions--questions they did not raise for 8 months. \nNow they are being raised. That is unfortunate. But we are prepared to \nanswer those questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/03/senate-section/article/S2651-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2651-S2652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HOUSING CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to close with one brief \nstatement, if I can, on the housing crisis we are facing.\n  Yesterday, I was in a neighborhood of Chicago named Albany Park. It \nis one of the most diverse neighborhoods on the north side of our city. \nI went into this neighborhood on Kedzie Avenue to meet in front of a \nhouse that had been boarded up going through mortgage foreclosure. A \nlot of families gathered around, families who live in the neighborhood. \nAnd they looked like America--Black, White, and Brown--all standing \nthere with their neat little homes all around this one foreclosed \nbuilding. The building was partially boarded up. Windows were broken. \nThe neighbors were outraged that this mortgage foreclosure has resulted \nin an empty building, which is now being vandalized and turned into a \ndrug haven.\n  You would be angry, too, if it were in your neighborhood. These folks \nwho care for their lawns, care for their kids, make sure their mortgage \npayments are paid on time, want to know what we are doing about \nmortgage foreclosures in this country. The honest answer is, We are \ndoing little or nothing.\n  We have to change that. For 2 years now. I have tried to pass one \nsimple measure that would change the Bankruptcy Code and say that a \nbankruptcy judge can, at the last resort, for those who end up in \nbankruptcy with a mortgage foreclosure, take a look at the terms of the \nmortgage and change those terms. That is not a radical idea. Currently, \nthe judge can do that for a second home, a farm, a ranch, but they \ncannot do it for your primary residence. I cannot explain why, but that \nis a fact.\n  Now we have primary residences across America that are being \nsubjected to mortgage foreclosure. Initially, it was because of the \nsubprime mortgages with those exotic finance deals that fell apart when \nthe mortgage was reset. Now more and more homes going into foreclosure \nhad fixed-rate mortgages, did not have subprimes, and we are seeing the \nbottom fall out of the housing market.\n  It is estimated one out of four mortgage holders in America are \npaying more principal on their mortgage than the value of their home. \nThey are underwater, as they say. What are we going to do about it? \nWell, for a long time we said: We will trust the banks, the sanctity of \nthe contract. They will work on it. They will negotiate. It has not \nhappened. As a result, we have record numbers of mortgage foreclosures. \nThe housing market is in a tailspin. No homes are being built, \nobviously. Most homes end up vacant on the rolls of the bank and become \neyesores in a neighborhood.\n  What I am suggesting is, we have to be honest. We tried to let the \nbanks and the mortgage bankers run this situation for the last year and \nthey have failed and failed miserably. If we do not take control of \nthis situation, if we do not have the bankruptcy court as the last \nresort that can ultimately change the terms of the mortgage, with \nreasonable limits--I am prepared to accept reasonable limits; there \nwill not\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\nbe any prospective use of this; only those existing mortgages today--\nthat is the only way to come to the bottom of this crisis.\n  We are working with these financial institutions to try to find \nreasonable terms to work this out, but we have not had a lot of luck. \nCitigroup stepped forward. We reached an agreement with them. We are \ntrying to reach an agreement with others. But for the mortgage bankers, \nwho brought us into this mess, to still hold this Congress enthralled, \nto hold us hostage to their so-called sanctity of contract, is to \nignore the obvious.\n  If they have their way, there will be a continued crisis of mortgage \nforeclosures, the recession will get worse instead of better, and \nneighborhoods such as Albany Park will disintegrate, deteriorate \nbecause of the foreclosures of homes in the neighborhood. Renters who \ndutifully pay their rent show up one day to be told: Oh, incidentally, \nyour landlord defaulted on the mortgage and now you are going to be \nthrown out on the street. Over and over again, and it is totally \nunfair.\n  We have to do something. I am glad the House is going to take up this \nmeasure. We need to move on it. We waited a year.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11:45 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from Hawaii or their designees on \namendment No. 592.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I will be brief this morning, but I wish to make a couple points. The \nappropriations bill that is on the floor of the Senate represents the \nbills that were not completed last year but were worked through in the \nindividual subcommittees, and the full Appropriations Committee of the \nSenate, passed, as I indicated earlier, almost unanimously, for every \npiece of legislation, by all Republicans and all Democrats in the \nAppropriations Committee. So it is not as if there is something strange \nhere.\n  The question is, Do we want to pass an appropriations bill, at least \nfor the last half of this year, that funds the agencies the way \nCongress has determined they should be funded? Or do we want to defeat \nthis bill and go on autopilot and say: Whatever was done last year, \nthat is what we will do next year. That does not make much sense to me. \nWhat we might have done last year should be judged on the basis: Did it \nwork? Did it not work? Where are the increases we probably ought to \nmake some additional appropriations for? Or where are some areas that \nought to be cut?\n  All these things represent a matter of judgment by Members of the \nSenate and particularly members of the Appropriations Committee who are \nfunding the individual agencies.\n  I mentioned, a moment ago, there is an account I cut in the \nsubcommittee I chair by $100 million because I felt it was not needed \nin the coming fiscal year, and I would move that $100 million to fund \nsomething else I thought was very important. Well, that is the kind of \nthing that will not exist if we decide: Whatever was spent last year in \nall those accounts, that is what we will spend going forward. That is \ndevoid of any kind of judgment at all.\n  Let me mention some areas we have felt should be increased. I will \ngive you some examples. One is the funding to prepare for a potential \npandemic flu. Obviously, it is a very significant issue. This country \nneeds to be prepared in the event we suffer in our lifetimes a pandemic \nflu. An influenza, pandemic epidemic that would move around this world \nwould be very serious, kill a lot of people. The need to be prepared \nfor that is very important. There are funds available in this \nlegislation to begin that preparation.\n  The efforts to improve the warning systems to notify communities \nabout severe weather: This deals with the funding that is necessary for \nthe next-generation satellites. This is not just something that is \nconvenient. When killer storms and hurricanes and other things are \nthreatening population centers, it is a need to have the very finest \ncapability to warn people. This is the money that is needed to continue \nthat progress in improving warning systems through the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration weather and climate satellites. That is \nin this bill to continue that work.\n  In my subcommittee, nonproliferation programs--and that is the issue \nof trying to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the programs we \nhave to try to prevent terrorist groups from acquiring the kind of \nmaterial with which they can produce nuclear weapons--we provide \nfunding for that and increased funding for that, which is very \nnecessary. It is funding to the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, and it is critical to our efforts to secure weapons-\ngrade nuclear material around the world that even today, as I speak, \nterrorists are trying to acquire.\n  So that issue of nonproliferation--we have increased some funding for \nit. If we decide we are not going to proceed with the normal \nappropriations bills that have now been put in this omnibus and instead \nwe are going to go with a continuing resolution, that extra funding to \ntry to protect us and stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons is \ngone.\n  There are so many areas. The area of science: our National \nLaboratories. You know the Bell Labs, which used to be the jewels in \nour country of scientific inquiry and discovery, and all the \nunbelievable inventions and new knowledge, those labs are largely gone. \nNow our science laboratories in this country--and the three weapons \nlaboratories and the array of science laboratories--represent the \nrepository of the best and brightest Ph.D.s in physics and engineering \nand mathematics and so on. We have to keep our lead in the world in \nthese areas. This legislation provides the increased funding for our \nscience labs that our country has already made a decision to do. If we \ndo not go forward, then we go backward, we lose some of those best and \nbrightest scientists and engineers.\n  At one of our laboratories, we have something called the Roadrunner, \nwhich is the most powerful computer in the world.\n  That is not elsewhere; that is here in our country. They were telling \nme one day about the roadrunner, what is called a petaflop, which is a \nthousand teraflops. A teraflop is a computer that has capacity to do 1 \ntrillion distinct functions per second. That is a teraflop. We reached \nthat 11 years ago. Now we have done a thousand teraflops, or what is \ncalled a petaflop. One thousand trillion functions per second in this \nworld's most powerful computer. What can you do with that? Well, they \nare talking about studying the synapses--1 billion synapses of the \nbrain to work how it works together to produce what we call vision. We \ndon't know that. With supercomputing, the potential to know a lot of \nthings is breathtaking. That exists here. It is the most powerful \ncomputer in the world here.\n  We have to continue to keep our edge in science and knowledge and \ninvention. Part of that will be dependent upon how we fund our national \nlaboratories and whether we keep that group of scientists and engineers \nworking on these breathtaking inventions and the development of new \nknowledge. We can only do that if we continue the commitment we have \nmade to fund our science in our national laboratories.\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\n  Those are a few of the things I wanted to mention. Again, these were \nappropriation bills considered individually by a subcommittee of \nAppropriations, Republicans and Democrats, and then brought to the full \nCommittee on Appropriations, Republicans and Democrats, and passed in \nevery case, except two, unanimously, 29 to 0. In two cases, it was 26 \nto 3 and 28 to 1. Essentially, all of these pieces of legislation were \npassed unanimously. So when someone says, you know, this legislation is \nmysterious, new, and it has been thrust upon the Senate--that is not \ntrue. This legislation was prepared in June and July of last year. This \nCongress cannot continue to do appropriations this way.\n  The majority leader has made a commitment and one that I think makes \na lot of sense. This year, this has to stop. We bring individual \nappropriation bills to the floor, vote on them, go to conference, have \na conference report and send the bill to the President, one by one. \nThat is the way this should work. It didn't work last year, or the year \nbefore, that way. As a result, for the last 6 months of the year, we \nwere confronted with nine appropriation bills that were worked through \non a bipartisan basis last summer and now need to be enacted.\n  My hope is that the Senate, working its will this week, will do the \nright thing and pass what is, for the most part, bipartisan legislation \ndealing with funding for Homeland Security, Justice, Energy, and so \nmany different areas that are important to the functioning of our \nGovernment--and important to the American people as well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the time of the quorum call \nbe charged equally to both sides. We are in a time agreement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been listening to the various \ncolleagues on the Republican side who are continuing to be the party of \n``nope'' instead of the party of ``hope.'' I came to the floor to say \nthat it is very easy to say no to this and no to that. But I have to \ntell you, the American people need leadership. When you say ``nope, \nnope, nope,'' it means you are in fact endorsing the status quo, and \nthe status quo is a major problem.\n  I see my friend from Washington on the floor. I know she had intended \nto speak. I will be glad to stop at this time and ask unanimous consent \nthat following her remarks, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for \nyielding me time on this bill and thank her for her support as we move \nforward in a very critical time to cast a vote that is very important \nto all of our communities, and that is for the Omnibus appropriations \nbill from last year that is currently on the Senate floor.\n  Let me start by commending our leadership, our new committee \nchairman, Senator Inouye, and our vice chairman, Senator Cochran, who \nhave put this bill in front of us. This Omnibus appropriations bill \nbefore us that we are now debating is absolutely essential to every \ncommunity in our country, especially as we work to address this \neconomic crisis. Both of our Senators, Mr. Inouye and Mr. Cochran, have \nbeen very measured and evenhanded as we have brought this bill \ntogether, despite the many challenges we face. I thank them for their \nwork.\n  I chair the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and \nHousing. I rise today to urge all of my colleagues to support this very \nimportant Omnibus appropriations bill. As I said, this bill is \nessential to families and communities across our country. It enables \nus, our Government, to meet the needs for health care, for housing, to \nmake college more affordable, and to keep our communities safe. Just as \nimportant, our communities today are counting on us doing our job and \npassing this bill.\n  With this bill, we are fulfilling our commitments we made to them \nback in June and July of last year when these bills were marked up in \nour appropriations committees. Senator Byrd, who was the Appropriations \nCommittee chairman at the time, held four separate markup sessions. \nAlmost every committee member attended those sessions to debate and \nvote those appropriations bills out of committee. While, of course, not \nevery Senator agreed with every line in every bill, they were written \nwith the cooperation of our Republican colleagues. All of us had to \nmake compromises, but in the end each of these bills was reported out \nof the full committee either unanimously or with a very large \nbipartisan vote. That is because each of these bills represents a \nbipartisan consensus and stays within the budget resolution Congress \npassed earlier last year.\n  Our Republican colleagues were full participants when we negotiated \nthe final details of this with the House of Representatives. Therefore, \nthe omnibus bill we are debating today reflects many of the same \npriorities Democrats and Republicans alike approved last July.\n  Even so, our Federal agencies have now been operating under a \ncontinuing resolution for 5 months now, since this fiscal year began. \nWe cannot delay sending them this bill any longer. On Friday night of \nthis week, at midnight, if we do not pass this bill, funding for most \nof our Federal agencies will stop. It will stop and the money will be \ncut off. The Federal Government will come to a halt. I think about what \nthat means. Millions of Americans depend on this funding. We cannot \nafford to let politics stand in the way and risk a government shutdown, \nespecially not when we face the greatest economic challenge since the \nGreat Depression, not with so many of our Federal agencies working day \nand night to make sure the economic recovery bill we adopted last month \ncan meet the needs of our families across the country, and not when we \nknow communities across the Nation are desperate for help to keep \ntransportation and safety and housing and all the other programs moving \nforward.\n  As chair of the Transportation and Housing Subcommittee, I want to \ntake a little bit of time today to give some details about why this \nbill is so important to address the housing crisis and ensure the \ncontinued safety of our transportation system.\n  First of all, this bill is an essential part of our efforts to \nrestart the housing market. In the last several weeks, I have heard \nsome of my colleagues talk about how they want to focus on housing as \nwe repair this economy. We cannot fix the housing market without the \nprovisions in this omnibus bill.\n  Let me give just one example. Up until last year, the Federal Housing \nAdministration's market share for guaranteeing mortgages had dropped to \na low of 3 percent. But now that the mortgage industry is in crisis, \nlenders have turned back to the FHA in droves because they know it will \nbe reliable. Yet, under the terms of the continuing resolution, the FHA \nis prevented from helping willing and qualified buyers get mortgages \nbecause that agency cannot guarantee more than $185 billion a year. If \nwe do not pass the bill in front of us and raise that cap to a level \nabove $300 billion, our effort to restart the real estate and housing \nindustry is going to crash and burn. If any of us think it is hard to \nget a mortgage now, just watch that happen if we keep the FHA's loan \nvolume cap at last year's level.\n  If we fail to pass this bill, we are going to throw thousands of low-\nincome families out of stable, affordable\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\nhousing. In the last year alone, 3 million Americans lost their jobs. \nCommunities across this country are struggling to meet those needs. \nThis is absolutely the wrong time to unravel the safety net we have in \nplace. The 2009 omnibus bill would provide enough additional money to \nkeep up with inflation and keep the current tenant-based section 8 \nrecipients in their homes. If we have to keep the funding for that \nprogram flat, the consequences will be severe. It is estimated that as \nmany as 45,000 families will be turned out of their homes if we don't \npass this bill; that is, 45,000 families who would lose their housing \nand be forced to turn to relatives, shelters--wherever they can--for \nhelp. So this bill is critical to help us address the Nation's housing \nneeds.\n  But the omnibus is also essential to the safety of our airlines, our \nrailroads, our roads, and our bridges. All of us, I hope, are aware we \nface very serious challenges today because our air traffic controllers \nand our safety inspectors are retiring in very large numbers, leaving a \nlot of less-experienced people to fill their shoes. Those are the \npeople who help us land or take off at our airports, who make sure our \nplanes are safe. We have been working for several years to address this \ncrisis. This bill is going to make sure we can keep hiring new air \ntraffic controllers and safety inspectors so they can get the training \nand experience they need. This bill provides the money to fully fund \nsome of the safety personnel we brought on last year. I hope it is very \nclear to everyone how important it is to keep up these efforts. If we \ndo not pass this bill, not only will we be unable to hire new safety \npersonnel, but we are going to have to fire some of the people we hired \nlast year. We face a simple choice: We can hire and train new air \ntraffic controllers and address that huge gap in experience levels \nbetween the workers who are retiring and the new employers who are at \nour towers across the Nation or we can just let those shortfalls get \nworse. I think that is an investment we cannot afford to not make.\n  The same is true when it comes to the safety of the rest of our \ntransportation system. This omnibus bill provides critical investments \nin rail safety inspectors, truck safety inspectors, and pipeline \ninspectors.\n  Back in the fall, through the leadership of Senators Inouye and \nLautenberg and many others, the Senate passed a comprehensive rail \nsafety and Amtrak bill that was signed by President Bush. That bill \nlaid out a very new vision for a modernized national rail network and a \nnew safety system that requires adequate staffing at the Federal \nRailroad Administration. With this bill that is before us now, we begin \nto make those investments. It is not a moment too soon. In the last \ncouple of years, a record number of commuters have parked their cars \nand started taking the train in response to the economic crisis and \nhigh gas prices. We have to expand and improve our rail transportation \nin America to meet that demand. But if we keep the funding levels flat, \nwe could end up forcing Amtrak to shut down some of those routes \ninstead.\n  Additionally, we finally got a settlement for Amtrak's workers last \nyear after they were forced to go almost 9 years without a wage \nincrease. That settlement was recommended by President Bush's emergency \nboard. It called for the Government--us--to make a lump-sum payment in \nbackpay to Amtrak workers. The bill before us includes the funding for \nthat long-awaited payment. Those workers earned that money, but if we \ndo not pass this bill, they almost certainly will not get it.\n  I give those as a couple of examples of what could happen if we do \nnot approve this omnibus bill and get it to the President's desk by \nFriday. Those, by the way, are just the risks in transportation and \nhousing. I know many of my fellow chairmen on the committee will be \ntalking about what happens to health or agriculture or energy or law \nenforcement.\n  Less than a month ago, we came together on this floor to pass a huge \nbill designed to give our economy the jump-start we need to get the \nGovernment working again and make investments that are going to create \njobs and strengthen our communities. We are already seeing it begin to \nwork. But the progress we are already making will be forced to a stop \nbefore it can get any momentum if we do not put the people in place to \ncarry it out.\n  That is why this bill is so important. This bill will keep the \nGovernment running at a time when we need Federal employees to put all \nof their efforts, every single day, into helping our economy recover. \nWe need this bill to help ensure that our low-income families keep \nsafe, affordable housing. We need this bill so that the FHA can help \nmore people get loans and buy homes. And we need it to ensure that our \ntransit system runs safely and smoothly. This bill is critical to every \none of our communities, and we all have to work together and do what is \nright for the American people today. We all know our families are \nstruggling and they are scared about what is ahead for our economy. \nThey do not have time for us to play games. They need help now.\n  I hope we can all join together this week and move this bill, the \n2009 Omnibus appropriations bill, to the President's desk by Friday and \nget our country working again.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previously ordered \nvote slated to occur at 11:45 now occur at 12 noon and that the \nadditional time be divided as previously ordered and the remaining \nprovisions under the agreement remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on the other side \nfor giving us this little extra time. I intend to speak about 5 \nminutes. If the Chair will tell me when I have a minute to go, I would \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. President, before Senator Murray leaves the floor, I wish to \nthank her for her very clear explanation as to the choice that is \nbefore us. If I could restate it in my own way, it is a choice right \nnow that Senator McCain is giving us through his particular amendment, \nwhich would give us an option to go back to the budget of 2008 instead \nof moving forward with a current budget that reflects the needs and \npriorities of our Nation right now.\n  I do not have to tell you what has happened to our country in the \nlast several months and in the last year. We are seeing an \nunprecedented recession. My personal belief is we are going to get out \nof this. My personal belief is there are some signs out there even in \nmy State, which is struggling mightily with an over 10 percent \nunemployment rate, we see some small signs here of life. For example, \nsales of existing homes in California went up 100 percent in January \nover the year before. I might say these are mostly sales of foreclosed \nhomes. This is a good thing. We are looking for a bottom. But if we go \nback to old policies, if we go back to a budget that doesn't reflect \nthe realities we face now, we are going backward.\n  So we passed a stimulus package--and I am so grateful we did that. \nOur President led us in that. Democrats stuck together. We got three \nindependent-thinking Republicans to join us, and we challenged the \nstatus quo and we passed it.\n  And now today we are facing another such choice between a budget of \nthe past offered to us by Senator McCain, and a budget of the present. \nSenator Murray was eloquent in going through all of the things--not all \nof the things, but some of the things. I am going to talk about a \ncouple of others.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission gets an increase. If we go \nback to the old bill, as Senator McCain wants, we do not get that \nincrease. What are we doing over there in the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission? Protecting our children from dangerous toys.\n  Senator Murray talked about families losing housing. That will be the \nreality if we go with the McCain approach to a continuing resolution. \nThe FHA will have to stop helping families facing foreclosure. Senator \nMurray pointed that out.\n  Here is one I will point out, enforcement of security laws. \nInadequate resources for the SEC. This would hamper their ability to \nfinally undertake investigation enforcement against these Ponzi \nschemes. Do we want to go back to the old budget before we knew about \nthese Ponzi schemes? I think it would be irresponsible. It would be \nmore of the party of nope; nope, we cannot fix this, nope, we cannot do \nthat. I want to stand for hope, not nope.\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\n  We talked about the air traffic controllers. There are also food and \nmedical product safety inspections. We would provide the FDA with an \nincrease of $325 million so they can make sure we do not see people \ngetting sick from eating peanut butter that is contaminated.\n  There is so much more Federal law enforcement effort through the \nDepartment of Justice. In the FBI, there would be 650 fewer FBI agents. \nIs this a time we want to do that, as we are continuing the war against \nterror?\n  In my last 2 minutes, I ask unanimous consent that I have an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We see in this bill, brought to us by the Appropriations \nCommittee, and I might say, in a bipartisan fashion--am I right on \nthat--Senator Inouye, working hard with the senior members of the \ncommittee, such as my colleague, Senator Murray--we see a bill that is \nrelevant to the problems of today, not an old bill that is offered up \nby Senator McCain going backward, looking backward, going in reverse. \nIt does not make any sense. If you sit down with your family today to \ndiscuss the issues of the day, and you avoid talking about the fact \nthat one child has gotten very ill and requires a lot of changes in \nyour family budget, then your family budget is not going to accommodate \nfor what has happened to your family. America is a family. This is a \nGovernment of, by, and for the people.\n  The last point I want to make, Senator Coburn has been on the floor \nbashing the congressional priorities that are in this bill, and he \nhappened to hit on one of mine. I want to set the record straight. We \nhave a county in our State, Orange County. It is the biggest Republican \ncounty in the State. The voters voted, 58 percent, to take a former \nMarine Corps air station and turn it into what is called a great park. \nIt is going to be a diverse development. In this bill, we have answered \nthe call of the local veterans group that wants to protect the great \nhistory of El Toro, and they want to convert an old hangar that was \nopened in 1943 into a military history museum and a welcoming center \nfor the park. This response to that request will put people to work \nrefurbishing this old Air Force base. So the Senator from Oklahoma has \nrailed against it. He attacks a balloon ride for children. That is not \nwhat we are funding. We are funding a military museum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let's listen carefully. I hope we will support our \nleaders on the Appropriations Committee and vote down the continuing \nresolution as an option.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona controls all the \nremaining 24\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank you. It is entirely possible all the time may not \nbe used.\n  As I discussed at length yesterday, this amendment would provide for \na long-term continuing resolution to fund the Federal Government \nthrough the end of this fiscal year at the fiscal year 2008 level; in \nother words, the same level as last year.\n  Obviously, funds can be shifted around within agencies, and the \nallegations that somehow we cannot do business this year at the same \nlevel as last year, when American families are clearly not doing \nbusiness this year as they did last year, I think are an example of \nbeing out of touch with the challenges the American people face.\n  I think it is important for us to look at what this amendment is \ntrying to do, which is simply maintain the same level of funding as \nlast year, in the context of what the American people are facing today. \nUnemployment in the previous speaker's State is now at 10 percent, home \nvalues continue to plummet, the stock market yesterday took another \nserious dive, as more and more of Americans' savings, 401(k)s are \ndramatically reduced, with massive job layoffs, in a very serious \neconomic situation.\n  I want to state again, America will recover from this. It is tough. \nIt may be long and hard. But America will recover because we are still \nthe greatest nation in the world. But in the meantime, Americans are \nhaving to tighten their belts all across this great Nation of ours. \nThey are having to reduce or eliminate spending they have wanted to \nengage in for a new car, for whatever they feel the necessities of \ntheir families are. They watch as their health insurance premiums \ncontinue to go up and that are less and less affordable for many \nfamilies.\n  What we are asking here, obviously in this very simple 1-page \nresolution, is that we maintain the same funding level as last year. I \nwill tell you, there are millions of American families who would like \nto stay on the same funding level as last year. So instead of that, we \nhave a statement of managers, 1,844 pages, which no Member has read. We \nhave the bill itself, 800, 700-some pages, whatever it is. And, \nobviously, we have dramatic increases, an 8-percent increase in \nspending over last year. We have been through many of these earmarks. \nWe have put them out. We have twittered them. And we will continue with \nour top ten. We have many top ten lists for this bill. It will be \npassed. It will be passed. Then it will be on the President's desk, and \nthe President will have a choice as to whether to accept all of these \nthousands and thousands of unnecessary, wasteful earmark projects, and \nbusiness as usual in Washington, or take out his veto pen. By the way, \nin all spirit of candor, the last President should have taken out his \nveto pen and vetoed these bloated, pork-barrel, project-laden bills. He \nshould have. He did not, and he lost the confidence of the American \npeople because we were not careful stewards of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  So we went through a Presidential campaign, and we said we would stop \nbusiness as usual here in Washington. The President stated very clearly \nat the debate in Oxford, MS, a mere 6 months ago:\n  We need earmark reform. And when I am President, I will go line by \nline to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.\n  I want to give the President of the United States a line item veto. I \nwant him to be able to go line by line and veto each unnecessary and \nwasteful spending project. I will be introducing, with my friend from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, a line item veto again.\n  But right now, this bill deserves the President's veto. By vetoing \nthis bill, the President could send a message to America and the world \nthat for the enormous economic difficulties every American family is \nfacing, we will show them that we will be, for a change, careful \nstewards of their tax dollars.\n  But there is no justification for, at these difficult times, $1.7 \nmillion for pig odor research in Iowa, $2 million for the promotion of \nastronomy in Hawaii, termite research, $1.9 million for the Pleasure \nBeach water taxi service project in Connecticut, $95,000 for the State \nof New Mexico to find a dental school location, $1.7 million for a \nhoney bee factory, $951,500 for a sustainable Las Vegas, a parking \ngarage in Provo City, UT, tattoo removal, $167,000 for the Autry \nNational Center for the Indian American West in Los Angeles, a rodeo \nmuseum in South Dakota.\n  These things may be nice. They may be nice to have, a Buffalo Bill \nhistorical center in Cody, WY, but right now Americans cannot afford \nhealth insurance, they cannot keep their jobs. I am not only angry \nabout it, my constituents are angry. And Americans are angry. It is \nbeing reflected in the polls of the lack of confidence in the future of \nthis country because we continue business as usual here in our Nation's \nCapital.\n  I know I will not be elected ``Ms. Congeniality'' again this year in \nthe Senate. For many years I have fought to try to eliminate a great \ndeal of this. Sometimes I have succeeded; most times I have failed. The \nprevious chairman of the committee used to call me the sheriff. But the \nfact is, there is no time more important than now for us to show the \nAmerican people that we are willing to tighten our belts, that we are \nwilling to stop this practice, which, yes, has corrupted people. That \nis why we have former Members of Congress now residing in Federal \nprison, and staffers under indictment. This process is wrong. It is \nwrong because we do not give it the scrutiny and the\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\nexamination and the authorizing it deserves before we appropriate the \nmoney.\n  That is why Americans are angry at the way we do business and our \napproval ratings continue to be very low. Our approval ratings are \nsomething that is somewhat ephemeral. But this practice has grown and \ngrown and grown over the years that I have been a Member of Congress \nand the Senate. It has continued to grow, and it has continued to waste \nthe American taxpayers' dollars. So I ask Americans, along with me, to \nask the President to veto this bill and have him send one back that is \ntruly reflective of the tough times America is in today, that we cannot \nafford any longer this wasteful spending practice, this spending on \nprojects that appear in the middle of the night, and sometimes, as in \none of last year's appropriations bills, they were projects added after \nthe President signed the bill into law. No one knows where it came \nfrom. What kind of a process is that? What kind of a process is it that \nwe have legislation that is this high, that no Member has read? The \nwhole process has to be fixed.\n  For the President's budget director to say: This is last year's \nbusiness, we want to move on, and the President's Chief of Staff, who \nhas said: Mr. Obama was not happy with the large number of earmarks in \nthis bill but, ``The President had kept lawmakers from adding a single \nearmark to the $787 billion stimulus package, and a $32.8 billion State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program,'' I find to be a very disingenuous \nstatement on its face.\n  The President's pledge 6 months ago wasn't that he would claim to \nkeep two bills earmark free and then let there be a feeding frenzy of \npork barrel. His pledge was: ``We need earmark reform'' and, as \nPresident, he would do it.\n  I read today an article in the Chicago Tribune that Mr. Emanuel is \ntied to as many as 16 earmarks in this legislation, totaling $8.5 \nmillion, $900,000 for Chicago's Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum, \nand the list goes on. When do we turn off the spigot? Haven't we \nlearned anything from the calls and letters, meetings with our \nconstituents who pour their hearts and souls out and share their fears \nabout keeping their jobs and homes as they struggle to put food on \ntheir families' tables? Bills such as this jeopardize their future. One \nof my greatest fears about the President's budget is that at no point \nin his budget does there seem to be a balanced budget, nor is there any \ntriggering mechanism, such as this side proposed in the stimulus bill, \nthat once our economy recovers--and it will recover--we embark on \nreductions in spending. Right now we are laying a huge debt on our \nchildren and grandchildren which is not in keeping with our \nresponsibilities.\n  I urge colleagues to vote for this amendment. I doubt it will be \npassed. I hope the American people understand what is at stake. I hope \nall Americans will urge the President to veto the bill when it gets to \nhis desk, send it back, save billions of their tax dollars, and come \nback with a bill that Americans can say is truly reflective of the \nchallenges we face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona proposes that the \nCongress should enact a continuing resolution until the end of the year \ninstead of fulfilling our responsibilities and completing work on the \nappropriations bills for fiscal year 2009.\n  Last summer the Appropriations Committee reported 10 Appropriations \nbills to the Senate. All of them were reported to the Senate from the \nCommittee with overwhelming bipartisan support. Eight were reported \nwith unanimous support. Of the ten bills, only three were enacted.\n  The other bills were put on hold because the previous administration \nrefused to negotiate on overall spending levels approved by the \nCongress.\n  Two other bills, Legislative and Interior, were prepared by the \nSubcommittee Chairmen, in concert with their Ranking Members, but were \nnever completed.\n  These nine unfinished bills were left on the shelf until the current \nadministration was elected.\n  Last fall the House and Senate Appropriations Committees sat down in \nbipartisan negotiations to work out the differences between these nine \nbills.\n  The result of those negotiations is the bill before the Senate today, \nH.R. 1105.\n  This bill reflects a compromise between the bills of both bodies.\n  It is a fair outcome that protects the interests of the House and \nSenate.\n  This bill was agreed to by the House last week, with votes from \nMembers of both parties.\n  I should point out that Members have had more than a week to review \nthe legislation.\n  The bill and statement have been on the internet since last Monday.\n  I also note that this bill was not done in the dark of night. \nVirtually every item in the bill reflects the bipartisan work of the \nAppropriations Subcommittees from last year.\n  Most of this information was posted on the internet and has been \navailable to Members' offices since last summer.\n  Unlike some omnibus bills in the past, there is no major legislation \nthat was added at the last minute.\n  The direction from the leadership of both houses was not to add \ncontroversial new material in this bill, and the committees did not.\n  If the Senate were now to determine that we should not complete our \nwork on the fiscal year 2009 appropriations bills at this juncture and \ninstead agree to a continuing resolution for the rest of the year, all \nthe efforts of the Committee in reviewing the budget request, the \nhearings and staff review, the countless meetings with executive branch \nofficials, the mark ups and the ensuing direction that comes with this \nbill would be wasted.\n  More importantly than the wasted effort is that the Congress would be \nabrogating its responsibility.\n  Under a continuing resolution the government operates programs under \nthe authority of the previous year. Programs that should have been \nterminated continue to be funded.\n  Important new programs cannot be initiated. This is true even if the \nprogram is something that was supported by both the previous \nadministration and the Congress. It is true if the Congress passed a \nnew authorization to fund it last year.\n  Is this really how we want to manage the executive branch?\n  Under a continuing resolution funding for the agencies covered by \nthis bill would be held at last year's level.\n  The Congress authorized a pay raise for our civil servants, and it \nmust be paid. But unless funding in the budget is increased, other \nprograms will have to be cut to meet payroll.\n  A continuing resolution doesn't account for the cost of inflation. \nEven in these tough economic times, there has been cost growth in \nmanaging our Government. We all know that it costs more to run these \nagencies this year than it did in 2008. But under a continuing \nresolution agencies have to cut necessary functions to cover the higher \ncosts due to inflation.\n  Perhaps most important, under a continuing resolution the Congress \nforegoes oversight of the executive branch. In each appropriations \nbill, the committees include guidance on how funding should be \nallocated. Some programs are increased; others are cut compared to the \nbudget request. When we operate under a continuing resolution, the \nCongress turns over control to the agencies.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution provides the Congress with the power \nof the purse to ensure that we exercise control over the executive \nbranch.\n  It is one of the most important rights of the legislative branch.\n  But it is also a duty.\n  It is the duty of the Congress to decide how the executive branch \nshould spend the taxpayer's money.\n  When we decide to govern by continuing resolution we are not \nresponsibly fulfilling this duty.\n  This amendment would turn over control of Government spending to the \nadministration.\n  It would put the Government on autopilot for programs approved for \n2008 not 2009.\n  This is not the way for the Congress to manage its business.\n  I will grant that the effect of this amendment would probably cut the \nearmarks that are included in this bill.\n  And while the majority of my colleagues have supported earmarks in \nthis bill for their constituents, it is\n\n[[Page S2657]]\n\nwell understood that the Senator from Arizona does not.\n  But this amendment isn't about the 1 percent of this bill for \nearmarks; it is about the 99 percent of the funds in the bill over \nwhich we are sacrificing oversight if this amendment were adopted.\n  This is bad policy for both the Congress and the executive branch, \nand I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  As chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, it should be \nnoted that if it weren't for earmarks or congressional initiatives, the \nC-17, the highly acclaimed cargo plane, would be history. Production \nwould have been stopped. But Congress took action to continue. Now all \nmilitary leaders are saying that was a great decision. The F-22, the \nfighter of the future--stealth, firepower--that would be a matter of \nhistory also. I could go on and on, but we don't have the time.\n  All I want to say is that earmarks are not evil. Yes, there are some \nthat are questionable, and there will come a time to do that.\n  I urge colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of the time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will you please state the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 592 offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain.\n  Mr. KYL.

Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                        America's Credit Crisis\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, families and businesses across the Nation \nare suffering from a severe economic squeeze. Unfortunately, despite \nthe $1 trillion stimulus bill passed by Congress, this economy will not \nrecover--at least not until we tackle the root of the problem. As \nPresident Obama said last week, we must solve America's credit crisis.\n  I am hearing from folks in my home State of Missouri and across the \nNation who are sick of hearing gloom and doom being preached by \nGovernment officials, sick of watching tens of billions of good \ntaxpayer dollars being put into failing institutions, and sick of \nlistening to the debate on how much we should pay failing CEOs, when \ncommon sense says we should fire them.\n  Let me be clear. All Americans need to care about the credit crisis \nand the Government's response. We have to solve the credit crisis to \nprotect Main Street families and workers. The key to our economic \nrecovery is the stabilization and restoration of the financial markets. \nOur financial markets make up the lifeblood of our economy, which \nfamilies need to buy homes and cars, students need to receive loans, \nand small businesses need to purchase supplies, invest in new \nequipment, and meet payroll. A functioning financial system is critical \nto our State and local governments so they can finance critical \ninfrastructure needs, water and sewer systems, affordable housing, and \ntransportation.\n  Our banking system affects every American's standard of living, our \nability to create and maintain jobs, and our ability to compete \nglobally. It is central to all financial and household activities for \nMain Street America.\n  Unfortunately, our financial system is not working. The credit market \nis clogged with toxic assets mainly made up of risky subprime housing \nloans which were packaged into exotic financial instruments, sliced and \ndiced, and sold here and abroad. The toxic assets are clearly at the \ncenter of the credit crisis, and until they are removed from the \nsystem, fear and uncertainty will continue to dominate the markets and \nour economy.\n  To respond to the financial crisis, the previous administration and \nfinancial regulators took a number of actions. While many of these \nactions were confusing and ad hoc in nature and lacking in \ntransparency, a financial calamity was likely staved off.\n  Unfortunately, instead of being implemented with the expectation that \nthe administration and the Treasury Department would provide a \ncoherent, systematic, and transparent approach to its financial rescue \nefforts, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, has been plagued \nby poor oversight, confusion, and changing direction.\n  This ``ad hocracy'' has created more uncertainty in the financial \nmarkets and for policymakers and taxpayers. Also, independent \nassessments have raised serious questions about the program's \nintegrity, accountability, transparency, and effectiveness.\n  About 3 weeks ago, Treasury Secretary Geithner released his financial \nstability plan. While I welcome the Secretary's and the \nadministration's new thoughts on resolving the financial crisis, his \nplan fails to live up to its promise. The plan fails to provide the \nclarity and the focus needed to address the financial crisis. Perhaps \neven more damaging, the plan created doubt and uncertainty about the \nSecretary's and administration's ability to lead our Nation out of this \ncrisis.\n  There is no roadmap, no exit strategy, and by throwing more taxpayer \nmoney at the problem, we are only digging a deeper hole. Once again, \nthe plan is nothing more than ``ad hocracy.''\n  Based on what can be gleaned from the administration's bare bones \nannouncement, most elements of the plan appear to be stylistic changes \nto what has already been tried under the previous administration and \nleaves uncertainty about the ultimate question: How will toxic assets \nbe addressed?\n  Fear and uncertainty cloud financial markets because of a lack of \nconfidence of the solvency of our banking\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\nsystem. To address this, we ultimately have to cleanse the financial \ninstitutions of the toxic assets. There are a number of ideas about how \nto do it. One option is to do nothing. That would not work because of \nmassive uncertainty. The private sector is unwilling to provide capital \nto the banks, and the likely result would be a collapse of the system.\n  Let me be clear. We cannot afford to do nothing. We cannot afford a \ncollapse of the entire banking system. A collapse of this magnitude \nwould devastate families, farmers, students, and businesses in every \ncommunity in every State.\n  The second option is to keep propping up the financial institutions \nby injecting more good taxpayer funds into sick financial institutions. \nThat option has been applied over the past several months--most \nrecently with AIG. Yet our financial system clearly continues to \nstruggle. And I for one cannot support a plan that will spend more \ntaxpayer dollars without solving the real problem.\n  Putting more good taxpayer money into bad institutions must end. We \nmust implement a plan that has worked in this and other countries. We \nmust remove toxic assets from banks.\n  This approach employs the statutory authorities, an approach long \nused by the FDIC for failed banks. It has succeeded in purging toxic \nassets over a long period of time.\n  This American credit cleanup plan is founded on lessons we learned \nwith our experience with the savings and loan crisis and avoids the \nmistakes made by Japan which gave them their so-called lost decade.\n  First, through independent regulators, the Government must determine \nthe true health of our banks. The overarching test is, will the bank or \nfinancial institution fail without taxpayer funds. Secretary Geithner \ndeserves credit for recommending a stress test to determine more \nprecisely and fully the condition of the bank--a stress test that \nshould have been implemented a long time ago. However, a stress test \ncannot be a one-time snapshot. It should have been and now must be a \nregular and ongoing review of a bank's health.\n  It is critical these stress tests be done in an objective and \ntransparent manner, without political interference, but professionally, \nsince it is the basis for Government action. This leads to the second \nkey principle.\n  For those banks found to be insolvent, toxic assets must be removed \nin a transparent, market friendly manner that is free from political \ninterference, protects taxpayers, and has a clear exit strategy.\n  To accomplish the goal, the Government should exert temporary control \nof the institution through conservatorship. The FDIC has existing \nauthorities to act as conservators and did so recently with IndyMac.\n  Under this approach, the taxpayer has greater protections because the \nGovernment is in control of assets and liabilities, and they can \ncleanse the balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities and \nrestructure the institution.\n  Under conservatorship, the first order of business is to protect the \nbank's depositors up to the current FDIC guarantee. It is essential \nthat we continue to protect families' investments.\n  Next, the Government can separate the bad assets from the good and \nhold the bad assets until market conditions improve. Remember, during \nthe savings and loan crisis, the RTC took 4 to 5 years and sold off \nnearly $460 billion in assets. But the RTC's patience and strategy to \nsell off the assets in a gradual manner is a model we can use to \naddress the massive toxic assets that are holding back the recovery of \nthe financial industry and do so in a manner that will help limit loss \nto taxpayers.\n  The FDIC has broad powers and experience, which is why the FDIC \nshould be the lead. Its resolution powers, including conservatorship, \nwere authorized by Congress nearly 20 years ago and then later improved \nunder the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991. And if the FDIC needs \nadditional authority or resources, Congress and the administration \nshould act quickly to ensure the FDIC can handle the crisis.\n  In the case of IndyMac, FDIC took over as conservator. It not only \nprotected depositors, it also established and implemented an aggressive \nforeclosure mitigation program. To avoid long-term ownership of the \ninstitution, the FDIC is in the process of selling the assets and \nownership of the operation back into private hands.\n  Finally, this approach eliminates the conundrum of valuing the assets \nsince the Government is acquiring the assets at the bank's current book \nvalue, which means including appropriate writedowns by regulatory and \naccounting authorities.\n  For conservatorship to be effective, however, it is critical that the \nGovernment's work be free and independent from political interference. \nMicromanaging by Congress and the administration must end.\n  It is critical that one Government agency be selected to lead the \ncleanup. Management by committee and multiple regulators is a recipe \nfor disaster.\n  While each Government regulator brings important skills and resources \nthat may be necessary for cleaning up toxic assets, the FDIC is best \nequipped to carry out an efficient and effective process of cleaning up \ntroubled banks as the lead agency. If necessary, the FDIC can draw upon \nadditional resources from other regulatory agencies, as well as the \nprivate sector, to complete its conservatorship.\n  Under the third principle, failed executives and members of the board \nwho are responsible for the failure of the sick financial institution \nshould be replaced. Capping pay and taking away corporate jets is not \nenough. Firing the senior executives and boards of directors who failed \nthe company and its shareholders must be a prerequisite to further \ngovernmental assistance.\n  It is time to stop taking a piecemeal, ad hoc approach in addressing \nour financial crisis, burying our collective heads in the sand to avoid \nwhat needs to be done, and by simply hoping things will get better. \nThrowing more taxpayer dollars at it or hoping they will get better on \ntheir own is unrealistic. Failing to address the toxic assets that clog \nthe financial system undermines taxpayers' confidence in our markets, \nexacerbates our economic condition, and throws more tax dollars down a \nrathole. The time for half-baked measures is long past.\n  It is time we implement a bold, coherent, and smart plan to ensure \naccountability, transparency, and oversight. This tried and tested \napproach is more cost-effective and efficient than the current \nhaphazard approach. Rather than pumping more and more taxpayer funds \ninto sick banks, it is time to take the toxic assets that undermine the \nhealth and viability of the financial system. In other words, it is \ntime to fire the bazooka. It is time to stop letting politics and fear \ndrive decisions. It is time for smart, considered, and decisive action \nbased on strategies that have worked.\n  In closing, I ask my colleagues and fellow Americans this question: \nAre we prepared to do what is necessary to save our financial system \nand our economy? I do not believe the answer can be anything but yes.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence, and the staff. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] moves to commit the \n     bill (H.R. 1105) to the Committee on Appropriations with \n     instructions to report the same back to the Senate with the \n     following amendment:\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Sec. ___. (a) Across-the-Board-Reduction.--Amounts \n     appropriated under this Act for--\n       (1) fiscal year 2009 shall be reduced by $18,981,000,000; \n     and\n       (2) fiscal year 2010 shall be reduced by $3,274,000,000.\n       (b) Implementation.--The Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall administer the reductions in \n     subsection (a) to the amount of budget authority provided or \n     obligation limit imposed for any discretionary account of \n     this Act.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I don't think we need a long time to \ndiscuss this amendment. It is a pretty simple amendment. What it says \nis, we are going to take this bill back to the Appropriations Committee \nand have the Appropriations Committee make the appropriate cuts so this \nbill comes back at the 2008 funding level.\n  We have to ask ourselves: When is the Senate going to start being \nfiscally responsible? The other side of the aisle criticized us, and \nrightly so, for free spending over the last 8 years. That was one of \nthe things President Obama campaigned on and the Democrats across the \ncountry campaigned on. They said they were going to be the party of \nfiscal responsibility.\n  The debt held by the public has continued to increase. The problem is \nthat under the President's new budget, over the next 5 years, the debt \nis actually going to double. Over the 10-year budget he has proposed, \nthe debt held by the public is going to triple from already \nunsustainable levels.\n  My amendment says that we give spending a little haircut around here. \nIt is not significant. It is saying that at a time when we recently \npassed a stimulus package, which tremendously increased Government \nspending, let us not take last year's spending bills and also \ntremendously increase their levels of spending. The current omnibus \nproposes an 8-percent growth in the size of our Government from one \nyear to the next. We are talking about a record deficit this year. \n$1.75 trillion is a big number; people can't even get their arms around \nthat number.\n  If you to spent $1 million a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, \nbeginning at the time Jesus was born, you still wouldn't be at your \nfirst $1 trillion today. Our deficit this year is $1.75 trillion. To \nadd to that deficit with this spending bill, I believe, is outrageous.\n  There is a saying--and I don't remember who said it, exactly or how \nit was said, but it is basically along these lines: The systems of \ngovernment such as we have always collapse due to two reasons: The \nfirst one is a moral collapse, the second one is followed by an \neconomic collapse. You can understand why they happen in that order. \nBecause what happens if people aren't moral enough to care about future \ngenerations? What they do is they vote people into office who give them \nwhat they want. They borrow from the Treasury to get it, and when the \ndebt gets too high, it collapses the economy.\n  What we are doing around here is exactly that. We are repeating the \nmistakes of history. We are borrowing from our children. We are running \nup huge debts. If folks don't think our economy can't completely \ncollapse due to the huge debt burden we are passing, they have another \nthing coming. Confidence in the dollar right now is questionable around \nthe world. Looking into the future, as we run up these larger and \nlarger deficits and add to a huge burgeoning debt in the United States, \npeople around the world are going to wonder about the strength of the \ndollar. They are going to wonder whether they want to continue to buy \nour Treasury bonds and finance our debt. If they stop buying our bonds, \nour economy collapses. It literally falls off the cliff.\n  We have a fiscal responsibility to be moral enough to care about \nfuture generations of Americans, to not continue to add dollar after \ndollar, million after million, billion after billion, trillion after \ntrillion onto their debt load. I would encourage this body to adopt \nthis reasonable amendment to this bill; that instead of increasing the \nGovernment 8 percent over last year on these particular spending bills, \nlet us freeze it at last year's level. We are not asking to cut \nanything, but let's freeze it at last year's level.\n  It will be up to the Appropriations Committee to decide whether some \naccounts are more worthy than others. They can plus up those or cut \nothers that are not as worthy. They can take care of Members' projects \nif they wish to take care of Members' projects. But the bottom line is, \nthis amendment would at least start down the road of fiscal \nresponsibility to future generations.\n  I have a couple other comments. Can anybody rightly say this bill is \nfull of good spending, of justified spending? We have heard about all \nthe earmarks. Let me note a few of them, if you think this bill is full \nof good spending. Mr. President, $1.79 million--and I am not \nexaggerating--$1.79 million for swine odor and manure management \nresearch. I am a veterinarian by profession. I understand that pigs \nsmell and pig farms smell worse than almost anything else. But when did \nit become the responsibility of the Federal Government to control pig \nodor? Shouldn't that be the responsibility of pig farmers?\n\n  Of course we need to pay back the labor unions. There is $190,000 to \nthe Plumbers Local Union 27 and Steamfitters Union 449, and that is in \nPennsylvania for the Western Pennsylvania Pipe Trades Regional Training \nProject. We also have almost $500,000 for the George Meany Center for \nLabor Studies at the National Labor College.\n  I have a whole list. As a matter of fact, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave this list of earmarks printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Notable Earmarks\n\n       These earmarks are listed in the Joint Explanatory \n     Statement which was published in the Congressional Record of \n     February 23, 2009; after each earmark is the page number in \n     the Record where it is listed.\n       $1.76 million for a honey bee lab (H1691).\n       $1.79 million for swine odor and manure management research \n     (H1692).\n       $767,000 for subtropical beef germplasm (H1692).\n       $245,000 for aegilops cylindrica (jointed goatgrass) \n     (H1700).\n       $469,000 for ethnobotanicals (ethnobotany is ``the plant \n     lore and agricultural customs of a people'') (H1698).\n       $5.8 million to the Edward M.

There are plenty of others we could go through, but for \nthe sake of time, let's just be fiscally responsible right now. Let's \nadd a little fiscal responsibility into this body, and let's adopt this \namendment that says we are going to freeze spending from Government \nthat was not already plussed-up in the stimulus bill. Let's be fiscally \nresponsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment that has \njust been offered by the Senator from Nevada. I go home every weekend \nand I talk to families across my State. There is no doubt that people \nare hurting. Thousands of people have been laid off from their jobs, \nand thousands more are worried that this week they are the ones who are \ngoing to be laid off from their jobs.\n  Since we first came into session in January, we have been working as \nhard as I have ever seen to address these challenges that are facing \nmillions of Americans today--losing their jobs, losing their homes, \nlosing their retirement. We are trying to get this economy back on \ntrack and instill some confidence in this country so we can move \nforward. We passed a major economic recovery package just a few weeks \nago. It is being implemented as we speak and will be implemented over \nthe coming weeks and months.\n  Here we are today talking about a bill that basically is the \nresponsibility of Congress, every single year, to fund the Government \nagencies that help make our country work. We should have had this bill \npassed 3, 4, 5 months ago. We did not. This bill was done. It was ready \nto go by the end of July. All of the appropriations committees had \nfinished their work. They had passed them out of the Appropriations \nCommittee, almost all of them on a unanimous vote, some of them with \njust a few negative votes in committee.\n  But the responsibility of the Senate and House and Congress every \nyear is to pass our spending bills. We pass these bills in order to \nmake our agencies work, whether it is the Food and Drug Administration \nthat makes sure our food is safe, whether it is our air traffic \ncontrollers who manage the flights out of our airports, whether it is \nour health care agencies that do research and important work for this \nNation's health, whether it is Government agencies that fund \nagriculture or any of the other agencies we have. These are people who \ngo to work every day whose function it is to make our economy and our \ncountry work so that average citizens do not have to sit at home and \nworry about whether the drug they purchase is safe or whether the \nagriculture they buy at the market is safe or whether their schools are \nfunded or whether we provide individuals the basic health care \nAmericans know they need in order to keep their families secure.\n  It is too bad these bills didn't pass a few months ago. Why didn't \nthey? Because we had an administration whose bottom line was to say no. \nThe President at the time, President Bush, said: I will say no to these \nbills as they come to my desk.\n  But here in the Senate and in the House, we said: These bills are \nimportant, but if this President is going to veto them, we are going to \nwait a few months for the election.\n  That happened, we have a brandnew President, and, unfortunately a few \nmonths late because we were working on an economic stimulus package, we \nare here to pass these bills. I wish they were done a few months ago. I \nknow all of us do. But we should not delay it any further. All of the \npeople who worked with us to get these bills passed, everyone in the \ncountry, whether it is a YMCA that has a domestic violence center that \nis waiting for $100,000 that we marked up in committee and appropriated \nlast year for them, or highway projects we marked up in this bill, or \ntransit projects, across the board, whether it is law enforcement, \nwhether it is consumer product safety, whether it is the numerous \nhousing agencies that are funded in this--they have known for several \nmonths what they are going to get. They are waiting for us to finish \nour work this week, by this deadline, Friday, so we do not go back to a \nCR. It is our responsibility to pass these bills.\n  The Senate had a very strong vote just a few hours ago to say we are \nnot going to work off a continuing resolution. We are going to do a \nresponsible job of funding these agencies, as we said.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Nevada that now comes before us \nsends us into a tailspin. It says we are going to send these bills back \nto the Appropriations Committee to cut some $20 billion out of them and \ncome back to us. First of all, just from a process point of view, this \nis not going to happen by this Friday, and if we do not get this bill \npassed by this Friday, the Government shuts down. I can talk about the \nconsequences of that. I have been in this body before when the \nGovernment shut down. It is not pretty, and we do not want to be there \nfor a million reasons that I am happy to talk about for some time, but \nwe will leave that for another day.\n  The fact is, to send this bill back to the Appropriations Committee \nand tell them to cut $20 billion out of it, that will underfund \ncritical initiatives this Senate and this House believe are important.\n  Let me talk for a minute about housing. We all know that one of the \nreasons our economy is in such trouble today is because of the housing \ncrisis that has come before us. In this bill--if we do not pass it as \nit is written and before the Senate today, we have about 45,000 \nfamilies who will lose their jobs on top of the thousands we have \nalready seen. We cannot afford to put those families in jeopardy. Yet \nthat is essentially what will happen if the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Nevada is agreed to.\n  We are working hard to make sure our families do not go into \nforeclosure. The amendment of the Senator puts all of those families at \nrisk. Single-family guaranteed housing loans are at risk under the \namendment of the Senator. Federal law enforcement efforts through the \nDepartment of Justice are at risk through the amendment of the Senator. \nAntiterrorist enforcement programs through the Department of Treasury \nare at risk under the amendment of the Senator. U.S. attorneys are at \nrisk. Food and medical product safety--right at a time when we are all \nworried about peanut butter--is at risk. Consumer product safety--the \nrisk goes on. All of these priorities that we worked through our \ncommittee on a bipartisan basis and said we need to move these \ninitiatives forward are at risk under the amendment of the Senator.\n  I believe we have to all go back to our responsibilities. All of us \nwish the bill could have passed a few months ago. It didn't. It is in \nfront of us now. We need to pass this bill, get it to the President's \ndesk, and then we will have\n\n[[Page S2661]]\n\nan opportunity to look at a budget for 2010. Our Budget Committee will \nlook at that budget hard, we will pass the budget out--it will have to \npass in the Senate and House--and it will set the parameters for next \nyear's appropriations bills. Those appropriations committees will then, \nin the next few months, begin to work on their bill. For anybody who \nhas issues, small or large, that is the appropriate place to begin the \ndebate and amendment process and hopefully in regular order to pass \nthose bills and move forward. But we should not jeopardize this bill at \nthis point. That is not responsible. That is not what any of us should \nbe doing at this point.\n\n  Finally, let me talk about the debt issue we have been hearing so \nmuch about. None of us wants to operate this country in debt. All of us \nare fiscally responsible. I have heard every Member of the Senate come \nforward and talk about making sure we keep our house in order.\n  Who got us to where we are today? The Republicans who came into power \nunder George Bush turned historic surpluses into historic deficits by \nnot being honest about the costs in front of us--whether it was the \nIraq war or whether it was other costs that were paid off-budget, \nemergencies across the country--not coming forward and being honest \nabout the fact that we do need to fund health care research or \neducation for our kids. Why have these bills not passed before the \nelection? Because even Republicans didn't want to cut education or to \ncut health care, which would have been what we had to do to meet the \nPresident's budget level.\n  I take a backseat to no one when it comes to making sure our country \nmoves forward in a fiscally responsible way and deals with the debt we \nhave. But at the cost of laying off thousands of people because we are \nnot being responsible and up-front about the job we have to do is \nirresponsible.\n  I hope our colleagues will defeat the amendment by Senator Ensign, \nmove on, pass this bill this week, and then we can have all the debate \nwe want about the budget that will come before this body shortly, about \nthe appropriations moving forward.\n  Let me remind all of us that what we are talking about here is \nextremely important. No one wants to get a pink slip. No one wants to \nsee their job lost. No one wants to see their health care at risk, \ntheir education at risk, or for that matter, within my appropriations \nbill, their flight from their airport at risk because we have not added \nair traffic controllers, which is in this bill. There are many other \nissues in this bill that are at risk under the proposal of the Senator, \nand I urge our colleagues to defeat this amendment and move forward, \ndoing what we were sent here to do, and that is be responsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to first address a few of the \nmisrepresentations of my amendment by the Senator from Washington. My \namendment does not cut any specific program, and you know it. It says \nto the Appropriations Committee: We will send this back to the \nAppropriations Committee, and you determine which programs are funded \nand which ones are not funded. But you will fund them at last year's \nlevel. If you want to raise the level in certain areas, then you will \nhave to cut funding in other areas.\n  We just have to ask ourselves the question: Does anybody believe \nthere is wasteful Washington spending? Does our Government have any \nwasteful spending in it? If you say there obviously is wasteful \nspending, when was the last time we cut anything? When was the last \ntime we cut any wasteful spending? Congress needs to address this \nwasteful spending. Part of the Appropriations Committee job is \noversight. The Committee then figures out what is working, what is not \nworking, fund what works and cut what does not work. But that doesn't \nhappen around here. All they do is add and add.\n  If you check the Constitution, the purse strings are controlled by \nCongress, not by the President. Democrats are entering their third year \nof that control in both houses. So what we have to do here is exercise \nour authority and say we are going to be fiscally responsible. You can \nsay you are fiscally responsible all you want, but unless you act on \nit, the words are hollow.\n  Businesses across America are looking for ways to cut waste from \ntheir budgets during this economic downturn. Do you know what they are \nfinding? Talk to them. I have been in business myself. I understand \nthat when times are good, you sometimes add staff you don't need, you \nwaste money in places you don't need to, and that is in the private \nsector. The Government is less efficient than the private sector.\n  Times are tough in this country, instead of thinking we will just add \nto the deficit, we will just raise taxes, let's look for efficiency and \nlet's eliminate wasteful spending. We have a bill in front of us that \nis going to increase spending over last year's level by 8 percent. Is \nthat fiscally responsible? We just passed a nearly $1 trillion spending \nbill called the stimulus bill, and now we are going to increase this by \n8 percent? It seems to me that is not fiscal responsibility. That is \nthe height of irresponsibility.\n  Let's have a debate on this, but let's have a honest debate.\n  We are not cutting any specific programs. Do not say we are cutting \neducation. Do not say we are cutting health care. Do not say we are \ncutting police and firefighters because this amendment does not do \nthat.\n  What this amendment says is, let's send this bill back to the \nAppropriations Committee, to last year's level. The Appropriations \nCommittee can determine which programs are funded at what level. If you \nbelieve there are certain priorities that need more funding, then fund \nthem; otherwise, let's be honest about this debate. And I am more than \nhappy to go back and forth with the other side about the merits. But if \nanybody thinks there is not wasteful spending going on in Washington, \nDC, you need to wake up and smell the coffee because it is outrageous \nhow much waste there is in our Government today--outrageous. We do not \nrequire fiscal discipline in our agencies, and that is what we need to \nstart doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           president obama's missile shield letter to russia\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of President \nObama's critical recognition that Russia must be a major player in \nblocking Iran's development of dangerous weapons. Yesterday, it was \nreported that the President wrote to Russia's President Dmitri Medvedev \nsignaling an openness to re-examining the contested missile defense \nsystem in Eastern Europe, while urging Russia to help us stop Iran from \ndeveloping nuclear warheads and long-range weapons.\n  This overture by President Obama is Reaganesque in its boldness. It \nhas the potential to represent the most cooperative approach to a \nglobal threat by our two countries since President Reagan and Gorbachev \nsigned the missile treaty 20 years ago.\n  It signals the ushering in of a new era of tough and smart thinking \nabout foreign policy that has been desperately lacking in the White \nHouse. Rather than alienating potential allies, President Obama and his \nteam are demonstrating that they will abandon the Bush unilateral \napproach to nuclear nonproliferation in favor of galvanizing \ninternational support to meet the challenge posed by these deadly \nweapons.\n  I am not an after-the-fact supporter of this strategy. I have long \nthought that the key to de-fanging Iran's nuclear threat lies in \nRussia's cooperation in imposing tough economic sanctions on Iran. In \nfact, in an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal last \nsummer, I urged President Bush to offer to Russia a deal: in exchange \nfor walking back the missile defense system that Russia so opposes, the \nU.S. should get Russia to back the United States' economic sanctions on \nIran that are our best stick for making sure that their nuclear threat \ndoes not become a reality.\n  I also made this suggestion in person at the White House last year. I \nwas literally told by Vice President Cheney ``We can't do that.'' Well, \nthere's new\n\n[[Page S2662]]\n\nleadership in Washington and President Obama says ``Yes we can.''\n  Today, there should be no lingering doubt that Iran represents a \nprofound threat to our global security. The latest International Atomic \nEnergy Agency report confirms that Iran remains in hot pursuit of a \nnuclear program. The report told us that Iran now possesses 1,010 \nkilograms, 2,222 pounds, of low-enriched uranium, which raises concerns \nthat it now has sufficient uranium and the means to enrich it to \nproduce nuclear warheads.\n  Whether President Ahmadinejad actually intends to make good on his \nthreat remains to be seen. But what we do know is that the \nadministration needs to use every diplomatic tool in our arsenal to \nhalt Iran's progress in the development of deadly nuclear weapons.\n  In the recent past, we have made some progress in ratcheting up \neconomic pressure on Iran by sanctioning four of Iran's major state-\nowned banks. This move has dramatically limited Iran's ability to \nconduct international business, as a growing number of foreign banks \nare unwilling to risk reputational harm or loss of access to U.S. \nfinancial markets. More economic pressure can and must be applied.\n  These sanctions are effective against Iran for several reasons. \nDespite the fact that the leadership and government of Iran is a \ntheocracy, the Iranian people are largely secular and look westward for \ntheir cultural bearings. It's a common sight to see satellite dishes \nhidden in air-conditioning ducts, so Iranians can stay abreast of \nWestern culture. Its growing youthful population also has strong ties \nto the west. MTV is a popular TV channel among the young in the \ncountry, not al-Jazeera. Iran is also wealthier than most neighbors in \nits region, and its inhabitants have enjoyed a higher standard of \nliving than most people living in the Middle East.\n  However, Russia is blunting the impact of the sanctions. Economic \nself-interest motivates Russia's arguments that there is no evidence \nthat Iran has a secret nuclear weapons program and that sanctions would \nundermine the International Atomic Energy Agency's efforts. Russia \nmakes money from business with Iran, since Russia currently supplies \nover 75 percent of Iran's arms imports. Russia continues to supply Iran \nwith nuclear fuel and to train Iran's nuclear engineers.\n  More ominously, Prime Minister Putin's nationalist rhetoric, designed \nto remake Russia into a global power and restore nationalist pride to \nthe Russians, has led Russia into an even tighter embrace with Iran, an \nembrace that must be untangled if we are ever to truly eliminate the \nIranian nuclear threat.\n  It is also not a secret that little has raised Russia's anger and \nfueled its nationalist impulses more than the Bush administration's \nmissile shield plan. Putin argued that such a plan would both reignite \nthe arms race of the 1980s and damage Russia's relations with the \nUnited States, Poland, and the Czech Republic. He also said that the \nshield would prompt Russia to increase its own defenses and abrogate \nits commitments to demilitarize under the Treaty on Conventional Armed \nForces in Europe.\n  Despite Russia's loud complaints over this missile shield, the Bush \nadministration plowed ahead, securing reluctant agreement from our \nallies at the NATO summit earlier last summer to move forward with its \nimplementation.\n  Let me be clear. The United States is committed to both protecting \nagainst the threat of a nuclear Iran and protecting a free and \nprosperous Eastern Europe. But the Bush administration's plan to deploy \nthe missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic has never \nmade much sense. The technology has never been proven to work, it has \nnot been determined to be cost-effective, and it will do nothing to \ntackle the ultimate source of this threat, Iran's stubborn refusal to \nabandon its nuclear program. At the same time, it does very little to \npreserve the necessary and very important independence of Eastern \nEurope.\n  In this context, it seems clear that the U.S. and Russia each have \nsomething to gain from each other. President Obama appears to recognize \nthis dynamic. In exchange for joining the West in imposing economic \nsanctions on Iran until they stop their pursuit of nuclear weapons, I \nencourage the administration to roll back its predecessor's plans for a \nmissile shield. It makes sense. With Russia on board, economic \nsanctions will have much greater success, and countries like China will \ncertainly think twice before engaging with the Iranian regime. Russian \nparticipation will give multilateral sanctions against Iran real teeth, \nand we can halt Iran's nuclear program before it is too late.\n  The President's gesture to Russia is the kind of smart, targeted \ndiplomacy our dangerous world needs. Given that a nuclear Iran is such \na profound threat, this strategy makes eminent sense. The United States \ncould give up a non-vital missile program in Eastern Europe in exchange \nfor vitally needed Russian cooperation to prevent Iran from going \nnuclear. President Obama and President Medvedev do not need to look \ninto each other's soul. They just need to be able to trust each other's \nhandshake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the measure before us, H.R. 1105, is \nconsistent with the funding levels approved in the budget resolution. \nTherefore, I sincerely believe there is no justification for any \namendment to reopen this bill to further cuts.\n  The Republicans argue there is an overlap between the funds added in \nthe recovery bill and the omnibus bill before us. At the request of \nRepublican Members, Senator Cochran and I called upon our staff to \nconduct a bipartisan review of the impact that the Recovery Act has on \nthe omnibus bill. That review determined that there is, at most, \nminimal overlap. Let me explain. First, there are 900 programs in the \nomnibus bill. Fewer than 20 percent receive stimulus funds. For those \nwho may want to offer an across-the-board cut to this bill, they would \nbe harming more than 80 percent of the programs for the Department of \nAgriculture, Commerce, Justice, Treasury, HUD, Energy, and so on.\n  Second, of the programs with stimulus funds, only 100 have an \nincrease in the 2009 omnibus bill above the 2008 funding level, and \nmany of those increases just cover inflation or are relatively small. \nNearly half of these programs averaged about $5 million in increase \nbetween 2008 and 2009. In many cases this does not even cover the cost \nof inflation.\n  Analysis will show there are 30 programs in the bill before us which \ngrow substantially between 2008 and 2009 by a total of $15 billion. Of \nthe omnibus growth of the $15 billion we measured, $13 billion is \neither entirely unrelated to the stimulus bill or is required in \naddition to the Recovery Act funds to achieve policy objectives or was \nfunded in response to strong political support which would eliminate \nany chance of reducing it.\n  I would like to mention a few critical priorities that would go unmet \nif the Congress were to pass a CR rather than the omnibus. On food and \nmedical product safety inspections, this omnibus bill would provide the \nFood and Drug Administration with an increase of nearly $325 million, \nof which $150 million is included in the current continuing resolution.\n  If this measure is not enacted into law, the proposed increased \nfunding for the FDA would be reduced by $175 million. This reduction in \nfunding would significantly decrease the number of food and medical \nproduct safety inspections, both domestic and overseas, that the FDA \ncould perform.\n  On the matter of consumer product safety, this measure would provide \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission with an increase of $25 million \nor 32 percent above the 2008 level. Without this funding increase, this \nCommission would not be able to implement many of the reforms and new \ndirectives contained in the newly enacted Consumer Product Safety \nImprovement Act to make children's products safer, such as the consumer \ncomplaint database, an overseas presence, and increased inspector \ngeneral staffing, and staffing generally.\n  On the matter of the enforcement of securities law, inadequate \nresources for the Securities and Exchange Commission would hamper the \nability to undertake vigorous enforcement of security laws to help \nbolster the integrity of the financial markets just when such \nenforcement is needed.\n\n[[Page S2663]]\n\n  On the matter of the Federal Aviation Administration, this agency \nfaces a crisis in maintaining an adequate workforce of trained air \ntraffic controllers. Without the increase provided in this omnibus \nbill, the FAA would be forced to freeze or reduce the number of new air \ntraffic controllers the agency can bring on board and train, worsening \nthe experience shortage we already have in our air traffic control \ntowers. One accident is one too many.\n\n  These are only some of the many priorities in this legislation that \nwould go unmet if we fail to pass this bill as written. This omnibus \nbill is a good package. It is bipartisan and noncontroversial. It is in \ncompliance with the budget resolution for the committee.\n  Again, I believe there is no justification for an amendment to reopen \nthis bill to further cuts that would do harm to the important national \npriorities I have mentioned.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Motion to Commit With Instructions, as Modified\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Ensign motion to commit with \ninstructions, as modified with the changes at the desk; and that no \namendments be in order to the motion prior to a vote in relation to the \nmotion to commit; that upon disposition of the motion to commit, \nSenator Hutchison be recognized to offer an amendment which provides \nfor a reduction in funding with no amendment in order to the amendment \nprior to a vote in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion to commit with instructions, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Mr. Ensign moves to commit the bill H. R. 1105 to the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate with instructions \n     to report the same back to the Senate with the following \n     changes:\n       Sec. ___. (a) Amounts appropriated under this Act for--\n       (1) fiscal year 2009 shall be reduced by $18,981,000,000; \n     and\n       (2) fiscal year 2010 shall be reduced by $3,274,000,000.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh), the \nSenator from North Dakota (Mr. Conrad), and the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                   Motion to Commit with Instructions\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk which I \nwould like to call up for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] moves to commit the \n     bill H. R. 1105 to the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate with instructions to report the same back to the \n     Senate with the following change:\n     Amend spending levels in the bill so as to report back a bill \n     with an aggregate non-security spending level at fiscal year \n     2008 funding level, adjusted for inflation, by reducing \n     duplicative or non-essential funding in the $787,000,000,000 \n     stimulus bill also referred to as the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the amendment that was just defeated \nwas to hold us to the 2008 spending levels after the $1 trillion of \nstimulus spending that has already been passed and signed by the \nPresident. My amendment would be for the nonsecurity spending for 2008, \nplus the rate of inflation at 3.8 percent.\n  Basically, what I am doing is asking that we commit the bill to the \nAppropriations Committee to amend and find the places in the omnibus \nbill that is before us or the stimulus bill from 2 weeks ago where we \nwould take out the amount of spending that is duplicative or \nnonessential in the amount of approximately $12 billion. This is a very \nmodest cut, but it would begin to put us on the road toward some fiscal \nresponsibility. We have just passed a $1 trillion stimulus package. It \nis in all of the areas that we could spend money on, and many of those \nare duplicated in what we are taking up on the floor right now.\n\n  So if you take the nonsecurity spending of 2008 and you add the \nregular inflation at 3.8, the Congressional Budget Office says that it \nwould be about $12 billion in cuts that the Appropriations Committee \nwould be able to find. So we are not saying here to slash across the \nboard. We are certainly holding harmless defense and veterans. But we \nare saying that the Appropriations Committee should look at what we \nhave passed and see where there is duplication and cut $12 billion out \nof this spending bill, and then we will be setting the precedent that \nwe are going back to fiscal responsibility, which is setting the budget \nand having a reasonable increase--the rate of inflation--which has been \nthe normal procedure here until this year.\n  When you look at the bill that is before us, it would cost about $408 \nbillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. When you account \nfor the previous continuing resolution, which provided funding for \ndefense, military construction, veterans affairs, and homeland \nsecurity, the top line fiscal year 2009 spending level would exceed $1 \ntrillion. This does not include last year's supplemental nor the \nstimulus which we have just passed, which, when you combine those \nbills, would be another total of $1.4 trillion. That is a 49-percent \nincrease over a 1-year period. If we want to exclude the emergency or \none-time actions, such as supplementals or the stimulus, then you would \nhave an increase over last year's spending by $83 billion, which would \nbe an 8.8-percent increase over last year's spending. That is more than \ntwice the rate of inflation, at 3.8 percent.\n  Let's take some examples. I will look at my committee, Commerce \nCommittee, and the areas of my jurisdiction. We authorize broadband \ngrants. We share this jurisdiction with the Agriculture Committee. We \nprovided a total of $7.2 billion for broadband grants and loans in the \nstimulus package, $4.7 billion for the NTIA, and $2.5 billion for rural \nutility service. Yet in this bill we are adding another $400\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\nmillion. That totals, for the fiscal year 2009 spending, a 4,500-\npercent increase. Why do we need another $400 million when we haven't \neven begun to spend the $7.2 billion from the stimulus yet?\n  How about the National Institute of Standards and Technology? This is \na program I support. It is a valid program, just as the previous one. \nBut here we are increasing the NIST funding by $31 million over last \nyear's funding level and we just gave NIST $220 million not 2 weeks \nago. So the Institute of Standards and Technology would be increased \nnot by $31 million, but $251 million over a 1-year period.\n  These are only some of the items in my own committee's jurisdiction. \nThere are 122 accounts in this bill that received stimulus funding, and \nI support most of what is in this bill because the Appropriations \nCommittee took up these spending bills last year. We had the ability to \namend, in most cases, and we know what is in those bills. However, they \nwere increased on the House side since we took them up last year, and \nnow we have, between now and October 1 of this year, this spending bill \nfor all of the accounts except the security accounts.\n  Why don't we show the American people that we are going to exercise \nfiscal restraint; that we know we have just passed $1 trillion in \nstimulus spending--some of which arguably is stimulus and some of which \narguably is not, but we passed that stimulus bill--and it is going to \ncost our taxpayers $1 trillion. We hope it will increase the revenue, \nbecause we hope it will increase jobs and it will keep people in their \njobs. That is what we want it to do. But now we are in the regular \nappropriations cycle, from today until October 1, and we are talking \nabout $408 billion more in spending, some of which has already been \nprovided for in the stimulus package we passed.\n  The American people, some of whom have lost their jobs, some of whom \nhave received notice that their mortgages are going to be foreclosed \nand their homes are going to be taken, are saying: What are they doing \nup there? How can they spend money like that without any regard to what \nis fiscally responsible? And how we are going to pay it off? Because \nthis is more debt, and we are going to increase, and increase again, \nand everyone who owns something or who has a mortgage understands this.\n  We don't have to do this. We can say today, in a bipartisan way, that \nwe are going to turn a new page; we are going to turn a new page in \nthis Congress and the Appropriations Committee is going to do its work. \nThe Appropriations Committee is going to, in a bipartisan way, start \nlooking at this $408 billion bill and compare it to the 122 accounts in \nthis bill that got stimulus 2 weeks ago and we are going to find $12 \nbillion in cuts--$12 billion out of $408 billion. It could come out of \nthe stimulus. If that were the preferred way to go, we could go back \ninto the stimulus in the outyears. It doesn't have to be in the next 2 \nyears, it can be in the outyears of the stimulus. The Appropriations \nCommittee would be authorized to go into either bill and shrink $12 \nbillion.\n  It seems almost unthinkable that we would not be able to cut $12 \nbillion out of $1.408 trillion of taxpayer money that is coming out of \nWashington and which is debt because we don't have the money to pay for \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment. Let us show the American \npeople that we do understand we should have fiscal responsibility and \nrestraint, as every household in this country is experiencing right \nnow; and that from now forward our appropriations bills are going to be \nin the regular order; that we are going to have a budget, and we are \ngoing to live within that budget, and we are not going to add 5 percent \nor 8 percent and then bring it over here and pass it with no \namendments. That is business as usual. That is not change, it is not \nbipartisanship, and it is not acceptable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 20 minutes and that the time not be counted against Senator \nHutchison's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, as this mammoth appropriations bill is \nbeing considered, there are some ramifications that go way beyond the \nfiscal impact of this bill and the prudence of those measures. It is \nabout the policy implications of some of the things that have been \nwoven into this bill. I am particularly referring to those issues \nreferring to our relationship with Cuba.\n  This Senate has debated over many years issues relating to Cuba, a \nclose neighbor; unfortunately, over the last half century, not a \nfriendly neighbor. I think back to about 1898, when this Senate was \nvery much in favor of Cuba's freedom from Spain and American forces \nintervened. In 1902, Cuba's freedom as an independent nation, freed \nfrom Spain, was granted as a result of actions by our Congress as well \nas our President.\n  As the Senate considers taking steps that would change the current \napproach to policy regarding Cuba, we should reflect on how and why we \nhave the current policy in place and the ramifications of adjusting \nthat policy at this moment in time, even temporarily.\n  The United States-Cuba policy is a living, breathing entity. Over the \nyears, it has been adjusted, loosened, tightened, and tested. Ten \nsuccessive U.S. Presidents have affirmed the policy, bolstering \nprovisions for the sake of those brutalized by the regime, seeking no \nharm to the general Cuban public while denying the regime the resources \nit so desperately needs to keep the stranglehold on power.\n  The United States has always had the general welfare of the Cuban \npeople in mind as evidenced by our generous humanitarian aid and the \npromise it is of untethered assistance. The United States is the No. 1 \nsupplier of humanitarian aid to Cuba. The American people, in 2007 \nalone, sent $240 million in private assistance through reputable \nhumanitarian assistance organizations. The foundation of our policy \ntakes aim at the actions of the regime that expropriated private \nproperty without compensation--property owned by American citizens. On \ntop of this foundation is our message that Cubans deserve access to \nfree and fair elections, basic human rights, and the rule of law.\n  The United States built this policy so as to stand with the Cuban \npeople, who are denied the freedoms we as Americans receive as a \nbirthright. As we consider stripping enforcement of the sanctions, I \nwish to spend some time talking about what this policy means to the \nCuban people, the American Government, and me personally, as someone \nwho witnessed the violence of this revolution firsthand.\n  United States-Cuba relations during the Castro era have largely been \ndefined by Cuba's record of anti-Americanism and aggressive acts of \nhostility. When Fidel Castro took power in the early days of 1959, \nthere were promises of democracy, free press, and elections. But such \nreforms never took place. In fact, a violent dictatorial regime came in \nits place. Many executions took place--killings without trial, without \ndue process. Our President, then Dwight D. Eisenhower, built a \nframework for the anti-Castro policy by placing trade sanctions on \nsugar, oil, and guns.\n  When barrels of Soviet oil began to arrive in Havana, United States \noil companies in Cuba refused to continue refining oil, paving the way \nfor further nationalization of United States assets--oil refineries in \nthis instance. All of these nationalizations took place without \ncompensation to American companies. And to this day, there never has \nbeen compensation. All of the properties owned by Americans were taken. \nLater, little by little, properties owned by Cubans were taken until \nthere was no vestige of private property left in Cuba whatsoever.\n  My own personal story, my own life, was touched, as I was a young boy \nwhen all of this took place. Ultimately, as a result of persecution of \nthose of us who were people of faith, as well as the stifling \natmosphere in a totally controlled society, as a teenager, I emigrated \nto the United States. I watched firsthand the tensions between Cuba and \nthe United States in a very personal way.\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\n  I remember watching the television and the news accounts of tensions \nrising between the United States and Cuba--escalating and leading up to \nthe Cuban Missile Crisis.\n  That began in July of 1962, when Raul Castro went to Moscow, and the \nbonds between Cuba and Russia strengthened.\n  The Castro brothers engaged with Russia and agreed to allow the \nSoviets to deploy nuclear missiles, under Moscow's jurisdiction on the \nisland of Cuba. By the fall of 1962, Soviet freighters began delivering \nshipments of middle-range ballistic missiles.\n  In an address to the nation on October 22, 1962, on the eve of my \n16th birthday, President John F. Kennedy warned of the imminent danger \npresented by the emerging Soviet-Cuba alliance.\n  In describing Cuba's nuclear strike capabilities, Kennedy said:\n\n       Several of them include medium range ballistic missiles, \n     capable of carrying a nuclear warhead for a distance of more \n     than 1,000 nautical miles. Each of these missiles, in short, \n     is capable of striking Washington, D.C., the Panama Canal, \n     Cape Canaveral, Mexico City, or any other city in the \n     southeastern part of the United States, in Central America, \n     or in the Caribbean area.\n\n  Five days later, in a letter to Russian Primer Nikita Khrushchev, \nFidel Castro offered the island in sacrifice and urged the Soviets to \nuse nuclear weapons against the United States if necessary.\n  Let's be clear, the Castro regime, under Fidel and Raul Castro, \nthen--as they are today--in power, wanted first strike nuclear attacks \nagainst the United States. Fidel Castro urged the Russians to let the \nmissiles fly toward our soil.\n  Fortunately for all, Khrushchev's response to the Castro request was \nto urge, ``. . . patience, firmness and more firmness.''\n  And these events are the foundation for U.S. Cuba policy; brutality, \nthe theft of U.S.-owned assets, and the threat of nuclear catastrophe. \nAll of these things perpetrated by the Castro brothers who were in \npower in 1959, and who remain in power today.\n  In the years between the Cuban Missile Crisis and now, the United \nStates has made many good faith efforts and attempts to unilaterally \nengage Cuba and restore relations.\n  Without fail, every single attempt has failed due to the actions of \nthe Castro regime.\n  Several attempts involved our offering concessions similar to those \nin the bill before us today.\n  In 1975, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, during President Gerald \nFord's presidency, tried to broker a deal with Cuba that would have \nlifted the trade sanctions and normalized relations. But the regime \nchose another route. It wanted to project power abroad. It was more \ninterested in acting as a surrogate of the Soviets than it was in \nbetter relations with the United States. So Cuba sent troops to Angola. \nThese troops engaged in a war as surrogates of the Soviet Union, where \nCuban men died and where the Cuban Armed Forces were engaged in battle. \nThey seized the capital city of Luanda, and the group then proclaimed \nindependence from Portugal.\n\n  In an effort to promote peace and stability, Secretary Kissinger had \nno choice but to tell Cuba that as long as they had troops in Africa, \nthe deal to normalize relations with Cuba was off the table.\n  In April 1980, during the Presidency of Jimmy Carter the U.S. \nGovernment once again reached out to the Cuban regime. This was \nrebuffed in a different way. This time it was as a result of more than \n10,000 Cubans who were seeking asylum in the Peruvian Embassy; Cuban-\nAmerican exile groups reached out to the island asking if willing \nCubans could be allowed safe passage to the United States.\n  The response from the Cuban people was overwhelming and more than \n125,000 Cubans fled for freedom in what became known as The Mariel \nboatlift. In the months that the boatlift took place, the U.S. \nestablished an interests section in Havana and reciprocated by allowing \nCuba to establish theirs in Washington.\n  This would have been a bright spot for U.S.-Cuba relations except for \nthe fact that the Castro regime took advantage of our generosity.\n  As thousands of Cubans lined up for the chance to live in freedom, \nthe Castro regime opened its prisons and mental hospitals and sent \npatients and their worst criminals, murderers, thieves, and drug \ndealers into the United States with the idea that they would be turned \nloose to wreak havoc in the U.S.\n  This was not only cynical but also an act of aggression during a time \nwhen President Carter had extended a hand of friendship.\n  Once discovered, the Castro regime refused to take back the criminals \nand many were absorbed by our prison system where they remain to this \nday because they will not accept them back.\n  The Mariel Boatlift, as it is now known, was symbolic of the desire \nof the Cuban people to live freely and the flight of the people of Cuba \nto friendlier places, but also of the frustrating attempts to have a \nbetter relationship with the Cuban government.\n  Frustrated with the conditions allowed by the Cuban regime, more than \n125,000 Cubans made the journey to the United States. Many were \nreunited with family and friends, and all had a chance at a better \nlife.\n  In February 1982, the U.S. Secretary of State added Cuba to the list \nof countries supporting international terrorists. The U.S. State \nDepartment issued a report detailing Cuba's activities.\n  The State Department asserted that Cuba had, quote, ``encouraged \nterrorism in the hope of provoking indiscriminate violence and \nrepression, in order to weaken government legitimacy and attract new \nconverts to armed struggle.''\n  Cuba was noted to have very active operations throughout Central \nAmerica and especially in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala.\n  It was reportedly providing, ``advice, safe haven, communications, \ntraining, and some financial support to several violent South American \norganizations.''\n  The long record of the Cuban government's lack of respect for human \nlife extends beyond the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. In 1996, the Castro \nregime engineered a civilian murder that shocked the conscience of all \nAmericans.\n  On February 24, 1996, the regime ordered the shoot down of two \nunarmed civilian planes flying over international waters on a \nhumanitarian mission.\n  Four people were killed. Three U.S. citizens and a permanent U.S. \nresident; Armando Alejandre, Jr., Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and \nPablo Morales.\n  These men were part of a Florida-based humanitarian organization \ncalled ``Brothers to the Rescue,'' a group credited with spotting and \nsaving the lives of thousands of Cubans who spotted and helped rescue \nCubans trying to raft across the Florida Straits.\n  Following a thorough Federal investigation, it was determined the \nregime premeditated the shoot down as part of a conspiracy called \nOperation Scorpion--a mission designed to send a message to the Cuban \nexile community.\n  In the months leading up to the shoot down, Cuban-piloted MiG jets \npracticed intercepting and firing on slow-moving planes similar to \nthose flown by the Brothers.\n  Further, the regime infiltrated an agent into Brothers for the sole \npurpose of encouraging the group to fly into the regime's death trap.\n  This agent disappeared the day before the shoot down and reappeared \nin Havana to denounce the humanitarian group.\n  The Southern District of Florida would eventually find and charge 14 \nindividuals including Cuban spies.\n  The reaction from the international community was swift and harsh.\n  The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution condemning \nCuba.\n  The European Union followed suit. Here in the United States, we \nstrengthened sanctions against Cuba through the Helms-Burton Act.\n  A known state-sponsor of terror, the Cuban regime engaged in \npremeditated murder, in international airspace.\n  And the same people who orchestrated this unprovoked attack, Fidel \nand Raul Castro, are still in power today.\n  Incidents such as these strengthen the resolve of Cubans looking for \na better life.\n  Jose Marti, a Cuban hero, referred to as the ``Apostle for Cuban \nIndependence,'' once said, ``Man loves liberty, even if he does not \nknow that he loves it. He is driven by it and flees from it where it \ndoes not exist.''\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\n  Many have fled Cuba for our shores.\n  During the early days of the regime from 1959 to 1962, it is \nestimated that the U.S. resettled 200,000 Cuban refugees.\n  There are well over 1.5 million Cuban refugees in the U.S. and many \nmore in Spain, Mexico, and throughout Latin America and the world where \nthe Cuban Diaspora has gone, escaping tyranny and seeking freedom.\n  According to the State Department:\n\n       These include former political prisoners, persecuted \n     religious minorities, human rights activists, forced labor \n     conscripts, and those discriminated against or harmed based \n     on their political or religious beliefs.\n\n  Those who choose to stay behind and courageously oppose the regime's \nradical ways are subjected to violence, torture, and even murder.\n  According to Armando Lago, an economist who has attempted to compile \na list of every person killed since the start of the Cuban revolution, \nRaul Castro was personally responsible for 550 executions in 1959 \nalone--executed without trial, without cause, without mercy--Raul \nCastro, the figurehead of Cuba's modern regime.\n  Lago has documented 500 murders by prison guards, 500 deaths from \nmedical neglect, 200 suicides of political prisoners, and more than \n1,000 assassinations and disappearances.\n  Those who have voiced opposition to the regime's policies have been \nforced to endure harsh consequences.\n  Under the Cuban Criminal Code, the regime has the legal authority to \ndetain and arrest anyone deemed not in line with the Communist State.\n  These individuals are defined under Article 103 of the Cuban Criminal \nCode as:\n\n       Any person who incites against the social order, \n     international solidarity or the communist State, by means of \n     oral or written propaganda or in any other way; prepares, \n     distributes or possesses propaganda . . . Any person who \n     disseminates false news or malicious predictions likely to \n     cause alarm or discontent among the population, or public \n     disorder . . . [or] Any person who permits utilization of the \n     mass communication media shall be punished with one to four \n     years imprisonment.\n\n  Once in prison, these individuals are subjected to unsanitary \nconditions, harassment, and beatings.\n  Here are just a few of the conditions reported by the Inter-American \nCommission on Human Rights.\n\n       The nutrition and hygienic situation, together with the \n     deficiencies in medical care continue to be alarming and have \n     caused numerous medical problems among the prison population. \n     Anemia, diarrhea, skin diseases and also parasitism due to \n     polluted water, appear to be commonplace in the majority of \n     the country's prisons, while in some such as the Manacas and \n     Combinado del Este facilities cases of tuberculosis have been \n     recorded.\n       Moreover, inmates who have made any form of protest about \n     the treatment received or who reject reeducation, which \n     according to information received consists of political and \n     ideological training, have been subjected to reprisals such \n     as beatings, being shut up in punishment cells (which are \n     extremely small, with the door closed and where the prisoner \n     can be kept for months without seeing the light of the sun), \n     being transferred to prisons normally far from where their \n     families live, suspension of family visits, or denial of \n     medical treatment.\n\n  This is in sharp contrast to the much publicized detention facility \nin Guantanamo. I have visited there and conditions are as good there or \nbetter than those in Florida jails. Organizations can visit Guantanamo. \nThat is the only jail in Cuba that can be visited by an international \norganization like the Red Cross. The Cuban government refuses any human \nrights organization permission to visit their prisons.\n  The fact is the only uninspected, deplorable prisons in Cuba are \nthose run by the Cuban government. Their gulag continues today \nunchecked, and would continue even in spite of us reaching out through \nthis bill in this misguided way.\n  According to the U.S. State Department's 2008 Report on Cuban Human \nRights released last week:\n\n       . . . the government continued to deny its citizens their \n     basic human rights and committed numerous, serious abuses.\n       The government denied citizens the right to change their \n     government.\n\n  In describing these abuses of human rights, the report states:\n\n       The following human rights problems were reported: beatings \n     and abuse of detainees and prisoners, including human rights \n     activists, carried out with impunity; harsh and life-\n     threatening prison conditions, including denial of medical \n     care; harassment, beatings, and threats against political \n     opponents by government-recruited mobs, police, and State \n     Security officials; arbitrary arrest and detention of human \n     rights advocates and members of independent professional \n     organizations; denial of fair trial; and interference with \n     privacy, including pervasive monitoring of private \n     communications.\n\n  The report notes,\n\n       . . . severe limitations on freedom of speech and press; \n     denial of peaceful assembly and association; restrictions on \n     freedom of movement, including selective denial of exit \n     permits to citizens and the forcible removal of persons from \n     Havana to their hometowns; restrictions on freedom of \n     religion; and refusal to recognize domestic human rights \n     groups or permit them to function legally.\n\n  One of the political prisoners mentioned in the State Department \nreport is a man named Tomas Ramos Rodriguez, who was released on June \n16 after 18 years in prison.\n  Following his release, Tomas Ramos noted that ``prison authorities \nbeat prisoners with truncheons on a near-daily basis with impunity. \nFamilies of prisoners continued to report that prison staff sometimes \ngoaded inmates with promises of rewards [if they would] beat a \npolitical prisoner.''\n  In describing the prison conditions, Tomas Ramos recalled the ``cell \nfloors that had standing pools of water contaminated with sewage.''\n  Additionally, the report tells the story of a physician named Rodolfo \nMartinez Vigoa, who complained to the Ministry of Public Health about \nthe condition of the local health clinic in Artemisa as well as the \nsalaries of his employees.\n  In response, instead of taking care of the problem, the regime stood \nby as ``approximately 300 persons arrived at Martinez's house and \nshouted insults, calling him a traitor and a counter revolutionary. The \ngovernment later stripped Martinez of his medical license.''\n  There is a long litany of the human rights abuses that exist in Cuba. \nThe fact is, with these conditions, we would dare not have a free-trade \nagreement with Colombia because of concerns about human rights. \nPresident Obama, during his campaign, indicated he was concerned about \nhuman rights conditions in Colombia so, therefore, he would not be for \na free-trade agreement with Colombia. It would seem to me that to be \nconsistent, he would have to veto this bill if, in fact, it contains a \nrelaxation of trade with Cuba, particularly if it gets into the area of \nproviding credits, which is what this bill would do, to those in Cuba \nwho do not pay their bills.\n  The fact is, there have been some pretend changes in Raoul Castro's \nregime since he took over Cuba. Citizens are allowed to use cell \nphones. That sounds like a great thing. The problem is the average \nCuban makes $17 a month. The average cell phone in Cuba costs about \n$64. With the activation fee as high as $120, never mind the contract \nfee on a month-to-month basis.\n  Another change is Cuban citizens can now stay in hotel rooms that \nhave been historically reserved only for tourists. The problem is, \nhotel rooms cost as much as 11 times the average monthly salary of a \nCuban. These are not changes, these are sham assurances aimed at hiding \nthe regime's struggle to remain financially solvent.\n  One clear change that has occurred is the rise of short-term arrests \nfor so-called dangerous activity. Arbitrary detentions of prodemocracy \nactivists have increased five times, from 325 in 2007 to 1,500 in 2008. \nThese are just those that have been documented. Hundreds more, I am \nsure, take place that would be difficult to document because they \nhappened in parts of the country where our diplomats certainly are not \nallowed to travel, and certainly there are no human rights \norganizations that could monitor it.\n  The regime's promise of change has fallen short of what the Cuban \npeople want and deserve. Where are the anticipated reforms? There have \nbeen 2 years of Raoul's rule and nothing has happened.\n  Even the most modest calls for reform go unanswered. Since the \naverage Cuban earns $17 a month, but the prices of goods and services \nare almost what they are here, many families find it very difficult to \nget by.\n  For those Cubans who have family members living abroad, here in the \nU.S. or Spain or elsewhere, they can receive remittances without a \nGovernment penalty. But the Cuban Government, unlike any other \nGovernment in the world, takes 20 percent from any incoming money.\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\n  A person living in the United States who sends funds to Brazil, \nEcuador, Colombia, or China, they can expect to pay a private \ntransaction fee of somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.5 percent. The \nCuban Government takes a 20-percent cut right off the top. In this bill \nwe will unilaterally be letting the Cuban Government receive unlimited \nremittances, asking them to do nothing--unilaterally lifting the \nrestrictions on remittances while asking the Cuban Government to do \nnothing.\n  Would it not be nice if we were to tell the Cuban Government that in \nexchange for allowing them to now receive unlimited remittances, which \nmay not be a bad thing, then they should, in fact, act in a way that \nallows the poor people of Cuba and those here sacrificing to send them \nhelp, not to be taking a 20-percent cut from the moneys they send to \ntheir relatives and loved ones in Cuba. These are not measures designed \nto serve the interests of the Cuban people.\n  But there is another yet darker side to this regime, as the anti-\nAmericanism and the antagonism to our country has exemplified the \nactions of this regime throughout its time. Cuba and its anti-\nAmericanism has fallen in line with Venezuela.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to have 5 \nadditional minutes to conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. The relationship between Venezuela and Cuba is very \nclose and obviously designed in their alliance to exercise an anti-\nAmerican policy. But it does not stop there. It also includes the very \ndangerous Government of Iran.\n  Fidel Castro visited Iran in 2001. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Cuba \nin 2006, following a visit in 2000 by then-President Khatami. The fact \nis, Chavez is in and out of Cuba regularly. The fact is, these \ngovernments are functioning as an alliance of sorts in the region, \ntrying to thwart and provoke an anti-American attitude.\n  Before voting on this spending bill, we ought to give serious \nconsideration to what changing the U.S. policy toward Cuba would mean \ngoing forward. While some may feel that the U.S. policy is punitive, it \nwas created with the interests of the Cuban people in mind. Relaxing \nrestrictions and allowing additional remittances would provide the \nregime with additional revenue, cash that would help it maintain its \nrepressive policies.\n  According to the Cuban Assets Control Regulation: Persons visiting a \nmember of the immediate family, who is a Cuban national, for a period \nnot to exceed 14 days, those are allowed today once every 3 years.\n  What is likely to happen under these proposed changes in the omnibus \nis a spike increase in tourist travel under the guise of humanitarian \nactivity. That does not serve the interest of the Cuban people and \nthose who seek freedom inside Cuba.\n  In addition to that, this legislation before us would extend credit \nthrough the U.S. banking system to a Cuban nation that recently \ndisclosed it owes more than $29 billion to the Paris Club, a debt they \nstopped making payment on back in the 1980s.\n  In fact, Cuba has the second worst credit of any nation in the world. \nAnd to that country, we are now proposing, in this legislation, in \nthese financial times we are living in, to provide the Cuban Government \nwith credit that can purchase agricultural goods in this country and \nalso medicine, in fact, to the tune of some $780 million a year.\n  They have been doing just fine paying cash on the barrel head. This \nbill will give them credit. Why would we do that to this Cuban \nGovernment? Why would we do that to this enemy of the United States, \nwhen we would not sign and ratify a free-trade agreement with a country \nsuch as Colombia, which is a friend, a partner, an ally.\n  As we consider changing U.S. policy regarding Cuba, why are we doing \nit in a way where we ask for nothing? We tie neither of the changes \ncalled for in this omnibus to any yardstick of improvement. We do not \ncall for the release of political prisoners; we do not call for \nlowering of the remittance fee from 20 percent to something more \nreasonable; we do not ask for any signs of positive behavior. We just \nlay the changes out there and then hope for the best. That is not the \nway we ought to approach a regime that has rebuffed our overtures for \nnormal relations and humanitarian aid and instead seeks to undermine \nour alliances and our interests in the region.\n  The fact is, the Cuban Government is no friend of the United States. \nThis is not just some benign dictator in Latin America; this is a \ngovernment that purposely, during the entire time that it has existed, \nhas had an antagonism and has exhibited every type of hostility toward \nthe United States, which it continues to exhibit to this day.\n  Now, there are those who believe that Raul Castro is a reformer. \nAfter 2 years in power, as I pointed out earlier, little or no reforms \nhave taken place. Great hopes were raised by him with many who are \nhoping for some sign. Yesterday, those signs of change were even \nfurther dashed when he had a major shakeup in his Government, and \nCarlos Lage, who has essentially been the Prime Minister of the Cuban \nGovernment, and one of those people whom folks believed was, in fact, a \nreformer, and the hopes were all pinned that if Lage would take over, \nthat he might be the next President--in fact, he was fired yesterday, \nand he is no longer any sign of hope for undermining change in Cuba.\n  In fact, what happened yesterday in Cuba, by any other standard, by \nany other measure in any other country would be considered a military \ncoup. We already have a totalitarian system. Now Raul Castro has put \nall of his friends from the military, all aging people in their \nseventies and older, as close to him as he can put them. Some of them \nare the most radical, the most vicious of those who have enforced \nCuba's totalitarian regime over the years that it has existed, and they \nare now in the throes of government.\n  So, essentially, what we have here is not an example of a change in \nregime but one that is only consolidating power, trying to only exact \nmore repression from its people, while at the same time exhibiting \nhostility and anti-Americanism anywhere that it goes and anywhere that \nit speaks.\n  So I would hope we can have this debate outside of this omnibus bill \nbecause it would be great to have a discussion on what our policy ought \nto be on Cuba--not to have it lumped into this massive spending measure \nthat has to be passed by Friday. I would love for us to talk about Cuba \nin terms of how we encourage respect for human rights, how we encourage \nthis Government to behave as a normal, law-abiding nation. The fact is, \nthis unilateral act which, frankly, would not be met with any \nreciprocity is a mistake. It is a sign that we are trying now to \nlegislate policy in a bill that is about spending and a very dramatic \nchange in U.S. foreign policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 596\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 596 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 596.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require the use of competitive procedures to award \n  contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements funded under this Act)\n\n       On page 1120, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n\n                     prohibition on no-bid earmarks\n\n       Sec. 414.  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to make any payment in \n     connection with a contract unless the contract is awarded \n     using competitive procedures in accordance with the \n     requirements of section 303 of the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253), section \n     2304 of title 10, United States Code, and the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, none \n     of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this \n     Act may be awarded by grant or cooperative agreement unless \n     the process used to award such grant or cooperative agreement \n     uses competitive procedures to select the grantee or award \n     recipient.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have to identify with the words of \nSenator\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\nHutchison about how the American public have to view this bill, \nespecially in light of the fact of the stimulus bill we just passed. I \nwill add some more to those comments as we go through this amendment.\n  This is a very straightforward amendment. It has been voted on by the \nSenate several times. Last time it passed 97 to 0. All it requires is \nthat the money expended in this, where appropriate, be competitively \nbid.\n  I am sure there is going to be people who vote against this this time \nbecause of the situation in which we find ourselves. I wonder how you \ngo back to your State and say that you do not think we ought to \ncompetitively bid the money we are going to spend on behalf of the \nAmerican people. But some are going to say that.\n  We will hear all sorts of things. What this requires is all \ncontracts, all grants, and cooperative agreements awarded under this \nact to be competitively bid. What do we know about competitive bids and \nwhat do we know that President Obama campaigned on? His campaign was, \nanything over $25,000 in the Federal Government ought to be \ncompetitively bid. So I have no doubt that my friend, the President, \nwill endorse this idea. It is an essential part of his campaign to help \nus clean up the corruption, clean up the cost excesses, and clean up \nthe overruns that we have seen.\n  The other thing is, we already have several laws that require it. But \nthen we have words in the appropriations bill that exempt us from those \nlaws requiring competitive bidding. So what do we do in this bill? We \nactually take away the enforcement of existing statutes so we do not \nhave to competitively bid. Is it not interesting that the reason we do \nnot want competitive bids mainly has to do with earmarks. It has to do \nwith the fact that people have earmarks in the bill that they want to \ngo to a certain set of people; maybe not the best qualified to perform \nthat function or task under which the Government wants this service to \nbe done, but you can bet your bottom dollar it is where the Senator or \nthe Congressman wants it to go so he can get credit for it.\n  So not only do we have a tendency for less than sunshine, what we \nhave bred is tremendous inefficiency. And it goes back to the very idea \nof why earmarks are so damaging to this country, which is because they \ngive elevation and attention to the politically entitled money class. \nThat is where 80 percent of the 7,700 earmarks in this bill are; they \nare to the politically entitled money class in this country, the people \nwho can give campaign donations. That is who they are to.\n  So we do not want competitive bidding because the person we are \ncounting on sending money back for a campaign contribution will not get \nthe contract. So the deal does not get completed. In May 2006, the \nSenate voted 98 to 0 to require that we have competitive bidding on the \nstimulus package. We voted 97 to 0. What did we do in conference? They \ntook it out so their friends do not have to competitively bid. Where I \ncome from, in Oklahoma, we call that corruption. We call it corruption. \nThat is a tough word. But that is what is going on with a lot of the \nmoney that our grandchildren are going to pay back that is going to go \non this bill and in the stimulus bill.\n  The other reason we should do this is because no-bid contracts \nhistorically, when you look at them, never give value. What we get is \ncost overruns.\n  Great example: The census this next year is going to cost close to \n$20 billion. The census in 2000 cost $10 billion. Now we have to be \nscratching our head to say, why would it double? Well, $1 billion of \nthat is because the Census Bureau had a no-bid contract for electronic \ndata collection that fell on its face.\n  In spite of oversight by this body, in spite of assurances that it \nwould not happen, we wasted $800-plus million on one contract that we \ncannot utilize anything from. That is the competency of no-bid \ncontracts. If we do a review of this bill in the future, and we did not \nput in competitive bidding, we are going to see that same thing to a \nlesser degree across the whole board.\n  The other thing, the reason we should use competitive bidding, is \nthat all of us would do it if it was our own money. We would want to \nget value. We would want to make sure we got the most value for the \ndollar that was spent.\n  We do not do that because it is not our money. Now there is a \nCongressman on the other side from Arizona who has above his desk \nwritten in great big red ink: The greatest pleasure in the world is to \nspend somebody else's money. But it instills all sorts of mischief when \nwe do it.\n  So this is very straightforward, very direct. There are no tricks. It \njust says: Let's do what everybody else in the country would do who was \nmaking the decision about spending $410 billion. They would make sure \neach segment of it got some competitive bidding so we could reassure \nourselves that at least we were getting value. It is not hard to do. It \nis easy guidelines. It is straightforward. Let's not exempt this bill \nfrom that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 608\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call \nup amendment 608.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 608.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funds for the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights \n  Crime Act from funds already provided for the Weed and Seed Program)\n\n       On page 135, line 6, strike the period and insert ``of \n     which $10,000,000 shall be available for grants to state or \n     local law enforcement for expenses to carry out prosecutions \n     and investigations authorized by the Emmett Till Unsolved \n     Civil Rights Crime Act established under Public Law 110-\n     344.''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is an amendment that is about a serious issue. I \nagree that $10 million in a bill of $410 billion is not a lot of money \nin relationship, but let me tell you what this $10 million is going to \ndo. There are 100 unsolved civil rights murders from the 1950s and \n1960s and 1970s that have not been investigated, that have not come \nforward because Congress hasn't put the money there.\n  Last year, under great fanfare, several of my colleagues were \ncritical of me because I wanted to pay for it as we passed the Emmett \nTill Unsolved Civil Rights Crime bill. What I said in opposing that \nbill initially, which I never was successful in getting it paid for, \nwas that there is plenty of money at the Justice Department if we just \ndirect the Justice Department to put $10 million to this. There are \nthree cases recently that are coming due, three that have been solved \nnow. We have several other leads. Timing is of the essence.\n  What I was told is: No, we will appropriate this money this year. \nThat is what we were told. I won't go into the five pages of quotes by \nthe general cosponsors of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime \nbill, about how they would put the money in right now. Guess what is \nnot in this bill. What is not in this bill is any money to the Justice \nDepartment to be directed to the Emmett Till unsolved civil rights \ncrimes. They said to my staff: Don't worry about it. There is plenty of \nmoney at the Justice Department to do it. So the same argument that was \nnot good enough last year when we tried to pay for it is now turned \naround, and they say: It is the same amount of money. We now have it, \nin their judgment. But we didn't last year.\n  The fact is, there is a sham being perpetrated. It is to claim a \nmoral position and say you will fund something and then, when it comes \ntime to have to give up an earmark or have to eliminate something else, \nyou can't quite have the courage to pull up to the level of moral \ntransparency and keep your commitments.\n  The information is fading away quickly. They are old crimes. People \nwho have testimony are dying and won't be available for the future. Yet \nwe have the insistence to say it doesn't matter to spend that money \nnow.\n  There is nothing in this bill more important than solving unsolved \ncivil rights crimes. The reason is because it says something about our \njustice system. It says we realize that justice delayed is justice \ndenied, and the hurt and trauma that came out of this country in the \ncivil rights movement will\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\nonly get closed when we have true justice. For us to now in a petty way \nsay: We will get it next year, do you realize that ``next year'' is \ncoming September 30, and 6 months from now, two or three more witnesses \nwill be gone, two or three more people who committed a crime will not \nget convicted because the evidence and the testimony will be gone? Yet \nwe can't bring ourselves to the point of saying this is a priority. \nThis says something about who we are, that we are going to give up a \nfew earmarks so we can actually stand on the side of justice. The \nhypocrisy of the debate we heard last year and then what we hear today \nat the staff level about why we can't fund this is unfortunate.\n  I advise the Senator from Connecticut, I have two more amendments to \noffer. I will talk a very short time and then be finished, if that is \nOK with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend. I have come over to speak in \nmorning business, and I will be happy to wait until he is done.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will come back to the floor and discuss these \namendments again, but I will give the courtesy to my friend from \nConnecticut of being fairly short.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 623\n\n  The next amendment is amendment No. 623. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be set aside and amendment number 623 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I object on behalf of the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I renew my request to set aside the pending amendment and \ncall up amendment No. 623.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, having heard from higher authorities, I \nwithdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit taxpayer dollars from being earmarked to 14 \n   clients of a lobbying firm under Federal investigation for making \n  campaign donations in exchange for political favors for the group's \n                                clients)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     none of the funds made available under this Act may be \n     obligated or otherwise expended for any congressionally \n     directed spending item for--\n       (1) DIRECT Methanol Fuel Cell (IN);\n       (2) Solar Energy Windows and Smart IR Switchable Building \n     Technologies (PA);\n       (3) Adaptive Liquid Crystal Windows (OH);\n       (4) Anti-idling Lithium Ion Battery Program, California \n     (CA) ;\n       (5) Advanced Engineering Environment for Sandia National \n     Lab (MA);\n       (6) Multi-Disciplined Integrated Collaborative Environment \n     (MDICE) (MO);\n       (7) Hydrogen Optical Fiber Sensors (CA);\n       (8) Flexible Thin-Film Silicon Solar Cells (OH);\n       (9) CATALYST: Explorations in Aerospace and Innovation \n     education program;\n       (10) Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, for \n     renovation and equipment;\n       (11) Mount Aloysius College, Cresson, PA, for college \n     preparation programs;\n       (12) Washington & Jefferson College, Washington, PA, for \n     science education outreach programs;\n       (13) DePaul University, Chicago, IL, for math and science \n     teacher education in Chicago Public Schools; and\n       (14) Nazareth Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, for renovation \n     and equipment.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I gave my assurance yesterday to the majority leader that \nI would offer no division of any amendments so he would not worry that \nwe would have more votes than he wanted. But I will make the point at \nthis time, at the rate we are going, we will have less than 12 \namendments on a $410 billion bill that spends $363 million a page. I \nwould love for every American to know we are so good in the committee \nthat none of us should be able to have significant amendments to modify \nthis bill that I guarantee has $50 billion worth of waste, fraud, \nabuse, or lack of direction in how the money is spent. So to be able to \nget four amendments on the floor, just four on a $410 billion bill, \nwhich we are only going to spend 3 days on, I have to agree to limit \nwhat the American people should know about this bill. That tells you \nwhere we are in the Senate. But I agreed to do that to be able to at \nleast bring some forward.\n  This amendment is entitled PMA earmarks. We are in the midst of an \ninvestigation of a lobbying firm that is alleged to have committed some \nvery serious felonies. It is uniquely curious that as this has \nprogressed, they have decided to shut down. However, within the bill, \nnot through necessarily their clients' fault, and not saying what they \nare trying to do was necessarily wrong in terms of the intent of the \nearmark, within this bill are 14 earmarks that you can see, if you have \nany common sense, if you look at the lobbying efforts of the PMA firm \nand then look at campaign contributions in the Congress, you can see a \nvery worrisome pattern. That is the very reason I don't do earmarks. If \nI did earmarks, the last thing I would do would be take any campaign \nmoney from somebody for whom I did an earmark.\n  Needless to say, the accusation and the alleged straw donor technique \nused by this lobbying firm to funnel campaign funds to Members who then \ngive earmarks through this bill, 14 of them listed in this bill--all \nthis amendment does is say: In the cloud of this and the way it looks, \nought we be continuing to do that under the cloud of what look to be \nvery serious allegations of impropriety at the least and, at the worst, \nquid pro quos for placing earmarks in campaign funds?\n  We will vote on this amendment. It probably won't pass. Then the \nAmerican people make a judgment about how well connected we are to \nreality. The stench associated with this investigation is at the root \ncause of us having $300 billion worth of waste a year in Congress in \nthe money we spend. It is at the root cause that we can't get \ncommonsense amendments passed that lack competition, lack funding, real \npriorities in a timely fashion, such as the Emmett Till bill. This is \nat the root of it. It is the pay-to-play game. All this amendment does \nis wipe out those. It just strikes them. It won't delay the bill. It \ndoes nothing but strike them. If they are legitimate, let them come \nback in this next year's bill and be done in an ethical, \nstraightforward, aboveboard, transparent manner that doesn't utilize \nthe concept of under-the-table, false campaign contributions, \nallegedly.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 610\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that that amendment be set aside, and I call \nup amendment No. 610.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 610.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit funding for congressional earmarks for wasteful \n                      and parochial pork projects)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     none of the funds made available under this Act may be \n     obligated or otherwise expended for any congressionally \n     directed spending item for--\n       (1) the Pleasure Beach Water Taxi Service Project of \n     Connecticut;\n       (2) the Old Tiger Stadium Conservancy of Michigan;\n       (3) the Polynesian Voyaging Society of Hawaii;\n       (4) the American Lighthouse Foundation of Maine;\n       (5) the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of John \n     Brown's raid on the arsenal at Harpers Ferry National \n     Historic Park in West Virginia;\n       (6) the Orange County Great Park Corporation in California;\n       (7) odor and manure management research in Iowa;\n       (8) tattoo removal in California;\n       (9) the California National Historic Trail Interpretive \n     Center in Nevada;\n       (10) the Iowa Department of Education for the Harkin grant \n     program; and\n       (11) the construction of recreation and fairgrounds in \n     Kotzebue, Alaska.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a simple little amendment. Out of the 7,700 \nearmarks,\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\nI took 11 that looked a little stinky to me, a little questionable--\njust 11. If I had my way, I would offer an individual amendment on \nevery earmark in this bill, but just 11. I will go through them very \nlightly for a moment, and then I will come back and talk on it later, \nmaybe this evening.\n  I want you to put this in your mind, that this year we are borrowing \n$6,000 from every man, woman, and child. That is how much we are going \ninto debt, $6,000 for every man, woman, and child. Put that in your \nmind as we talk about whether these ought to be a priority: A $1.9 \nmillion earmark for the Pleasure Beach water taxi service in \nConnecticut. That may be great to do, but we are borrowing all this \nfrom our grandkids. Our kids are already broke, so now we are borrowing \nfrom our grandkids. Our kids will never have the same standard of \nliving we have. Now we are going into our grandkids, and next year we \nwill be going into our great grandkids. Should we spend $2 million on a \nwater taxi service? I will show the pictures later of where this is to. \nIt will knock your socks off.\n  There is a $3.8 million earmark to preserve the remnants of the old \nTiger Stadium in Detroit. It may be a good idea to preserve that. \nShould we be doing that now when we are borrowing all that money? Is \nthat a priority for the Congress? If it is really a priority for the \nCongress, I don't belong here. I just don't think the same way the \nCongress thinks if that is a priority right now for us, to preserve an \nold stadium that we are not going to do anything with, and we can \npreserve it later, spending that kind of money.\n  There is $238,000 for the Polynesian Voyaging Society of Honolulu, \nwhich organization runs sea voyages in ancient-style sailing canoes. \nTell me, as we borrow $6,000 from every man, woman, and child in this \ncountry, that is a priority. I can't see it being a priority. I don't \nthink anybody from my State can see that being a priority. I don't know \nabout the rest of the States. I would be interested to hear the answers \nof the Senators who are going to vote against this amendment and what \nthey tell people. I would like to have it in my repertory. I would like \nto know what to tell people about this kind of foolishness.\n  There is a $300,000 earmark to commemorate the 150th anniversary of \nJohn Brown's raid on the arsenal at Harper's Ferry National Historic \nPark in West Virginia. Let's do it for no money. Let's just commemorate \nit, and let's save 300 grand for our grandkids.\n  There is $1.719 million for pig odor and manure management in Ames, \nIA. That goes to Iowa State University. Pigs stink. We know why. We \nknow where they live. So is that a priority for us right now?\n\n  There is $475,000 for the Orange County Great Park in California. \nMore millionaires live there than anywhere else in the world. Yet we \nare going to spend money for a new park now when we are borrowing this \namount of money?\n  Here is my favorite: $200,000 earmarked for tattoo removal in Mission \nHills, CA. We are going to take Federal money, send it to California, \nand say: You can have this money to remove tattoos. I would think under \na personal responsibility platform if you were responsible for getting \na tattoo put on you, you might ought to be responsible for getting it \ntaken off, and I do not think our grandchildren ought to be paying for \nit.\n  There is $1.5 million for the California National Historic Trail \nInterpretive Center. We are going to build another interpretive center \nat a time of economic malaise--as President Obama calls it, a crisis. I \ndo not think it is a crisis. I think we are in a deep slump, but I do \nnot think it is a crisis yet. It is a crisis to those people who have \nlost their job. But the more we say ``crisis,'' the worse we make it. \nBut we are going to do an interpretive center now? Is now the time we \nshould be doing it, knowing we are borrowing the money? Remember, for \nevery $1 million we borrow, we are going to pay back $3 million. I am \nnot including long-term interest costs in any of these numbers.\n  Then there is a $5,471,000 earmark for the Harkin grant program in \nIowa, which says Iowa gets treated differently than every other State \nin this country. They actually get direct money going directly for \npublic education outside all the other programs. We have been doing it \nfor years, but everybody else in this country gets to pay so Senator \nHarkin can look good in Iowa. I have attacked this earmark before. It \nis wrong. It is unfair. It is not befitting the body. But it is going \nto stay in. So we have brandnew schools in Iowa, and the rest of us \ndeal with what we have in our States.\n  Then we have $380,000 for the construction of recreation and \nfairgrounds in a town in Alaska. It may be a good idea. But should we \ndo it now? Should we do it at that cost?\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 623, as Modified\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that on amendment No. 623, \nlines 19 through 21 be removed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator clarify the language to be \nstricken from his amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. On amendment No. 623, lines 19 through 21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 623), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     none of the funds made available under this Act may be \n     obligated or otherwise expended for any congressionally \n     directed spending item for--\n       (1) DIRECT Methanol Fuel Cell (IN);\n       (2) Solar Energy Windows and Smart IR Switchable Building \n     Technologies (PA);\n       (3) Adaptive Liquid Crystal Windows (OH);\n       (4) Anti-idling Lithium Ion Battery Program, California \n     (CA);\n       (5) Advanced Engineering Environment for Sandia National \n     Lab (MA);\n       (6) Multi-Disciplined Integrated Collaborative Environment \n     (MDICE) (MO);\n       (7) Hydrogen Optical Fiber Sensors (CA);\n       (8) Flexible Thin-Film Silicon Solar Cells (OH);\n       (9) CATALYST: Explorations in Aerospace and Innovation \n     education program;\n       (10) Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, for \n     renovation and equipment;\n       (11) Mount Aloysius College, Cresson, PA, for college \n     preparation programs;\n       (12) Washington & Jefferson College, Washington, PA, for \n     science education outreach programs;\n       (14) Nazareth Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, for renovation \n     and equipment.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I will end now so I can yield to my \nfriend, the chairman of my committee, the Senator from Connecticut, so \nhe will have an opportunity to speak on the floor but not before I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a listing of the \nearmarks provided today by Taxpayers for Common Sense.

With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I \nthank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma.\n  (The remarks of Mr. LIEBERMAN are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the motion offered by the Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison, is very similar to the motion of the Senator \nfrom Nevada that the Senate defeated. There is only one difference \nbetween the two motions. This motion allows for the cost of inflation \nto be provided, and the previous one did not.\n  I have already informed the Senate why making reductions in this bill \nis not a good idea, but I wish to remind my colleagues once again that \nthe level of funding in this bill is consistent with the amount \napproved by the Congress in the budget resolution. Second, as the \nSenator from Texas knows, the omnibus bill was written by the \nAppropriations subcommittees in a bipartisan process and these bills \nwere reported out of the committee--five of them unanimously and two \nalmost unanimously. The subcommittees worked with their House \ncounterparts to craft this legislation. It reflects a fair compromise \nbetween the two bodies.\n\n[[Page S2672]]\n\n  But, once again, the argument in favor of cutting the omnibus is that \nthere is overlap between the funds in the Recovery Act and in the \nomnibus bill. As I have noted previously, this simply is not the case. \nThe funds in the Recovery Act are either unrelated to the omnibus or \nwere assumed in the levels approved by the Recovery Act.\n  This motion also suggests that the committee should cut nonessential \nspending. I, for one, would argue that this bill contains only \nessential funds, but I recognize for a few of my colleagues \nnonessential spending equates to earmarks. I wish to remind my \ncolleagues once again that on the question of earmarks, there is $3.8 \nbillion in congressionally directed spending in this bill. This \nrepresents less than 1 percent of the total bill. If you eliminated all \nof the earmarks in this bill, including those of Hawaii and Texas, you \nwould still have to cut at least $8 billion more from other valid \nprograms. If we have to cut this bill to the fiscal year 2008 level, \nthat means there are a number of worthy projects that will have to be \nreconsidered.\n  For example, the State and Foreign Operations chapter of the bill \nprovides a total of $5.5 billion for programs to combat HIV/AIDS--$388 \nmillion above former President Bush's request and $459 million above \nthe fiscal year 2008 request. This increase was supported by Democrats \nand Republicans. Of this amount, $600 million is provided for the \nGlobal Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, which is $400 million above the request. \nAdditionally within the total, $350 million is provided for USAID \nprograms to combat HIV/AIDS. These additional funds, which pay for \nlife-sustaining and antiretroviral drugs, prevention and care programs, \nwould be lost to the detriment of 1 million people who would receive \nlifesaving treatment this year. With this funding, 2 million additional \nHIV infections would be prevented this year. Instead of 10 million \nlives we are saving today, we have the opportunity to save 12 million \npeople. We have the opportunity with this bill to save or care for 1 \nmillion more orphans and vulnerable children who are either infected \nwith HIV or have been orphaned because a parent died from HIV. Do we \nthink that the Senate wants to reconsider this item?\n  Freezing funding would mean $350 million less for the FBI to protect \nour Nation and our communities from terrorism and violent crime. The \nFBI would have to institute an immediate hiring freeze of agents, \nanalysts, and support staff. This will mean 650 fewer FBI special \nagents and 1,250 fewer intelligence analysts and other professionals \nfighting crime and terrorism on U.S. soil. Surely the Senator from \nTexas doesn't want us to go back and reduce funding for the FBI.\n  More than 30 Members requested the committee add funds for operations \nof our national parks. If we have to cut program goals, we will lose \n3,000 park rangers. While there are funds in the Recovery Act for the \nPark Service, these funds were not for rangers or park operations; they \nwere to cover deferred maintenance projects. These are projects that \nare ready to go and can be started almost immediately to stimulate the \neconomy as intended. There is no duplication between the Recovery Act \nand the omnibus for our national parks.\n  I could stand here all day and list example after example of the \ntypes of programs that are funded in this omnibus bill with the \nincreases that the Senator's amendment would eliminate. These examples \nshouldn't come as any surprise to the Members of the Senate, if they \nremember that these bills were written by our subcommittee chairmen and \nranking members in a bipartisan fashion. They were marked up in open \nsession with all Members able to offer amendments and the final product \nwas drafted with our House colleagues on a bipartisan basis. Once \nagain, the omnibus bill is a good package of bills. It is bipartisan, \nit is noncontroversial, and it is in compliance with the budget \nresolution totals for the committee. The idea of stimulus overlap is \nnot based on fact. The question of earmarks is a minor point in the \nsignificant bill that protects Democratic priorities. So I believe this \nbill deserves the support of every Member of the Senate. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this motion.\n  If I may speak on another subject, the Senator from Oklahoma raised \nquestions regarding the Polynesian Voyaging Society. Students learn in \ndifferent ways, and educators are constantly pressed to find inspiring \nways to educate our young people, particularly those who are considered \nat risk. That is what the Polynesian Voyaging Society offers. The \nvoyages organized by the Society help to train educators and scientists \nin ocean resource stewardship. In addition, through the use of the \nInternet, the society interactively communicates with students during \nthe voyage to share the knowledge gained.\n  This initiative supports cultural education programs geared toward \nenhancing leadership skills and cultural knowledge through deep sea \nvoyaging for students. These traditional voyaging skills utilize \nnoninstrument navigation skills whereby participants have to rely upon \nthemselves and their crews to arrive safely at their destination. The \nvoyage is much more than one of miles; it is a voyage of young people \ndiscovering that they are able to accomplish more than they ever \nthought possible.\n  This knowledge of self-reliance and interdependence helps to \ntransform students, especially native Hawaiian students, so they may \nchart a positive future. The program also makes science more accessible \nto school students as they follow the journey. Many students are \nencouraged to study science and care about the environment because of \nthis program. Numerous college science majors mentioned activities on \nthe Polynesian Voyaging Society as the reason why they chose to study \nscience.\n  This leadership opportunity has been shown to be especially effective \nwith at-risk youth diagnosed with mental illness. The success of \ntraditional methods of addressing mental illness in adolescents \ninvolves a strong family support system. One study revealed the \nstudents who participated in this program showed great improvement \nregardless of the support that the student received from family. In \neffect, this program has been able to transcend existing social \nproblems within the student's own family so that these young people can \ngrow and develop into contributing members of the community.\n  As noted in the National Academies' Study, ``Rising Above The \nGathering Storm,'' creating opportunities and incentives for students \nto pursue science studies is a critical component of ensuring America's \nfuture competitiveness. The Polynesian Voyaging Society's programs are \ngeared toward providing such opportunities.\n\n  On a personal note, the program is geared to assist Native Hawaiians, \nin particular. As we find in Native societies throughout the United \nStates, Native Americans have not only been mistreated and victims of \ndiscrimination, they have been deprived of their culture. In earlier \ndays, they were forced to become Christians. They were forced to wear \nsuits. They were forced not to wear feathers.\n  While in this Polynesian program, I have spoken to many of the \nstudents, and there are certain points that should be made. Several \nstudents came up to me, for example, and said, ``I am proud to be a \nHawaiian.'' That is one of the things we have found lacking in Native \nHawaiian youth--pride in their ancestry--especially when they learn \ntheir ancestors took a voyage much longer than the one Columbus took \nacross the Atlantic, double the length, and the Hawaiians knew where \nthey were headed--to Hawaiki, which is presently the State of Hawaii. \nColumbus thought he was going elsewhere, and he got lost. It makes them \na bit proud of their ancestry. They learned their ancestors were great \nwarriors, great voyagers, great administrators, and great farmers. This \nis a very inexpensive way to restore the pride that is much in need \namong our Native Hawaiian youth.\n  I have been told that the assistant leader will be seeking \nrecognition. I am happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, before I make a few remarks about the \nunderlying bill, I want to say that those following this debate on the \nfloor are witnessing a piece of history. Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii \nhas made such amazing contributions to this country. As a young man, \nhis service in World War II led to his being honored\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\nwith the Congressional Medal for his bravery in battle. He has carried \nthe wounds of that battle now for many years. He used his time in the \nservice to inspire him to higher levels of public service in our \nGovernment and beyond the military, serving in Congress and as a U.S. \nSenator from the State of Hawaii. He is, in fact, a legend in the \nhistory of the Senate. I am honored to call him a colleague. \nParenthetically, 6 years ago, when I was sworn in to my second term, I \nchose Senator Inouye to escort me for that swearing-in ceremony because \nof my great respect for him and all he has meant to our country, his \nState of Hawaii, and to me personally.\n  What you just heard in his comments about Native Hawaiians you could \nhave heard as well about his commitment to Native Americans. From the \nbeginning, Danny Inouye has been there to fight for those who \noftentimes were not given the same treatment, same respect, and same \nrights as other Americans. His voice has made a difference time and \ntime again. When he comes to us and talks about this underlying Omnibus \nappropriations bill and some of the programs that will help Native \nHawaiians and Native Americans, it is with a commitment from the heart. \nHe really believes in helping these people, many of whom have been \ntreated badly by the United States in our founding years.\n  I wanted to preface my remarks by saying, for those looking for a \nreason to support this bill, Senator Danny Inouye, our chairman, has \ngiven a good, solid reason, so that we can balance the books and right \nthe wrongs that occurred in previous generations.\n  I want to come down to practical considerations. The pending \namendment would dramatically cut this bill. Some of the cuts would make \na big difference. I look back and remember what happened not that long \nago, over two holiday seasons, when parents and families across America \nwere frightened that the toys they were buying were dangerous. The \npaint contained lead that could have a negative physical impact on a \nchild. We traced many of the toys back to China and found that not only \nwere they careless in their manufacture, but we were careless, as a \ngovernment, in our inspection.\n  The agency responsible for it, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, was one of the small agencies that most people never heard \nof. When it became a scare and concern for parents in America, we \nstarted to pay attention. In my subcommittee, we had this particular \nCommission. I decided to make a substantial change in the funding and \nstaffing so that this Commission could protect Americans not just from \ndangerous toys but dangerous products all around. So what we did in the \nbill was provide $105 million for the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, an increase of $25 million over last year's spending, and \n$10 million above the committee's report. The idea is to put the people \nand resources there and overseas to make sure we protect American \nfamilies and consumers from dangerous products. I think most people \nwould agree that is money well spent. When any of us go into a store \nand buy a product, we assume some agency of the Government took a look \nat it. It turns out that, in many cases, this small Commission could \nnot keep up with that challenge. If the pending amendment by Senator \nHutchison prevails, that money won't be there. This agency will be cut \nback again, and families will be vulnerable again. I don't want that to \nhappen.\n  We also put in $943 million for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. It is an increase of $37 million over the previously \nenacted level. The additional money we are putting into the SEC is a \ndirect result of reports of dereliction of duty and their failure to \nrespond to serious challenges. We all know about the Bernard Madoff \nscandal, where that man created a Ponzi scheme that went undetected and \nunpunished until there were innocent victims all across the United \nStates of this man's chicanery. The SEC, it turns out, had been warned \nyears before and didn't follow through.\n  The SEC has an important role in our free market economy to make \ncertain that stocks and other financial instruments are done in a \ntransparent and honest way. That is why we are increasing the size of \nthe appropriation for this agency. The pending amendment would cut that \nback at a time when we are in such economic turmoil. We need to have \ncertainty as Americans that we are safe when we invest and that \nsomebody in the Government is keeping an eye on those transactions and \nthose companies.\n  The same is true for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It is \nan important Commission that deals with financial instruments, such as \nfutures, and those instruments that relate to things such as the cost \nof oil. We paid close attention to that when gasoline was $4.50 a \ngallon. I provide $146 million through my committee to the CFTC. That \nis a 31-percent increase over last year's appropriation. Why? So they \ncan buy the computers to keep up with the hundreds of thousands and \nmillions of transactions, so they can detect wrongdoing and correct it \nbefore innocent people lose their life savings, and before people who \ncount on the integrity of the American financial institutions are \ndefrauded. I think that is money well spent, and it is money we should \nspend in this instance.\n  I say to those who are cutting back and say: We are just making \nacross-the-board cuts, it is not really going to touch us, there are \nthree specific examples where money is included in this appropriations \nbill to protect American families and consumers, money that is small in \ncomparison to larger appropriations but can make a significant \ndifference in the role of Government and, I guess, the fact that the \nfunction of Government to help the helpless and protect those who need \nit is honored. I hope everybody will come to the floor and think long \nand hard about this bill.\n  I will add one closing fact. Many people remember the flooding that \noccurred in Cedar Rapids, IA, last year. It was devastating. One of the \nbuildings devastated was the courthouse in Cedar Rapids. As a result, I \nhad a request from Senators Charles Grassley and Tom Harkin to come up \nwith emergency funds to rebuild this courthouse in the right way, so \nthat it could be safe and functional after the flooding. We had $182 \nmillion in the 2009 Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and \nContinuing Appropriations bill for that purpose. It is an earmark, make \nno mistake about it. We earmarked the funds for that courthouse that \nwas devastated by floodwaters at the request of Senators Grassley and \nHarkin. I believe this was the right expenditure. It is an earmark that \nwe can justify as being important not just to Iowa but to the Nation. I \nhope both Senators know we listen carefully to them in our \nsubcommittee. With Senator Brownback of Kansas, we work to be \nresponsive to the real needs of our colleagues across America. This is \na responsible bill. I commend it to my colleagues. I hope we can enact \nit soon because on Friday our temporary spending measures will expire, \nand we need a long-term Omnibus appropriations bill so that we can get \nto work on the next fiscal year in an orderly manner, under the \nleadership of Chairman Inouye.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I am overwhelmed by the generous remarks \nof the distinguished Senator from Illinois. Thank you very much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:45 \ntoday, the Senate vote in relation to the Hutchison amendment, with the \n4 minutes prior to the vote equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Hutchison and Inouye or their designees, and that the previous \norder prohibiting amendments prior to a vote remain in effect. Madam \nPresident, the 4 minutes will cause a vote not to be right at 5:45, but \nit will be close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I alert all Members that we have a number \nof people who want to speak in relation to the Coburn amendments. We \nalso are told by the Republican staff that there\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\nare a number of Senators who would be willing to offer amendments on \nthe Republican side. I have spoken to the Republican staff, and they \nsay they can lay down two of those and debate them tonight. That is \nfine with us.\n  Tomorrow, of course, we are going to come in at 9:30. Then we have to \ngo to the House because Prime Minister Brown is here. That is at 10:30. \nAnd then there are other things going on. The Republican leader and I \nhave been invited to a lunch with Prime Minister Brown, and there are \nother things. We have a steering meeting of the Republicans, I \nunderstand, during the lunch hour--I think that is what it is called. \nWe have a chairman lunch. We are not going to be able to have the votes \non any of these amendments until after we finish these things \ntomorrow. That will give us the afternoon to have some votes and find \nout where we are on this bill tomorrow.\n\n  We have had some good debate today. These have been very difficult \namendments. I think they go to the heart of the bill, especially those \noffered by Senator McCain, Senator Ensign, and Senator Hutchison. The \nrest of them I will have comments on at a later time.\n  I hope Senators understand where we are and where we are headed on \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that I be allowed to call up my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Wicker] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 607.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require that amounts appropriated for the United Nations \n Population Fund are not used by organizations which support coercive \n                 abortion or involuntary sterilization)\n\n       On page 927, strike line 14 and all that follows through \n     page 929, line 20, and insert the following:\n       (b) Availability of Funds.--Funds appropriated under the \n     heading ``International Organizations and Programs'' in this \n     Act that are available for UNFPA and are not made available \n     for UNFPA because of the operation of any provision of law, \n     shall be transferred to the ``Global Health and Child \n     Survival'' account and shall be made available for family \n     planning, maternal, and reproductive health activities, \n     subject to the regular notification procedures of the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n       (c) Prohibition on Use of Funds in China.--None of the \n     funds made available under ``International Organizations and \n     Programs'' may be made available for the UNFPA for a country \n     program in the People's Republic of China.\n       (d) Conditions on Availability of Funds.--Amounts made \n     available under ``International Organizations and Programs'' \n     for fiscal year 2006 for the UNFPA may not be made available \n     to UNFPA unless--\n       (1) the UNFPA maintains amounts made available to the UNFPA \n     under this section in an account separate from other accounts \n     of the UNFPA;\n       (2) the UNFPA does not commingle amounts made available to \n     the UNFPA under this section with other sums; and\n       (3) the UNFPA does not fund abortions.\n       (e) Report to Congress and Dollar-for-Dollar Withholding of \n     Funds.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 4 months after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n     submit a report to the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives indicating the amount of funds that the UNFPA \n     is budgeting for the year in which the report is submitted \n     for a country program in the People's Republic of China.\n       (2) Deduction.--If a report submitted under paragraph (1) \n     indicates that the UNFPA plans to spend funds for a country \n     program in the People's Republic of China in the year covered \n     by the report, the amount of such funds that the UNFPA plans \n     to spend in the People's Republic of China shall be deducted \n     from the funds made available to the UNFPA after March 1 for \n     obligation for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the \n     report is submitted.\n       (f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be \n     construed to limit the authority of the President to deny \n     funds to any organization by reason of the application of \n     another provision of this Act or any other provision of law.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added as cosponsors of amendment No. 607: Senator \nEnzi, Senator Bunning, Senator Inhofe, Senator Coburn, Senator Vitter, \nand Senator Grassley.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WICKER. I will yield to the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to the \nSenator's amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I spoke at some length yesterday about \nthis amendment. It deals with one issue and one issue only--whether \nU.S. taxpayer dollars will be provided in this omnibus bill to help \nfund coercive population control policies, such as China's one-child \npolicy--a policy that relies on coerced abortion and forced \nsterilization.\n  Specifically, this pro-child, pro-family, pro-woman amendment would \nrestore the Kemp-Kasten antipopulation control provision, which has \nbeen a fundamental part of our foreign policy for almost a quarter \ncentury. As it has always done, Kemp-Kasten allows the President of the \nUnited States to certify that funds are not used for coercive family \npractices. As it has always done, the provision would allow the \nPresident to release those funds after he has made such a \ncertification.\n  My amendment is needed because the underlying bill reverses this \nlongstanding provision. The omnibus bill\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\nthat we have before us purports to retain Kemp-Kasten, but then it also \nincludes six troubling words that effectively kill the provision. In \naddition to Kemp-Kasten, the bill directs funds to the United Nations \nPopulation Fund, or UNFPA ``notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw.''\n  Perhaps these words were added inadvertently. I don't know. But the \nwords that are added--those six little words--represent a loophole that \nin effect guts Kemp-Kasten and alters this longstanding bipartisan \nforeign policy in the process.\n  Some people may ask why restoring Kemp-Kasten is important, and here \nis why. The U.N. Population Fund, a group that is in line to receive \nsome $50 million in this bill, has actively supported, comanaged, and \nwhitewashed crimes against women under the cover of family planning. \nUnder the Kemp-Kasten provision, the last administration withheld money \nfrom UNFPA for this very reason. I would like to quote then-Secretary \nof State Colin Powell, who stated:\n\n       UNFPA support of and involvement in China's population \n     planning activities allows the Chinese Government to \n     implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion. \n     Therefore, it is not permissible to continue funding UNFPA at \n     this time.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from our Secretary of State.\n  A further analysis by the U.S. State Department of the Chinese \nprogram on family planning reveals this--I will quote from the State \nDepartment analysis:\n\n       China's birth limitation program retains harshly coercive \n     elements in law and practice, including coercive abortion and \n     involuntary sterilization.\n\n  Does anyone in this Senate want to spend U.S. funds to support these \nactivities: coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization? I think we \nought to have a unanimous consensus in the Congress that we have no \nbusiness spending our taxpayers' dollars on such things. The report \ngoes on to say:\n\n       The State Department summarized these practices in its 2007 \n     China Country Report on Human Rights Practices. . . . These \n     measures include the implementation of birth limitation \n     regulations, the provision of obligatory contraceptive \n     services, and the use of incentives and penalties to induce \n     compliance.\n\n  Further in the report, and I continue to quote:\n\n       China's Birth Limitation Program relies on harshly coercive \n     measures such as so-called ``social maintenance'' fees.\n\n  And to skip down further:\n\n       In families that already have two children, one parent is \n     often pressured to undergo sterilization. A number of \n     provinces have legal provisions that require a woman to have \n     an abortion if her pregnancy violates government regulations. \n     . . .\n\n  I wish we could stop this practice worldwide. China is a sovereign \nnation, and they have the power to impose these laws on their people. \nBut taxpayer funds should not be spent from the U.S. Treasury to assist \nan organization that funds such practices in China.\n  The most recent State Department report on UNFPA activities shows \nthat their funds are indeed funneled to Chinese agencies that \ncoercively enforce the very practices I just read about. Are we to \nbelieve that in less than a year the UNFPA has changed its practices? \nThat is not a bet I am willing to take with the taxpayers' money.\n  The Wicker amendment should be adopted to once again give the \nPresident, President Obama, the opportunity to certify that UNFPA, or \nany other organization, is not participating in family planning \ntechniques such as the harsh techniques I just read about.\n  My amendment does not represent a radical shift or departure from \nwhat is normal. In fact, it simply returns the language in this bill to \nlanguage that was agreed upon by both Republicans and Democrats in last \nyear's Foreign Operations appropriations bill during a time when \nDemocrats controlled the House of Representatives and controlled the \nSenate of the United States. The language that I am offering was agreed \nupon by Republicans and Democrats.\n  Finally, there have been concerns voiced about the need not to make \nchanges in this bill. We have been told this bill has been \npreconferenced. Persons say that in doing so we might delay the bill's \npassage by sending it back to the House for approval. I admit the \nfunding contained in this bill is important, but that does not mean we \ncan forget about our jobs as legislators. I do not believe the other \nbody will let this bill die simply because we are doing what is right, \nby clarifying our country's policy of standing against coercive \npopulation control practices like forced abortion and forced \nsterilization.\n  I realize opinions in this Chamber and across our country vary \ngreatly on the issue of abortion. I am pro-life and I am mindful that \nsome Members in this body would describe themselves as pro-choice. But \nregardless of where we come down on that issue, can't we agree that we \ndo not want to spend taxpayer dollars to force this on women who do not \nwant this procedure? We ought to all be able to agree that is wrong and \nthat is a misuse of American taxpayer funds.\n  The United States should not turn its head on coercive family control \nprograms like sterilization and forced abortion, and our taxpayers \nshould not have their dollars used to help fund such horrible acts. My \namendment will help stop that from happening. It restores a \nlongstanding foreign policy provision. It reflects our Nation's \ncommitment to promoting human rights. I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise to speak on the underlying bill \njust for a moment. I know some of my colleagues are on the floor of the \nSenate, and I will be very brief.\n  I come to the floor to support the underlying bill and also to give a \nfew brief remarks about the legislative branch, which I chair, for the \nrecord. The legislative branch in this bill is funded at $4.4 billion--\nnot an insignificant amount of money but very small relative to the \noverall bill. There is a $43 million increase over last year, which is \nan 11-percent increase, which would seem on the face of it rather \nsignificant, so I thought I would like to explain.\n  It is more than the cost of living, more than inflation, but there \nare three very good reasons we thought--both Republican and Democrat on \nour committee--that this was the right thing to do. First of all, \nbuilding up Congress's oversight responsibilities at this time is \ncritical. We have seen much of the scandal and corruption and \nunregulated situations that have led us to the place we are. Congress \nneeds to make sure we are doing a better job with our inspector general \noffices, with our general oversight, particularly because we are \nstepping up so much additional spending for stimulus and investment. \nOur committee thought that was the responsible thing to do, to actually \ninvest in greater oversight. So about 38 percent of this increase is \nrelated to that.\n  Second, there is a backlog of life safety issues related to this \ngreat Capitol complex. Trust me, there is no money in here for carpet \nor fancy lighting or extra offices for anyone. This is for basically \nasbestos removal--which can be life threatening, as you know, and cause \nserious harm to those people who work in this Capitol, both our staffs \nand the workforce. That is an unmet need. There is over $1 billion of \nunmet needs. This bill attempts to just deal with some immediate \nsituations.\n  Finally, now that the Capitol Visitor Center is open, there are some \nadditional security requirements of our Capitol Police. This project \nwas started many years ago. It was supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans. It is now open, was dedicated recently, but we have to \noperate it appropriately. We have to make sure it is secure, not just \nfor ourselves and our staff, but for the millions of visitors who come. \nThere is some increased funding for Capitol Police that reflects that \nthis Capitol Visitor Center is the greatest expansion of this building \nin over 100 years. It was not just a small addition, it was quite a \nlarge addition, and we need that extra security.\n  Finally, there is a full request, that was met, by the Library of \nCongress to provide new modern technology for the visually impaired. It \nis something that was a high priority for the community of the blind \nand the visually impaired, millions of Americans who have no access to \nbooks as we normally read them but need these digital talking\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\nbooks. Not only does it help the Library of Congress but ensures every \nlibrary in America, including school libraries, has access, so children \nwho do not have their sight, and adults, can read and remain part of \nthis economy.\n  Those are the reasons this bill has been expanded by 11 percent. I \nhope my colleagues understand. We have gotten pretty much broad-based \nsupport.\n  As I said Madam President, 38 percent of the total increase goes \ntowards increased staffing for the Government Accountability Office and \nthe Congressional Budget Office to allow for greater oversight of the \nFederal Government. The help of these agencies is more critical than \never during this time of economic uncertainty and national crisis. GAO \nand CBO intend to beef up their staffing levels to meet Congress's \nneeds as we tackle the many critical issues facing us today.\n  Nearly 23 percent of the overall fiscal year 2009 increase goes to \nthe Architect of the Capitol for fire and life safety projects in the \nCapitol Complex--including $56 million for asbestos removal and \nstructural repairs in the utility tunnels which provide steam and \nchilled water throughout the entire complex.\n  Congress is facing a tremendous backlog of structural problems in our \naging infrastructure here on Capitol Hill which has grown to over $1.4 \nbillion. This bill provides a small but much-needed step towards \naddressing this backlog. Many of our buildings in the Capitol Complex \nlack the adequate fire and life safety requirements to keep Congress in \ncompliance with health and safety regulations. As I said, I am proud of \nthe funding included in this bill which will address these inadequacies \nand help make the Capitol safer for our staff and for our visitors. It \nwould be irresponsible not to tackle these problems now--we will just \nbe kicking them down the road where they will be more expensive and \nmore difficult to repair.\n  The bill includes funding for the United States Capitol Police to \nhire and train additional personnel to provide security for the now \nopen Capitol Visitor Center. The CVC which opened December 5 is a huge \nsuccess and a much-needed addition to our Complex providing security, \neducational opportunities, restaurant facilities and many other \namenities to the millions of visitors who arrive on our doorsteps each \nyear. The bill also provides funding to fully implement the merger of \nthe Library of Congress Police force with the Capitol Police. This \nlong-awaited merger is essential to maintaining streamlined security \nthroughout the Capitol Complex. Quite simply, this bill will provide \nthe resources needed to the Capitol Police to effectively perform their \nrequired missions without putting more on their plate than they can do.\n  This bill fully funds the Library of Congress, including the \nLibrary's request for the Books for the Blind and Physically \nHandicapped. The Library's fiscal year 2009 budget includes $29 million \nto move forward on the Digital Talking Book for the blind project. This \nproject is a high priority for this Congress and for the blind \ncommunity. It is vital that the blind receive uninterrupted access to \nsomething the rest of us take for granted--books and other reading \nmaterials that allow us to work and learn. This bill supports that \nimportant goal allowing this project to proceed on schedule and provide \nmore titles than originally anticipated. This is a key issue of \nfairness which we can and must address now.\n  The funding in this bill puts the Legislative Branch on solid footing \nfor the future and invests in the right priorities. We should strongly \nsupport it.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 635\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for the Emergency Fund for Indian Safety \n                      and Health, with an offset)\n\n       On page 458, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n\n              emergency fund for indian safety and health\n\n        For deposit in the Emergency Fund for Indian Safety and \n     Health established by subsection (a) of section 601 of the \n     Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership \n     Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization \n     Act of 2008 (25 U.S.C. 443c), for use by the Attorney \n     General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the \n     Secretary of the Interior in accordance with that section, \n     $400,000,000, to be derived by transfer of an equal \n     percentage from each other program and project for which \n     funds are made available by this Act.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Let me explain very simply what this amendment does.\n  Last summer, President Bush signed into law a $50 billion foreign aid \nbill; HIV and AIDS was the purpose, the direction of the bill. Included \nas part of that PEPFAR bill was a $2 billion authorization that I and a \nbipartisan group of Senators worked on, including that redirected money \nto critical public safety, health care, and water needs in Indian \nCountry. All of the Senators who worked on the amendment's inclusion in \nthe final package, including now Vice President Biden and Secretary of \nState Clinton, recognized there are great needs internationally, but \nthey also realized we have equal or maybe even greater needs right here \nat home on our Nation's reservations.\n  The final PEPFAR bill created a $2 billion, 5-year authorization \nbeginning in fiscal year 2009 for an emergency fund for Indian health \nand safety. Over the 5-year authorization, $750 million could be spent \non public safety, $250 million on health care, and $1 billion for water \nsettlements.\n  In order to ensure that the emergency fund for Indian health and \nsafety was funded as quickly as possible, I and six of my colleagues \nsent a letter to President Bush last year asking that he include \nfunding in the fiscal year 2010 budget for the emergency fund. Then we \nworked to get a total of 21 Senators to send a similar letter to \nPresident Obama on November 24, 2008. I believe this continued \nbipartisan effort underscores the support for addressing the needs that \nexist in Indian Country.\n  What the amendment does is seek to remedy this without raising the \noverall cost of the omnibus bill. It simply reduces discretionary \nspending throughout the bill by $400 million, the fiscal year 2009 \nauthorized amount from PEPFAR, and redirects that money to the \nemergency fund for Indian safety and health. This amounts to less than \none-tenth of 1 percent cut from each program funded in the omnibus \nbill.\n  Bear in mind the omnibus bill includes an overall funding increase of \n8.3 percent over last year's appropriated level--that on top of the \nstimulus bill that passed earlier this year that, as we all know, \npoured billions of dollars into many of these Federal agencies. So what \nI am suggesting is we carve out one-tenth of 1 percent of the cost of \nthis bill. As I said, take the overall increase in this year's bill \nfrom 8.3 percent over last year's appropriated amount to an 8.2-percent \nincrease over last year's amount.\n  Since this appropriations bill was put together--I think it was put \ntogether in very short order behind closed doors, not to mention the \nfact that none of the nine appropriations bills were ever voted on in \nthe Senate--I believe my amendment is a commonsense proposal that will \nensure that we allocate tax dollars where they are needed the most.\n  The needs are great in Indian Country and I know many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle would agree.\n  Nationwide 1 percent of the U.S. population does not have safe and \nadequate water for drinking and sanitation needs. On our Nation's \nreservations this number climbs to an average of 11 percent and in the \nworst parts of Indian Country to 35 percent.\n  This lack of reliable safe water leads to high incidences of disease \nand infection. The Indian Health Service has estimated that for each $1 \nit spends on safe drinking water and sewage systems it gets a \ntwentyfold return in health benefits.\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\n  The Indian Health Service estimates that in order to provide all \nNative Americans with safe drinking water and sewage systems in their \nhome they would need over $2.3 billion.\n  Nationally, Native Americans are three times as likely to die from \ndiabetes compared to the rest of the population.\n  An individual that is served by Indian Health Service is 50 percent \nmore likely to commit suicide than the general population.\n  On the Oglala Sioux Reservation in my home State of South Dakota the \naverage life expectancy for males is 56 years old. In Iraq it is 58, \nHaiti it is 59, and in Ghana it is 60, all higher than right here in \nAmerica.\n  One out of every three Native American women will be raped in their \nlifetime.\n  According to a recent Department of the Interior report, tribal jails \nare so grossly insufficient when it comes to cell space, that only half \nof the offenders who should be incarcerated are being put in jail.\n  That same report found that constructing or rehabilitating only those \ndetention centers that are most in need will cost $8.4 billion.\n  The South Dakota attorney general released a study at the end of last \nyear on tribal criminal justice statistics and found: homicide rates on \nSouth Dakota reservations are almost 10 times higher than those found \nin the rest of South Dakota and forcible rapes on South Dakota \nreservations are seven times higher than those found in the rest of \nSouth Dakota.\n  Clearly there are great needs in Indian County and my commonsense \namendment would be a good step forward in addressing some of these \nneeds because the emergency fund for Indian safety and health can be \nused for: detention and IHS facility construction, rehabilitation, and \nreplacement; investigations and prosecutions of crimes in Indian \nCountry; cross-deputization and other cooperative agreements between \nState or local governments and Indian tribes; IHS contract health care; \nand water supply projects approved by Congress.\n  Passage of my original amendment to PEPFAR clearly shows a commitment \nby the Senate to addressing domestic priorities for Native Americans.\n  I urge support for my amendment to fund this authorized emergency \nfund for fiscal year 2009.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 599\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set the \npending amendment aside for the purpose of calling up an amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would ask the Senator from Alaska \nwhich amendment she is sending.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. This is amendment No. 599.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for herself, Mr. \n     Begich, and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered 599.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify a provision relating to the repromuglation of final \n rules by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce)\n\n       On page 541, strikes lines 1 through 10 and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Commerce may withdraw or repromulgate the rule described in \n     subsection (c)(1) in accordance with each requirement \n     described in subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of \n     title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the \n     ``Administrative Procedure Act''), except that the public \n     comment period shall be for a period of not less than 60 \n     days; and\n       (2) the Secretary of the Interior may withdraw or \n     repromulgate the rule described in subsection (c)(2) in \n     accordance with each requirement described in subchapter II \n     of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of title 5, United States Code \n     (commonly known as the ``Administrative Procedure Act''), \n     except that the public comment period shall be for a period \n     of not less than 60 days.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. The amendment I bring forward this evening would \nmodify section 429 of the bill we have before us. This amendment does \nnot cost us any money. It will, in fact, eliminate a major obstacle to \njob creation, including many of the construction projects that were \nfunded under the recently passed stimulus bill.\n  To be more specific, I am introducing an amendment to modify section \n429 to require the Departments of Interior and Commerce to follow the \nprocess provided by existing law to withdraw and alter two provisions \nthat were essential ingredients last year in the decision by former \nSecretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne when he listed the polar \nbears of northern Alaska as threatened under the Endangered Species \nAct.\n  Section 429, as it now stands, would allow those agencies to withdraw \nthose regulations arbitrarily and then reissue them immediately without \npublic comment. My amendment does not overturn the listing of the polar \nbears as threatened, even though up in Alaska most of us feel the \nlisting was premature and perhaps totally unnecessary, but it will \nrequire the Department to follow existing public notice and comment \nstatutes, if they want to modify last year's listing decision and the \nrelated carbon emissions rule in the future.\n  We are asking that you follow the process that is in place. Section \n429 of the omnibus provides a provision that allows the Secretaries of \nInterior and Commerce to withdraw the final rule relating to the \ninteragency cooperation under the Endangered Species Act and the final \nrule relating to endangered and threatened wildlife plants, the special \nrule for the polar bear.\n  This section allows the Secretaries of either Commerce or Interior, \nor both, to withdraw the two Endangered Species Act rules promulgated \nunder section 7 of that act within 60 days of adoption of the omnibus \nbill and then reissue the rule without having to go through any notice \nor any public comment period, or be subject to any judicial review as \nto whether their actions were responsible.\n  Last year, after years of comment and review, the Interior Department \nelected to list the polar bear as threatened, solely because of the \nfear that greenhouse gas emissions will raise temperatures sufficiently \nin the future, causing the Arctic pack ice that the bear relies on for \nhabitat to melt, making it more difficult for the bears to feed.\n  During the scientific review that was conducted before the listing \ndecision, there was very little to no evidence that indicated that \nneither very carefully limited subsistence hunting activities by the \nAlaska Natives, nor onshore or offshore oil and gas exploration or \nproduction activities in any way would disturb the bears or place \nstress on their population.\n  So it was for that reason, based on all the science and the research, \nfor that reason that the listing decision specifically provided, and \nthis was set forth in section 4(d) of the act, it provided that oil or \ngas development or subsistence hunting will not be impacted by any \naction plan the Department will craft to remedy bear population issues \nin the future. Those provisions were added after extensive public \ncomment and based on a full scientific review.\n  Now, without any scientific review, at the last minute, someone in \nthe House of Representatives has decided to impose as fact their \nopinion that the bears should be listed as threatened without \nlimitation. This provision makes a mockery of what we know and accept \nand applaud with the scientific review process.\n  In all the science leading up to the listing, there was no evidence \nthat oil or gas exploration and development were having any effect on \nthe bears which are already carefully regulated under the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act. In fact, the populations of both the Beaufort and \nChukchi Sea areas have actually risen by around 500 bears since 1972, \nand any anecdotal evidence of minor recent declines is purely \nanecdotal.\n  Now, yes, Fish and Wildlife researchers have some evidence that bears \nmay have dietary issues that may impact juvenile survival rates if the \nice melt causes dislocation of the seal populations. But that problem \nhas nothing to do directly with oil or gas or subsistence activities.\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\n  Withdrawal of the 4(d) protections could prompt lawsuits to stop any \naction that would increase carbon dioxide or any greenhouse gas \nemissions anywhere in the country, not just in the State of Alaska but \nanywhere in the country, if the project had not first consulted with \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife on potential impacts.\n  What this means, the potential for this is that every powerplant \npermit anywhere that might increase carbon emissions could face a \nlawsuit. Damage could extend past fossil fuel projects to include an \nincredible array, agricultural practices, any increase in livestock \nnumbers, new road construction, literally any project or activity that \nmight increase greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Suits that could be triggered by this seemingly limited change could \nstop many of the construction projects that this body has provided \nfunding for in this stimulus bill to help get this Nation's economy \nmoving again.\n  Now, the Center for Biological Diversity has already stated it \nintends to use the polar bear listing to regulate greenhouse gas \nemissions. But I am afraid such overreaching could actually harm \nenvironmental protections. That is because such an effort to overreach \ncould trigger such a backlash that it harms support for the entire \nEndangered Species Act.\n  The administration is planning to ask Congress to pass cap-and-trade \nlegislation this year to regulate greenhouse gasses. Debate over that \nbill is the proper place for this issue to be tackled, not through a \nback-door amendment to this key appropriations bill that will not \npermit public process.\n  For my home State of Alaska, the amendment's impacts are immediate \nand they are far reaching. It is almost certain to result in lawsuits \nto stop oil and gas development in northern Alaska, both onshore and \noff. Such suits certainly could stop the exploration needed to produce \nnew natural gas finds. We know this is vital to the viability of an \nAlaska natural gas line to bring our clean-burning natural gas to the \nlower 48.\n  This project has been supported by the administration and most every \nMember of this body. We recognize that such sites could endanger Native \nsubsistence activities, not just for the bears and marine mammals that \nthe bears prey upon but for any species, such as the western and \ncentral Arctic caribou herds. These are vital food sources for our \nAlaska Natives.\n  So what my amendment does is it requires that if either the carbon \nemissions consultation rule or the polar bear 4(d) rule is to be \nwithdrawn or reissued, such action is subject to the requirements of \nthe Administrative Procedures Act, with at least a 60-day comment \nperiod.\n  What this does, it essentially gets us back to the status quo, where \nthe Secretaries can now withdraw or repromulgate these regulations, but \nthey have to follow the APA. Nothing Earth shattering, we are not \nplowing new ground. We are saying, follow the process we set up. The \nprovision in the budget bill does much more than overturn Bush \nadministration rules, it violates the public process and scientific \nreview called for in the Endangered Species Act, and by doing that it \nweakens and risks support for the act.\n  As it stands, under section 429, the Secretaries can make dramatic \nand far-reaching changes with their rules and regulations and do so \nwithout having to comply with the longstanding Federal process \nrequiring public notice and comment by the American public and by \nknowledgeable scientists. We should not make a mockery of the formal \nESA review process and the APA, the Administrative Procedures Act. We \nshould support this amendment to strike the House waiver of those acts \nand require that those laws be enforced.\n  I cannot stress how important this is to the Nation, to the American \nenergy production of the workings of the stimulus bill, and eventually \nto the integrity of the Endangered Species Act and this Nation's \nadministrative process.\n  Now, this afternoon President Obama issued a new directive on the \nESA. But it is only pertaining to the optional consultation portion of \nsection 7. The directive requests the Secretaries of the Interior and \nCommerce to review the regulation issued on December 16, 2008, and \ndetermine whether to undertake new rulemaking. Until such review is \ncompleted, the President requested the heads of all agencies to \nexercise their discretion, under the new regulation, to follow the \nprior longstanding consultation and concurrence process.\n  But this Presidential order did not address the issue of the polar \nbear 4(d) rule and does not remove the House omnibus rider. It does not \nmaintain the Administrative Procedures Act requirement, and it does not \nnegate the need for my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to a \nperiod of morning business with the time equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would ask if the Senator would modify her amendment to \nallow for me to speak on the Wicker amendment. Could we do that?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I modify my request and ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Coburn be allowed to speak for 5 minutes on the \namendment, and following his remarks, the Senate move to a period of \nmorning business, with the time equally divided in the usual manner \nwith a 10-minute limitation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 607\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wanted to spend a minute talking about \nthe Wicker amendment No. 607. I am having trouble, from a philosophical \nviewpoint, understanding why the language is in this bill the way it \nis. There is no confusion as to my stand on pro-life issues, pro-choice \nversus pro-life. I stand in the corner of pro-life. But I want to \ndebate this issue as if I were pro-choice, that I believe that the law \nas we have it today should be enforced. If, in fact, we believe that \nif, in fact, women have a right to choose, why in the world would we \nsend money to UNFP that is going to take that right away from women in \nother countries? It is beyond me that these little six words in the \nbill, ``notwithstanding any other provision of law,'' are intended to \neliminate the ability of the President to certify that our UNFP money \nis going to be used for coercive abortions and coercive sterilizations. \nI am having trouble understanding why those in this body who absolutely \nbelieve without a doubt that a woman has a definite right to choose on \nwhether to carry a pregnancy to term, have a definite right to choose \nthe number of children they are going to have or have none, we would \nallow this bill to go through here this way that will deny that ability \nto Chinese women.\n  If somebody in our body can explain that to me, I would love them to \ndo so. You can't be on both sides of this issue. Either you believe in \na woman's right to choose or you do not or you only believe in a \nwoman's right to choose in America. And because the Chinese have too \nmany people, you don't think that same human right ought to be given to \nwomen in China. I won't go into the details. There is no question that \nUNFP will mix this money, and we will fund forced abortions in China. \nThat is what these six words do. They mean American taxpayer dollars \nare going to go to China to enforce coercive abortion against the will \nof women and force sterilization against the will of women in China. \nChina is not in bad shape. They don't need our money in the first \nplace. But then we are going to send that money over there to enable \nand allow that policy to progress. I find it disconcerting that anybody \nwho is pro-choice could not vote for the Wicker amendment. Because what \nit says is, you are double minded. The standard applying in this \ncountry is one thing, but human beings throughout the rest of the \nworld, that same standard doesn't apply. I think it is unfortunate that \nthis was put in here. We will rue the day it was.\n  In fact, we lessen our own human rights campaigns for equal treatment \nand the protection of human rights around the world as we do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I request the regular order.\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/03/senate-section/article/S2679-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

TAXATION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I was misled into thinking that we would \nbe able to introduce some amendments tonight and then was told, when I \ngot down, that they are confining those amendments to only three. Let \nme mention that I have an amendment I feel very strongly about that I \nwant to take up first thing in the morning. I will explain what it is. \nIt is amendment No. 613.\n  I can remember back in 1996, the United Nations Secretary General \nannounced that the U.N. was interested in pursuing a global tax scheme. \nIn response, Congress passed--and President Clinton signed into law--a \npolicy rider on the Foreign Operations and State Department \nappropriations bills that would prevent the United Nations from using \nany U.S. funds to pursue a global tax scheme. The idea was that if we \nhad a United Nations that wanted to have a global tax--they have been \nattempting to do this for many years because they don't want to be held \naccountable to anyone--then every time something comes up that is \nagainst the interests of the United States, we normally will pass a \nresolution saying that we are going to withhold a percentage of our \ndues to the United Nations until they change this policy. In 1996 and \nevery year since, 13 years, we have had, as a part of that, language \nthat says that the U.N. could not use any of the funds of the United \nStates to pursue a global tax scheme of any type. The provision has \nappeared in every annual appropriations since 1996. This year marks the \nfirst time an annual appropriations bill will not contain this policy \nprovision preventing U.S. tax dollars from funding U.N. global tax \nschemes.\n  According to page 64 of division H of the joint explanatory \nstatement, this policy provision has been intentionally left out of the \nfiscal year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Preventing U.S. taxpayers \nfunding U.N. global taxes in annual appropriations bills has been a \nbipartisan U.S. policy for over a decade. It is very difficult for me \nto understand, because I haven't seen any explanation as to who is \nopposed to this. It was put in by Democrats and Republicans on a \nbipartisan basis. Now we find that it was left out. The amendment very \nsimply puts back the language that we have had historically in the law \nfor the past 13 years.\n  Let me serve notice that I will make every effort to be first in line \ntomorrow morning to try to get this amendment in. I would invite any \nopposition that is out there, because I don't know of any opposition to \nit. Being fair, I think it is probably the fact that they wanted to \nshorten tonight to restrict it to three amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my time be extended to whatever time I \nshall pursue. I will not be more than 15 minutes from this point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/03/senate-section/article/S2679-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2679-S2680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHANGES TO THE ESA RULES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I was listening with some interest to \nthe Senator from Alaska and what she is trying to do. I think, once \nagain, we are faced with a backhanded attempt to regulate greenhouse \ngases without the transparency of public debate. Section 429 of the \nomnibus currently includes yet another congressional handout to some of \nthe extremist groups and to the trial bar. This rider is clearly an \nattempt to legislate on a spending bill, the sort of bad habit that \nDemocrats in Congress and the White House promised to give up during \nthe last election.\n  As ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I \nstrongly support the bipartisan amendment offered by Senators Murkowski \nand Begich to revise the omnibus section 429. This subject is \nparticularly important to me since the EPW Committee holds jurisdiction \nover all issues impacted by the offending provision, including \nendangered species, the regulation of greenhouse gases, and the \ntransportation infrastructure which we are going to be pursuing in the \nnext few weeks.\n  Without the amendment, section 429 allows the agencies to make \ndramatic changes to the Endangered Species Act rules and regulations \nwithout having to comply with longstanding Federal laws that require \npublic notice and public comment by the American people and \nknowledgeable scientists. These changes have the potential for far-\nreaching and unintended consequences in our economy.\n  Specifically, this activist-friendly rider would allow the Secretary \nof Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to undo a regulation making \ncommonsense adjustments to the ESA as well as withdraw a special rule \nand listing for the polar bear. By ignoring the protections of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act, the rules in question could be withdrawn \nwithin 60 days of adoption of the omnibus bill and then reissued in \nwhatever form the agencies preferred, without having to go through any \nnotice or public comment period and without being subject to any \njudicial review as to whether their actions were responsible or \njustified.\n\n  This is exactly what the two Senators from Alaska are attempting to \ncorrect. Existing ESA rules clearly lay out the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService position that oil and gas development in the Arctic and Alaska \nNative subsistence activities are not the reason for the polar bear's \nrecent listing status and are not affecting polar bear population. I \nmight add that we have made quite a study of the 13 polar bear \npopulations in Canada. All but one are increasing. The one that is not \nis the western Hudson Bay. That is due to some regulations in hunting \nthat have adversely affected them. That is being corrected at this \ntime. So if you stop and realize over the last 40 years, we have \nincreased the population of polar bears in the world by fivefold, then \nthere isn't a problem. However, let's assume that there is a problem, \nand we want to be sure that we are able not to have the intended \nconsequences.\n  If enacted, implementation of section 429 would mean that any \nincrease in carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the \ncountry could be subject to legal challenges due to assertions that \nthose activities are harming a polar bear or that there has not been \nsufficient consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nregarding activities that are funded, carried out, and authorized by \nthe Federal Government.\n  In other words, you could have someone who is cooking on his Hasty \nBake in his backyard in Tulsa, OK and have a lawsuit filed saying: You \nare emitting greenhouse gases; therefore, you are affecting the polar \nbear. Any permit for a powerplant, refinery, or road project that \nincreases the volume of traffic anywhere in the United States could be \nsubject to litigation, if it contributes to local carbon emissions. \nLawsuits and ESA-prompted delays could extend to past fossil fuel-\nlinked projects, if those projects could increase greenhouse gas \nemissions or reduce natural carbon dioxide intake.\n  If this provision is allowed to stand, it will likely endanger the \ndelivery of the majority of the construction projects funded by the \nrecent stimulus bill since these projects have not gone through a \nsection 7 consultation regarding their impact to the polar bear. In \nother words, we passed the stimulus which I opposed. I had an amendment \nthat would have actually provided a lot of jobs. That amendment they \nwould not let me bring up. I believed that since it was an Inhofe-Boxer \namendment, it would have passed. But it didn't.\n  So now we have a few jobs out there, a few things that are going to \ncontribute to the employment problem of this country. If this provision \nis in there without the correction found in the bipartisan amendment by \nthe two Senators from Alaska, then it is going to say the very thing we \nare trying to stimulate--in terms of jobs, construction, roads, \nbridges, and highways--cannot be done because of the section 7 \nconsultation regarding the impacts on the polar bear. Ironically, \nPresident Obama today announced the release of $28 billion from the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act to States and local \ntransportation authorities to repair and build highways, roads, and \nbridges. This investment will lead to\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\n150,000 jobs saved or created by the end of 2010. State highway \ndepartments have already identified more than 100 transportation \nprojects throughout the country, totaling more than $750 million, where \nconstruction can start within the month. In other words, we have \nalready undergone all of the environmental requirements. We have the \nenvironmental impact statements. We are ready right now. In my State of \nOklahoma, we have $1.1 billion worth of work that could be started \ntomorrow.\n  Now, President Obama stated that the projects funded under the ARRA \nare deemed so important to America's economic recovery that they will \nbear a newly designed emblem. The emblem is a symbol of President \nObama's commitment to the American people to invest their tax dollars \nwisely and to put Americans back to work. Rest assured that section 429 \nof the omnibus bill will not bear this emblem.\n  I applaud the President for highlighting infrastructure spending as a \nmain driver of immediate job growth in the stimulus plan, but I am \nconcerned by the conflicting priorities created by section 429. You \ncannot support large infrastructure spending as an economic stimulus \nwhile simultaneously endangering its translation into job growth with \nmore redtape.\n  The Murkowski-Begich amendment correctly requires that if these ESA \nrules are withdrawn or revised, the action is subject to the \nrequirements of the Administrative Procedures Act, with at least a 60-\nday comment period. This is a good government amendment. The fact that \nthis amendment is even needed to restore the public participation \nprotections is exactly the sort of nonsense that makes the American \ntaxpayer so suspicious of Congress. From the public's perspective, the \neffect of this amendment would be to bring us back to the longstanding \nprocess where the agencies may withdraw and revise regulations by \nfollowing the law established to do so.\n  We have heard from the Democratic managers of this bill that nothing \nnew was added to this bill since last year. We have been told there is \nno controversial legislative language in this bill.\n  We have been misinformed. This rider was not a part of the \nnegotiations or the appropriations bills last year, and I assure you, \nit is very controversial. I urge the leadership to allow the Senate to \nvote on the Murkowski-Begich amendment, and I ask for my colleagues' \nsupport for ensuring regulatory transparency.\n  I believe this is very important because, without this, there is so \nmuch uncertainty as to what the application would be in terms of the \nEndangered Species Act. So I encourage the adoption of that amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Madam President, last week I joined 86 of my colleagues \nto pass Senate amendment No. 573, offered by Senator DeMint to the DC \nVoting Rights Act, which prohibited the Federal Communications \nCommission from reinstating the fairness doctrine.\n  This has become an issue over the years where you can recall the \naction that took place back in the middle 1980s--I think 1986--that \nrecognized the fact that we have so many opportunities for people to \nget at information that it is no longer necessary to have what they \ncall the fairness doctrine.\n  Last week's vote was the first nail in the coffin of the fairness \ndoctrine, but it was not the end of the attempt on the part of some \npeople to regulate the airwaves. I have long been outspoken on this \nissue. It gives me great satisfaction that so many of my colleagues \nvoted in favor of free speech over Government regulation last week. But \nthe debate has changed. In a straight party-line vote, Democrats chose \nto adopt Senator Durbin's amendment No. 591, which calls on the FCC to \n``encourage and promote diversity in communication media ownership and \nto ensure that broadcast station licenses are used in the public \ninterest.''\n  Essentially, it makes an end run around the fairness doctrine. Those \non the other side of the aisle believed this would allow them to \nproclaim their opposition to a reinstatement of the fairness doctrine, \nwhich has always been a losing issue for them, while at the same time \nreplacing it with an equally heinous piece of legislation that gives \nthe FCC unfettered authority to interpret that language however they \nplease.\n  So we have potentially taken away the threat of the fairness \ndoctrine, which requires broadcasters to ``present controversial issues \nof public importance in an equitable and balanced manner,'' and \nreplaced it with ``encouraging and promoting diversity in communication \nmedia ownership.'' At least with the fairness doctrine, broadcasters \nhad an initial choice of how to interpret ``controversial issues of \npublic importance'' before answering to the FCC, but this new authority \ngives all the power to a Government agency and none to the people of \nthe broadcast industry.\n  One thing I know: When you take choice out of the market, and when \nyou impose the Government's will on an industry, that market and that \nindustry will suffer, and that is exactly what Senator Durbin's \nlegislation attempts to accomplish. What was once the fairness doctrine \nhas now become the Durbin doctrine.\n  What, I ask, does ``encourage and promote diversity in communication \nmedia ownership'' really mean? I certainly cannot tell you what it \nmeans, and that is what concerns me because it is up to someone else's \ninterpretation. The legislation offers no words of clarification or \nspecificity. If I were an FCC commissioner, I would not know what to do \nwith this language, and in any other line of work, I would send it \ndirectly back with a little note attached asking to please be more \nspecific. But Federal agencies love this kind of language because it \ngives them greater leeway to interpret it however they like--which \ncould be interpreted differently by different governmental agencies--\nand impose their will upon the industry they regulate.\n  My Democratic colleagues who promoted this amendment like this type \nof language because it, first, means that they do not have to spend the \ntime drafting quality legislation aimed at solving a specific problem, \nand, two, it means they can disavow their true intention of having \ngreater Government regulation of the airwaves. Now, at the same time, \nthey can say: Well, I voted for the DeMint amendment. So that offered \ncover for these individuals.\n  This legislation is so incredibly vague and so potentially far \nreaching that I cannot say with any certainty what the end result will \nbe. This is not good governance, and it is not good legislative \npractice to cede such authority to any agency of our Government, \nespecially when the right to speak freely over the airwaves will most \ncertainly be impacted.\n  Another threat to our freedom of speech is a stealth proposal called \n``localism,'' which could force local radio stations to regulate the \ncontent they broadcast. It is important to note that ``localism'' as \nFCC policy already exists, but new policies that have been proposed \nreach far beyond ensuring that broadcasters serve their local \ncommunities.\n  The FCC gave notice of proposed rulemaking. This was back on January \n24, I believe it was, of 2008. While the regulations were ultimately \ndropped, they are indicative of future attempts to regulate the \nairwaves through localism and something about which all Americans need \nto know.\n  Among other things, the proposal would have required radio stations \nto, one, adhere to programming advice from community advisory boards; \ntwo, report every 3 months on the content\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\nof their programming, the producers of their programming, and how their \nprogramming reflects community interests; and, three, meet burdensome \nlicense renewal requirements.\n  The localism rule, had it been promulgated, would have meant that \nradio stations would have to comply with blanket regulations and \nbroadcast programming that may not be commercially viable, rather than \ntaking into account the diverse needs of communities across the \ncountry.\n  One of my constituents, Dan Lawrie, who is vice president and manager \nof Cox Radio Tulsa, and president of the Oklahoma Association of \nBroadcasters, stated that:\n\n       regulations requiring additional and unnecessary \n     documentation of programming in order to show proof of \n     broadcasting that we already provide to our local communities \n     is entirely unnecessary. To burden our Tulsa radio group with \n     this type of ascertainment documentation would cause us to \n     lay off several staff members to offset the expense of \n     completing the increased paperwork.\n\n  As you can see, this is a real threat to broadcast media as a whole.\n  Let's look at this from a market standpoint. I have often said: \nPeople who think maybe the content is too progressive or not \nprogressive enough or too conservative--I have heard some pretty heated \naccusations made at various popular talk radio hosts--forget about the \nfact that this is market oriented. The market is determining how this \nshould be. I can remember it was not too long ago--last year--I believe \nSenator Harkin wanted to regulate the type of content that was going \nover the airwaves to our troops who were listening overseas, and we \nwere able to stop that because they overwhelmingly wanted, in their \neyes, conservative content to be broadcast. We won that one. But the \neffort is still out there.\n  Look at it from a market standpoint. Stations strive to endear \nthemselves to the local community to be successful. It makes \nprogramming sense to cover local news and events because it increases \nthe ratings. Why should Washington regulate what local stations are \nalready doing? They are doing this now because people who listen to the \nradio may want to hear some talk show host, but you find right through \nintermingled within these comments, every 15 minutes or so, or every 10 \nminutes, they stop and tell what the local weather is, they tell of \ndifferent activities, what is happening in the local community. They \nare doing this already. That is just good business sense, and that is \nwhy in the highly competitive environment we find our local radio \nstations, they have to do these things. They are already doing it.\n  The reason is this: These community advisory boards, or local content \nboards, coupled with the threat of license renewal requirements, are \njust one more way liberals can affect what is broadcast over the \nairwaves. They have created a regulatory avenue by which to accomplish \ntheir goal of silencing talk radio because they are incapable of \ncompeting in the broadcast radio market.\n  President Obama has expressed support for new localism regulations, \nand it is expected to come up again under his administration. All those \nwho value their right to listen to the things that are important to \nthem, and important to their community, must be aware of the great \npotential for infringement on free speech that localism will bring.\n  What is perhaps most concerning to me is the enforcement procedure \nfor breaches of localism and diversity promotion. We simply do not know \nwhich pathway the FCC will choose when it comes time to enforce these \nnebulous regulations. License revocation is a real threat to the \nwillingness of the broadcasters to appeal to their market rather than \nto conform to FCC regulations. Senator Durbin's amendment requires \naffirmative action on the part of the FCC, stating: ``The Commission \nshall take actions to encourage and promote diversity.'' It doesn't \nstipulate what actions or to what degree but instead leaves the \nenforcement mechanism up to the determination of the FCC. I find this \nto be extremely dangerous.\n  Any enforcement of Government regulation of the airwaves could have a \nserious detrimental effect, not only on talk radio but also on the \nwillingness of Christian broadcasters to air political and perhaps even \nreligious messages. It is well known that the only radio station ever \ntaken off the airwaves was a Christian radio station, WGCB in Red Lion, \nPA. In that particular instance, the supposed offense was a personal \nattack against the author of a political publication. The ACLU and \nother liberal organizations could attempt to file lawsuits against \nanyone who presents a message that they deem to be counter to Federal \nlocalism and diversity regulation, and though I believe these lawsuits \nwould ultimately fail on first amendment grounds, the chilling effect \nthat the mere threat of a lawsuit will have on religious broadcasters \ncould be substantial.\n  Free speech is fundamental to what it means to be an American, and we \nmust protect it. Reimposing any form of a fairness doctrine threatens \nfirst amendment rights. Some on the left of the political spectrum are \nfrustrated that more talk show hosts have conservative political \nleanings than liberal political leanings. In response, I say the \ncontent is market driven. When the market is on the other side, they \nwill do that. The market has worked well throughout the history of this \ncountry, and people listen to it.\n  I think we are also forgetting about the fact that the broadcasting \nindustry is very competitive. We have companies that own broadcast \nmedia. They are not making a lot of money. It is competitive. A lot of \nthem go broke every year. What they are trying to do is come up with \nsomething they know people want and is sellable. They depend on people \nbuying advertisement for them to exist. So this is what this is all \nabout. I believe there are two attacks out there. I applaud Senator \nDeMint for the language he was able to get in, and I applaud all the \nRepublicans and most of the Democrats for voting for it. But to turn \naround and pass something that undoes what he did with that amendment I \nthink is something that needs to be looked at.\n  So I am concerned. I am concerned that so many of these stations out \nthere that are right on the border of surviving in this very difficult \neconomy we have are now looking at another threat, another bunch of \nregulations that are there, as well as the fear of the unknown, the \nnebulous language that says what a localism is, what power does the \nlocal community have. So that is a difficult thing.\n  I will only say to those individuals who think the problem of the \nfairness doctrine being reinvoked is not over: It is there, and our \nfirst amendment rights are threatened at this time.\n  I would anxiously pursue any effort we can that is going to preclude \nthe fairness doctrine, and I think the first thing we should do would \nbe to rename the fairness doctrine because it is certainly not fair and \nnot fair to the people in the broadcast industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/03/senate-section/article/S2681-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2681-S2682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SECRETARY OF STATE VISIT TO THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is \nin the Middle East this week on her first trip to the region as \nAmerica's top diplomat. The Secretary traveled to Egypt earlier in the \nweek to attend the international summit in Sharm El Sheikh, and she is \nnow visiting Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\n  I rise to praise Secretary Clinton for the strong and principled \ndiplomacy she has undertaken on America's behalf on this trip, that is \nas reflected in her comments, both prior to her departure from \nWashington and since arriving in the region.\n  Secretary Clinton is no stranger to the Middle East, having spent \nsignificant time there as First Lady and then as our colleague in the \nSenate. As a result, she brings a depth of familiarity with the Middle \nEast's complexities and challenges, an appreciation for our friends and \nallies in the region, and a clear-eyed understanding of the interests \nand values that must guide American foreign policy there.\n  In particular, I believe Secretary Clinton deserves praise for her \nstrong statements on this visit strengthening the forces of moderation \nin the Middle East and challenging the forces of extremism. Having \nrecently returned from the region myself, I am convinced, with a \nclarity greater than ever before, that the true dividing line in the \nMiddle East today is not between Arabs and Israelis or between Sunni \nMuslims and Shia Muslims. The true dividing line in the Middle East \ntoday is between moderates and extremists.\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\n  In every case, it is important to note, the extremist camp is \nsponsored and supported, often trained and equipped, by the Government \nof the Islamic Republic of Iran in Tehran.\n  Secretary Clinton deserves praise for her promise to vigorously \npromote peace between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as her \nrecognition that success in this crucial effort is inseparably linked \nwith strengthening the moderate forces among the Palestinians, in \nparticular, the Secretary was absolutely correct to make clear that aid \nto the Palestinians should be directed toward bolstering the leaders of \nthe Palestinian Authority, President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad, \nrather than directly or indirectly rewarding or supporting the \nextremist terrorist leaders of Hamas.\n  I am also pleased Secretary Clinton has made clear that any \nreconciliation between Hamas and Fatah must be contingent on Hamas \naccepting the conditions of the so-called Quartet; namely, that Hamas \nmust renounce violence, recognize Israel's right to exist, and honor \nthe agreements made by previous Palestinian Governments. There should \nbe no compromise or confusion on this point by anyone. If the leaders \nof Hamas refuse to accept these conditions, they are dooming themselves \nto further isolation from the international community, and they are \nstanding in the way of the aid that the world wants to provide the \nPalestinian people who live in Gaza.\n  Secretary Clinton, I believe, also deserves commendation for her \nrealistic and hardheaded comments about the danger posed by the \nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Our friends in the Middle \nEast want to know that the U.S. Government understands this threat, \nthat we are committed to taking the tough actions necessary to address \nit, and that whatever strategy we adopt, we will do so in real and \nclose partnership with them.\n  What our friends and allies in the Middle East are asking of us is \nreasonable and very much in America's national security interest.\n  I will say that based on my recent visits to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, \nIsrael, and the Palestinian Authority, I can attest that there is great \nanxiety in the region about Iran and its intentions, its \naggressiveness, its extremism, its expansionism. But there is also some \nuncertainty about the direction of American policy toward the \nGovernment in Tehran.\n  The hard truth is that Iranians are determined to acquire nuclear \nweapons. Everything we know about what they are up to tells us that \nand, therefore, we must be even more determined than they if we are to \nstop them from obtaining nuclear weapons.\n  Our friends and allies in the Middle East are looking to the United \nStates now for leadership and strength. President Obama and Secretary \nClinton have been very clear that they are committed to preventing Iran \nfrom going nuclear on their watch. We in Congress have a responsibility \nin turn to work together with the administration to achieve this \nresult, which is so critical to our national security and to the \nworld's security in the years ahead.\n  Again, I thank Secretary Clinton for her leadership, for her words, \nfor her outreach, for her representation of America's best interests on \nthis, her first trip to the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/03/senate-section/article/S2682-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2682-S2688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Failure to do so shall, upon a finding \n     to that effect by a majority of the members present, subject \n     such counsel to disciplinary action which may include \n     warning, censure, removal, or a recommendation of contempt \n     proceedings.\n       (c) There shall be no direct or cross-examination by \n     counsel. However, counsel may submit any question in writing \n     to the Committee and request the Committee to propound such \n     question to the counsel's client or to any other witness. The \n     counsel also may suggest the presentation of other evidence \n     or the calling of other witnesses. The Committee may use or \n     dispose of such questions or suggestions as it deems \n     appropriate.\n       8.5. Statements by Witnesses.--Witnesses may make brief and \n     relevant statements at the beginning and conclusion of their \n     testimony. Such statements shall not exceed a reasonable \n     period of time as determined by the Chairman, or other \n     presiding members. Any witness required or desiring to make a \n     prepared or written statement for the record of the \n     proceedings shall file a paper and electronic copy with the \n     Clerk of the Committee, and insofar as practicable and \n     consistent with the notice given, shall do so at least 48 \n     hours in advance of his or her appearance before the \n     Committee.\n       8.6. Objections and Rulings.--Any objection raised by a \n     witness or counsel shall be ruled upon by the Chairman or \n     other presiding member, and such ruling shall be the ruling \n     of the Committee unless a majority of the Committee present \n     overrules the ruling of the chair.\n       8.7. Inspection and Correction.--All witnesses testifying \n     before the Committee shall be given a reasonable opportunity \n     to inspect, in the office of the Committee, the transcript of \n     their testimony to determine whether such testimony was \n     correctly transcribed. The witness may be accompanied by \n     counsel. Any corrections the witness desires to make in the \n     transcript shall be submitted in writing to the Committee \n     within five days from the date when the transcript was made \n     available to the witness. Corrections shall be limited to \n     grammar and minor editing, and may not be made to change the \n     substance of the testimony. Any questions arising with \n     respect to such corrections shall be decided by the Chairman. \n     Upon request, the Committee may provide to a witness those \n     parts of testimony given by that witness in executive session \n     which are subsequently quoted or made part of a public \n     record, at the expense of the witness.\n       8.8. Requests To Testify.--The Committee will consider \n     requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before \n     the Committee. A person who believes that testimony or other \n     evidence presented at a public hearing, or any comment made \n     by a Committee member or a member of the Committee staff, may \n     tend to affect adversely that person's reputation, may \n     request to appear personally before the Committee to testify \n     or may file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony, evidence, or comment, or may submit to the \n     Chairman proposed questions in writing for the cross-\n     examination of other witnesses. The Committee shall take such \n     action as it deems appropriate.\n       8.9. Contempt Procedures.--No recommendation that a person \n     be cited for contempt of Congress or that a subpoena be \n     otherwise enforced shall be forwarded to the Senate unless \n     and until the Committee has, upon notice to all its members, \n     met and considered the recommendation, afforded the person an \n     opportunity to oppose such contempt or subpoena enforcement \n     proceeding either in writing or in person, and agreed by \n     majority vote of the Committee to forward such recommendation \n     to the Senate.\n       8.10. Release of Name of Witness.--Unless authorized by the \n     Chairman, the name of any witness scheduled to be heard by \n     the Committee shall not be released prior to, or after, \n     appearing before the Committee. Upon authorization by the \n     Chairman to release the name of a witness under this \n     paragraph, the Vice Chairman shall be notified of such \n     authorization as soon as practicable thereafter. No name of \n     any witness shall be released if such release would disclose \n     classified information, unless authorized under Section 8 of \n     S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress or Rule 9.7.\n\n   Rule 9. Procedures for Handling Classified or Committee Sensitive \n                                Material\n\n       9.1. Committee staff offices shall operate under strict \n     precautions. At least one United States Capitol Police \n     Officer shall be on duty at all times at the entrance of the \n     Committee to control entry. Before entering the Committee \n     office space all persons shall identify themselves and \n     provide identification as requested.\n       9.2. Classified documents and material shall be stored in \n     authorized security containers located within the Committee's \n     Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Copying, \n     duplicating, or removing from the Committee offices of such \n     documents and other materials is prohibited except as is \n     necessary for the conduct of Committee business, and in \n     conformity with Rule 10.3 hereof. All classified documents or \n     materials removed from the Committee offices for such \n     authorized purposes must be returned to the Committee's SCIF \n     for overnight storage.\n       9.3. ``Committee sensitive'' means information or material \n     that pertains to the confidential business or proceedings of \n     the Select Committee on Intelligence, within the meaning of \n     paragraph 5 of Rule XXIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     and is: (1) in the possession or under the control of the \n     Committee; (2) discussed or presented in an executive session \n     of the Committee; (3) the work product of a Committee member \n     or staff member; (4) properly identified or marked by a \n     Committee member or staff member who authored the document; \n     or (5) designated as such by the Chairman and Vice Chairman \n     (or by the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director acting \n     on their behalf). Committee sensitive documents and materials \n     that are classified shall be handled in the same manner as \n     classified documents and material in Rule 9.2. Unclassified \n     committee sensitive documents and materials shall be stored \n     in a manner to protect against unauthorized disclosure.\n       9.4. Each member of the Committee shall at all times have \n     access to all papers and other material received from any \n     source. The Staff Director shall be responsible for the \n     maintenance, under appropriate security procedures, of a \n     document control and accountability registry which will \n     number and identify all classified papers and other \n     classified materials in the possession of the Committee, and \n     such registry shall be available to any member of the \n     Committee.\n       9.5. Whenever the Select Committee on Intelligence makes \n     classified material available to any other committee of the \n     Senate or to any member of the Senate not a member of the \n     Committee, such material shall be accompanied by a verbal or \n     written notice to the recipients advising of their \n     responsibility to protect such materials pursuant to section \n     8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. The Security Director \n     of the Committee shall ensure that such notice is provided \n     and shall maintain a written record identifying the \n     particular information transmitted and the committee or \n     members of the Senate receiving such information.\n       9.6. Access to classified information supplied to the \n     Committee shall be limited to those Committee staff members \n     with appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know, as \n     determined by the Committee, and, under the Committee's \n     direction, the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director.\n       9.7. No member of the Committee or of the Committee staff \n     shall disclose, in whole or in part or by way of summary, the \n     contents of any classified or committee sensitive papers, \n     materials, briefings, testimony, or other information in the \n     possession of the Committee to any other person, except as \n     specified in this rule. Committee members and staff do not \n     need prior approval to disclose classified or committee \n     sensitive information to persons in the Executive branch, the \n     members and staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, and the members and staff of the Senate, \n     provided that the following conditions are met: (1) for \n     classified information, the recipients of the information \n     must possess appropriate security clearances (or have access \n     to the information by virtue of their office); (2) for all\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\n     information, the recipients of the information must have a \n     need-to-know such information for an official governmental \n     purpose; and (3) for all information, the Committee members \n     and staff who provide the information must be engaged in the \n     routine performance of Committee legislative or oversight \n     duties. Otherwise, classified and committee sensitive \n     information may only be disclosed to persons outside the \n     Committee (to include any congressional committee, Member of \n     Congress, congressional staff, or specified non-governmental \n     persons who support intelligence activities) with the prior \n     approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, \n     or the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director acting on \n     their behalf, consistent with the requirements \n     that classified information may only be disclosed to \n     persons with appropriate security clearances and a need-\n     to-know such information for an official governmental \n     purpose. Public disclosure of classified information in \n     the possession of the Committee may only be authorized in \n     accordance with Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th \n     Congress.\n       9.8. Failure to abide by Rule 9.7 shall constitute grounds \n     for referral to the Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. Prior to a \n     referral to the Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400, the Chairman and Vice Chairman \n     shall notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader.\n       9.9. Before the Committee makes any decision regarding the \n     disposition of any testimony, papers, or other materials \n     presented to it, the Committee members shall have a \n     reasonable opportunity to examine all pertinent testimony, \n     papers, and other materials that have been obtained by the \n     members of the Committee or the Committee staff.\n       9.10. Attendance of persons outside the Committee at closed \n     meetings of the Committee shall be kept at a minimum and \n     shall be limited to persons with appropriate security \n     clearance and a need-to-know the information under \n     consideration for the execution of their official duties. The \n     Security Director of the Committee may require that notes \n     taken at such meetings by any person in attendance shall be \n     returned to the secure storage area in the Committee's \n     offices at the conclusion of such meetings, and may be made \n     available to the department, agency, office, committee, or \n     entity concerned only in accordance with the security \n     procedures of the Committee.\n\n                             Rule 10. Staff\n\n       10.1. For purposes of these rules, Committee staff includes \n     employees of the Committee, consultants to the Committee, or \n     any other person engaged by contract or otherwise to perform \n     services for or at the request of the Committee. To the \n     maximum extent practicable, the Committee shall rely on its \n     full-time employees to perform all staff functions. No \n     individual may be retained as staff of the Committee or to \n     perform services for the Committee unless that individual \n     holds appropriate security clearances.\n       10.2. The appointment of Committee staff shall be approved \n     by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or, at the \n     initiative of both or either be confirmed by a majority vote \n     of the Committee. After approval or confirmation, the \n     Chairman shall certify Committee staff appointments to the \n     Financial Clerk of the Senate in writing. No Committee staff \n     shall be given access to any classified information or \n     regular access to the Committee offices until such Committee \n     staff has received an appropriate security clearance as \n     described in Section 6 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress.\n       10.3. The Committee staff works for the Committee as a \n     whole, under the supervision of the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee. The duties of the Committee staff \n     shall be performed, and Committee staff personnel affairs and \n     day-to-day operations, including security and control of \n     classified documents and material, shall be administered \n     under the direct supervision and control of the Staff \n     Director. All Committee staff shall work exclusively on \n     intelligence oversight issues for the Committee. The Minority \n     Staff Director and the Minority Counsel shall be kept fully \n     informed regarding all matters and shall have access to all \n     material in the files of the Committee.\n       10.4. The Committee staff shall assist the minority as \n     fully as the majority in the expression of minority views, \n     including assistance in the preparation and filing of \n     additional, separate, and minority views, to the end that all \n     points of view may be fully considered by the Committee and \n     the Senate.\n       10.5. The members of the Committee staff shall not discuss \n     either the substance or procedure of the work of the \n     Committee with any person not a member of the Committee or \n     the Committee staff for any purpose or in connection with any \n     proceeding, judicial or otherwise, either during their tenure \n     as a member of the Committee staff or at any time thereafter, \n     except as directed by the Committee in accordance with \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the \n     provisions of these rules, or in the event of the termination \n     of the Committee, in such a manner as may be determined by \n     the Senate. The Chairman may authorize the Staff Director and \n     the Staff Director's designee, and the Vice Chairman may \n     authorize the Minority Staff Director and the Minority Staff \n     Director's designee, to communicate with the media in a \n     manner that does not divulge classified or committee \n     sensitive information.\n       10.6. No member of the Committee staff shall be employed by \n     the Committee unless and until such a member of the Committee \n     staff agrees in writing, as a condition of employment, to \n     abide by the conditions of the nondisclosure agreement \n     promulgated by the Select Committee on Intelligence, pursuant \n     to Section 6 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress, and to \n     abide by the Committee's code of conduct.\n       10.7. As a precondition for employment on the Committee \n     staff, each member of the Committee staff must agree in \n     writing to notify the Committee of any request for testimony, \n     either during service as a member of the Committee staff or \n     at any time thereafter with respect to information obtained \n     by virtue of employment as a member of the Committee \n     staff. Such information shall not be disclosed in response \n     to such requests except as directed by the Committee in \n     accordance with Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th \n     Congress and the provisions of these rules or, in the \n     event of the termination of the Committee, in such manner \n     as may be determined by the Senate.\n       10.8. The Committee shall immediately consider action to be \n     taken in the case of any member of the Committee staff who \n     fails to conform to any of these Rules. Such disciplinary \n     action may include, but shall not be limited to, immediate \n     dismissal from the Committee staff.\n       10.9. Within the Committee staff shall be an element with \n     the capability to perform audits of programs and activities \n     undertaken by departments and agencies with intelligence \n     functions. Such element shall be comprised of persons \n     qualified by training and/or experience to carry out such \n     functions in accordance with accepted auditing standards.\n       10.10. The workplace of the Committee shall be free from \n     illegal use, possession, sale, or distribution of controlled \n     substances by its employees. Any violation of such policy by \n     any member of the Committee staff shall be grounds for \n     termination of employment. Further, any illegal use of \n     controlled substances by a member of the Committee staff, \n     within the workplace or otherwise, shall result in \n     reconsideration of the security clearance of any such staff \n     member and may constitute grounds for termination of \n     employment with the Committee.\n       10.11. All personnel actions affecting the staff of the \n     Committee shall be made free from any discrimination based on \n     race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, \n     or disability.\n\n              Rule 11. Preparation for Committee Meetings\n\n       11.1. Under direction of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman \n     designated Committee staff members shall brief members of the \n     Committee at a time sufficiently prior to any Committee \n     meeting to assist the Committee members in preparation for \n     such meeting and to determine any matter which the Committee \n     member might wish considered during the meeting. Such \n     briefing shall, at the request of a member, include a list of \n     all pertinent papers and other materials that have been \n     obtained by the Committee that bear on matters to be \n     considered at the meeting.\n       11.2. The Staff Director and/or Minority Staff Director \n     shall recommend to the Chairman and the Vice Chairman the \n     testimony, papers, and other materials to be presented to the \n     Committee at any meeting. The determination whether such \n     testimony, papers, and other materials shall be presented in \n     open or executive session shall be made pursuant to the Rules \n     of the Senate and Rules of the Committee.\n       11.3. The Staff Director shall ensure that covert action \n     programs of the U.S. Government receive appropriate \n     consideration by the Committee no less frequently than once a \n     quarter.\n\n                     Rule 12. Legislative Calendar\n\n       12.1. The Clerk of the Committee shall maintain a printed \n     calendar for the information of each Committee member showing \n     the measures introduced and referred to the Committee and the \n     status of such measures; nominations referred to the \n     Committee and their status; and such other matters as the \n     Committee determines shall be included. The Calendar shall be \n     revised from time to time to show pertinent changes. A copy \n     of each such revision shall be furnished to each member of \n     the Committee.\n       12.2. Measures referred to the Committee may be referred by \n     the Chairman and/or Vice Chairman to the appropriate \n     department or agency of the Government for reports thereon.\n\n                       Rule 13.

No employee of the select committee or any person \n     engaged by contract or otherwise to perform services for or \n     at the request of such committee shall be given access to any \n     classified information by such committee unless such employee \n     or person has (1) agreed in writing and under oath to be \n     bound by the rules of the Senate (including the jurisdiction \n     of the Select Committee on Ethics) and of such committee as \n     to the security of such information during and after the \n     period of his employment or contractual agreement with such \n     committee; and (2) received an appropriate security clearance \n     as determined by such committee in consultation with the \n     Director of National Intelligence. The type of security \n     clearance to be required in the case of any such employee or \n     person shall, within the determination of such committee in \n     consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, be \n     commensurate with the sensitivity of the classified \n     information to which such employee or person will be given \n     access by such committee.\n       Sec. 7. The select committee shall formulate and carry out \n     such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent \n     the disclosure, without the consent of the person or persons \n     concerned, of information in the possession of such committee \n     which unduly infringes upon the privacy or which violates the \n     constitutional rights of such person or persons. Nothing \n     herein shall be construed to prevent such committee from \n     publicly disclosing any such information in any case in which \n     such committee determines the national interest in the \n     disclosure of such information clearly outweighs any \n     infringement on the privacy of any person or persons.\n       Sec. 8. (a) The select committee may, subject to the \n     provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information \n     in the possession of such committee after a determination by \n     such committee that the public interest would be served by \n     such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to \n     disclose any information under this section, the committee \n     shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any \n     member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of \n     the select committee shall disclose any information, the \n     disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a \n     vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of \n     such information or after such vote except in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to \n     disclose publicly any information which has been classified \n     under established security procedures, which has been \n     submitted to it by the Executive branch, and which the \n     Executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee \n     shall--\n       (A) first, notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader \n     of the Senate of such vote; and\n       (B) second, consult with the Majority Leader and Minority \n     Leader before notifying the President of such vote.\n       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such \n     information after the expiration of a five-day period \n     following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted \n     to the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader and the \n     President, unless, prior to the expiration of such five-day \n     period, the President, personally in writing, notifies the \n     committee that he objects to the disclosure of such \n     information, provides his reasons therefore, and certifies \n     that the threat to the national interest of the United States \n     posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it outweighs \n     any public interest in the disclosure.\n       (3) If the President, personally, in writing, notifies the \n     Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate and the \n     select Committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), the Majority Leader \n     and Minority Leader jointly or the select Committee, by \n     majority vote, may refer the question of the disclosure of \n     such information to the Senate for consideration.\n       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the \n     question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under \n     paragraph (3), the Chairman shall not later than the first \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for \n     its consideration.\n       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on \n     which the Senate is in session following the day on which any \n     such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier \n     time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the \n     Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of \n     rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate \n     shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the \n     pending business. In considering the matter in closed session \n     the Senate may--\n       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of \n     the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall publicly disclose the information ordered to be \n     disclosed,\n       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion \n     of the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered not to be \n     disclosed, or\n       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the \n     committee, in which case the committee shall make the final \n     determination with respect to the public disclosure of the \n     information in question.\n\n     Upon conclusion of the consideration of such matter in closed \n     session, which may not extend beyond the close of the ninth \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close of \n     the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the \n     majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5 \n     of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever \n     the case may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the \n     disposition of such matter in open session, without debate, \n     and without divulging the information with respect to which \n     the vote is being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of \n     such matter by one or more of the means specified in clauses \n     (A), (B), and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph. \n     Any vote of the Senate to disclose any information pursuant \n     to this paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member \n     of the Senate to move for reconsideration of the vote within \n     the time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule \n     XIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure \n     of such information shall be made consistent with that right.\n       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select \n     committee relating to the lawful intelligence activities of \n     any department or agency of the United States which has been \n     classified under established security procedures and which \n     the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section, has determined should not be disclosed shall be \n     made available to any person by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate except in a closed session of the \n     Senate or as provided in paragraph (2).\n       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the \n     committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of \n     such information, make any information described in paragraph \n     (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of \n     the Senate. Whenever the select committee makes such \n     information available, the committee shall keep a written \n     record showing, in the case of any particular information, \n     which committee or which Members of the Senate received such \n     information. No Member of the Senate who, and no committee \n     which, receives any information under this subsection, shall \n     disclose such information except in a closed session of the \n     Senate.\n       (d) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee on Ethics \n     to investigate any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence \n     information by a Member, officer or employee of the Senate in \n     violation of subsection (c) and to report to the Senate \n     concerning any allegation which it finds to be substantiated.\n       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any \n     such investigation, the Select Committee on Ethics shall \n     release to such individual at the conclusion of its \n     investigation a summary of its investigation together with \n     its findings. If, at the conclusion of its investigation, the \n     Select Committee on Ethics determines that there has been a \n     significant breach of confidentiality or unauthorized \n     disclosure by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, \n     it shall report its findings to the Senate and recommend \n     appropriate action such as censure, removal from committee \n     membership, or expulsion from the Senate, in the case of a \n     Member, or removal from office or employment or punishment \n     for contempt, in the case of an officer or employee.\n       Sec. 9. The select committee is authorized to permit any \n     personal representative of the President, designated by the \n     President to serve as a liaison to such committee, to attend \n     any closed meeting of such committee.\n       Sec. 10.

Madam President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor \nthe life of CPL Zachary Ray Nordmeyer from Indianapolis, IN. Zachary \nwas 21 years old when he lost his life on February 23, 2009, from \ninjuries sustained when he and others came under attack from small-arms \nfire in Balad, Iraq. He was a member of the 5th Squadron, 1st Cavalry \nRegiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division of \nFort Wainwright, AK.\n  Zachary, a graduate of the JROTC program at Ben Davis High School in \nIndianapolis, joined the Army in July 2007 and was sent to Iraq in \nSeptember for a 12-month tour. He was an avid sports fan, playing \nfootball and baseball at Ben Davis and never missing an opportunity to \nwatch his favorite NASCAR driver, Jeff Gordon, in action. He was a \nmember of Lakeview Church and Harmony Baptist Church, and also enjoyed \nfishing, hunting, and spending time with his family and friends.\n  Today, I join Zachary's family and friends in mourning his death. \nZachary will forever be remembered as a loving brother, son, grandson, \nand friend to many. Zachary is survived by his fiancee, Chrissy Purdy; \nfather, Michael Nordmeyer; step-parents, Kevin and Cindy Bereman; \nbrothers, Josh and David Nordmeyer; step-sisters, Rachel Klop, Kendra \nGregg, and Karen Piehl; step-brother, Kristopher Bereman; grandparents, \nNancy and Bill Harman, Tim and Susan Fair; grandfather, Paul Nordmeyer; \ngrandmother, Marilyn Fair; great-grandparents, Herman and Evona Fair; \naunts and uncles, Tom and Mindy Nordmeyer, Brian and Stephanie \nNordmeyer, Brad and Kim Nordmeyer; uncles, Kevin and Brandon Fair and \nSteven Harman; aunt, Stephanie Harman; many nieces and nephews; and a \nhost of other friends and relatives. Zachary was preceded in death by \nhis mother, Kimberly Bereman; and great-grandparents, Lester and Elenor \nBaker, George and Eve Nordmeyer, and Paul and Dorothy Fisher.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Zachary set as a soldier. Today and always, \nZachary will be remembered by family, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a \ntrue American hero, and we cherish the sacrifice he made while \ndutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice to this valiant fallen soldier, I \nrecall President Abraham Lincoln's words as he addressed the families \nof soldiers who died at Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas we can take some measure of solace in knowing that Zachary's heroism \nand memory will outlive the record of the words here spoken.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Zachary Nordmeyer in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. I pray \nthat Zachary's family can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said:\n\n       He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will \n     wipe away tears from off all faces.\n\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Zachary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/03/senate-section/article/S2688-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PEACE CORPS ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, Sunday marked the 48th anniversary of \nthe Peace Corps. As we wrap up Peace Corps Week here in the United \nStates, I would like take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt \ncongratulations and appreciation to all current and former volunteers.\n  Since its creation in 1961, approximately 190,000 volunteers have \nserved in 139 countries around the world. The fields Peace Corps \nvolunteers work in are as varied as the countries in which they serve, \nbut they offer us a snapshot of the breadth of global development \nchallenges we face as a planet: HIV/AIDs; food security; environmental \ndegradation; expanding the reach of technology; improving access to \nclean water and sanitation; and providing education and professional \nopportunities to those who might not otherwise have a chance to go to \nschool or open a business.\n  Not only the host countries benefit from all the good work these \nvolunteers do. Each of these volunteers gives the United States an \nopportunity to showcase our values and goals to the rest of the world \nin a grassroots way. The volunteers have the chance to learn foreign \nlanguages, live and work in new cultures, and develop skills which will \naid them in their future careers. The skills these intrepid volunteers \nlearn during their tours will also be a credit to the United States in \nthe future as they return home and put their on-the-ground knowledge to \nwork in the States.\n  I am delighted to see that the spirit of this movement is still \nstrong with Alaskans. This year, 32 Alaskans are serving in 27 \ndifferent countries on five different continents in fields ranging from \nhealth to education to agriculture to small business development. When \nthey return to Alaska it will be with the knowledge that they can \nachieve any task set before them with innovation and hard work. I am \nexcited to see what great things they will do next for our State and \nthe Nation as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/03/senate-section/article/S2688-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2688-S2690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\nprices have dropped in recent weeks, the concerns expressed remain very \nrelevant. To respect the efforts of those who took the opportunity to \nshare their thoughts, I am submitting every e-mail sent to me through \nan address set up specifically for this purpose to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       You have asked for input as to helpful solutions regarding \n     the energy crisis.\n       I am attaching three resolutions that came from a national \n     committee that I chair--the Energy, Natural Resource & \n     Agriculture Policy Committee for the National Foundation for \n     Women Legislators (NFWL). These resolutions were passed by my \n     Committee in October of 2007. Each ``Where As'' tells the \n     story of why we are where we are today and then finally gives \n     recommendations for solutions. Please submit these into the \n     Congressional Record as you seek to tell stories about what \n     Idahoans are doing to offer help and why energy solutions are \n     needed.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to tell our story from the \n     Energy, Natural Resource & Agriculture Committee to the U.S. \n     Senate.

and\n       Whereas, it is in the best interests of the United States \n     to become as energy independent and diversified as possible \n     to avoid economic dislocations instigated by foreign oil \n     interests, markets and the effects of natural disasters; and\n       Whereas, comprehensive federal energy legislation signed \n     into law in 2005 advocates the expansion of nuclear energy \n     for the production of electrical power and hydrogen, as well \n     as the development of bio-energy and other alternative fuels \n     to reduce dependence on foreign sources of oil, a truly \n     balanced portfolio of energy options; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) is \n     the federal agency that has primary responsibility for \n     carrying out the directives of the President and the Congress \n     relative to enabling and enhancing the energy security of the \n     nation; and\n       Whereas, the DOE Laboratories and other Federal \n     Laboratories are a key national research, development and \n     demonstration resource wherein the federal government has \n     invested significant tax dollars to establish such unique and \n     globally important assets all of which demand continued, or \n     even expanded, use to assure maximum return on tax dollar \n     investment; and\n       Whereas, the Idaho National Laboratory has been designated \n     as the lead DOE lab for nuclear energy technology and \n     development and is expected to have a key role in an \n     international initiative; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Laboratory Consortium (FLC) for \n     Technology Transfer can assist in identifying federal labs \n     with a variety of expertise to help states, including energy, \n     through their website;\n       Be it resolved that the NFWL Energy, Natural Resource & \n     Agriculture Policy Committee supports execution of an \n     enhanced and balanced portfolio of nuclear, bio-energy, \n     hydropower, fuel reforming and related alternative and \n     renewable energy research, and hereby requests the DOE, the \n     Administration and the Congress identify, commit and sustain \n     the funding necessary to allow continued performance of this \n     and other multi-program energy and national security \n     enhancing work so critical to the long-term well-being of \n     these United States.\n       Be it further resolved, that NFWL forward a copy of this \n     resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, to the President \n     of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     NFWL Energy, Natural Resources & Agriculture Policy Committee\n\n\n   Resolution on the Energy Policy Act of 2005 Loan Guarantee Program\n\n                     (Introduced October 12, 2007)\n\n       Whereas, the National Foundation for Women Legislators \n     (NFWL) Energy, Natural Resource & Agriculture Policy \n     Committee commends Congress and the Administration on passage \n     of the EPAct05 (Energy Policy Act of 2005) that reaffirms the \n     federal commitment to establish and maintain a national \n     energy policy; and\n       Whereas, the EPAct05 authorizes the U.S. Department of \n     Energy to issue loan guarantees to eligible projects that \n     ``avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic \n     emissions of greenhouse gases'' and ``employ new or \n     significantly improved technologies as compared to \n     technologies in service in the United States at the time the \n     guarantee is issued''; and\n       Whereas, loan guarantees will be another tool that DOE will \n     use to promote commercial use of innovative technologies; and\n       Whereas, a principal purpose of the Title XVII loan \n     guarantee program is to encourage early commercial use in the \n     United States of new or significantly improved technologies \n     in energy projects; and\n       Whereas, this NFWL Policy Committee submits that energy \n     independence must be a primary goal of the United States and \n     that short- and long-term strategies that provide adequate \n     energy supplies with efficient utilization and optimum cost \n     effectiveness must be developed; and\n       Whereas, it is believed that accelerated commercial use of \n     new or improved technologies will help to sustain economic \n     growth, yield environmental benefits, and produce a more \n     stable and secure energy supply; and\n       Whereas, the national energy policy and loan guarantee \n     program should promote and provide incentives for the \n     development and optimal use of all energy resources; and\n       Whereas, nuclear energy is not currently listed in FY 2008 \n     House Energy & Water Appropriations legislation as an \n     included technology area to participate in the loan guarantee \n     program, and is a technology project that avoids, reduces, or \n     sequesters air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of \n     greenhouse gases;\n       Now, therefore be it resolved that the NFWL Energy, Natural \n     Resource & Agriculture Policy Committee requests the DOE, the \n     Administration and the Congress to include nuclear energy in \n     the projects for the loan guarantee program.\n       Be it further resolved, that NFWL forward a copy of this \n     resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, to the President \n     of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     of Congress as well as appropriate House and Senate \n     Committees.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     NFWL Energy, Natural Resources & Agriculture Policy Committee\n\n\n                  Resolution on National Energy Policy\n\n                     (Introduced October 12, 2007)\n\n       Whereas, the National Foundation for Women Legislators \n     (NFWL) Energy, Natural Resource & Agriculture Policy \n     Committee commends Congress and the Administration on passage \n     of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that reaffirms the federal \n     commitment to establish and maintain a national energy \n     policy; and\n       Whereas, the primary goals of a national energy policy \n     should develop a comprehensive energy conservation strategy, \n     with the most efficient use of energy, promote reliable \n     sources of domestic energy supplies as well as develop and \n     promote the use of alternative, renewable and non-renewable \n     energy sources; and\n       Whereas, a national energy policy should ensure affordable \n     priced energy with an adequate supply available, and ensure \n     an efficient and environmentally-sound manner so that the \n     needs of all citizens, economy and national security \n     interests are met and be a balanced portfolio of energy \n     options; and\n       Whereas, this NFWL Policy Committee submits that energy \n     independence must be a primary goal of the United States and \n     that short and long-term strategies that provide adequate \n     energy supplies with efficient utilization and optimum cost \n     effectiveness must be developed; and\n       Whereas, a comprehensive strategy is needed to increase \n     U.S. and global energy security, encourage clean development \n     around the world, recycle nuclear fuel using new \n     proliferation-resistant technologies to recover more energy \n     and reduce waste, and improve the environment; and\n       Whereas, the national energy policy should promote and \n     provide incentives for the development and optimal use of all \n     energy resources and new facility infrastructure which \n     assures that various domestic energy sources are continually \n     developed, maintained and stored to prevent supply \n     emergencies and to promote energy independence; and\n       Now, therefore be it resolved that the NFWL Energy, Natural \n     Resource & Agriculture Policy Committee encourages the DOE, \n     the Administration and the Congress to develop a balanced \n     portfolio of energy choices, implement and maintain an \n     expansive, cost-effective, environmentally-sensitive national \n     energy policy.\n       Be it further resolved, that NFWL forward a copy of this \n     resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, to the President \n     of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a little more than concerned about the rising costs of \n     fuel. It hits every economic level of income but mostly the \n     middle to low incomes. We are in the $50,000 income range. I \n     own a small business and my husband works for the State. \n     Increase in the price of fuel is directly felt every time a \n     person drives a vehicle. It is double what it was last year. \n     I drive a 2000 Nissan Sentra. It is a little car. We live on \n     a budget. A paycheck only stretches so far. For a small \n     business this means an increase in freight costs. Some\n\n[[Page S2690]]\n\n     of those costs are passed to the consumer and some are \n     absorbed. A small business is the least likely to be able to \n     handle this. The costs passed to the consumer are on top of \n     the gas prices they are already paying. I live in a small \n     rural community. Because in the past so many people have done \n     their shopping out of town, our town has less to offer which \n     in turn makes going out of town to shop a very costly \n     experience. The whole situation is a catch-22.\n       America needs to use its own resources and not let foreign \n     companies do it (drilling for oil off the coast). We also \n     need to be responsible for our overindulgences and use \n     smaller more economical vehicles. We are paying for \n     our gluttony. We do need to explore alternative energy \n     also. We also need to curb our spending in congress. Our \n     country is broke and nobody wants to fix it. Pork barrel \n     spending is breaking this country. Why are we attaching \n     appropriations to bills that have nothing to do with the \n     original bill? Please start making upright and morally \n     responsible decisions. I think Congress is totally out of \n     control.\n       A desperate citizen,\n     Sue, Grangeville.\n                                  ____\n\n       I appreciate your interest in this issue. I must say I am \n     quite fortunate that my 94 Ford escort gets 37 MPG and suits \n     most my needs quite adequately. In addition, I live just a \n     few miles from work in Boise, so I usually ride my bicycle to \n     work. I do recognize that this is not an option for many \n     Idahoans, such as my mom who lives 10 miles outside of \n     Blackfoot.\n       Frankly, as far as this last e-mail you sent me goes, it \n     sounds like you are listening too much to lobbyists from the \n     energy industries. More gas exploration is not a long term \n     solution--I cannot imagine that new finds are going to even \n     come close to offsetting increased demand from Asia. (If you \n     have numbers that suggest otherwise, I would love to see \n     them.) More exploration is a mere band-aid that just kicks \n     the problem down the road to whomever gets your seat next. To \n     me, it sounds almost as pointless as Senator Clinton's gas \n     tax holiday she was talking about.\n       Instead of typical Washington [solutions], Senator, we need \n     real leadership. We need to be pouring our resources into \n     building alternative modes of transit that can aid this \n     inevitable transition from cheap fossil fuels. We need to \n     bring rail transit back to Southern Idaho. We need a rural \n     bus system with park-and-ride spots along state highways \n     (much like the system used for the buses that run to INL). We \n     need higher fuel-efficiency standards from Detroit. (You may \n     have to tell some industry folks to jump in a lake--that is \n     what we pay you for.) As far as helping people cope with this \n     transition, perhaps you could give tax cuts to small farmers \n     and people who live more than 15 miles from a bus or train \n     stop. But basically any incentives should go towards helping \n     people use less fossil fuel, not more.\n     Alex, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       First off I want to state that I do not consider this fuel \n     problem to be as big of a crisis as it was when we had the \n     fuel shortages back a few decades. This is becoming more of \n     an issue because the dollar is so weak right now, and it does \n     not seem to be getting any better. With that said, my family \n     and I have noticed the problems with fuel prices across the \n     board. I am in the process of trying to make a choice in a \n     new job that would put me back in the classroom doing what I \n     really love, but with gas prices and me riding the ACHD van \n     that is a big cost change for us. I am amazed that with all \n     of the possibilities out there that our energy and gas prices \n     are going up. Why are we not building more wind power plants \n     like California to produce endless power that is also very \n     expandable? Why are we not taking advantage of the man who \n     invented the super fuel efficient engine right here in Idaho \n     who resides in Weiser? There are answers besides drilling \n     right here and we seem to overlook them. I am not against \n     more nuclear power, but the hazards really do not justify \n     those means of power any more. I really hope that we can see \n     some changes soon with the addition of a transit system from \n     Caldwell to Boise or maybe even Weiser. I do know that \n     something has to change or the US will have too many poor \n     people to help. Thank you for your time.\n     Richard, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked for and so here goes. I am so upset with all of \n     the members of Congress and our Government in general for not \n     having an energy plan already in place in the United States. \n     Not only should we not be dependent on foreign countries for \n     our oil sources but we should most definitely have invested \n     in other sources of energy long before now. Off-shore \n     drilling and massacring the Alaskan Wilderness is not the \n     answer. There is absolutely no reason for us not to have \n     automobiles running on other sources of power other than to \n     line the pockets of the oil industry and those ``in the \n     trough''. The technology is there and I think we need \n     government mandates and incentives in place now to force \n     (if necessary) people to create and use these alternative \n     sources. We should reward those companies and those people \n     who produce and use hybrid and other alternative energy-\n     sourced vehicles and mass transit and severely tax those \n     people who insist on driving the big SUVs and Hummers in \n     the U.S. as well as those who are the big wasters of \n     energy. ``Going Green'' should not only be the right thing \n     to do for us and the world (and the U.S. should be leading \n     the world as the ``example'') but should be the most \n     economical thing to do and we need to reward those who do \n     and assess those who do not. If companies are not going to \n     take the initiative to make this happen on their own, then \n     the government has to give the free enterprise system and \n     the general public incentives to make it happen.\n       There is no one person in the U.S. who is not feeling the \n     effects of the high prices. Whether it be gas, food or other \n     products we buy and use in our life activities, they are all \n     affected by the high gas prices. Those with high incomes can \n     most likely absorb these increased costs but those on fixed \n     incomes and the low- and middle-income cannot sustain these \n     high prices for long. We are in a crisis situation here and I \n     only see it getting worse. And I blame all of you in Congress \n     for not addressing it much sooner (like some 10-20 years ago) \n     and I blame John Q. Public for re-electing all of you time \n     and again. It seems to me that Congress is completely out of \n     touch not only with John Q. Public but with reality. Let me \n     reiterate, more drilling in our own country is not the \n     answer. We must use other alternative energy sources be it \n     electric, wind, nuclear, etc. What kind of country are we \n     leaving for our grandkids? Not a very good one at this rate--\n     if we even have one left!\n     Melodie.\n                                  ____\n\n       You write that my country is too dependent on foreign oil \n     and we must develop alternate energy sources. You, your \n     party, and many of the Democrats have voted consistently \n     against all such alternatives for one reason or another. It \n     is of no use to write about my experience with the rise in \n     gas prices. If Congress and this Administration need stories, \n     then it further proves that our elected government does not \n     give a damn about the citizens--an expansion of Katrina/New \n     Orleans. You have held hearings with the oil representatives \n     which resulted in the usual shameful display of sucking-up to \n     the industry. Thank you for your inattention to this \n     response.\n     Harry.\n                                  ____\n\n       Does anyone in Washington remember the huge deal it was \n     when gasoline broke $2/gallon about 4 years ago? How about \n     when it reached $3/gallon briefly in 2005 and caused a minor \n     panic about skyrocketing prices? I remember newspaper \n     articles asking ``Will we ever see $2/gallon gasoline \n     again?'' and we wondered if that time had passed. Then prices \n     came back down and did a bit of an up-down over the next \n     couple of years. Through all of that, combatting high oil \n     prices was a top priority for Congress and the White House, \n     which led to the ethanol debacle.\n       Now, the Democrat powers-that-be in Washington and around \n     the country have seemingly embraced $4/gallon gasoline as the \n     impetus to make us explore ``alternate energy sources,'' \n     while completely ignoring the agonizing inflationary pressure \n     these price increases are causing. Now we hear, ``Blame \n     Bush!'' ``No war for oil!'' ``Save the polar bears!'' How in \n     the world do we expect to be able to maintain our economic \n     strength while we simultaneously insist on crippling the \n     economy?\n       I would urge you, Senator, to work to allow us to pursue \n     oil reserves wherever they might be found in our country. We \n     should seek to be wise stewards of the land, but also \n     acknowledge that if we do not do it here, it will be done \n     elsewhere by people who do not seem to care as much about the \n     environment. ``Not in my backyard'' is the most \n     environmentally irresponsible decision we could possibly \n     make.\n     David, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Gas prices are outrageous. If it does cost that much for \n     the oil, why not get out of there and drill on our own \n     grounds, or even Canada? What is happening is someone is \n     making a lot of money off this, and they know that they can \n     keep raising the price and people will pay it, people have to \n     pay it.\n     CJ.\n                                  ____\n\n       We appreciate your interest in the high cost of gasoline \n     and energy, but even if the government started drilling \n     today, we do not have refineries up and running nor do we \n     have enough of them to process the gas we discover. So who \n     and where will we have to transport this ``new gas'' to, to \n     make it useable for the people of the U.S.? Obama stated he \n     wished the price would have increased a little more slowly so \n     this sounds like it is been planned a looong time in \n     Congress.\n       Who has got the truth on any of our economy and energy \n     issues?\n       Thanks for your efforts.\n     Chuck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/03/senate-section/article/S2690-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/03/senate-section/article/S2690-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2690-S2691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations\n\n[[Page S2691]]\n\nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/03/senate-section/article/S2691-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:27 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n  H.R. 81.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with \nrespect to the safety of the food supply; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the FDA Food \nSafety Modernization Act.\n  When I introduced this bill in the last Congress, we were in the \nmiddle of one of the largest food-borne illness outbreaks in the \nhistory of our country. Nearly 1500 people fell sick last spring and \nsummer because of Salmonella Saintpaul, leading to a Government \ninvestigation that pointed the finger first at tomatoes and then at \njalapeno peppers in Texas before settling on Serrano peppers in Mexico. \nIn the meantime, more people got sick and the tomato industry lost up \nto hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Less than a year later, we find ourselves in the middle of yet \nanother nationwide outbreak: peanut butter tainted with Salmonella, the \nsecond case of its kind in 2 years. There is not a day that goes by \nthat we don't hear about another recalled peanut butter product or \nanother person sick with Salmonella. More than 660 people have been \nsickened, half of them children. At least nine people are dead. Over \n2,600 products have been recalled, in a recall that goes back to March \n2005 and could continue for at least another couple of years, making \nthis one of the biggest food recalls in our Nation's history.\n  Unfortunately, these problems seem to be par for the course. In the \nlast couple of years we have seen Salmonella in our peppers and peanut \nbutter and E. coli in our spinach. Our food safety problems do not just \nstart and stop at home: we have also seen chemically tainted pet food, \nmilk products, and seafood from China.\n  These problems are only the tip of the iceberg. Every year, more than \n76 million Americans become sick because of a food-borne illness, \n325,000 are hospitalized, and 5,000 die.\n  It is clear that the Food and Drug Administration, who regulates \nthese foods and 80 percent of our food supply, including virtually all \nfood imports, can not keep up. The agency is underfunded and \noverwhelmed. It operates under an obsolete, largely reactive 1938 law. \nIts food safety program has not kept up with the dramatic changes in \nour food system, and it does a poor job of preventing and responding to \nfood safety problems. As a result, consumers suffer and so do \nbusinesses something we can never afford, but especially in these \ntrying economic times.\n  Our food safety system is in crisis and it is time that we act. \nThat's why Senator Gregg and I are introducing\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\nthe FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, a bipartisan bill that gives the \nFDA the new authorities and resources it needs to stop food safety \nproblems before they start.\n  For the first time in history, our bill gives the FDA a mandate to \ninspect: to increase the inspections at all food facilities, including \nannual inspections of high risk facilities. It requires the food \nindustry to have in place plans that address identified hazards with \nthe right preventive measures. It requires all testing and sampling for \nregulatory purposes to be done by labs accredited by the FDA, and \nrequires those results to be sent to the agency. It also enables the \nFDA to more effectively respond to an outbreak by giving the agency new \nauthorities to order recalls, shut down tainted facilities, and access \nrecords.\n  This bill is proof that food safety is not a Democratic issue or a \nRepublican one. Everyone eats. All Americans have a right to know that \nthe food we buy for our families and our pets is safe. We should not \nhave to worry about getting sick, or worse. If there's a problem, our \nGovernment should be able to catch it and fix it before people die.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy, Dodd, Klobuchar, Burr, Alexander, and \nChambliss for joining me in this effort. I also want to thank the \nconsumer, public health, and industry groups who have helped us craft a \nstrong bill for their support: Consumer Federation of America, Center \nfor Science in the Public Interest, Consumers Union, Trust for \nAmerica's Health, Grocery Manufacturers of America, American Feed \nIndustry Association, American Frozen Food Institute, Food Marketing \nInstitute, National Fisheries Institute, and American Spice Trade \nAssociation.\n  This bill is a comprehensive, bipartisan effort that improves the \nFDA's ability to prevent, detect, and respond to food safety problems, \nwhether this means Salmonella-tainted peanut butter from Georgia or \nmelamine-spiked candy from China. It's the first step towards building \na food safety system that is science and risk-based, accountable to \nconsumers, more transparent, and focused on prevention. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 510\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance \nvocational rehabilitation benefits for veterans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am introducing today the proposed \nVeterans Rehabilitation and Training Improvements Act of 2009. This \nmeasure would improve the program of rehabilitation and training for \nveterans who suffer from service-connected disabilities by offering an \nincrease in the amount of subsistence allowances, reimbursing certain \nincidental costs, and repealing the limit on the number of individuals \nwho may be enrolled in a program of Independent Living services.\n  Under current law, veterans who are enrolled in a program of \nrehabilitation under Chapter 31 receive a monthly subsistence \nallowance. This, in addition to the payment of the costs of the program \nof rehabilitation, is intended to offer the veteran a means of paying \nfor basic living expenses while pursuing their training or education.\n  With the enactment of the new Post 9-11 GI Bill last year, P.L. 110-\n323, which adopted a tuition-and-fees plus a living allowance approach \nto the payment of benefits under the educational assistance program, I \nam concerned that there may be an inequity between the vocational \nrehabilitation and education programs and that individuals who would \ntruly benefit from enrollment in a program of rehabilitation and \nemployment under Chapter 31 will be tempted to enroll in the Chapter 33 \neducation program in order to take advantage of the higher living \nallowance. Those who would make such an election might forgo valuable \ncounseling, employment and placement, and other assistance from which \nthey might benefit.\n  To address this concern, the measure I am introducing today would \nmodify the Chapter 31 program by offering a subsistence allowance to \nenrollees equal to the national average for the Department of Defense's \nBasic Allowance for Housing, BAH, for members of the military at the E-\n5 level, adjusted for marital status. This is similar, although not \nidentical to, the approach of the new chapter 33 program which\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\nadopted a regionalized BAH approach based on the address of the \ninstitution.\n  This is intended to help ensure that individuals who could best \nbenefit from enrollment in the Chapter 31 program are not faced with a \ndisincentive to do so.\n  With regard to the second issue, VA is permitted to pay certain costs \nassociated with enrollment of an individual in a program of \nrehabilitation--for example, fees, equipment, and supplies. However, \nthere are other costs that an individual might incur that are not \ncovered by VA and these costs could represent a substantial barrier to \nthe successful completion of a program. An example could be that of a \nsingle young mother with young children who--in order to attend \nclasses--needs child care. Another example might be a veteran who lost \nboth legs in service and needs a new suit in order to make the most \nfavorable impression at the interview with a prospective employer.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would require VA to issue \nregulations providing for the reimbursement of incidental costs \nassociated with obstacles that pose substantial barriers to successful \ncompletion of a program. I believe that this will substantially \nincrease the ability of many individuals to finish their rehabilitation \nprograms and be placed in rewarding jobs.\n  I also believe we need to repeal the cap on the number of individuals \nwho may be enrolled in a program of Independent Living services under \nthe Chapter 31 program. Current law provides that individuals for whom \na determination is made that a program of rehabilitation leading to \nemployment is not reasonably feasible may be eligible for enrollment in \na program of independent living services which is designed to help the \nindividual achieve a maximum level of independence in daily life. \nHowever, the number of veterans who in any one year may enroll in these \nprograms is capped at 2,600.\n  Even though the VA has testified in the past that this enrollment cap \ndoes not present any problem for the effective conduct of the program, \nI remain concerned--despite the fact that last year Congress raised the \ncap from 2,500 to 2,600 in P.L. 110-389--that the effect of the cap is \nto put downward pressure on VA's enrollment of eligible veterans in \nthis very important program. This is of particular concern when so many \nof today's returning servicemembers suffer from disabilities that may \nrequire extensive periods of rehabilitation and assistance in achieving \nindependence in their daily lives that can result from such conditions \nas traumatic brain injury or PTSD.\n  Disabled veterans are transitioning from military service into an \neconomy that is changing, challenging, and contracting at historic \nrates. My bill will give these veterans more of the help they need by \nincreasing program flexibility and boosting the living stipend for \ndisabled veterans undergoing rehabilitation.\n  While there will be costs associated with this legislation, the \nveterans who are served by the chapter 31 rehabilitation and employment \nprogram are the highest priority for our Nation--individuals who have \nincurred service-connected disabilities in service to the country. This \ntruly is one of the costs of war that must be borne.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in moving this \nlegislation through the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 514\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE FOR VETERANS PARTICIPATING IN A \n                   PROGRAM OF REHABILITATION.\n\n       (a) Modification of Amount of Subsistence Allowance.--\n     Subsection (b) of section 3108 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the \n     amount of the subsistence allowance to be paid to a veteran \n     under this chapter for a month during which the veteran \n     participates in a rehabilitation program under this chapter \n     shall be the amount equal to the national average of the \n     amount of basic allowance for housing payable under section \n     403 of title 37 for that month for a member of the uniformed \n     services in pay grade E-5 with or without dependents, as \n     applicable.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on October 1, 2009, and shall apply with \n     respect to subsistence allowances payable under chapter 31 of \n     title 38, United States Code, for months beginning on or \n     after that date.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The costs \n     for which payment may be made under this subsection may \n     include child care expenses, costs for clothing for \n     interviews for employment, and such other costs as the \n     Secretary may prescribe in such regulations. The amounts \n     payable in reimbursement for any such costs shall be the \n     amounts determined in accordance with such regulations.\n       ``(2) Any payment of costs in reimbursement of a veteran \n     under this subsection is in addition to the subsistence \n     allowance payable to the veteran under this section.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPEAL OF LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF VETERANS ENROLLED \n                   IN PROGRAMS OF INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES AND \n                   ASSISTANCE.\n\n       Section 3120 of title 38, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (e); and\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (e).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, Mr. Risch, and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 515. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to provide for \npatent reform; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, ingenuity and innovation have been a \ncornerstone of the American economy from the time Thomas Jefferson \nissued the first patent to today.\n  The Founding Fathers recognized the importance of promoting \ninnovation, and the Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power \nto ``promote the progress and science and useful arts, by securing for \nlimited times to . . . inventors the exclusive right to their \nrespective . . . discoveries.'' The discoveries made by American \ninventors and research institutions, commercialized by our companies, \nand protected and promoted by our patent laws have made our system the \nenvy of the world.\n  The legislation I introduce today with Senator Hatch, and many others \nand from across the political spectrum, will keep America in its \nlongstanding position at the pinnacle of innovation. This bill will \nestablish a more efficient and streamlined patent system that will \nimprove patent quality and limit unnecessary and counterproductive \nlitigation costs, while making sure no party's access to court is \ndenied.\n  Innovation and economic development are not uniquely Democratic or \nRepublican objectives. I have been working on the Patent Reform Act on \na bipartisan basis with Senator Hatch and others for several years--and \nSenator Hatch and I worked on various patent issues for many years \nbefore that.\n  Last Congress, I introduced, along with Senator Hatch, the Patent \nReform Act of 2007, which is the precursor to the legislation we \nintroduce today. That bill was the subject of consideration and \namendments over four weeks of mark-up sessions in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. After the Judiciary Committee voted to approve the bill in \nJuly 2007, we continued to hold numerous meetings, briefings, and \nstakeholder roundtables--again, on a bipartisan basis.\n  The legislation we introduce today picks up where we left off in \nthose discussions. We have made some changes from the Committee-\napproved bill in response to concerns we heard from groups ranging from \nlabor unions to small inventors to manufacturers. We have removed the \nrequirement that all patent applications be published 18 months after \nthey are filed and we have removed the requirement for Applicant \nQuality Submissions. We have also adopted the House approach to \nimproving the current inter partes reexamination process, rather than \ncreating a new second window post-grant review.\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\n  Perhaps the most hotly debated topic in the patent reform debate last \nCongress was the damages provision. The reasonable royalty language in \nthe bill we introduce today is identical to the language approved by \nthe Judiciary Committee last Congress. While I strongly support this \nlanguage, I am prepared to continue the conversation and debate from \nthe last Congress in order to find the best language we can.\n  There have been several positive developments since the Committee \nvoted to report the legislation in July 2007. Senator Specter has made \nconstructive suggestions about a ``gate keeping'' role for the court in \ndamage calculations. The Supreme Court's Quanta decision may offer a \nuseful way of describing the truly inventive feature of a patent. There \nis much work to do on this provision and I am optimistic that by \ncontinuing to work together, we will find the right language.\n  During consideration of the Patent Reform Act of 2007 in Committee \nlast Congress, I offered an amendment, which was adopted, to codify the \ninequitable conduct doctrine. Senator Hatch has asked that the \nprovision be removed on introduction this year. I understand that the \nissue of inequitable conduct is very important to Senator Hatch, and I \nwill work with him to address any statutory changes.\n  It has been more than 50 years since Congress significantly updated \nthe patent system. In the decades since, our economy has changed \ndramatically. No longer is the economy defined only by assembly lines \nand brick-and-mortar production. We are living in the Information Age, \nand the products and processes that are being patented are changing as \nquickly as the times themselves.\n  A patent system developed for a 1952 economy, needs to be \nreconsidered in light of 21st century realities, while staying true to \nour constitutional imperative. The patent laws that were sufficiently \nrobust for promoting innovation and economic development are now \nactually impeding growth, harming innovators and raising prices on \nconsumers.\n  The array of voices heard in this debate--representing virtually all \nsectors of the economy and all interests in the patent system--have \ncertainly not been uniform, but three major areas of concern with the \ncurrent patent system can be distilled from their discussions.\n  First, there is significant concern that the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office, PTO, is issuing low quality patents. Patent examiners \nare facing a difficult task given the explosion in the number of \napplications and the increasing complexity of those applications. When \nCongress last overhauled the patent system in 1952, the PTO received \napproximately 60,000 patent applications; in 2006, it received 440,000. \nClearly, this puts a strain on the system and understandably affects \nthe quality of patents issued.\n  Second, the costs and uncertainty associated with patent litigation \nhave escalated in recent years, and are creating an unbearable drag on \ninnovation. Damage awards are inconsistent and too often fail to focus \non the value of the invention to the infringing product. This \ndisconnect and uncertainty is a problem that also leads to unreasonable \nposturing during licensing negotiations.\n  Third, as business and competition become more global, patent \napplicants are increasingly filing patent applications in other \ncountries for protection of their inventions. The filing system in the \nUnited States, known as ``first-to-invent,'' differs from that in other \npatent-issuing jurisdictions, which have ``first-to-file'' systems. \nThis causes confusion and inefficiencies for American companies and \ninnovators.\n  The Patent Reform Act of 2009 promotes innovation, and will improve \nour economy, by addressing these impediments to growth. As the \nadministration endeavors to guide the economy out of the recession, as \npayrolls shrink and the jobless rate rises, Congress cannot afford to \nsit idly by while innovation--the engine of our economy--is impeded by \noutdated laws.\n  Our legislation ensures that, in the Information Age, we have the \nlegal landscape necessary for our innovators to flourish. It will \nimprove the quality of patents and remove the ambiguity from the \nprocess of litigating patent claims, which will promote innovation \nstifled by the current system. As innovation is encouraged, and \nexcessive litigation costs are removed, competition will increase and \nthe consumer cost of products will fall. In this way, the bill directly \nbenefits both creators and consumers of inventive products.\n  Patent reform is ultimately about economic development. It is about \njobs, it is about innovation, and it is about consumers. All benefit \nunder a patent system that reduces unnecessary costs, removes \ninefficiencies, and holds true to the vision of our Founders that \nCongress should establish a national policy that promotes the progress \nof science and the useful arts.\n  When Thomas Jefferson issued that first patent in 1790--a patent that \nwent to a Vermonter--no one could have predicted how the American \neconomy would develop and what changes would be needed for the law to \nkeep pace, but the purpose then remains the purpose today--promoting \nprogress.\n  As I said when I introduced the Patent Reform Act last Congress: If \nwe are to maintain our position at the forefront of the world's \neconomy, if we are to continue to lead the world in innovation and \nproduction, if we are to continue to benefit from the ideas of the most \ncreative citizens, then we must have a patent system that produces high \nquality patents, that limits counterproductive litigation over those \npatents, and that makes the entire system more streamlined and \nefficient.\n  Now is the time to bolster our role as the world leader in \ninnovation. Now is the time to create jobs at home. Now is the time for \nCongress to act on patent reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 515\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The court shall also \n     identify the factors that are relevant to the determination \n     of a reasonable royalty, and the court or jury, as the case \n     may be, shall consider only those factors in making such \n     determination.\n       ``(A) Entire market value.--Upon a showing to the \n     satisfaction of the court that the claimed invention's \n     specific contribution over the prior art is the predominant \n     basis for market demand for an infringing product or process, \n     damages may be based upon the entire market value of that \n     infringing product or process.\n       ``(B) Established royalty based on marketplace licensing.--\n     Upon a showing to the satisfaction of the court that the \n     claimed invention has been the subject of a nonexclusive \n     license for the use made of the invention by the infringer, \n     to a number of persons sufficient to indicate a general \n     marketplace recognition of the reasonableness of the \n     licensing terms, if the license was secured prior to the \n     filing of the case before the court, and the court determines \n     that the infringer's use is of substantially the same scope, \n     volume, and benefit of the rights granted under such license, \n     damages may be determined on the basis of the terms of such \n     license.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce with Senate Judiciary \nCommittee chairman Patrick Leahy the Patent Reform Act of 2009, S. 515. \nI consider introduction of this bill to be a milestone in the progress \nwe have made so far in the effort to reform our patent system--a system \nthat has not been updated significantly since 1952. There is no doubt \nwe have come a long way in our pursuit to accomplish comprehensive \npatent law reform. Reform is so vitally necessary to keep our nation \ncompetitive in our technologically advanced global economy, especially \nduring these difficult economic times.\n  I have always believed that passing patent reform legislation would \nbe a multi-Congress endeavor. The Hatch-Leahy patent bill, S. 3818, \nformally started the legislative process in 2006. We continued the \nmomentum in the 110th Congress by introducing S. 1145, the Patent \nReform Act of 2007. In June 2007, my colleagues and I on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee approved S. 1145 by a vote of 13-5. While I would \nhave liked to see S. 1145 pass the full Senate, I believe the process \nalready provided makes passage of the Patent Reform Act of 2009 even \nmore likely this Congress.\n  S. 515 represents a bipartisan and bicameral commitment to streamline \nour nation's patent system that will improve patent quality and limit \nunnecessary and counterproductive litigation costs.\n  House Judiciary chairman John Conyers and ranking minority member \nLamar Smith are true partners in this important legislation. For those \nwho might say nothing has changed, I can attest that it has. Just look \nat the bill. We have listened to many of the concerns raised by \nstakeholders and have changed the legislative text accordingly.\n  Let me highlight some of the significant changes we have made to the \nbill.\n  For example, S. 515 does not contain an applicant quality submissions \nprovision due to near uniform opposition we heard from the patent \ncommunity about the burdens this would place on applicants.\n  Additionally, the Patent Reform Act of 2007 would have eliminated the \ncurrent opt-out provision for publication of patent applications. \nCurrent law permits applicants to request upon filing that their \napplication not be published at 18 months if a certification is made \nthat the invention disclosed in the application has not and will not be \nthe subject of an application filed in another country. Because of \nserious concerns raised by independent inventors and small entities, we \nhave removed this provision from S. 515.\n  Patents may be challenged either in court or at the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office, USPTO. The current administrative review process at \nthe USPTO is widely viewed as ineffective and inefficient. Accordingly, \nlast year's bills proposed a process more like a court proceeding than \nthe current re-examination process. Both bills had a 1-year window for \nchallenges during which patents would not be presumed valid, and a \npatent could be invalidated by a ``preponderance of evidence'' against \nit. However, the Senate bill, S. 1145, added a second window during the \nlife of the patent where only ``clear and convincing'' evidence could \ninvalidate the patent. Most in the patent community prefer the post-\ngrant review language as passed in the House because, instead of \ncreating a ``second window,'' it improved upon the existing inter-\npartes reexamination. As such, S. 515 adopts the House approach to \nexpanding interpartes, but includes ``public use or sale in the United \nStates'' as a basis for challenging a patent. Further, our bill ensures \nthat ex parte reexamination proceedings are maintained, which is an \nimportant tool for challenging patents that should not have issued.\n  With patent litigation costs escalating, the threat of enhanced \ndamages can be quite substantial. For this reason, the Senate and House \nbills introduced in the 110th Congress narrowed the circumstances under \nwhich treble damages could be awarded for willful infringement of a \npatent. After introduction of the Patent Reform Act of 2007, the \nFederal Circuit issued an in banc decision, In re Seagate, which \ninstituted an objective recklessness standard to prove willfulness. \nAfter considerable discussion with stakeholders in the patent \ncommunity, we believe the Seagate decision is a positive improvement to \nthe law and, therefore, have sought to incorporate correlating language \ninto S. 515.\n  There are other changes we made to the Patent Reform Act of 2009, but \nI want to focus my remaining remarks on two key issues: how damages are \nawarded in infringement lawsuits and inequitable conduct reform.\n  I am aware of the concerns that some have raised about the damages \nprovision contained in S. 1145. I have heard from some who are \nconcerned that courts have allowed damages for infringement to be based \non the market for an entire product, when all that was infringed is a \nminor component of the product. I have also heard from some who argue \nthat the current language will severely limit the amount of damages an \ninfringer has to pay, thereby encouraging infringing behavior.\n  The sponsors of the Patent Reform Act of 2009 all agree that we need \nto improve the damages provision. In crafting a fair damages provision, \nwe can rely upon well-reasoned and persuasive case law, scholarship, \nand other texts. I am confident that we will achieve consensus language \nin this area, but make no mistake: it will take willing partners to \ncraft a compromise that will not have deleterious affects on any one \nsector of our economy.\n  For years I have been arguing if we are serious about enacting \ncomprehensive patent law reform then we must take steps to ensure that \nthe inequitable conduct doctrine is applied in a manner consistent with \nits original purpose: to sanction true misconduct and to do so in a \nproportional and fair manner. Inequitable conduct reform is core to \nthis bill, as it dictates how patents are prosecuted years before \nlitigation. The inequitable conduct defense is frequently pled, rarely \nproven, and always drives up the cost of litigation tremendously.\n  Under current law, any perceived transgression of the patent owner is \nbeing painted as ``fraud.'' If an inequitable conduct claim wins, a \nvalid patent will be held entirely void, and the infringer walks away \nwithout any liability. There is virtually no downside for the infringer \nto raise this type of attack. This is why inequitable conduct \nchallenges are raised in nearly every patent case. It has become, in \nthe words of the Federal Circuit, a ``plague'' on the patent system.\n  The development of a more objective and clearer inequitable conduct \nstandard will remove the uncertainty and confusion that defines current \npatent litigation. We cannot settle for mere\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\ncodification of current practices. Chairman Leahy and Chairman Conyers \nboth know of my strong interest in this area and have agreed to \nincorporate changes to the law. There is no doubt that inequitable \nconduct reform has the potential to single-handedly revolutionize the \nmanner in which patent applications are prosecuted. Arguably, reform in \nthis area will have the most favorable impact on patent quality and the \nability for the USPTO to reduce its pendency--thereby fostering a \nstrong and vibrant environment for all innovation and entrepreneurship.\n  Now more than ever, our industries need reassurance and \npredictability in order to move forward in these challenging times. I \nbelieve the Patent Reform Act of 2009 has the potential to complement \nall of the stimulatory efforts currently under way. Now is the time to \nact.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 517. A bill for the relief of Alejandro Gomez and Juan Sebastian \nGomez; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I send to the desk a private relief \nbill to provide permanent resident status to Juan and Alejandro Gomez, \nand ask that it be appropriately referred.\n  Juan, 20, and Alejandro, 21, are natives of Colombia who came to the \nU.S. with their parents in August 1990 on B-2 visitors visas and reside \nin Miami, FL. Their parents were deported on October 30, 2007. Their \ninitial departure date was September 14, 2007, but because of \nlegislation introduced last Congress that date was extended. However, \nnow they have been ordered to report for deportation on March 15, 2009. \nJuan and Alejandro have lived continuously in the U.S. for the last 18 \nyears. They have both graduated from Miami Killian High School. Juan is \na student at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Alejandro is a \nstudent at Miami Dade Community College and works at the Biltmore Hotel \nin Miami. They have the strong support of their community. It would be \nan extreme hardship to uproot Juan and Alejandro from their community, \nwhich has wholeheartedly embraced them, to send them back to Colombia \nwhere there lives could be in serious danger.\n  We all know that the circumstances of Juan and Alejandro are not \nunique. Just like many other children here illegally, they had no \ncontrol over their parents' decision to overstay their visas a number \nof years ago. Most of these young people work hard to complete school \nand contribute to their communities. Cases like Juan's and Alejandro's \nare the reason why the so called DREAM Act was attached to the \ncomprehensive immigration reform legislation that the Senate attempted \nto pass last Congress, only to face a filibuster from opponents of any \ncomprehensive immigration reform proposal.\n  The DREAM Act has broad partisan support and is not the reason that \nthe immigration bill stalled in the Senate. I would hope that \nconsideration could be given to delinking the DREAM Act from the larger \nbill so that we can put in place a legal framework for dealing with \nyoung people similar in circumstances to Juan and Alejandro who are \ncaught in this unfortunate immigration status. But that is not likely \nto happen soon enough to address the problems confronting Juan and \nAlejandro.\n  That is why I have decided to reintroduce a private bill on their \nbehalf. I will also be writing to Senator Charles Schumer, Chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Immigration to request, pursuant to the \nSubcommittee's Rules of Procedure, that the Subcommittee formally \nrequest an expedited departmental report from the Bureau of Citizenship \nand Immigration Services regarding the Gomez brothers so that the \nSubcommittee can then move forward to give consideration to this bill \nas soon as possible.\n  I have had the opportunity to meet Juan and Alejandro. They believe \nthat America is their home. They love our country and want to have an \nopportunity to fulfill their dreams of becoming full participants in \nthis country. Passage of the private bill would give them that \nopportunity. I look forward to working with the Subcommittee to \nfacilitate its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 520.

Roszkowski United States Courthouse''; considered and \npassed.\n  Mr. DURBIN.
