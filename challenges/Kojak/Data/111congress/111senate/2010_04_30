Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 3217, the Wall Street reform legislation. \nThere will be no rollcall votes today.\n  I am anxious to see how the debate goes forward on this bill. It is a \nmost important bill. The bill before the Senate places strict new \nregulations to stop Wall Street's reckless gambling. There will be no \nmore taxpayer bailouts; that is, no bailouts ever. It ends too big to \nfail. It puts a new cop on the beat. It puts consumers in control with \ninformation that is in plain English.\n  Let me repeat. The legislation before this body holds Wall Street \naccountable, ends taxpayer bailouts, guarantees taxpayers will never \nagain be forced to bail out reckless Wall Street firms by creating a \nsafe way to liquidate failed firms without taxpayer money, ends too big \nto fail with strict new caps on leverage requirements to prevent firms \nfrom growing too big to fail, brings sunlight and transparency to \nshadowy markets where Wall Street executives make gambles that threaten \nour entire economy. That will no longer exist. It reins in CEO pay, it \nprotects community banks, streamlines bank supervision to create \nclarity and accountability, and protects the dual banking system that \nsupports community banks; it protects consumers in many different ways.\n  In effect, it puts a new cop on the beat, creates an independent \nagency with broad authority to monitor firms for abusive practices and \nintervene to protect consumers. It guarantees clear information in \nplain English. It ensures that consumers get the information they need \nto shop for mortgages, credit cards, and other financial products that \nthey can read and understand.\n  There will be no more abusive practices. It protects consumers from \nhidden fees, abusive terms and deceptive practices. In effect, it \nprotects against the Bernie Madoff-type scams. It reforms and \nstrengthens the SEC's ability to enforce securities laws. This is a \ngood piece of legislation.\n  I know Republicans and Democrats want to improve it in ways they feel \nare appropriate. I hope the debate will be civil. I hope we can have \nlimited\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\ntime on these amendments, as the Republican leader said yesterday. I \nlook forward to that debate. It is one of the most important issues to \ncome before this body in a long time. I hope we can complete it in a \ntime that is appropriate. We have so much more to do, and we have been \nprevented, basically, this week from getting to this bill by the \nminority.\n  In the future, I hope they will recognize there are other things to \ndo in this body that are of extreme importance to our country. We are \ngoing to have a name from the President in the next few weeks--I assume \nthat is the case--so we can begin work on someone to replace Justice \nStevens.\n  We have to do something with energy. There is much we have to do, \nincluding our normal housekeeping appropriations bills. We have to make \nsure the tax extenders, the expiring provisions, are taken care of. \nThat expires at the end of May.\n  So we have a lot of work to do. We have made some commitment to do \nsomething with small business jobs. I explained to one Republican \nSenator who said they wanted to move to that, that the longer you hold \nup on us moving legislation, the more difficult it will be to get to \nsome of the things you want to do.\n  This has been difficult. We moved to this financial reform bill last \nThursday and here it is Friday and we just got on it yesterday. It has \nbeen a tremendous waste of our time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/30/senate-section/article/S2988-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 3217, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3217) to promote the financial stability of the \n     United States by improving accountability and transparency in \n     the financial system, to end ``too big to fail,'' to protect \n     the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect \n     consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Dodd-Lincoln) amendment No. 3739, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Reid (for Boxer) amendment No. 3737 (to amendment No. \n     3739), to prohibit taxpayers from ever having to bail out the \n     financial sector.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I know there will be a number of people \ntalking about regulatory reform. The Senator from Virginia and I worked \non a number of issues together in order to create a bill we think is \nsolid and will stand the test of time. I hope that spirit continues.\n  One of the things many Members have been talking about is the size of \ninstitutions. There has been some movement to arbitrarily decide what \nsize an institution ought to be. Everybody is frustrated by what \noccurred a couple years ago. There are a lot of ideas coming forth to \ntry to prevent the same types of things that occurred a couple years \nago, or a year ago, from happening again. What I hope people will keep \nin mind is that the reason our large financial institutions are the \nsize they are is because we have companies that need to be large in \norder to be competitive.\n  Obviously, if it is a large company doing business throughout the \ncountry, what they want to ensure is that they have a financial \ninstitution that covers the entire geographic map of the country. They \nwant to be able to do business in every State in a way that is easy and \nallows them to do what they do competitively.\n  Then we have to remember, especially as we continue to talk about \nother countries and the tremendous growth taking place in countries \nsuch as China and others, that we live in a global environment. In that \nglobal environment, some of the great companies that have been founded \nin this country need the ability to operate and do so in a way that \ncreates American jobs. We need to have a banking system where we have \ninstitutions with the ability to operate throughout the country. Then \nwe need the ability for these institutions to compete on a global \nbasis.\n  What that means is, we have large, highly complex institutions that \nare able to do all the things necessary for companies to compete.\n  I hope as people look at arbitrary downsizing, as people look at \nlines of business in which banks can or cannot be involved, that they \ntake into account that of the 10 largest financial institutions in the \nworld--let me start with the top five financial institutions in the \nworld--a place where companies have to compete. We have not one bank in \nthat category. We have the largest gross domestic product in the world, \nthe most competitive business environment in the world. Yet we do not \nhave one institution that ranks in the top five in the world.\n  As a matter of fact, if we take it down to the top ten, we only have \ntwo financial institutions, two banks that are in the top ten, and they \nare toward the bottom of that ranking.\n  I know it sounds great to say we are going to take on Wall Street, \nbut I think we need to remember that we may be taking on the heartland. \nFor instance, if you are in Indiana or Ohio or someplace like that, and \nyou are making some product out of metals, you probably want to know, \nif you have long-term contracts, that you have the ability to hedge the \nrisk of metals going up or, if you are dealing with another country \nwhere you have a lot of shipments going, you want the ability to know \nthat if you are selling it for what you think is a U.S. dollar, that \nU.S. dollar stays constant by having currency swaps and those types of \nthings.\n  One of the great things about America--we talk about the American \ndream--is that people in this country have the ability--such as the \nSenator from Virginia. There is no better example. The Senator from \nVirginia had a dream he realized early on. I think he started with \nmaybe $5,000 and might have lost that quickly. Then he had to reload \nagain and figure out a way with small amounts of money to create a \ngreat company. He did that. He did it over and over again.\n  The reason he was able to do that was in this country, we have the \nability to bring capital together around entrepreneurs. You don't have \nto be born in this country with a silver spoon in your mouth. I know I \nstarted exactly the same way with $8,000 when I was 25 years old. We \nhave the ability in this country to have a dream and to accumulate ways \nto build around that dream with capital formation that creates jobs.\n  This debate is interesting. I know people can score political points; \nit is great to take on Wall Street. But what we have to be careful of \nis cutting our nose off to spite our face. The fact is, what makes this \ncountry great is all the companies across the country where people got \nup this morning and went to work. Some entrepreneur had an idea, built \na company, and now it is employing people which I know all of us \nrealize is probably the most important thing for all of us to care \nabout. Heads of households then have the ability to raise their \nchildren, to pay for their education, to do the kinds of things that \nimprove our standard of living.\n  So I am a little concerned, as I hear night after night after night, \npeople coming down to this floor and they are bashing Wall Street. By \nthe way, there are some things that certainly need to be corrected, and \nI know the Senator from Connecticut is trying to do that with portions \nof his bill. I know the Senator from Virginia and I worked on portions \nof the bill we hope will do that, but just arbitrarily saying we are \ngoing to create a system in this country of small banks--banks that do \nnot have the ability to aid companies that deal around this world so we \nas a country can be globally competitive--that concerns me.\n  I hope that, again, in the name of political points, we will stop \nmuch of this\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\ndiscussion and we will all come to our senses.\n  Well, I should not have said that; everybody has strong opinions and \nthat was a misstatement by me. I hope we will look at the end results \nof our actions and what that may mean to the good people of this \ncountry who get up every day and work hard and depend upon--depend \nupon--those people who are willing to take risks for their families to \nbe able to put food on their table, to educate their kids, and to live \na life in America we can all be proud of.\n  I see the Senator from Connecticut. I know there is no one else on \nthe floor. I will actually pause for a second. This may be the second \nlongest speech I have ever given on the floor. So I will stop and take \nmy breath.\n  I yield the floor, if that is all right, to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am delighted to see that my good friend \nand colleague from Tennessee is here.\n  Let me say, there is not a word the Senator from Tennessee has just \nsaid--I listened to his remarks--that I disagree with. In fact, I agree \nwith everything he just said. I hope that mentality and attitude will \nprevail in the coming week or two we are going to be engaged in this \ndiscussion. I was thinking--when the Senator was talking--about an \narticle I read the other day. It was making the same point the Senator \nfrom Tennessee is making; that is, that of the 50 largest banks in the \nworld, 4 of them are located in the United States, 5 are located in our \nneighbor to the north, in Canada. Canada has a much smaller economy. \nObviously, it is a smaller country than ours. They did not suffer any \nof the difficulties we have gone through during the last couple years \nduring this economic crisis. They had a downturn. I do not mean to say \nit was all working beautifully for them, but, nonetheless, they did not \nhave the problems within their financial structures we have had, \ndespite the fact they have actually 1 more than we do of those 50 \nlargest banks.\n  Paul Krugman, of the New York Times, whom I do not always agree with, \nhas written about this point as well. I do not know if my colleague has \nseen his articles. Size, I understand, is important to people, and that \nmay be one way of looking at all this. But it is excessive risk, it is \na question of whether there is proper regulation of activities. It is \nleverage. It is capital requirements. It is liquidity. It is all these \nother factors--the ones we are trying to keep an eye on--because size \nthen can become a problem.\n  But size may not be the only issue. You could be a small institution \nengaging in the marketing of products that put the system at risk. So \nwe need to get focused on exactly what are the issues we are trying to \naddress in all this. That is what we have tried to do. Again, my \ncompliments to both the Acting President pro tempore and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee for their tireless work. The Senator from Tennessee \nknows he and I worked and spent a lot of time talking about all this as \nwell. A lot of what is in this bill is a reflection of the Senator's \nlabors. I realize it is not exactly everything he wants, but I think it \nis 90, 95 percent of what we are talking about. My hope is in the \ncoming days we can try to close whatever concerns and gaps people have \nthat do not do any underlying damage to the overall thrust of what we \nare trying to improve.\n  I wish to pick up on a second point as well because I think it is \nvery important. I have said the three goals I have for this bill. I \nhope all of us have for this bill. One is to try to close the gaps \nwhere we have this unregulated part of our economy that went kind of \nwild out there and caused so much of the difficulties our country has \nbeen going through. So to the extent we can do that--recognizing it is \nnot our job to regulate. I always say there are two things we do not do \nvery well in this institution: One is to set accounting standards or \nnecessarily write regulations. It is not within our pay grade to try to \ndo all that. We try to focus on institutions that have that \nresponsibility and then demand the accountability. But I, clearly, want \nto see us plug in those gaps so we do not have shadow economies \noperating that can put us at risk.\n  Secondly, to try to see if we cannot create--there is always some \ndanger in trying to do this and I commend both my colleagues because \nthey have been the principal advocates of this--some sort of an early \nradar warning system. I do not know how perfectly it can work or how \nwell it can work but at least having the idea that we have people with \neyes who will bring a different perspective to all this, to kind of \nkeep an eye out to the Greeces, the Shanghais, as well as to what \nhappens here because we live in that global economy, as my colleague \nfrom Tennessee has just articulated.\n  So if this next crisis comes--and it will come as certain as I am \nstanding here, maybe long after we are gone from here--there will be \nanother economic crisis, some bubble, I suppose, someplace--the \nquestion is, Can we identify it early enough before it metastasizes--I \nuse that word--into the rest of the economy or globally, as is Greece, \nfor instance, today. It is the downgrading of their debt that all of a \nsudden caused the Euro to decline, and Europe finds itself, once again, \non the precipice of an economic disaster, spilling potentially over to \nthe rest of the world. So that is the second point of the bill.\n  But the third point is equally important; that is, to make sure, in \nour determination to satisfy point 1 and point 2, we do not end up \nstrangling a financial system. We need to make sure the creativity, the \ninnovation, the flow of credit and capital that are critical for job \ncreation, wealth creation, and economic growth are going to be there.\n  That is a very difficult sense of balance to maintain. No one has \never gotten it absolutely right. It is always one side or the other \nthat seems to be dominating the other. But those are my three goals, in \na sense: to make sure we satisfy those first two, while simultaneously \nmaking sure we do not end up making it more difficult for that kind of \ninnovation and creativity to spring forward.\n  So it is exactly as the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from \nTennessee and many others have done--because they had an idea, they had \nimagination, they had determination to go out and to create an idea, to \nsee an idea that would put people to work, to solve problems for \npeople, whether it is a medical device or a prescription drug or \ncreating a new widget that improves the efficiencies of how we function \nas a country. There are all sorts of ideas that have been the \nwellspring of what has made America such a unique place in the world, \nparticularly in the 20th century.\n  So before we begin this whole amendment process--I will repeat this \nas many times as I can--those are the goals. I think they are the \nshared goals. I believe they are the shared goals we all have. \nObviously, there are debates about whether certain points advance those \ngoals or cause some retreat in them, and I believe honest people can \ndisagree about how to do that.\n  In our job, which is the hardest thing in the world--I am speaking \nabout a former Governor and a former mayor. They have come out of the \nexecutive side of the government, where it must be awfully frustrating \nto be sitting in a body with 98 other people who are also, in a sense, \nexecutives--we are all coequals--to bring forth our ideas to try to \nforge, out of a body such as this of 100 people, some clear, \nfocused vision of how to achieve those goals.\n\n  But that is the challenge we have in the coming weeks. Again, I am \nvery grateful to both my colleagues for the contribution they have \nmade. I say that with complete sincerity and appreciation for their \nefforts. This can be, I hope, a good, honest discussion and debate. \nHopefully, we can agree on some things. Others may have to have that \ndebate and those votes to see where it lies and not try to bind up the \nplace in filibusters and other things. It is not an unlimited debate. \nWe do not have unlimited time, obviously, to do it. But we can spend \nthe next couple weeks to try to get this focused in a way where we can \ncome out and, again, not solve every problem. This bill does not take \non every imaginable financial institution and issue out in the country, \nbut we think it focuses on some of these critical ones that are \nimportant.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Tennessee coming over and sharing his \nthoughts. Again, I agree with him on our goals. That is my point.\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the comments from the \nSenator from Connecticut. I would like to sort of summarize the way I \nsee things today.\n  I, first of all, would say, I think last week--or over the last short \nperiod of time anyway--probably has been the lowest point in my Senate \ncareer of 3 years and 4 months in just hearing all the rhetoric on both \nsides of the aisle, candidly, about this bill. I continue to hear it, \nunfortunately, in the evenings from this floor. The fact is, this is a \nserious issue, it is complex, and there are a lot of substantive issues \nthat need to be addressed.\n  I guess the thing that frustrates me most about this body--it has \nnothing to do with having been a mayor or a businessperson--is the \noutlandish things people can say on both sides of the aisle just to try \nto cut herds out of Americans. So Americans who are busy raising their \nfamilies or doing what they do on a daily basis--and, candidly, what we \nare doing is just a long way away and they hear pieces of it--it is \njust to sort of divide up our country. I do hope on this bill we can \nfocus more on the facts, and we will see if that occurs. It certainly \nwould be the first time in a long time if that were to occur, but I \nhope that happens.\n  As I look at this bill, first of all, on the too-big-to-fail piece, \nmy sense is, the Senator from Connecticut is going to work with the \nSenator from Alabama and pretty well fix that over the course of this \nweekend. I have a feeling a manager's amendment is coming forth. There \nwill be people on both sides of the aisle who think a resolution \nmechanism is not appropriate, I realize that, and there will be a push \ntoward bankruptcy, which I know the Senator from Virginia and I wanted \nto strengthen in big ways. There are some committee issues that sort of \nkeep that from happening as elegantly as it might happen. But I sure \nhope we will do everything we can to strengthen the bankruptcy laws so \nthe default position for a major company is to go into bankruptcy. OK. \nThat is the way our country works when a company fails.\n  But in some cases, I do believe there is a need for a resolution \nmechanism. My sense is, the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator \nfrom Alabama will come to terms over the next several days with ways of \nensuring there are not those gaps. The administration gets a little \ninvolved in a bill, and they want to create some flexibility. I \nunderstand that. If I were on their side, I would want to do the same: \nHey, I will take the power and we will solve everything. We need to \nsort of close that up so the things we intend to happen actually happen \nin this bill, and my sense is, I say to the Senator, you all are going \nto fix that over the weekend.\n  So then we have the issue of the derivatives, and I think all of us \nwant to see derivatives cleared. There have been some issues, I know, \nthat came forth out of the Ag Committee. This 106 issue is something \nthat I think my friends on the other side of the aisle are going to \nfigure out a way to solve and get back in the box, and I look forward \nto the debate you all will have amongst each other doing that. That \nwill actually be humorous to watch. But I think the Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Arkansas \nwill figure out a way to get that one back in the tube, if you will.\n  So the derivatives issue, my sense is, will get to a place where it \nprobably works. I know Judd Gregg and Jack Reed--smart guys on both \nsides of the aisle--have worked on this. Their work at some point will \nbear some fruit. I know Saxby Chambliss and Blanche Lincoln have worked \nheavily on it. I think we are going to get that right.\n  So at the end of the day, I think we know the issue that probably is \ngoing to divide this group, if we do not work it out--I am talking \nabout this Senate body--is the consumer protection piece. Look, I want \nto see consumer protection take place. I do. I know the Senator from \nConnecticut knows I was serious about trying to resolve that issue in \nMarch. It is my hope we can come to terms on that.\n  It is my hope we can create a balance, an appropriate balance, so the \nconsumer protection piece is in balance with prudential regulation. For \npeople who do not do this on a daily basis, I am talking about those \npeople who make sure our banking system is safe and sound, that our \nfinancial institutions are not at risk because of the rules and those \nkinds of things. Hopefully, we can get that in balance.\n  I do not know if the Senator from Connecticut wishes to speak to \nthis, but that is the one issue I know has a lot of people concerned. I \nthink many of us are concerned about an agency that, as it is written \ntoday, I do not think has appropriate checks and balances, and with the \nwrong kind of leadership, over time, could end up being something very \ndifferent than even possibly what the Senator from Connecticut intends \nfor it to be today.\n  Again, over the course of the debate, I hope we have the ability to \ndeal with consumer protection in a way that achieves that balance, \nwhere people across this country, who awaken on a daily basis and are \nnot necessarily directly involved in the financial industry, have no \nfears of this sort of reaching out and becoming unnecessarily involved \nin what they are doing. So that is the one issue, and I know the \nSenator from Connecticut realizes that.\n\n  I will digress slightly. I know the Senator from Connecticut referred \nto Canada and the large institutions Canada has and a much smaller GDP. \nOne of the reasons they did not get into the same difficulties we had \nas a country is they have underwriting mechanisms there that determine \nwhat is appropriate for people to do as it relates to borrowing for \ntheir homes. Their underwriting standards are very different than exist \nin this country. I know the Senator from Connecticut has an approach to \nit--the 5-percent risk retention with securitizations. I have a little \ndifferent approach to it and feel as though we shouldn't be \nsecuritizing loans in the first place that are written to people who \ncan't pay them back.\n  I wish to get at the very base of this issue, and I hope that over \nthe course of this debate we will figure out a way to merge what the \nSenator from Connecticut has proposed and maybe some real underwriting \nso that when the loans are written in the first place and end up \ngetting spread across our country, we have made sure these loans are \nwritten in such a way that we know the people who have taken out these \nmortgages can pay them back.\n  Again, that is why Canada had no issues whatsoever as it related to \nthis because in their country they have different underwriting \nstandards. People there actually put down 50 percent, generally \nspeaking, when they purchase their homes. I know we don't want to be \noverly proscriptive in this body. I hope the Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Connecticut and all of us can sit down and figure out \na way to address that in a slightly different way. But candidly, as it \nrelates to this issue, it is hard for me to believe that we have a \nfinancial regulation bill and are not addressing that, the underwriting \npiece.\n  But, again, as the Senator from Connecticut mentioned, we are not \ngoing to deal with everything. We cannot deal with everything. We know \nwe have to come back around very soon and deal with Fannie and Freddie. \nI hate it that we are not dealing with that now. I think all of us \nwould like to be dealing with that now. The fact is that at some point \nwe ought to come back around and deal with that, have another bite at \nthe apple to deal with many of these issues, when that issue is taken \nup.\n  Back to consumer protection. I think as a body we have a chance to \npass a serious piece of legislation--a serious piece of legislation--\nthat a lot of thought has gone into. A lot of hearings have taken \nplace. We have a chance to pass a serious piece of legislation in this \nbody with potentially an overwhelming vote if we can figure out a way \nto come together on the consumer protection piece. I think the Senator \nfrom Connecticut knows where most Republicans wish to be on that issue. \nIf you look at a 10 scale, if you will, I think where Republicans wish \nto be, or at least many on this side of the aisle, is an 8 on a 10 \nscale for people who care about and who think consumer protection is \nthe issue. It seems to me that as a body, instead of trying to score \npolitical points and say if you vote against this bill, you are voting \nfor Wall Street, which is ludicrous, all of us care.\n\n[[Page S2991]]\n\n  I have something every Tuesday called Tennessee Tuesday. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Senator Alexander and I, greet people from Tennessee. I \nhave to tell my colleagues, there are not any Wall Street bankers \nthere. They are community bankers and credit unions who come to see us. \nThose are the folks who I think most of us care about as it relates to \nconstituents in our State. I know these provisions that are in consumer \nprotection are what scare them most about what that might become down \nthe road.\n  So, again, instead of making this an ``if you are with us, you are \nagainst Wall Street; if you are against us, you are for Wall Street,'' \nI hope what we will do is at some point--I know these bills all sort of \nhave a life and they ebb and flow and there is a time maybe when these \nkinds of negotiations can take place in a serious way, but I hope what \nwe will do, instead of dividing this body over an issue we all care \nabout, is unite this body by maybe figuring out a way to merge that \nissue a little bit more fully.\n  I realize there is a way that a bill can pass out of this body on a \n62-vote margin. I realize that is possible, that there will be a couple \nfolks who might have different sensibilities about particular issues \nand things. I realize that.\n  As a tribute, actually, to the Senator from Connecticut, who has been \nhere many years, who is leaving this body at the end of this term, I \nhope what we do is figure out a way to have an 85-vote bill and come \ntogether on this one issue that I think ultimately has the potential to \ndivide us--a piece of legislation that leaves this body on a party-line \nvote almost, or maybe it doesn't even leave because it is so divisive, \nbut leaves on a party-line vote that I don't think this country \nrespects much. I think they are over that, and I think they wish to see \nus work together in a way that solves things.\n  I am getting ready to yield the floor because I am beginning to talk \nway too long. I thank the Senator from Virginia. I thank the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. I hope within this body we are able to do something \nthat seeks the appropriate balance and seeks to do something that truly \nis a bipartisan compromise that will stand the test of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again I wish to thank my colleague from \nTennessee for his comments and thoughts. I won't address each and every \npoint, but I wish to make a couple of suggestions.\n  Most people I have worked with over the years, many of whom have long \nsince left this Chamber since the day I arrived here in January of \n1981, I think people believe this about me, which is that I never \nchaired a committee before 36 months ago, 37 months ago, despite being \nhere for 30 years. I had the wonderful privilege of sitting next to \nsome people who have had longevity, both politically and healthwise, so \nI ended up having the wonderful experience of being a junior Member for \nvirtually my entire service. Only about 37 or 38 months ago did I \nbecome a chairman of a major committee the first time, the Banking \nCommittee. It was through the departure of my great friend Paul \nSarbanes who has now retired, the elevation of Joe Biden to the vice \npresidency, and the passing of my best friend in this Chamber, Ted \nKennedy, that created an opportunity for me for the first time in a \nquarter of a century to actually chair a committee.\n  But I have managed bills on the floor in the past, either as a \nsubcommittee chairman or for other matters. In every single instance, \nwith the exception of one or two, I have always had a Republican \npartner in what I have done. Kit Bond and I did family and medical \nleave together, along with Dan Coats of Indiana. Orrin Hatch and I \nwrote child care legislation 27 years ago. I worked on private \nsecurities litigation reform with Phil Gramm of Texas. Mitch McConnell \nand I did the Help America Vote Act together. Lamar Alexander and I did \npremature birth infant screening. There is a long list without \nexception. I don't have a public partner yet on this one here and, \nagain, I think it is a reflection on the times we are in, in terms of \npeople's willingness to come together and say this isn't exactly what I \nwould write, anymore than this bill is today, but to sit down and help \nmanage something through so we get to that point of getting the best \nresult we can under the circumstances in which we live, the times in \nwhich we live.\n  So over these coming weeks, while I don't have a partner yet in all \nof this, I will certainly be reaching out the best I can to people to \nsay, Come along. Again, if you are looking for perfection, if one side \nwants to totally dominate the other, obviously, you don't get that. But \nmy experience, with some success over the years, includes in our own \ncommittee where during the last 37 months we have had 42 measures come \nout of the Banking Committee. Now 37 of those 42 measures are the law \nof the land today because Richard Shelby and I have been able to work \ntogether with others on a wide range of issues, by the way. We worked \non transit security, terrorist risk insurance, port security, a lot of \nmajor balls, Iran sanction legislation, and the like. So I am hopeful \nthat will happen here in the next couple of weeks, and I am reaching \nout to people so that will be the process.\n  Let me mention specifically a couple of things. I agree with my \ncolleague, I hope we can resolve the derivatives issue. I commend \nBlanche Lincoln for her efforts, and Chuck Grassley. By the way, the \nonly bipartisan proposal that is on the table right now is the one \nSenator Lincoln forged and managed to get some bipartisan support for. \nSo I commend my colleague from Arkansas for her work on that committee.\n\n  It is going to involve all of us here to come up with some answers on \nderivatives. Despite the fact that my friend from Tennessee would love \nto sit in that chair of his over there and have a good laugh, as we end \nup having a battle here--no, sir, the Senator from Tennessee is going \nto be involved in that whether he likes it or not if we are going to \nend up resolving it.\n  On the issue again of too big to fail, the Presiding Officer and the \nSenator from Tennessee have done about 98 percent of the work. There \nare a couple of issues we are going to try to work ourselves through \nover the next couple of days and present to our colleagues what we \nbelieve is a fair resolution of that matter that will deal with those \nissues and that will guarantee I hope once and for all the end of the \ndebate about whether anything in this bill is designed to perpetuate \nthe too-big-to-fail concept.\n  Let me mention the issue of underwriting, because we have written--\nand of course the Federal Reserve has now written underwriting \nstandards, at long last, by the way. I was around in 1994 when we \npassed the legislation mandating the Federal Reserve to promulgate \nregulations against deceptive and fraudulent practices in the \nresidential mortgage market. They never promulgated one in all of those \nyears, so we ended up in this unregulated part of the economy, again, \nwhere a lot of these brokers and others were out there luring people \ninto complicated matters. I get a kick out of this: Having owned \nseveral homes in Connecticut--two, actually--over the last 30 years, \nand one home here, we have all been to those closings, when we sit down \nacross that table and there is usually a stack of papers with tabs on \nthem and someone who is representing the buyer and seller is asking us \nto sign. I have yet to meet anybody, whether it is a banker, a lawyer, \na Senator, or a Congressman, who reads all of the details in those \nthings. We sort of assume whoever is representing our interests has \nprotected us. Well, we can imagine an awful lot of people in the \ncountry who lack the understanding or even the financial literacy who \nappreciate what they are reading.\n  Clearly underwriting standards are important. How do we achieve that? \nFor the first time, what these community banks like about our bill is \nwe are not going to have that unregulated part of the economy, so they \nare going to play by the same rules. That has been unfair to those who \nhave been regulated. I can't speak for community bankers in Tennessee \nor Virginia, but I can tell my colleagues in my State of Connecticut, I \nforget the numbers, but it is so infinitesimal, the number of \nforeclosures that occurred or subprime lending that went on within my \ncommunity banks, and I presume that is pretty true nationwide based on \nthe evidence I have heard over the last\n\n[[Page S2992]]\n\nnumber of months. So we need to get that unregulated shadow economy \nregulated.\n  We also know what has happened. In securitization, the difference \nbetween Canada and the United States and Europe and ourselves is we \nhave had a deep appreciation for the ability of the average American to \nbuy a home because we have understood how much that meant to people. \nThe idea that they can have their own home has been the greatest source \nof wealth creation for most Americans, an acquisition of equity in a \npiece of property that would ultimately provide a source of revenue to \nhelp educate your children, provide a cushion in your retirement. It \nstabilizes families, stabilizes neighborhoods and communities. Look at \nneighborhoods where you have renting and where you have people who have \na financial interest in that property in which they live, and the \ndifferences are huge. So we are different. I know in Europe and \nelsewhere you get 5-year loans and so forth. We are the only country in \nthe world, the only one, that provides a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage \nfor people. It has been a remarkable tool to provide stability and \nwealth creation for people. Other countries don't do that.\n  I certainly believe you have to have underwriting standards. You have \nto have them. The question is how do you get them and what is the \nstandard, because as my friend points out--and he is absolutely right \nabout this--having that 15 percent or 20 percent may be absolutely \ncritical under one set of circumstances, but for someone else it may \nnot be necessary. You may actually have a zero down, again, based on \nthe FICO scores and other factors that are there to apply one standard \nover another. What we want is underwriting standards that will take \ninto consideration the ability of that borrower to meet those \nobligations so they understand what they are getting into.\n  The securitization of the real estate market has provided a source of \ncapital and liquidity that has allowed for a further expansion of home \nownership. So I am not opposed to securitization at all; it is a \nquestion of whether it can be done responsibly, the rating agencies \nthat brand these bundled products as being AAA or AA and whether the \ninstitutions are actually marketing products that they are going to be \nconcerned about what happens to them. We all know what has occurred for \na lot of the unregulated brokers. We recall we had those hearings in \nwhich they showed their Web site where the first rule of the broker \nwas: Convince the borrower you are their financial adviser. Of course, \nwe have learned they were anything but in many cases their financial \nadviser. They are being paid rather quickly. The banks that are writing \nthe mortgages hold on to them on average 8 to 10 weeks. That is the \naverage time. So basically in that 8 or 10 weeks they bundle these \ntogether and sell them off, so they are out of the game; they have been \npaid. The broker is paid, the bank is paid, and some unsuspecting \ninvestor has just acquired something that has a brand on it of AAA or \nAA and they feel pretty good. Home mortgages have been a pretty \nreliable investment over the years. People pay their mortgages. And of \ncourse no one was sitting there insisting that we look at exactly \nwhether that borrower could afford to do this under these circumstances \nor looking at whether it was a fully indexed price or looking at all of \nthese other teaser rates and things that went on in there.\n  We will have someone there who will now be accountable, because we \nare going to keep an eye on you. There is a cop on the beat who says to \nthe broker that you have to do this right. We are saying to \ninstitutions out there you are going to, one, either put up skin in the \ngame, because I know if you have skin in the game you will pay more \nattention to what you are doing; you will not expose yourself to losses \nif you have skin in the game or--and this is where we need to come \ntogether--meet some underwriting standard. Make the choice. If you \ndon't want to do that, put some money on the table, because I want you \nto bear some loss if that thing goes out the door and you have allowed \nit to happen because you decided you didn't care. I prefer to have the \nunderwriting standards. That is one option I looked at, and I invite my \ncolleague to look at this, to get good underwriting standards, in the \nabsence of which we might have an inability to move forward. I raise \nthat as one thought.\n  On the consumer side of the equation, a lot more gets made of these \nissues for the very reason my friend from Tennessee worries about. I \nfind people sort of pumping up politically trying to fire up people \nbecause they have other motives in all of this. I am aware that people \ncan demagog on the issue of what we are trying to do. For the first \ntime in our country, seven agencies have had a consumer protection \nresponsibility, and virtually all of them have failed. It is not a \npriority. There is always something else that comes in that takes a \npriority position, including those who have the prudential \nresponsibilities of safety and soundness. I acknowledge that safety and \nsoundness is critical. I am also painfully aware that for quite a bit \nof time, between 2005 and 2007, people were saying: Our institutions \nare safe and sound. What are you talking about? How do you know that? \nLook at how much money they are making--when, in fact, it was rotting \nfrom within, because of the very things my colleague talked about: lack \nof underwriting standards, people were pushing this stuff out the door, \nand there were unregulated sections of our economy running wild. It was \nhardly safe and sound; nobody was watching what was happening at the \nmost fundamental level--that person who picks out a home for their \nfamily and decides this is what we would love to have; they pick out \ncolors for the rooms and get excited, and then they are across the \ntable and they close on the deal. It is hardly a level playing field.\n  For the overwhelming majority of Americans, it is hardly a level \nplaying field. When you are excited about it and you are convinced this \nis the right thing for your family, you can get lured into those deals. \nI am not excusing the consumer. We all have to be more responsible. \nSenator Daniel Akaka has spent time talking about financial literacy. \nWe tried to include provisions to raise the level of financial \nliteracy. My colleagues know I have two young children--an 8-year-old \nand a 5-year-old. My 8-year-old is in second grade here in a public \nschool in the District. They are trying to get them to talk more in \nmath classes early on about how to balance a checkbook, so that we \nstart raising a generation that will understand financial \nresponsibilities at an early age.\n  I don't discount the moral responsibility and the financial \nresponsibility people have. That is where a lot of this began. All we \nare trying to do here is say that average citizen has an advocate in \nthis process.\n  We saw what happened to the credit card industry, which was gouging \npeople right and left. That bill passed 90 to 5 here, trying to do \nsomething about that issue. I worry that sometimes people glom onto \nthese ideas and say the sky is falling, and what a dreadful thing we \nmay do, when that is hardly the intention at all.\n  I am prepared to listen to ideas on how we can make this work better. \nI don't want someone to exaggerate what this means and then suggest \nsomehow that the bill should fall because maybe we are trying to do a \nlittle more in this area of protecting people, who have very little \nprotections out there in the world today.\n  I am not talking about what happens at some community bank level. In \nfact, the community bankers--again, providing regulatory coverage to \nthose nonregulated areas is important, as we are talking about here; it \nis not the Federal regulators. If your financial institution's business \nassets are less than $10 billion--and I only have one in Connecticut \nthat has assets in excess of $10 billion--then your cop is that local \ninvolvement, not the Federal Government or some national consumer \nprotection agency jumping all over you. It is going to be done at a \nlocal level. Again, we will have to watch it and see how it works. I \nthink we would be remiss in the bill if we didn't end up with something \nthat says to the American consumer: What do I get out of this?\n  Lastly, I don't like the bashing that goes on. I realize that \nhappens. To make a point, sometimes people engage in that. My colleague \nsaid this at the outset of his remarks, and I commend him. The idea \nthat we want to provide that capital, that credit for that person, with \nan idea that if someone\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\nwants to expand a plant, we need to have a Wall Street that helps that \nhappen. This is too circular. It was all happening within the sort of \nclosed circulatory system, where little of that capital was moving out. \nBasically, people were thinking how to scam it. By making bets for and \nagainst certain things, their wealth increased, but very little of it \ngot out through that mechanism to that person you are talking about \nthere--maybe that person you went to as a young man of 25, who took a \nchance on you and said that guy has a good idea and I am going to get \nbehind him. That is the idea we ought to have more of, where a person \nwith a good idea can come through the door, and someone may be \ninterested in your idea.\n  That happens in venture capital and equity markets. My colleague from \nVirginia can bear witness to what angel investors can do. I spoke last \nevening with our colleague from Missouri, Kit Bond, who cares about it, \nas Senator Warner does. We will have amendments on that. We possibly \nwent too far in the bill in that area. We need to fix that so that the \nventure capitalist who thinks you have a good idea can get behind it. \nToo much of Wall Street gave up on that. No customers were coming in \nthe door as we know them here, and it got so self-absorbed in its own \ncapacity to generate wealth for itself that it lost sight of what this \nis supposed to all be about. That is what makes people so furious.\n  I thank my colleague from Tennessee--this is probably not something \nhe wants to be thanked for, but having been charged, he has been very \ninvolved in this. I will never forget as long as I live that morning \nmeeting about six of us had. He was included. It was on the first \nfloor. We met to figure out how to do this thing in the fall of 2008, \nto put us into a position where we don't find a financial meltdown and \ncollapse. We will never know the answer as to whether that would have \nhappened. But when you have pretty important people telling you we are \non the brink of that, we had to respond. We stepped up and managed to \nwrite something that I think made a difference. But the ability to come \ntogether and get that job done, to move us away from that, and then to \nwatch, after we stabilized these institutions and kept them on their \nfeet, provided the kind of security and predictability, turn around and \nsort of almost disregard all of that and get into these silly arguments \nabout how much of a bonus I can take, in the midst of everybody else \nsuffering, is where this arrogance comes in, which people in the \ncountry got so irate about.\n  There was a notion that having written that check for $700 billion to \nstabilize and provide certainty that we weren't going to collapse--you \nwould have thought at that moment, for a couple of years, leaders of \nthese institutions would say: Thank you, America, thank you, average \nJoe taxpayer, you kept this country alive. You stood up and made that \nchoice. We thank you for doing that. By the way, for the next few \nyears, we are going to take some hits for ourselves, self-imposed. We \nwill not take huge bonuses of millions of dollars. We are going to roll \nup our sleeves and figure out how we can do a better job of doing like \nBob Corker and Mark Warner did. Someone stood behind them and with \nthem, and they grew a business, employed people, and created jobs in \nour country. I don't recall hearing one voice say that during all of \nthis--not one stood up and said: Thank you, America; thank you for \nwriting that check to help us stabilize our economy. It was the \narrogance of it that drove people to distraction. I don't disagree. We \nneed to move on in the debate. But it is also important to understand \nwhat happened here and why people are so angry and upset. Jobs have \nbeen lost, lives have been ruined--absolutely ruined--because of what \nhappened over the last 18 months, and a little before that. They are \nnever going to get it back again. That retirement income is gone, the \nhome has been lost, and that job has disappeared. So they are never \ngoing to get back on their feet again.\n\n  When they hear somebody saying that is the way life is, and I hope \none day life gets better for you--why not have a consumer protection \nagency to keep an eye on these things. Obviously, some people aren't \ngoing to watch out that closely for you. Maybe that is part of our job \nto do that. I don't want to create a situation to take small businesses \nand others--I know there has been a lot of talk about that, but that is \nnot the intention. We can make it clear that that is not what we are \ntrying to do at all. Too often sometimes we get insulated from what is \nhappening out there. I understand that level. The tea party people--\nmany were at every event with ``dump Dodd'' signs and flags and bumper \nstickers. Certainly, it hurt personally that people would say that \nabout me after 30 years of service. But I kind of understand it, too. I \nunderstand the average person. It wasn't about me personally, \nnecessarily. They were deeply upset and frustrated. They are not bad \npeople. Maybe there is some leadership out there and others who are \nfrankly dangerous elements. I worry about that. I have a feeling that \nan awful lot of people who are not at a rally but are watching it on TV \nand reading about it feel that way too. They may say: I am not going to \njoin in a crazy demonstration saying outrageous things, but I feel that \nway too. I think we need to acknowledge that in all of this. They are \nout there, and they are not Democrats, Republicans, Independents; they \ndon't think about political affiliation every day. They wonder if \nanybody is watching out for them. Who cares about me? When these \ndebates happen and people talk about systemic risk, derivatives, credit \ndefault swaps, and currency swaps, they say, what are you talking \nabout? I don't understand what you are talking about. I presume it is \nimportant, but how does that affect me? I want to know is anybody in \nthat place going to write anything here so when the credit card company \nor that bank, that is not necessarily the best guy in town--is someone \nstanding up for me and giving me a shot that I don't end up in the \nruinous position so many people did when we were going through a safe \nand sound period, when we were anything but safe and sound?\n  That is at the heart of all this. I will listen to ideas on how we \ncan do a better job. If anybody claims they have all the wisdom, I get \nnervous about those people. We are not going to write something that \nwill necessarily satisfy everybody. Hopefully, we can do something that \nmakes sense.\n  I didn't intend to talk this long, but that point of not losing sight \nof our job here--it is about big companies that sell all over the \nworld. I know that. Being able to have big financial institutions that \nthey can stay with and compete in the global economy. But in our \ninterest in satisfying that, let's not forget that person who is not a \nbig company, a big corporation, who is going to work every day trying \nto raise their families and make sure if somebody gets sick, they will \nbe OK, and they can retire with dignity and security, and maybe buy \nthat home or take that vacation. They are not looking for much out \nthere. They want to know in this debate, in this bill here, which has \nmy name on it--the only name on it is mine at this point. There is only \none name up here, and I will be the last to say there is anything \nBiblical about this. It is our best efforts to try to address some \nissues here. There are flaws in here, I will guarantee you. Sometimes \nthings don't work as well as the author intended. But is there \nsomething in here that speaks to that individual out there, who is not \na banker, not a Wall Street guy, not a big corporation, just a consumer \nin the country, and they would like to know we have them in mind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I enjoyed listening to the comments of the Senator from \nConnecticut. I can certainly share with him some of the ideas he \nsuggested. My other colleagues and I, to be candid, could change this \nbill and it would have numerous names on it. I hope we have the ability \nto talk about some of those over the course of the next several days. \nApparently, it is not quite time for that.\n  I want to mention the issue of Wall Street and talk about public \nrelations. There is no question that after what occurred, many of the \nfolks on Wall Street could have used a public relations firm to help \nthem. No question, the bonuses and things we saw, after getting \ntaxpayer money to make sure they survived, no doubt that created a \nbacklash.\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\n  As a matter of fact, the Senator from Virginia and I are working on \nan amendment that would say, if this ever happens again and we have to \ntake one of these firms through resolution, which is part of the Dodd \nbill right now, the bonuses and other types of things in recent years \nwould all be clawed back. You cannot make huge sums of money, take your \ncompany down the tubes, and do things to America in that way without \npaying a price. We are working on something I think is balanced and \nappropriate, hopefully not populace but something that is thoughtful. \nIf somebody takes their company down and wreaks havoc on our country, \nthat will make us use this resolution mechanism. I think that is \nappropriate to look at.\n  Also, back in the fall of 2008, had the resolution mechanism we have \ntalked about that still has some imperfections been in place--and I \nrealize Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby are going to fix it this \nweekend--had that been in place, that meeting might not have occurred--\nright?--because we would have had a way to deal with some of the \ncontagion that exists when a company goes down.\n  I want to go back. The Senator from Connecticut talked about the \ngroups, when he was in Connecticut, who were upset with him. I say to \nthe Senator, it is not those issues that he alluded to that made them \nso angry and made me angry. It is the huge expansion of government they \nare seeing take place. It is this huge role that Washington is \nbeginning to play in their lives.\n  As we look at this consumer protection title Senator Dodd addressed a \nminute ago, the big guys on Wall Street do not care about that. This is \nnot something that is going to affect the big guys on Wall Street. They \nhave staffs and they have reams of people who have the ability to deal \nwith these consumer laws. Those are not the people who are coming into \nour office. It is the small, the medium-sized folks who do not have the \nability to deal with these in the same way.\n  If the Senator from Connecticut would be willing to sit down and talk \nabout ways of ensuring that Americans should not fear this organization \nbecause this organization over time will become way involved in their \nlives--which I think is stoking most of the anger we are seeing across \nthe country today, and I think rightfully so--if there is a way of \nachieving a balance where, in essence, consumers are protected--I know \nthe Senator from Connecticut knows well I am all for working on \nstreamlining, pulling these agencies together, making sure we have a \nvoice that is out there dealing with that issue--if there is a way of \ndoing that, I think the Senator from Connecticut would find that this \nbody would come together, and very quickly.\n  There are a few issues--106. Maybe the Volcker language ought to be \nmodified a little bit. Sometimes we do best around here when we study \nthings before we take action. I know Americans might be shocked if we \nactually did that.\n  If we can moderate just a couple of things--I am talking about just a \nfew sentences--and then look at consumer protection in a way that is \nbalanced and does not stoke that anger, that rightful anger that exists \nacross our country with the government taking a bigger and bigger role \nin people's lives unnecessarily, if we could fix that--and I think we \ncan. That is what frustrates me. I think we can do that--then we will \nhave appropriately dealt with the resolution. We will have \nappropriately dealt with derivatives. There are a few changes that need \nto take place, and both sides know what they are. If we can do that, \nthen we will have a bill that I think will stand the test of time, and \nwe will have a bill I think Americans will embrace and will do the \nthings we set out to do.\n  I know we have had a long colloquy. I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for indulging me and the Senator from Virginia, with whom I \ntalked prior to coming to the floor. I hope in some form or fashion, we \nare able to deal with some of these concerns to ensure consumers are \nprotected, to ensure that derivatives are clear and we do not end up \nwith an AIG situation with huge amounts of money and having to settle \nup on a daily basis and we deal with the issue that when a company in \nthis country fails, they fail.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, that is what Tennesseans care about. \nThey do not understand because when a business in Bradley County or a \nbusiness in Shelby County--maybe a mom or pop--fails, they are out of \nbusiness. In this country, they see these large institutions on Wall \nStreet fail and they do not go out of business. They consider that to \nbe morally wrong.\n  I know we will get that right in this bill before it passes. I hope \nwe can deal with these other issues appropriately.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, while we are on the subject matter, I \nappreciate the thoughts of my friend and colleague from Tennessee. Let \nme note one quick observation the Senator said. It goes back to the \nissue that Wall Street could have used a public relations firm. In a \nsense, that is the problem. When you have to hire a public relations \nfirm, if you do not understand this yourself, then there is something \nfundamentally wrong. You do not need to hire a public relations firm if \nyou are taking multimillion-dollar bonuses and 8.5 million people have \nlost their jobs and 7 million homes are in foreclosure, in no small \nmeasure, because of the problems you created. I don't think you need a \npublic relations firm. Where is the sense of decency and ethics and \nmorality that says: The average citizen made it possible for this \ninstitution I am running to stay alive? If I have to insist we hire a \npublic relations firm, we are in deeper trouble than I could imagine.\n  That is usually the answer when things go wrong: hire a public \nrelations firm. Just stand up and tell the truth. That might not be a \nbad idea. They always say it is the best defense on these matters.\n  I presume my colleague shares my view on this subject, that they \nshould not have needed a public relations operation to do it. I could \nnot resist responding. One would have thought a good look in the mirror \nwould have done it, and saying to themselves: Why are people angry? \nWhat can we do to help get back on our feet?\n  That is what is going on out there. I thank my colleague. I did not \nmean to dwell on that point.\n  Mr. CORKER. Obviously, Mr. President, I was being humorous in talking \nabout that. The Senator is right. The Senator from Virginia and I both \nknow that in our businesses, we were the last ones to be paid. Everyone \nelse was dealt with and our obligations were dealt with first.\n  I agree with the Senator from Connecticut. Something certainly went \nawry after the country had basically made these companies whole. It \nappeared to me the conduct was very unseemly. I agree with the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I understand there is an amendment pending \nthat is not appropriate to set aside to call up another amendment; is \nthat correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. An amendment is pending and will \nrequire unanimous consent to set aside.\n  Mr. WEBB. Having discussed this with the chairman, it is his \npreference not to set the pending amendment aside; is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct, yes.\n  Mr. WEBB. All right. Well, I assume there will be no objection if I \nspeak about the amendment I have introduced, amendment No. 3736?\n  Mr. DODD. None whatsoever.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3736\n\n  Mr. WEBB. I thank the chairman for that.\n  Mr. President, I introduced this amendment earlier, on another piece \nof legislation, and it was not considered germane. I understand there \nmay be some procedural issues with raising it on this particular piece \nof legislation, but I believe it is an amendment that Congress needs to \npass and that the American people need to have. It is a one-shot \nwindfall profit tax on a very\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\nappropriately designed group of executives who benefitted enormously \nfrom the contributions the American taxpayers made in order to bail out \nthe economy as opposed to bailing out banks specifically. I will \naddress this amendment in detail in a moment.\n\n\n               Anniversary of Official End of Vietnam War\n\n  Before I address the subject of my amendment, I would like to point \nout, as I have every April 30 since I have been in the Senate, that \ntoday is the day--now 35 years ago--South Vietnam fell to a Communist \noffensive and the Vietnam war officially ended.\n  April 30, 1975, has a very unique meaning among Vietnamese and the 2 \nmillion Americans of Vietnamese descent in this country. It is almost \nas strong as the way many people feel in this country about B.C. and \nA.D. It is a very clear demarcation line in terms of an effort that was \nmade for many years to assist an incipient democracy in South Vietnam \nfrom coming under a different form of government, just as clearly as we \nattempted to assist South Korea from coming under the form of \ngovernment that today we see in North Korea and just as clearly as we \nspent many years and much national treasure preserving the democratic \nprinciples in West Germany after the Cold War began, with the hope and \nthe eventual result of the unification of that country.\n  This is not a time, all these years later, to debate the merits of \nthe American involvement in Vietnam. I am one who is very proud to have \nserved in that war as a U.S. marine. I still believe strongly in what \nwe attempted to do. And we have heard from some of the really great \nthinkers of our generation--the Asian thinkers, such as Minister Lee \nKuan Yew of Singapore--that the attempt of the United States to staunch \nthe flow of communism in Vietnam allowed the other countries in \nSoutheast Asia--Singapore strongly among them but a number of the other \ncountries in Southeast Asia--to build governmental systems and free \nmarket economies that eventually have had a dramatic impact in that \npart of the world.\n  Today we see organizations such as ASEAN, the 10 nations of Southeast \nAsia, having begun to come together and think with commonality about \nfree market principles and different sorts of governments. A great deal \nof that did come out of the position the United States took during the \nVietnam war.\n  This war is not taught in American schools. It goes by so fast in \nschool systems that sometimes it is dealt with in a matter of an hour \nor two. The contributions of our men and women in Vietnam in the \nmilitary are generally dismissed or downplayed. We put 2.7 million \nAmerican military people into that country against a very capable \nenemy. We fought for years. We lost 58,000 Americans on the \nbattlefield. We lost another 300,000 wounded.\n  The U.S. Marine Corps lost more total casualties in Vietnam than even \nin World War II. They lost three times as many as in Korea. They lost \nfive times as many combat dead as in World War I. The experience, \nbecause of the division in this country, went right past the American \npopulace. It is still not plugged into the comprehension, the quality \nof the service and the quality--against a very highly capable enemy--\nthe results we brought onto the battlefield as measured by the \nstandards that our leaders placed upon us. Mr. President, 1.4 million \nCommunist soldiers died in this war--by the admission of the Hanoi \ngovernment in 1995, not these arguments about whether body counts \ncoming from the battlefield were inflated or not, 1.4 million soldiers. \nThis was a brutal war.\n  The aftermath of the war is almost never discussed in this country. \nIt is as if everything ended in 1975. One million South Vietnamese, the \ncream of South Vietnam's young leadership, were put into reeducation \ncamps; 240,000 of them remained in those camps for longer than 4 years; \nan estimated 56,000 died. Another 1 million Vietnamese jumped into the \nsea, followed by others, including my wife's family. This day, 35 years \nago, her family was on a boat having escaped from North Vietnam in 1954 \nand South Vietnam in 1975, facing unknown futures. The Soviet Union \ngained a strong foothold which did not expire until the Soviet Union \nexpired, putting into place a command economy and basically a Stalinist \nsystem. When I first started going back to Vietnam in 1991, the system \nwas extremely rigid and could only be called a Stalinist system.\n  But the other piece of this, which a number of people in this \ncountry--and I count myself among them--have worked assiduously for \ndecades to bring about is the healing of that war here, in Vietnam, \nbetween the 2 million people of Vietnamese descent in this country and \nthe existing forces in Vietnam. This has been a very arduous and \nsuccessful, for the most part, process.\n  When I look at the Vietnam of today--and I have spent a great deal of \ntime there not only during the war but after the war--I am very \noptimistic. I have always believed, even in my younger days as a \nmarine, that Vietnam was one of the four or five most important \ncountries to the United States when we look at our relations in Asia. \nThis is evolving. The countries, as our trade relations have evolved, \nas our contacts have evolved, and as the trust level has evolved, our \ncountries are working very well together to assure the stability of \nthis region.\n  I feel compelled to make these points on a day that has such an \nimpact on Vietnamese around the world, and to say I am hopeful that \nwith the progress we have made over the past several years that we can \nachieve the objectives that we once were trying to achieve at the time \non the battlefield--a strong relationship with a country whose \ngovernment will become more open and more mature, with a people who \nhave a tremendous level of entrepreneurship and energy, and in the end, \na relationship that can assure greater stability in east Asia and \nSoutheast Asia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3736\n\n  I would now like to turn to my amendment. I would like to emphasize, \nthis is a very carefully drafted amendment. It is one shot, not a \ncontinuing windfall profits tax--which I don't generally agree with. It \nis a one-shot amendment designed to give the American taxpayers a place \non the upside of the recovery of the financial system that they, \nfrankly, enabled. You can understand the anger in this country when we \nlook at the results of this hearing the other day that Senator Levin \nchaired. We hear in many cases the irresponsible behavior of some \nexecutives in the financial sector who brought about the difficulty \nthat threatened our entire economic system.\n  This amendment is very simple. It would provide a one-time, 50-\npercent tax on bonuses that are above $400,000 of any initial bonus \npaid to executives at Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or financial \ninstitutions that received a minimum of $5 billion in the TARP. It is \nonly for income that was generated for work in 2009 and compensated in \n2010.\n  Again, this is a one-shot matter of fairness to balance out the \nrewards that these financial institutions received which were enabled \nby the contributions of the American taxpayers, particularly in the \nTARP. We have had estimates this amendment would recover for our \neconomic system somewhere in the neighborhood of a minimum of $3.5 \nbillion and potentially as high as $10 billion--13 companies, on \nbonuses in excess of $400,000 after all the other compensation has been \npaid. That is the amount of money paid to these executives.\n  Again, I need to emphasize the American taxpayer did not create the \neconomic crisis. They were required to bail out the people who did \ncreate it, and they deserve a share in the upside because these are the \nrewards that they themselves enabled.\n  Paul Krugman, who is a Nobel Prize-winning economist, wrote in July \nof 2008 about his concern at the very inception of this economic crisis \nthat we were moving toward a tendency in this country to socialize risk \nand individualize reward. In other words, whenever we create a \nsituation where there is an economic challenge, the American taxpayer \nat large is expected to absorb the risk. But when the reward comes in, \nonly the executives, the people who were managing the financial system, \nare able to actually get the reward.\n  This particular reward in this one-shot tax proposal has come about \nlargely as a result of government intervention, as a result of working \npeople having to put their money forward, having to bail out a \nfinancial system that went wrong. As a result, as a matter of equity, \nthe reward should be\n\n[[Page S2996]]\n\nshared with the taxpayers who made it possible.\n  When I first started thinking about doing this, I actually was drawn \nto an article that was written in the Financial Times. This actually \nwas last November in the Financial Times. It was written by Martin \nWolf, who is a conservative economist. Here you see the logic and the \nequity of moving forward with this type of windfall profits tax. When \nwe have Paul Krugman, who is known as a liberal economist, a Nobel \nPrize winner, and Martin Wolf, who is a conservative economist who \nwrites for the Financial Times, agree on principle, we have to stop and \nthink about it.\n  Martin Wolf, in this article, said--and I am going to just read a few \nexcerpts from the article:\n\n       Windfall taxes are a ghastly idea. . . . So why do I now \n     find the idea of a windfall tax so appealing? Well, this time \n     it looks different.\n       First, all the institutions making exceptional profits do \n     so because they are beneficiaries of unlimited State \n     insurance for themselves and their counterparts. . . .\n       Second, the profits being made today are in large part the \n     fruit of the free money provided by the central bank, an arm \n     of the state. . . .\n       Third, the case for generous subventions is to restore the \n     financial system--and so the economy to--health. It is not to \n     enrich bankers. . . .\n       Fourth, ordinary people--\n\n  And we need to think about this when we look at the impact, the \nincredible anger that is in this country after incidents such as the \nhearings this week--\n\n     ordinary people can accept that risk takers receive huge \n     rewards. But such rewards for those who have been rescued by \n     the state and bear substantial responsibility for the crisis \n     are surely intolerable. . . .\n\n  Our taxpayers, our working people, rescued a financial system that \nwas on the verge of collapse because of massive acts of bad judgment \nand greed by the very companies that are now reaping huge bonuses from \nthe government's intervention. It is not too much to ask those who have \nbeen so fully compensated and who have received in excess of a $400,000 \nbonus on top of their compensation, that they pay a one-time tax and \nshare that excess, on top of their $400,000 bonus, with the people who \nrescued them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is timely that we have started to \nconsider the financial services modernization legislation during April, \na month that we have designated as Financial Literacy Month. There are \nthree vital components to financial literacy: education, consumer \nprotection, and economic empowerment. H.R. 3217, the Wall Street Reform \nbill, includes essential provisions in all three of these areas for \nconsumers and investors. I have worked extensively with the chairman of \nthe Banking Committee and other members of the Committee to ensure that \nbill includes essential education, consumer protection, and economic \nempowerment provisions. I appreciate all of the leadership and work \ndone by Chairman Dodd and his efficient, effective, and hardworking \nstaff to develop this legislation so important to working families.\n  With regard to education, the legislation creates an Office of \nFinancial Literacy within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The \nFinancial Literacy Office is tasked with developing and implementing \ninitiatives to educate and empower consumers. A strategy to improve the \nfinancial literacy among consumers, that includes measurable goals and \nbenchmarks, must be developed. The Administrator of the Bureau will \nalso become Vice-Chairman of the Financial Literacy and Education \nCommission. This will ensure meaningful participation in the \nCommission.\n  The legislation also requires a Securities and Exchange Commission, \nSEC, financial literacy study to be conducted. The SEC will be required \nto develop an investor financial literacy strategy intended to bring \nabout positive behavioral change among investors.\n  The second key component of financial literacy is consumer \nprotection. This legislation creates a regulatory structure to ensure \ngreater emphasis by regulators on investor and consumer protection. The \nfailure of regulators to protect consumers contributed significantly to \nthe financial crisis. Prospective homebuyers were directed into \nmortgage products that had risks and costs that they could not \nunderstand or afford.\n  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will have the ability to \nrestrict predatory financial products and unfair business practices in \norder to prevent unscrupulous financial services providers from taking \nadvantage of consumers.\n  We also strengthen the ability of the SEC to better represent the \ninterests of retail investors. My proposal to create an Investor \nAdvocate within the SEC is in the bill. The Investor Advocate is tasked \nwith assisting retail investors to resolve significant problems with \nthe SEC or the self-regulatory organizations, SROs. The Investor \nAdvocate's mission includes identifying areas where investors would \nbenefit from changes in Commission or SRO policies and problems that \ninvestors have with financial service providers and investment \nproducts. The Investor Advocate will recommend policy changes to the \nCommission and Congress in the interests of investors. The creation of \nthe Office of the Investor Advocate has widespread support from \nconsumer, labor, and industry organizations.\n  We worked to include in the legislation clarified authority for the \nSEC to effectively require disclosures prior to the sale of financial \nproducts and services. Working families depend on their mutual fund \ninvestments and other financial products to pay for their children's \neducation, prepare for retirement, and attain other financial goals. \nThis provision will ensure that working families have the relevant and \nuseful information they need when they are making decisions that \ndetermine their future financial condition.\n  This legislation also addresses remittance consumer protections. \nWorking families often send substantial portions of their earnings to \nfamily members living abroad.\n  In my home State of Hawaii, many of my constituents remit money to \ntheir family members living in the Philippines. Consumers can have \nserious problems with their remittance transactions, such as being \novercharged or not having their money reach the intended recipient. \nRemittances are not currently regulated under Federal law and State \nlaws provide inadequate consumer protections.\n  The bill will modify the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to establish \nremittance consumer protections. It will require simple disclosures \nabout the costs of sending remittances to be provided to the consumer \nprior to and after the transaction. A complaint and error resolution \nprocess for remittance transactions would be established.\n  The third component of financial literacy is economic empowerment. \nSenator Kohl and I developed title XII of the legislation which is \nintended to increase access to mainstream financial institutions for \nthe unbanked and the underbanked. Mainstream financial institutions are \na vital component to economic empowerment.\n  Banks and credit unions provide alternatives to high-cost and often \npredatory fringe financial service providers such as check cashers and \npayday lenders. Unfortunately, approximately one in four families are \nunbanked or underbanked.\n  Many of these families are low- and moderate-income families that \ncannot afford to have their earnings diminished by reliance on these \nhigh-cost and often predatory financial services. Unbanked families are \nunable to save securely for education expenses, a down payment on a \nfirst home, or other future financial needs. Underbanked consumers rely \non nontraditional forms of credit that often have extraordinarily high \ninterest rates. Regular checking accounts may be too expensive for some \nconsumers unable to maintain minimum balances or afford monthly fees. \nPoor credit histories may also limit their ability to open accounts. \nMore must be done to promote product development, outreach, and \nfinancial education opportunities intended to empower consumers.\n  Title XII authorizes programs intended to assist low- and moderate-\nincome individuals establish bank or credit union accounts and \nencourage greater use of mainstream financial\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\nservices. Title XII will also encourage the development of small, \naffordable loans as an alternative to more costly payday loans.\n  Payday loans often have outrageously high interest rates. Payday loan \nflipping often leads to instances where the fees paid for a payday loan \nwell exceed the principal borrowed. This creates a cycle of debt that \nis hard to break.\n  There is a great need for working families to have access to \naffordable small loans. This legislation would encourage banks and \ncredit unions to develop consumer-friendly payday loan alternatives. \nConsumers who apply for these loans would be provided with financial \nliteracy and educational opportunities. I am proud of the credit unions \nin Hawaii that have worked to develop payday loan alternatives to meet \nthe needs of their members, particularly for our military families that \nhave traditionally been exploited by payday lending.\n  The National Credit Union Administration has provided assistance to \ndevelop these small consumer-friendly loans. More working families need \naccess to affordable small loans. This program will encourage \nmainstream financial service providers to develop affordable small loan \nproducts.\n  I also appreciate the work done by Senator Menendez and his staff to \nauthorize financial education economic empowerment grants intended to \nprovide opportunities for economically vulnerable families.\n  This bill is not about the last financial crisis. This legislation is \nabout creating a more fair financial system that better educates, \nprotects, and empowers consumers and investors.\n  The emergency actions that had to be done in the fall of 2008 brought \nwith it an obligation to create a financial regulatory system that is \nmore helpful to working families. This legislation fulfills that \nobligation and will help improve the lives of so many people in our \ncountry by educating, protecting, and empowering consumers and \ninvestors.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I wish to \ncommend our friend and colleague from Hawaii. I have had the privilege \nand pleasure of knowing Senator Akaka for a long time. He is consistent \nin his issue cluster, if you will. He obviously has issues to deal with \nin his State, but I have never known another individual who has been as \ndogged as the Senator from Hawaii has been about seeing to it that \npeople get that clear, understandable information, the ability to learn \nmore about their own financial activities, that literacy he has \nconsistently talked about for such a long time.\n  There are other accomplishments he has achieved. He is a wonderful \nmember of our committee. He has made a significant contribution to this \nbill. This bill can bear his name on it as having contributed a major \nportion of the effort we are trying to achieve. I thank him for that.\n  We have a ways to go now on the floor in the debates that come here, \nbut I am grateful to him for his consistent support, his ideas he has \nbrought to the product we have now before us. I thank him not only on \nbehalf of his colleagues but on behalf of the American people. He may \nrepresent one State, but his language here affects every State and \nevery person in it. That is a significant contribution. I thank the \nSenator for it.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for your great \nleadership.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I did not get a chance to respond to our \ncolleague from Virginia, Senator Webb, and, first of all, to commend \nhim. His wonderful service to our country in uniform is known by many, \nbut every year he comes to the floor and takes a moment to talk about \nthe conflict in Vietnam, where he played such a significant role in the \nfall of Saigon. We are grateful to him for his service to our country.\n  We are a better Chamber because of Jim Webb's presence here and the \nknowledge and understanding he brings. I know the Presiding Officer, as \nhis colleague from Virginia, appreciates the relationship he has with \nhim and the difference he has made in the Senate by being here. So I \nthank Jim Webb for that.\n  He has offered an idea, as well, to this financial reform package, \none to which I am very sympathetic. There are some constitutional \nissues we have with tax measures that have to originate on the House \nside rather than on the Senate side under the Constitution. I know my \ncolleague from Virginia is probably aware of that, but nonetheless his \nideas have some merit. Obviously, when he brings it up, we will have a \nchance to talk about it, but I would be remiss if I did not mention \nthat particular issue.\n  I see my colleague from North Dakota, who is here with some thoughts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to, in a few minutes, talk about \nthe START treaty. But before I do that, I would like to engage in some \ndiscussion with the Senator from Connecticut about financial reform.\n  Even as I do that, and I will do that briefly, I wanted to say that \nnot many Members of the Senate understand how much time and effort the \nSenator from Connecticut has put into this product of financial \nreform--Wall Street reform, as it is called. I, for one, very much \nappreciate the work that has been done. There is a lot in the bill that \nhas been brought to the floor by Senator Dodd that is commendable and \nthat is right on point. There are some areas where I, perhaps, will \nwant to offer suggestions. Maybe the Senator will agree with them, \nmaybe not.\n  I wish to say as a starting point that I am very pleased that we have \nthe bill on the floor now, open for debate, open for amendment next \nweek. I hope we keep it on the floor and improve it in areas where it \ncan be improved, make modifications where necessary, but in the end be \nable to vote for a piece of legislation that will allow us to tell the \nAmerican people: We understand what happened, and we have tried to take \nsteps now to make sure it cannot and will not happen again.\n  One of the areas where I will offer an amendment--and I understand it \nwill be a controversial amendment--is on the issue of too big to fail.\n  My colleague from Connecticut and others on the Banking Committee \nhave constructed one approach on too big to fail, and I will be \nsupportive of that approach. But I do think the too-big-to-fail issue \nat its root is, if you are too big to fail, from my standpoint, you are \ntoo big. And I come down on the side of one-fourth of the Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve Board who have said this, and many others. I come \ndown on the side of those who have said: If you are too big to fail, \nyou are too big.\n  I think the council that is established under this legislation ought \nto at that point--once designating a company that has become too big to \nfail, that is too big to fail, that causes a moral hazard and an \nunacceptable threat and risk to our economy, then I think divestiture \nis in order of that portion of the company that puts this country at \nrisk as a result of them being too big to fail. That is a different \napproach than is used by the committee but an approach that I think is \nstill credible; an approach, in fact, that has been described by the \nformer Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Greenspan, by, as I said, three \nmembers of the Federal Reserve Board saying: There ought to be \ndivesture. That would be one of the amendments I will offer next week \nand discuss.\n\n  Again, what has happened leading up to and since the near collapse of \nour economy, as a result of unbelievable activities at the top of our \nfinancial food chain, the largest financial enterprises have actually \nbecome much larger because of actions of the Federal Government, among \nother things, to encourage them to become larger. I think an \nappropriate amendment would be for us to have a real discussion about, \nshould we not just decide if you are too big to fail, you are just too \nbig.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. One of the powers of the systemic risk council is, in fact, \nthe power to break up large financial institutions. It is not one of \nthe things they would do, but it is a power which resides in our bill \nfor them to do that. I couldn't agree more about the excessive risks \nthat institutions have taken,\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\nbut there is a distinction. I always think it is more about what risks \nthese institutions pose. Do they have capital standards, leverage \nstandards, liquidity standards that are in place? As we were discussing \nearlier, of the 10 largest financial institutions in the world, the \nUnited States has 1. Of the top 50, 5 are in Canada, a country with \nwhich my colleague is more familiar than most. We have four. They have \nhad very few financial problems during this crisis, not because of the \nsize of their institutions so much as they are far better regulated in \nterms of what they can do, what risks they can assume. There are other \nthings they engage in as well.\n  The point my colleague is making is a very sound one, to make sure we \nare not seeing our system exposed to the kind of actions that can bring \nit down. But I wanted to at least mention to him that we do have the \npower to divest, and we are trying to work on that issue of excessive \nrisk. I appreciate his comments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. First, the point the Senator from Connecticut made, which \nis so important, is effective regulatory authority. If we don't have \nregulations that work or regulators who care, what happens is what \nhappened to us in the last couple years. We have a buildup of \nsubstantial risk, effectively allowing some to gamble rather than \ninvest. We desperately need effective regulatory capability and \nregulators who care. I understand the risk council in the underlying \nbill is allowed to go toward divestiture but not require it.\n  Mr. DODD. That is true.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My point is, I will offer an amendment that would \nactually require it at the front end, simply saying, if we have a \ncategory that is described as too big to fail, meaning this is too \nlarge an organization to be allowed to fail, which in my lexicon is no-\nfault capitalism, if they are now at such a size that they are too big \nto fail, they pose a moral hazard, a grave threat and risk to the \neconomy, if they were to fail, then I say do as we have done on some \nother occasions. We broke up Standard Oil into 26 parts, and it turns \nout the value of the parts was substantially greater than the value of \nthe whole. It turned out to be a pretty wonderful thing. We broke up \nAT for other reasons. I am not rushing to try to break up anybody, \nbut if we are serious about describing that which we think creates \nsubstantial, additional risk in the future, then we should take action \nto eliminate those kinds of risks, if the risk is, in this case, too \nbig to fail.\n  I would like to get rid of the category of too big to fail. The \nFederal Reserve Board has had such a category for a long time. We have \nalways known that if one is too big to fail, they are at a significant \nadvantage to virtually every other financial institution. They can do \nbusiness. They can take risks, but they can't fail. They are too big to \nfail and, competing with them, they have a safety net. My amendment \nwill be simply, if you get to that point where this council judges you \nto be too big to fail without substantial grave risk to the country's \neconomy, then I think divestiture that is sufficient to get the \ninstitution back to an area where it is not too big to fail would be in \nthe public interest. My amendment would require divestiture.\n  The other amendment I will be offering is one that is also perhaps \ncontroversial. That is on the issue of naked credit default swaps or \nwhat some people call synthetic default swaps. They have been \ndescribed, accurately so, as betting or wagering rather than investing. \nI have heard the descriptions of the investment bankers about why they \nare useful in dealing with risk and so on. But it is not useful, from \nmy perspective, to have the largest financial institutions collecting \nfees for the purpose of arranging wagers. There are places to make \nwagers, if we call the wager simply gambling. Las Vegas and Atlantic \nCity come to mind. But with respect to credit default swaps, which is a \nnew term in the discussion these days, credit default swaps themselves \nrepresent insuring against a bond default, for example. But a naked \ncredit default swap means you have no insurable interest in anything. \nYou are simply betting someone else about something that might happen \nwith a bond issue, despite the fact neither of you own the bond. I \nbegan thinking about a column Mr. Pearlstein wrote in the Washington \nPost. He always writes interesting columns. He said: Why should there \nbe allowed more insurance against bonds than there are bonds? Then I \nread a piece that in England they actually tried to categorize it, what \npercent of the credit default swaps were synthetic or naked, having no \ninsurable interest? The answer was about 80 percent. Think of that. \nAbout 80 percent of these naked credit default swaps have no insurable \ninterest on anything. It is just a way to wager.\n  I believe that is a category that ought not be allowed. I will offer \nan amendment on that. I recognize that that may also be a controversial \nissue but one, nonetheless, I think is important.\n  Nobody knows this better than the chairman of the committee. I think \nit is important we have a productive sector to produce things, to \nproduce things that might have a label that says ``Made in America.'' \nIt is important we have a financial sector because we can't produce \nwithout finance. Production is necessary for finance as well. If you \nlook at a couple hundred years of economic history, you will find that, \nin some cases for decades, production has the upper hand and finance is \nout here sort of moving at the beck and call of production. Then, in \nother areas, the financing industry has the upper hand. You see it move \nback and forth. We have been through a couple decades in which finance \nhas the upper hand and has been calling the shots.\n  It is critically important to have a system of finance, and that \nsystem includes investment banks, FDIC-insured banks, venture capital \nfunds, a wide array of financial institutions. We desperately need \nthat. We can't have an economy that grows without it. But it is very \nimportant that financial system be one that has proper, effective \nregulation so we don't see it spin out of control as we have seen in \nthe last 10 or 15 years.\n  In 1994--15\\1/2\\ half years ago--I wrote the cover story for the \nWashington Monthly magazine. The title of my cover story was ``Very \nRisky Business.'' I took a part of a title of a movie back then. At \nthat point, I think there was something like $18 or $28 billion \nnotional value of derivatives out in the economy. I talked about the \nrisk those derivatives posed to our banking institutions that were \ntrading on their own proprietary accounts on derivatives. It is not as \nif I have just discovered this issue. With Senator Feinstein from \nCalifornia and others, I have been on the floor many times talking \nabout the need to regulate derivatives and regulate hedge funds. We \nhave been spectacularly unsuccessful in that over the years, but now at \nlong last, with the legislation that is coming to the floor and the \nopportunity to have a wide-open debate with a lot of amendments, I \nthink all of us can believe that if we are successful--and I believe we \ncan be--we will do something that has merit for the future stability of \nthis country's economy.\n  Again, I know there is a lot of language about banking and investment \nbanking out there. I use some of it, perhaps, that is pretty hot \nlanguage. Some of it is well deserved by a lot of people who made a lot \nof money, as they steered this country's economy into the ditch. But \nlet it be known we need a financial system that works in order to \nfinance production. All of us want the same thing. We want to put this \ncountry back on track and expand the economy and create jobs once \nagain. That is the purpose of all this.\n\n  I used to teach a bit of economics in college. I always described to \nstudents that the economy is not like some engine room on the ship of \nstate where, if you get down in the engine room and find the right \ndials and switches and push them all just right, that the ship of state \nwill move forward. It is not that at all. It is about confidence. If \nthe American people are confident in the future, they do things that \nmanifest that confidence and expand the economy. They buy a new suit of \nclothes, a car, a house, take a trip. They do the things that manifest \ntheir confidence in the future. That is expansive to the economy. If \nthey are not confident, they do exactly the opposite. That contracts \nthe economy.\n  That is why this legislation is going to go a long way toward saying \nto the American people: You can have confidence this sort of thing is \nnot going to happen again. That is the precursor\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\nto allowing us to see an economy that expands because people have some \nconfidence in the future.\n  I started by saying thank you to the Senator from Connecticut. I say, \nagain, there is a lot of work that has gone into this. It is not \nperfect bill. There will be much that is controversial. I will offer a \ncouple controversial amendments. At the end, I hope we will all have \nworked together to accomplish the same thing for the country--the \nopportunity for more economic growth and expansion and more hope and \nopportunity for American families.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for as much time \nas I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              START Treaty\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday there was a hearing in the \nSenate on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty we have negotiated with \nRussia. I was not on the committee, but there was testimony by Dr. \nJames Schlesinger and Dr. William Perry, two of the most veteran arms \ncontrol experts, who came to the Foreign Relations Committee and said \nthey support the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia.\n  I was in Russia a couple weeks ago and had an opportunity to tour a \nnumber of sites that we are actually funding from the United States \nthrough the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, the partnership we \nhave with Russia in a number of areas, stemming from, among other \nthings, what is called the Nunn-Lugar law, the Nunn-Lugar program. I \nhave long supported the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program called \nNunn-Lugar, named after two of my colleagues, Senators Sam Nunn and \nRichard Lugar.\n  In the early 1990s, they wrote legislation that allows us to work \nwith the Russians and other former Soviet states to deactivate nuclear \nweapons and to destroy delivery systems.\n  I wish to show a couple of the photographs and if I might show \nsomething I have had in my desk for a while. I ask unanimous consent to \ndo that. This is a photograph of a blackjack Russian bomber being \ndismantled. This is the wing strut from that bomber. I have a piece \nthat was sawed off from the bomber's wing strut in my desk simply \nbecause it was given to me, and I thought it was so significant that \nthe wing of a Soviet bomber that used to carry nuclear weapons, part of \nthat wing is now in my Senate desk, not because we shot the Russian \nbomber down; it is because we actually provided the funding to saw the \nwings off and destroy the bomber. That is success.\n  This is a photograph of a missile silo in the Ukraine. I have in my \ndesk, as well, a hinge. This hinge came from that missile silo. That \nmissile silo held an SS-18 missile with a nuclear warhead aimed at the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  Now, where that missile silo once existed, with a missile and a \nwarhead aimed at America, is now a field of sunflowers. You can see \nfrom this picture the missile silo was blown up, dismantled. I actually \nhave a piece of the hinge. What a great success. The missile silo did \nnot have a missile delivered to destroy a city in America. We actually \nspent the money to pay for the destruction of the missile silo under \nthe Nunn-Lugar program. What a spectacular success that is.\n  This next picture is of a submarine being dismantled. It is a Russian \nsubmarine. It is a Typhoon class ballistic missile submarine, and it \nwould have carried missile tubes, and those missile tubes in that \nsubmarine under the water would have contained nuclear warheads that \nwould have been used to destroy our country.\n  Here, in this picture, is an example of the missile tubes on that \nsubmarine. These too were destroyed. I have a little vile of copper \nwire that was ground up that came from that submarine. Now, we did not \nsink that submarine in an act of warfare. We actually paid to have that \nsubmarine dismantled and the copper wiring ground up. I have some of \nthe copper wiring here in my desk, just to remind us how important this \nprogram has been.\n  Now, we have on this Earth about 25,000 nuclear weapons, roughly. \nThis comes from the Union of Concerned Scientists in 2010. It is \nestimated Russia has about 15,000 nuclear weapons; the U.S. probably \nabout 9,000-plus; China, a couple hundred; France, several hundred; \nBritain, a couple hundred. So here is the quantity of nuclear weapons \non our planet. The question is, What would happen if someday in some \nway someone detonates a nuclear weapon in the middle of a major city on \nthis planet? I know what will happen. It will change life on Earth as \nwe know it.\n  So let me describe a story. And keep in mind, we have 25,000 nuclear \nweapons on the planet. Let me describe a story. One month after 9/11, a \nCIA agent nicknamed Dragonfire reported to the CIA that he had evidence \nthat a 10-kiloton Russian nuclear weapon had been stolen and had been \nsmuggled into New York City and was to be detonated. That was 1 month \nafter 9/11. It was October 11, 2001, to be exact. Dragonfire reported \nthat al-Qaida terrorists had stolen a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb from the \nRussian arsenal and may have smuggled it into New York City.\n  It was not reported at that point, but there was an apoplectic \nseizure here. The President and others who had this information were \nnot sure whether it was accurate or not. It was a report from a CIA \nagent, and they--just in the shadow, 1 month later, of 9/11 of course--\nwere very much on their guard. Our country was pretty much shocked by \neverything that happened.\n  So this report by Dragonfire meant that Vice President Cheney moved \nto a secret mountain facility, along with several hundred government \nemployees, we are told. So they were the core of an alternative \ngovernment that would operate if Washington, DC, were destroyed by a \nnuclear weapon.\n  We are told that President Bush dispatched a nuclear emergency \nsupport team to New York to search for a weapon. To not cause panic, no \none in New York City was informed of the threat, not even the mayor of \nNew York. After a few weeks, the intelligence community determined that \nDragonfire's report of someone having stolen a Russian nuclear weapon \nand smuggling it into this country was probably a false alarm.\n  But when they did the post-mortem on it, they all understood it was \nperfectly possible that a nuclear weapon could have been stolen from \nthe Russian arsenal, perfectly possible that a nuclear weapon could \nhave been smuggled in to New York City or Washington, DC, and possible \nfor terrorists to disarm the safeguards and explode the bomb.\n  No one said it was impossible that a terrorist group would want to \nkill several hundred thousand Americans with one bomb in the middle of \nan American city. On the contrary, all of the experts knew this was \npossible. Now, all of that--by the way--all of that angst was about one \n10-kiloton, rather small Russian nuclear weapon reported by a CIA agent \nto have been stolen.\n  But there is more than one nuclear weapon; there are 25,000 nuclear \nweapons on this planet. Think of the concern about the potential \nstealing of one, and then ask the question, What do we have to do to \nmake sure that nuclear weapons that now exist are safeguarded, that \nthere is adequate security, and, even more important, that we stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons to others, other countries, and certainly \nterrorist groups who want to acquire nuclear weapons?\n  The description of Dragonfire's report comes from a former Clinton \nadministration official, Graham Allison, an expert on nuclear \nproliferation. He wrote about the incident in a book called ``Nuclear \nTerrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe.'' The description I \nhave just read is a part of the book by Mr. Allison.\n  Now, even though the Cold War ended two decades ago, we still have, \nas I have indicated, about 25,000 nuclear weapons in the world. Mr. \nPresident, 95 percent of them are owned by the United States or by \nRussia. We are now operating under the Strategic Offensive Reduction \nTreaty, also known as the Moscow Treaty. It requires the United States \nand Russia, by our agreement, to have no more than 2,200 \n``operationally deployed'' strategic nuclear weapons by 2012. But it \ndoes not do anything to restrict nuclear delivery vehicles--bombers, \nmissiles, submarines. And it does not have any verification measures. \nIt expires in 2012.\n  A few weeks ago President Obama and Russian President Medvedev met\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\nin Prague, the Czech Republic, and signed a new strategic arms control \ntreaty. It is called START. It limits each side to 1,550 deployed \nstrategic nuclear warheads--30 percent lower than the existing treaty. \nIt limits each side to 800 deployed and nondeployed ICBM launchers, \nSLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments--one-\nhalf of what the START treaty allowed. It sets a separate limit of 700 \ndeployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers that are \nequipped. It has verification regimes for on-site inspections, \ntelemetry exchanges, data exchanges, and so on.\n  Now, I know this treaty will be controversial in some quarters, but I \nwant to describe what ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, has said just in the last month, because some are worried about \nwhether our nuclear weapons work, whether our stockpile is reliable. \nWhat if we use it? Can we expect it to work? Well, the other side of \nthe nuclear debate is, if you use it, you probably will never be around \nto wonder whether it works. I think the face of this Earth will change \nif there is ever an exchange of nuclear weapons of any kind between \nadversaries that have multiple nuclear weapons.\n  ADM Michael Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says:\n\n       I, the Vice Chairman, and the Joint Chiefs, as well as our \n     combatant commanders around the world, stand solidly behind \n     this new treaty, having had the opportunity to provide our \n     counsel, to make our recommendations, and to help shape the \n     final agreements.\n\n  So the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs says they are satisfied with this \ntreaty, believe it is a good treaty.\n  Linton Brooks says something very important. He is the former NNSA, \nNational Nuclear Security Administration, Administrator from 2003 to \n2007. He says:\n\n       START . . . is a good idea on its own merits, but . . . for \n     those who think it's only a good idea if you only have a \n     strong weapons program, I think this budget ought to take \n     care of that.\n\n  He is talking about the budget the President has sent to the Congress \nfor life extension programs and the other things we do to make sure the \nnuclear stockpile is up to date.\n  He said:\n\n       Coupled with the out-year projections, it takes care of the \n     concerns about the complex and it does very good things about \n     the stockpile and it should keep the labs healthy. . . .\n\n  He said:\n\n       . . . I would've killed for this kind of budget.\n\n  The reason I mention this is that we have people coming to the floor \nof the Senate now, and in public discussion--and Douglas Feith is an \nexample of them. He says:\n\n       Since the administration is so eager for [the treaty], the \n     main interests of conservatives will relate to modernization. \n     Republicans are interested in the U.S. nuclear posture, the \n     political leverage they have will be the treaty. . . .One of \n     the hot issues is going to be the replacement warhead. . . .\n\n  What does that mean? That means we have had people in this Chamber \nand others--including the neocons, and Mr. Feith and others--they have \nalways wanted to begin building new nuclear weapons. It started with: \nWhat we need to do is, we need to build new designer nuclear weapons. \nWe need to build earth-penetrating bunker-buster weapons so we can use \nthem. In Afghanistan there were some folks who were hold up down, well \nunderground, and so: What we need to do is develop designer nuclear \nweapons, earth-penetrating bunker-buster nuclear weapons.\n  Well, Senator Feinstein and I and some others got that abolished. It \nmakes no sense to me for us to be off building new nuclear weapons. It \njust does not make any sense. The fact that the bunker-buster earth-\npenetrator was not built--that does not matter--then they came with the \nRRW, reliable replacement weapons. Substantial costs of additional \nfunding to build new nuclear weapons called the replacement weapons.\n  Here are some statements by some skeptical U.S. Senators about this \nSTART treaty:\n\n       Well, I can tell you this, that I think the Senate will \n     find it very hard to support this treaty if there is not a \n     robust modernization plan. . . .\n\n  Another Senator:\n\n       The success of your administration in ensuring the \n     modernization plan is fully funded in the authorization and \n     appropriations process could have a significant impact on the \n     Senate. . . .\n\n  It means you have to be building additional nuclear weapons, you have \nto spend X amount of money here and there in order for us to support \nthe START treaty.\n  Another Senator says:\n\n       My vote on the START treaty will thus depend in large \n     measure on whether I am convinced the administration has put \n     forward an appropriate and adequately funded plan to sustain \n     and modernize the smaller nuclear stockpile it envisions.\n\n  Let my say what the JASON says about all this. It is an organization \nthat really knows what it is talking about and issues a lot of reports \nwith respect to the science of nuclear weapons, because some have said: \nWe have to build a lot of new nuclear weapons here because the nuclear \nweapons we have--dealing with the degradation of the pits and other \nthings--we are not going to be able to have confidence they even work. \nSo here is what the JASON says:\n\n       JASON finds no evidence that accumulation of changes \n     incurred from aging and LEPs--\n\n  Life extension programs--\n\n     have increased risk to certification of today's deployed \n     nuclear warheads.\n\n  They are saying, quite clearly, there is no evidence there is an \nincreased risk to be able to certify that our nuclear stockpile is \nreliable.\n\n       Lifetimes of today's nuclear warheads could be extended for \n     decades, with no anticipated loss in confidence, by using \n     approaches similar to those employed in [the life extension \n     programs] to date.\n\n  So to those who want to go off and spend a lot of money building new \nnuclear weapons, at a time when we are deep in debt, and leverage that \nin exchange for voting on the START treaty, I say you are wrong. You \nare just dead wrong. We have to get about the business of reducing \nnuclear weapons. We have to get about the business of agreeing to \ntreaties like this because it is our responsibility. It falls on our \nshoulders here in the United States to be the world leader to steer us \naway from nuclear catastrophe.\n  Now, I understand nobody is talking about disarmament here. But we \nare talking about a circumstance where there is able to be \ncertification that our nuclear stockpile is reliable. That certainly \nought to satisfy the appetite of those who want to build more nuclear \nweapons. We should not be building more nuclear weapons. What kind of a \nmessage does that send to the rest of the world? We have 25,000 nuclear \nweapons on the planet already--the loss of one which caused an \napoplectic seizure around this place, for those who knew it, because \nthey wondered what would happen.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 was several thousand people. What would happen if \nseveral hundred thousand people were murdered with a nuclear weapon \nbeing exploded in a major city--and not just a U.S. city, any major \ncity on this planet? It will dramatically alter life on this planet.\n  So I just wanted to say, this START treaty--I commend the President: \na job well done. This is a very good and important treaty for our \ncountry and for the world. I am going to be strongly supporting it. We \nwill have sufficient resources--the President has seen to it--\nsufficient resources for the life extension program to make sure our \nnuclear stockpile is reliable.\n\n  This President has said, to his credit, that our job, our \nresponsibility as a world leader is to provide leadership to stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons, to do everything that is necessary to keep \nnuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists and rogue nations. Our \njob is to find ways to reduce the number of nuclear weapons on this \nplanet.\n  The President of the United States hosted at the convention center \nhere in Washington, DC, I think the largest gathering, perhaps, of its \nkind in history, of world leaders who came here to talk about securing \nloose nuclear materials and nuclear weapons. Some make light of that: \nWell, a little gathering; good for all them. No one should make light \nof that gathering. It was historic and unbelievably important. A very \nsmall amount of highly enriched uranium--the size of a 2-liter of soda \nin the store--is enough to build a nuclear weapon. The loose nuclear \nmaterials, highly enriched uranium and plutonium that is available \naround the\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\nworld, must be gathered together and must be safeguarded and kept out \nof the hands of terrorist organizations. That is what this President \nwas doing: cementing together the will and the agreement with other \nleaders from around the world to do that. That is unbelievably \nimportant. No one should make light of that and everyone should \nunderstand the historic importance of what this President has done.\n  Finally, this START treaty, as I indicated, I think has much to be \ncommended to this country, and this Senate ought not find itself in the \nkind of dispute it almost always has on everything these days. If there \nis anything this Senate ought to be able to agree upon, it is that it \nis our responsibility and in our interests--in our long-term survival \ninterests--to find ways to reduce the number of nuclear weapons on this \nplanet, reduce delivery vehicles, and reach agreements with adversaries \nand potential adversaries so all of us understand that we cannot allow \na nuclear weapon to fall into the hands of terrorist organizations.\n  I commend the administration. I hope on a bipartisan basis we can \ngive a very strong vote to the START treaty when the hearings are \ncompleted and when we have a debate on it on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have been having a conversation this \nmorning. Senator Corker of Tennessee was on the floor, a member of our \nBanking Committee, and he and I engaged in a conversation about our \nlegislation. Senator Akaka from Hawaii, a member of the committee as \nwell, was here to talk about the bill. Senator Dorgan was here talking \nabout arms control, but also about our legislation. Senator Jim Webb \nwas also here this morning to talk about provisions in the bill. While \nthere are no votes today, it was an opportunity for people to come and \ntalk about either what they are in support of or what they object to \nand what additions they may wish to make.\n  Let me emphasize again my hope that today and over the weekend and \nMonday, Members who have amendments to this bill, Democrats and \nRepublicans, if they would let us know what those amendments are so we \ncan begin to process them and possibly accept, hopefully, as many as we \npossibly can as additions to the bill, and modify some, making them \nacceptable, without having necessarily to go into votes. Of course \nthere will be some that will require a debate and discussion and votes \non the floor. We wish to accommodate as many Members as we can over the \nnext couple of weeks on these matters. I know the leader has indicated \nto me that his intention is to come in very early every day and to stay \nlate next week and the week after if necessary so we can accommodate as \nmany Members as possible in this debate. I know the floor staff of the \nSenate is delighted to hear those comments about being in early and \nstaying late, but obviously we want to get this bill done if we can. It \nis an important piece of legislation. I know there are others who want \nto be heard on it. Obviously it is an emotional issue, given what our \ncountry has gone through over the last 2 years. So I lay that out as a \nbackdrop for my colleagues and ask them to let us know how we can be \nhelpful to them.\n  I will also respectfully ask that when Members bring up their \namendments, if we can limit the time of debate so we don't have \nextended debate. A good, strong debate can occur over a half an hour or \n45 minutes and might be more than adequate, and to then give our \ncolleagues an opportunity to vote.\n  Briefly, this afternoon, before closing out this discussion, I wish \nto talk about a very important part of this bill. We have been hearing \na lot of discussion about too big to fail and about the derivatives \nsections of the bill and the early warning system. One of the major \nattributes of this legislation is the establishment of a Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau or division. We have never had one before. \nIn fact, we have had many of them, but not one. We have around seven of \nthem at the Federal level, various prudential regulators. I have great \nrespect for the people who work in these divisions.\n  Candidly, as I think many of them would attest, the predominant \nfunction of the regulator has been the safety and soundness function, \nand the consumer side of that equation has always been sort of \nrelegated to a second-class status in too many cases. As a result, over \nthe years we have seen that consumer protection has not had, when it \ncomes to financial services, the elevated status it deserves. So I wish \nto talk about briefly what is in our bill. I wish to take great \nexception to some of the falsehoods that are being bandied about to \ndescribe what is in this bill, address them each directly by quoting \nfrom the bill. Members themselves can then read the legislation to \ndetermine whether they think the language is adequate. Obviously we \ndon't want to overly burden anyone, nor do we want to leave a situation \nwhere people are burdened, tremendously so, when their homes, their \nincomes, their retirement have been lost because consumer protection \nwas not being considered at all during the time the economic crisis was \nemerging and during the time it exploded.\n  I would be very surprised if any Member of this body comes to the \nfloor and says, Well, I don't think we need to put a focus on consumer \nprotection. Virtually everyone I have spoken to has said this is very \nimportant. We need to have consumer protection in the financial \nmodernization and financial reform bill. After all, I think it is \nwidely understood that it was a failure of consumer protection that was \nat the very heart of the financial crisis. It was, of course, these bad \nmortgages that were being sold and that people were being lured into \nthat caused the fires that began and that consumed our economy, or \nnearly consumed our economy. Over the last year and a half, in fact, as \nthe Banking Committee has held a long series of hearings on the root \ncause of the crisis, the pattern has been clear. Americans, as we now \nknow painfully, were sold mortgages they never understood and could \nnever have afforded.\n\n  The very first witness we had before the Banking Committee when I \nbecame chairman in January and February of 2007--I had never been \nchairman of a committee before, until the retirement of my great pal \nand friend and wonderful chairman, Paul Sarbanes, who had served as \nchairman, and as Richard Shelby, my now ranking member had been \nchairman. In February the very first hearings we held were on the \nmortgage crisis.\n  The very first witness we had was a woman named Delores King, who is \nan elderly woman from Chicago. She is retired. She worked all her life. \nShe had lost her husband, as I recall, but they had been able to buy a \nhome years before. They had lived in that home and raised their family. \nShe tragically lost her husband and she was on in years. She had a very \nsmall amount of debt. I don't know whether it was a credit card debt or \nutility debt, but I am talking small--$2,000 or $3,000, as I recall \nnow. Three years ago she appeared as my first witness as chairman of \nthe committee to talk about the mortgage crisis in January and February \nof 2007.\n  What happened to her happened, unfortunately, over and over again. A \nmortgage broker came and said: I know how to take care of that debt you \nhave, Mrs. King. What we will do is rewrite your mortgage for you on \nyour home. Here she was on a fixed income as a retiree in our country, \ntrying to make ends meet. She had not a lot of retirement income. I \nthink she may have worked in the postal department. She worked in the \nlibrary. I thank my staff member here recalling from 3 years ago who \nwas with me that day. She worked in a library in Chicago, obviously not \nmaking a lot of money as a librarian, or working in the library. So she \nwas on a very fixed, narrow income as a retiree. That mortgage this guy \nsold to her ended up exploding on her in a matter of months to the \npoint where it consumed 70 percent of her fixed income and she lost the \nhome. Here is a woman who had done everything right, and that went on \nover and over again.\n  If you want to know why we are in the mess we are in, although things \nare getting better, it was Delores King's story being repeated over and \nover and over and over and over again that\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\ncaused the situation we are living in today.\n  So when I say the root cause of what happened to us financially began \nin the living rooms of Delores King and those like her, that is exactly \nwhat happened. There are other factors as well, but that is the root \ncause. So to talk about drafting a bill on financial reform and \nexcluding the kind of protections that would have avoided Delores King \nlosing her home and going through the financial turmoil as a retiree \nmust be a critical part of this legislation and why I feel so \npassionately and strongly about this in our bill.\n  The regulators today we have in place simply can't get this job done. \nI won't dwell on it. I have great respect for people who work in our \nrespective public sectors at the local, State, and national level. I am \nsure there are many good and talented people. But when you are \nsubjected to a division or a bureau that kind of separates you out in \nsort of the basement or wherever else you are, if not physically at \nleast how you are treated in the context of everything else, you get \nsome flavor of what has happened here. Their jobs in these seven other \nregulatory bodies have been divided up among different regulators where \nconsumer protection is an afterthought to their primary safety and \nsoundness missions and responsibilities. So the legislation we have \nbefore us replaces that failed setup with a single regulator, with the \nindependence and authority to do the job right. That is what we are \ntrying to do.\n  This regulator will be a watchdog with a bark and bite, one with the \nability to take meaningful action to stop the ripoffs and the mission \nto empower consumers to make good financial decisions.\n  The bureau will force large banks and credit card companies to \nexplain their offerings in plain English so that you do not need a \nmaster's in business administration to be an informed consumer. It will \nshut down the scam artists and the sleazy lenders--and they are out \nthere in droves--before they can take advantage of the Delores Kings \nagain. There would not, of course, be scam artists and sleazy lenders \nif these abusive practices were not profitable--and they are \nprofitable--when we have large Wall Street firms that have earned--\n``earned'' is not the right word--gained, they gained billions of \ndollars by engaging in these practices. Don't think they were not. They \nwere not the broker who walked into Delores King's house. They were not \nthe small banks that decided to write that mortgage. But these large \nfirms were involved in the securitization, the marketing of these \nproducts all bundled together.\n  We have now learned even in the hearings last week that they knew \nwhat crummy bundles they were. There was a lot of junk and trash in \nthere. Delores King was given a mortgage knowing she could not pay, she \nwas on a fixed income, they knew it would balloon to the point that it \nwould consume 70 percent of her income--don't tell me they did not know \nwhat that was. And expecting that 80-year-old woman to read and \nunderstand all she was going to be subjected to in the fine print of \nthe mortgage contract is ridiculous. Yet that is how this daisy chain \nworked and why we ended up in the mess we did. This consumer bureau \nmust be a part of our bill.\n  The Chamber of Commerce is circulating some talking points about what \nthis bureau is and how it will impact American businesses. Tom Donahue \nand I are good friends. I have known Tom a long time. We have worked on \nissues together. He runs the chamber. It saddens me that an \norganization such as that would put out a piece of paper with that much \nfalse information. I know they do not like consumer protection at the \nChamber of Commerce. That has been a standard, unfortunately, for too \nmany years. I don't mind them taking on and arguing with me about the \nbill if they want to, and you are entitled to all the opinions you wish \nto have, but you are not entitled to your own facts, as the old saying \ngoes. What they put out is factually wrong.\n  I want to spend a couple of minutes addressing each one of their \nfalse accusations in the document they are spreading around and address \nthem directly.\n  The chamber claims that the bureau would regulate ``virtually every \nbusiness that extends credit.'' Suddenly, they will have you believe \nthat anyone who bills you at the end of the month will be caught up in \nsweeping new regulations. That sentence is totally false.\n  You may not accept what I said, that it is totally false, so let me \nread from the bill. The bill is here, this tome, these 1,400 pages. Let \nme read from the section of the bill that covers this particular point. \nI will read it carefully:\n\n       The Bureau--\n\n  Speaking about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--\n\n     may not exercise any rulemaking, supervisory enforcement, or \n     other authority under this title with respect to a merchant, \n     retailer, or seller of nonfinancial goods or services that is \n     not engaged significantly in offering or providing consumer \n     financial products or services.\n\n  I don't know what part of that sentence they do not understand, but \nthat is about as clear as it could possibly be. You must be \nsignificantly involved in the selling of financial services and \nproducts. A dentist, a butcher, a retailer who sells you products and \nallows you to pay later or on some delayed paying process is not in the \nbusiness of financial services and products. Allowing their clients, \ntheir patients, their customers to have some delayed payment process \ndoes not bring them under the purview of this law.\n  The line that ``virtually every business that extends credit'' is a \ncompletely false sentence, and yet it is in the talking points of the \nChamber of Commerce.\n  I will read the sentence again in the bill:\n\n       The Bureau may not exercise any rulemaking, supervisory \n     enforcement, or other authority--\n\n  Other authority, Mr. President--\n\n     under this title with respect to a merchant, retailer, or \n     seller of nonfinancial goods or services that is not engaged \n     significantly in offering or providing consumer financial \n     products or services.\n\n  What does that mean? If you run a tab at your butcher or grocer, you \nare not covered. Again, merchants, retailers, sellers of nonfinancial \nservices are not covered. If a doctor charges you a late fee, that is \nnot covered. If a retailer refers a customer who has not paid his bill \nto a debt collector, that is not covered under this bill. If a store \naccepts credit cards, that is not covered. If your dentist or retailer \nor merchant allows you to pay your bill over time, they are not covered \nunder this bill.\n  The consumer bureau is not going to regulate accountants and \northodontists. It is not going to regulate anyone who--and I will quote \nagain--``is not engaged significantly in offering or providing consumer \nfinancial products or services.''\n  Any time we hear a Member of this body--and some already have--come \nto this Chamber to object to this bureau by invoking a small business \nin their State, keep your ears perked. The strong likelihood is that \nthe false talking point is surfacing yet again.\n  The second falsehood in the chamber's epistle: I heard people say \nthat this is a wild new bureaucracy with powers that ``extend far \nbeyond traditional financial services products to the entire economy. \nIn short''--this chamber letter goes on--``In short, it creates a new \nregulatory overlay over the entire business community.'' Not true. \nCompletely false.\n  The powers under this bill already exist. I am not writing new powers \nunder this bill. They exist under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the \nTruth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Home \nMortgage Disclosure Act, the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, and \nRESPA. There is a long list of legislation that passed years ago that \nis out there. This bill says those laws must be enforced. We are not \nwriting new laws. These are the laws that are on the books.\n  We add one new word. ``Deceptive and unfair practices'' is covered, \nand we had the word ``abusive.'' I acknowledge that. There is one new \nword called ``abusive'' that we add to the litany of the kinds of \npractices that have caused consumers the difficulties they have been \nthrough. There is no other new authority. The rest of the authority \nexists in current Federal law under the statutes I enumerated and there \nare many others, by the way, that are presently covered.\n  All we are saying is, what is the point in having these laws? They \nare\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\non the books designed to protect people. The issue is whether anyone is \nable or willing to exercise the authority.\n  Financial firms, I believe, will benefit from this in many ways when \nwe streamline and minimize regulatory burdens. There are seven other \nagencies responsible to one degree or another for this list of existing \nFederal law. It seems to me the financial services sector will benefit \nby having a single regulator with the ability to enforce this \ncollection of laws I described. It seems to me that would be a welcome \nopportunity rather than having so many different regulators to deal \nwith. The single new agency will easily be held accountable for its \nperformance as well.\n  The third false claim. I quote again:\n\n       The bill gives the consumer financial product agency \n     authority to write rules, enforce rules, conduct \n     examinations, require new review and approve disclosures \n     regarding consumer financial products, impose fees or \n     assessments on all covered persons, and require reports from \n     any covered entities.\n\n  Again, false. Not true at all. This bill does not give this new \nbureau any authority to charge anyone a fee or assessment. There are no \nfees or assessments in our bill--this bill--on any of these entities. \nYet the report that is out there indicates it does. Completely false. \nIt does not create a new government power.\n\n  What it does do is allow the Bureau to write rules that create a \nlevel playing field for small community banks and credit unions which \ntoday face unfair competition from largely the unregulated shadow \nbanking industry. We heard from our community banks over and over about \nthis point. Where is the level playing field? We get drawn in, we do \nour job, we are regulated, we operate carefully, and then you have \nthese operators out there totally unregulated, and the reputation of \neverybody in the financial services sector suffers because of some of \nthese unscrupulous payday lenders, these check-cashing operations that \ndo not have any regulator at all. They are functioning, they are \nabusing or deceiving people. And that regulated bank on the corner is \nsaying: Why isn't that guy being regulated? I am regulated.\n  Our bill changes that situation. We apply those same rules, and that \nis a great advantage to the community banks in the country to have a \nlevel playing field. Because this new bureau will be able to write \nrules that prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in the shadow \nbanking sector and conduct examinations and gather information from \nnonbank lenders and brokers. Those shadowy firms will not have an \nunfair leg up on our community banks, allowing those smaller \ninstitutions to compete more effectively and to provide capital more \nfreely.\n  The fourth false claim is the following, and again I am quoting from \nthis document:\n\n       The consumer financial protection agency would set the \n     floor, not the ceiling, regarding State consumer protection \n     laws. This will create a new regulatory regime companies will \n     be subject to and consumers will be lost in the maze of \n     Federal regulations and disclosures, 51 State laws and State \n     attorneys general interpreting and enforcing Federal law at \n     State level. This is directly contrary to the goals of \n     streamlining, modernizing, and simplifying the regulatory \n     system (and disclosure to consumers.)\n\n  That is the claim. A Federal consumer law has historically \nestablished a minimum standard, and that is what this bill does as \nwell. Ever since the Truth in Lending Act passed in 1968, Congress has \nallowed the States to adopt consumer protection laws as long as they do \nnot conflict with Federal law. State attorneys general have always been \non the front lines of consumer protection, and they will continue to \nplay that role.\n  Meanwhile, this single bureau will help to streamline, as I said a \nmoment ago, and simplify disclosures. For instance, two agencies \nregulate mortgage laws, meaning consumers and community banks are \nforced to contend with two different Federal mortgage disclosures. \nUnder our Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, we will eliminate that \nunnecessary duplication and create one single form.\n  Fifth: The Chamber claims:\n\n       The consumer financial protection agency will have the \n     authority to mandate that any company offering a consumer \n     financial product has to offer a product with terms and \n     conditions set by the government. Alternative products cannot \n     be offered unless the ``plain vanilla'' is extended. This \n     gives the largest banks a significant competitive advantage \n     over smaller banks, limits consumer choice, and will \n     significantly increase the cost of any alternative products \n     that are tailored for specific needs.\n\n  This one is entirely made up of whole cloth. There is no such thing \nin our bill. None. I don't even know from where it comes. It is one \nthing to disagree over the wording of something, but when you make up \none out of whole cloth entirely, I don't know how to address that. I \ndon't know what they are talking about. This one comes out of the blue.\n  Finally, I wish to address the claim that ``the bill gives the \nconsumer financial protection agency the authority to request and hold \nreports from any covered entity--including reports from banks about \ntheir types of accounts and the balances in each account.\n  In fact, just as regulators today collect and share information about \nthe companies they oversee, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nwill be able to collect information and share it with other regulators. \nThere is nothing new about that at all. But, unlike some of the claims \nthat have been made that this information will be made public or sent \nto Wall Street--the idea is that this new government entity will be \ncollecting private information about your finances and making it \npubilc, that is not true either. That is false.\n  Strong privacy protections are included in our bill to make sure that \nproprietary, personal, or confidential consumer information is kept \njust that--private.\n  Think about this for a moment. Opponents of this new bureau are \nactually suggesting it will benefit consumers for regulators to have \nless information about what the companies they regulate are doing.\n  I have said before people are welcome to their opinions but not their \nfacts. Again, I am more than happy to consider ideas people have and \nhow they think we can make this consumer bureau work better. I have not \nshut the door on any ideas people may want to bring up. But what I \ncan't tolerate is people making totally false accusations to inflame \nthe passions, to incorrectly and falsely cause great concern among \nretailers and merchants and others across the country. That is the \nintent of all this. I know what it is. They do not want to take on the \nbill itself and what it does, so they are out there propagandizing with \nfalse information about this to undermine what we are trying to \nachieve. Again, some of those very businesses are the ones that pay an \nawful price.\n\n  I had a wonderful couple last year in my State who had started a \nbusiness 40 years ago. They are a family-run small business. They were \nlate by 3 days for the first time in 40 years on a credit card \npayment--the first time in 40 years, 3 days late. They watched their \ninterest rate go from 5 percent to 22 percent, and it put them out of \nbusiness--after 40 years. That is a small business that extends credit, \nworks with customers and others. They were taken to the cleaners \nbecause there wasn't anyone around to say: No, you can't jump from 5 \npercent to 22 percent. That is unfair and that is wrong.\n  I tried for 20 years to pass a credit card bill in this Chamber and \nwas never able to get it up even for a vote, except on amendments to \nbills. Last spring, we were able to bring it up, and it passed 90 to 5 \nin this Chamber, although it was a highly partisan vote coming out of \nthe Banking Committee. As a result, today we have protections in place \nfor that family in Connecticut, similar to so many others who have \nwatched fees and interest rates skyrocket for almost no reason at all. \nIn fact, the language of the contract says they can do just that, for \nno reason at all.\n  Every time consumers get taken to the cleaners, it shouldn't take 20 \nyears to pass a law to address it. The power of the credit card \ncompanies was such they were able to stop me, year in and year out, \nfrom getting that bill passed. Why can't we have protection for \nconsumers who purchase and use--as we all do today for toasters, cars, \nand other products--financial products?\n  I have used the example lately of the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. We have one in place. We all read the tragic stories \nrecently of a car company that had problems with an accelerator. What \nhappened? There was a recall of those automobiles to protect\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\npeople against the harm that could befall them if that happened to them \nwhile they were driving that automobile.\n  When someone marketed a crummy mortgage in an unregulated sector of \nour economy and took Dolores King to the cleaners and ruined her life--\nshe lost her home, lost the earnings she had--where does she go? \nNowhere. There is nowhere to go. Maybe some sympathetic banker might \ntake pity on her. But why should Dolores King be subjected to financial \nruin, when the producer of an automobile that is faulty is protected or \na toaster or a television? For all these products, if they are faulty \nor deficient in some way, there are places we can go to get our \nsituation addressed. Yet in the world in which we live today, of \nmortgages and credit cards and financial products, there is nothing \nthat exists to give people a chance to get the protections they \ndeserve.\n  Our bill isn't perfect. I will be the first to admit there may be \nbetter ideas on how to do this. But I am not going to sit around and \nlisten to people issue false statements about what is in this bill and \ninflaming innocent people who want good legislation that this bill will \ndo them harm. It does the opposite.\n  So next week we will begin the debate. I am sure there will be a ton \nof amendments that will try to undermine the consumer protection bureau \nwe have established. But I would hope my colleagues--Democrats and \nRepublicans--will join in an effort to write a good, strong consumer \nprotection bill, along with the other pieces of this legislation, so we \ncan provide at least a better sense of security.\n  I will end on this note. I wish to pick up on a point Senator Dorgan \ntalked about in his remarks earlier this morning--something I have \naddressed occasionally over the last number of days, but I don't think \nI have emphasized it as much as I should. I have been reciting \nstatistics--8\\1/2\\ million jobs lost, 7 million foreclosures, 20 \npercent decline in retirement, 30 percent decline in home values, $11 \ntrillion lost in household wealth. I hear the numbers and I have said \nthem so many times I can recite them. But I don't have a number for--\nand this actually worries me far more than those statistics, as \ndevastating as those numbers are--I don't have a number for what the \ncost is to our country because the American people have lost faith and \nconfidence in our financial system. I don't know how to put a dollar \nsign on that one for you. I don't know if anyone could. I don't believe \nanyone can.\n  But I know this much. People don't trust and don't have faith that \nthe system is going to work for them when they see, as we all have, \nthese stories of these credit card fees and charges and every gimmick \nyou can think of to reach into the pockets of hard-working families. \nYou begin to understand why people have lost faith, when they see and \nhear stories about Dolores King and others who have done everything \nright in their life and someone comes in and decides to take advantage \nof them or they read these e-mails, as we had last week, of these \narrogant characters up there laughing about the widows and orphans they \nhave taken advantage of at a major investment bank. What do you do \nabout that? What is the number to put on that one?\n  I will tell you this much. We can write all the bills we want, we can \npass all the regulations, but if we don't get back that confidence and \nfaith, which has historically been very much a part of our system--I \nremember once I talked to a man who was not a citizen of our country, \nbut he invested here. He took his money and invested it in the U.S. \nfinancial system. I said: Why do that? He said: One, you people are a \nstrong economy and you do well. But more importantly is the second \nreason. He said: I have never lost a wink of sleep because I was \ninvesting in an economy or a structure that was unsafe. I may make a \nbad bet and lose because of that, but I have never worried about ever \nlosing a nickel because someone in this country in your financial \nsystem would take advantage of me.\n  A wonderful reputation to have had, and that reputation has been \nshattered, not just for some foreign investor but I think for people \nhere at home. I am not suggesting that by the passage of this bill we \nwill miraculously change all that, but I think it moves us in the right \ndirection.\n  I know my colleagues have a lot of good ideas. Some like what I have \ndone, some don't think I have gone far enough, and some think I have \ngone too far with the bill. But what I have tried to do over the past \nfew months is to put together the best ideas I could and to attract \nbroad support from the 100 of us in the Senate. Ultimately, if I can't \nproduce 60 votes or whatever we have to get these days, no matter how \ngood the ideas are, they will not go anywhere. So I hope my colleagues \nwill read this, and if they have constructive changes to make to the \nbill, I welcome those.\n  I apologize for taking so long on this, and now, if I can, I wish to \nconclude the business of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/30/senate-section/article/S3004-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

MIKE REED\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special tribute to Dr. \nMike Reed, who has been a champion for the University of Nevada, Reno, \nand for the Nevada System of Higher Education throughout his \nprestigious career. After numerous years of enhancing the education of \nhis students, leading UNR's College of Business, and serving the \nState's education system, Dr. Reed is soon to embark on a well-earned \nretirement.\n  Dr. Reed began his journey as a faculty member of the College of \nBusiness Administration at UNR in 1972. In 1993, he became dean, a \nposition which he served faithfully for 13 years. More recently in \n2006, Dr. Reed was named vice chancellor of finance and administration \nfor the Nevada System of Higher Education.\n  In addition to his outstanding career, Dr. Reed has received a \nplethora of awards and accolades in recognition of his hard work and \ndedication to his community. He was recognized as the 1997 Raymond I. \nSmith Civic Leader of the Year Award by the Reno-Sparks Chamber of \nCommerce. In 2005, he was inducted into the Junior Achievement Business \nLeaders Hall of Fame. He has given back to northern Nevada in other \nways, as well. He served as former host of KUNR's bluegrass music \nprogram and remains an active volunteer with the Boys and Girls Club of \nTruckee Meadows. Dr. Reed's significant contribution to that wonderful \norganization for youngsters was very evident when he received their \n``Bigs in Schools'' award in 2006.\n  It is an honor for me today to recognize Dr. Mike Reed and all of his \naccomplishments as an educator in the Silver State. He is a fine \nNevadan, and we are tremendously proud to call him our own. He has left \na lasting legacy on the University of Nevada, Reno Wolf Pack, and the \nNevada System of Higher Education. I sincerely thank Dr. Reed and wish \nhim all the best for a happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/30/senate-section/article/S3004-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3004-S3005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IDAHO'S 2010 WINTER OLYMPICS ATHLETES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Idaho's Winter \nOlympics athletes. Just a few days ago, our country's Olympic champions \nwere at the White House to meet with President Obama, who marked the \ngreat success of the American 2010 Winter Olympic team. The American \nteam made an outstanding showing by winning a record 37 medals, more \nthan any single country ever in the Winter Olympics. With six athletes, \nIdaho's team made an impressive contribution to this performance, even \nadding to the medal count. The Idaho team includes freestyle/aerial \nskier Jeret Peterson, of Boise; Alpine skier Hailey Duke, of Boise; \nBiathlon skier Sara Studebaker, of Boise; cross country skier Morgan \nArritola, of Ketchum; Alpine skier Eric Fisher, of Middleton; and \nsnowboarder Graham Watanabe, of Sun Valley. Jeret Peterson won the \nsilver medal for freestyle skiing/aerials with the successful \ncompletion of his signature move, the ``Hurricane,'' which includes an \namazing three flips and five twists all in a single jump.\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\n  The U.S. Olympic team also includes several other athletes with ties \nto Idaho: freestyle skier Emily Cook, from Massachusetts, who trained \nat Bogus Basin in her youth and is friends with Jeret Peterson; \nFreestyle skier Patrick Deneen, from Washington, who skied at Silver \nMountain near Kellogg in his youth; snowboarder Elena Hight, from \nCalifornia, who lived in Boise when young and learned to snowboard at \nBogus Basin; bobsledder Nick Cunningham, from California, who was a \ntrack star at Boise State University; and snowboarder Nate Holland, \nfrom California, who grew up in Sandpoint, Idaho, where he learned to \nski at Schweitzer Mountain.\n  I offer my sincere and well-deserved congratulations to Idaho's 2010 \nWinter Olympics athletes.

Mr. President, today, during Child Abuse Prevention \nMonth, I wish I wish to recognize Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Fedderson, \nfounders of the nonprofit child abuse prevention group Childhelp, for \nall of their work on behalf of abused and neglected children. For half \na century, these two heroes have spoken up for at-risk children and I \nam grateful for their ceaseless work to create better lives for \nchildren.\n  Sara and Yvonne first started this work 50 years ago as American \nactresses when they had a chance encounter with 11 homeless orphans in \nJapan, while entertaining U.S. troops. Sara and Yvonne tried to place \nthose children in a Japanese orphanage only to discover they were \nunwelcome because of their mixed race heritage. Returning to \nCalifornia, these women founded International Orphans Incorporated, now \nChildhelp, and raised funds that eventually built four orphanages \ncaring for abandoned Japanese-American children as well as Vietnamese \nchildren. Over the years they have worked to create the Childhelp \nHotline, children's advocacy centers, high-quality foster care homes, \nand training around child abuse prevention.\n  In 2008, nearly 800,000 American children were victims of child abuse \nor neglect. Nearly 1,800 of them died as a result. It is our youngest \nchildren who suffer the brunt of the abuse. Four in ten of those \nfatalities were children younger than one year of age and three in four \nfatalities were younger than four. These statistics are overwhelming. \nBut for each individual case, each child who suffers, there is a \nlasting story of pain and loss. Child maltreatment affects the \nemotional and behavioral development of its victims, often for a \nlifetime.\n  Without Childhelp these statistics would be even worse. Childhelp's \nprofessionals and many volunteers focus their efforts on advocacy, \nprevention, treatment, and community outreach. I know my colleagues \njoin with me in congratulating these two amazing women and their life's \nwork in protecting our most valuable resource, our children.\n  Even one case of abuse or neglect is too many. But every child we \nsave from maltreatment is a child who can go on to achieve great \nthings. For half a century, Childhelp has done so much good for so many \nkids. With Sara and Yvonne's tireless devotion to children in need \nthroughout the world, Childhelp is well prepared for another 50 years \nof protecting our children from abuse and neglect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/30/senate-section/article/S3005-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:26 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2499.
