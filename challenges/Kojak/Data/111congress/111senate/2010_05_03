Mr. President, we are deeply concerned about what is \ngoing on in gulf coast right now as this massive oil slick spreads even \nfurther and makes its way toward the coast. The entire Nation is \nbracing itself for the full impact of this disaster, which, as we all \nknow, could get far worse.\n  Our focus at the moment is on stopping the leak and mitigating the \ndamage as quickly as possible, so we will be paying close attention to \nthe administration and to local officials on the ground to assist them \nin those efforts as the oil comes ashore. We are all hoping that the \ncoordinated efforts of local, State, and Federal officials, along with \nBP workers, will prevent a worst-case scenario.\n  No one is ignorant of the impact this spill has already had and could \npotentially have on the environment, the economy of the gulf, or on the \nthousands and thousands of individuals and families whose lives and \nlivelihoods are rooted, in some cases for generations, in the fish and \nwildlife that live in these coastal waters. It is heartbreaking to \nthink of those who live in this region enduring yet another tragedy, \nbut we are inspired by their resilience and by the tireless efforts of \nthose engaged in the repair and recovery efforts.\n  Tragedies like this are a reminder of the dangers so many Americans \nendure every day in the work of keeping America moving, and of the \nfragility of the environment. Our prayers remain with the families of \nthose who were lost in the initial explosion. We will also be keeping \nthe repair and recovery workers in our thoughts as we continue to \nmonitor the situation. Once the flow has been stopped and help is on \nthe way, there will be a full investigation into what went wrong and \nwhat can be done to prevent anything like this from ever happening \nagain.\n  Meanwhile, a potential tragedy appears to have been averted over the \nweekend thanks to the vigilance of ordinary citizens and the quick \nresponse of law enforcement officials in New York City. We were all \nalarmed to learn of the attempted car bombing in Times Square but \nrelieved that it failed to go off.\n  All of this was a vivid reminder of the continual threats to our \nsecurity and of the need to remain vigilant and to never drop our \nguard. New Yorkers responded to this attempted attack just as we would \nexpect them to. Within hours, Times Square was again full of tourists, \nand on Broadway every show went ahead as scheduled on Sunday. So we \napplaud the people of New York and the local and Federal law \nenforcement officials who snapped into gear to disarm the car bomb and \nwho continue to investigate this situation.\n  Here in the Senate, debate continues on the financial regulatory \nbill. I will just note as we continue this debate that a consensus \nseems to be emerging among the experts and the public about two thing. \nFirst, it would be deeply irresponsible to rush a piece of legislation \nthis far-reaching without fully understanding its potential impact on \nordinary Americans who had nothing to do with the financial crisis.\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\n  Second, any bill that comes out of the Senate must actually address \nthe core problems that led to the crisis. This should be obvious, but \nthe fact is, a lot of people are increasingly concerned that this bill \ncould actually miss the mark completely, not just as a result of what \nit does, but as a result of what it fails to do.\n  On example is Federal housing policy, as embodied by the government-\nsponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In my view, it is \nsimply not acceptable for some on the other side to suggest that we \nhave to rush this particular bill through Congress, but that it is OK \nto wait another year to address the GSEs, which we all know played a \ncentral role in the financial crisis.\n  So Republicans will work to make sure this bill actually addresses \nthe problems at hand, and that in an effort to rein in Wall Street, \nthis bill doesn't actually end up hurting those who had nothing to do \nwith this crisis.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 3217, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3217) to promote the financial stability of the \n     United States by improving accountability and transparency in \n     the financial system, to end ``too big to fail,'' to protect \n     the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect \n     consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Dodd/Lincoln) amendment No. 3739, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Reid (for Boxer) amendment No. 3737 (to amendment No. \n     3739), to prohibit taxpayers from ever having to bail out the \n     financial sector.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                          Gulf Coast Disaster\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, before I talk about financial reform, I \ndid want to say a word about the disaster on the gulf coast now and the \noil spillage there. Obviously, all of our hearts go out to the families \nof the 11 workers who lost their lives and to the thousands and \nthousands of employees in the region who are going to lose their jobs \nas this terrible contamination spreads all over the gulf coast.\n  But I hope very much we comprehend, in the midst of the disaster, \nthat when we are dealing with technologies such as offshore drilling \nor, in fact, nuclear energy, we cannot be 99.99 percent successful. \nUnfortunately, as human beings, 100 percent success is a goal we often \ndo not reach. That is why, in my view, as someone who has long opposed \noffshore drilling, I think it is absolutely imperative we understand as \na nation if we move aggressively to energy efficiency, if we move \naggressively to such clean, sustainable energies as wind, solar, \nbiomass, and geothermal, we can, in fact, break our dependence on \nforeign oil and on fossil fuel in general, and we can create millions \nof jobs as we become energy independent without having to deal with the \ncalamities we are experiencing today.\n  Mr. President, either tomorrow or shortly after--I hope tomorrow--I \nwill be offering an amendment which deals with transparency at the Fed. \nI did want to say a few words about that.\n  At a time when many Americans are dispirited by the intensity of the \npartisanship which they see in Congress, this amendment, demanding \ntransparency at the Federal Reserve, does something which is quite \nunusual. It brings together some of the most progressive Members of the \nU.S. Congress--and I consider myself in that fold--with some of the \nmost conservative. It also brings together some of the strongest \ngrassroots progressive organizations in the country with some of the \nmost conservative. So what we are seeing in this amendment is a coming \ntogether of millions of Americans who have very different political \nideologies but who agree it is absolutely imperative we bring \ntransparency to the Fed.\n  This amendment is virtually identical to legislation I have offered \non the subject that now has 33 cosponsors. In order to give an \nindication of the diversity of ideological position, let me read who \nthey are. They are Senators Barrasso, Bennett, Boxer, Brownback, Burr, \nCardin, Chambliss, Coburn, Cochran, Cornyn, Crapo, DeMint, Dorgan, \nFeingold, Graham, Grassley, Harkin, Hatch, Hutchison, Inhofe, Isakson, \nLandrieu, Leahy, Lincoln, McCain, Murkowski, Risch, Sanders, Thune, \nVitter, Webb, Wicker, and Wyden. That is a very broad cross section of \nideological opinion in the Senate.\n  In the House of Representatives, a similar process has taken place, \nand this concept has been cosponsored by 320 Members of Congress. That \nis a lot. That very rarely happens. That legislation was authored by \nRepublican Congressman Ron Paul and Democratic Congressman Alan \nGrayson.\n  The amendment I will be bringing to the floor of the Senate has 15 \ncosponsors--Republicans and Democrats alike--and I very much appreciate \ntheir support. This amendment is simple and it is straightforward. At a \ntime when the Federal Reserve has provided over $2 trillion in zero or \nnear zero interest loans to some of the largest financial institutions \nin this country, this amendment requires the Fed to tell the American \npeople who got the money. I do not think that is a very radical \nconcept.\n  This amendment would simply do two things: No. 1, require the \nnonpartisan GAO, the Government Accountability Office, to conduct an \nindependent and comprehensive audit of the Fed within 1 year; and, \nsecondly, require the Federal Reserve to disclose the names of the \nfinancial institutions that received over $2 trillion in virtually zero \ninterest loans since the start of this recession.\n  In terms of progressive grassroots organizations, this amendment \nenjoys the strong support of Americans for Financial Reform, a \ncoalition of over 250--250--consumer, employee, investor, community, \nand civil rights groups, including the AFL-CIO, which represents \nmillions of American workers, and the AARP, which is the largest senior \ngroup in this country representing tens of millions of seniors. So what \nwe are looking at are grassroots organizations representing a huge part \nof our population that say it is time for transparency at the Fed.\n  There are also many conservative grassroots organizations that are \nsupporting this amendment, including the Campaign for Liberty, the \nRutherford Institute, the Eagle Forum, and many other groups.\n  This amendment is not a radical idea. As part of the budget \nresolution debate in April of 2009, the Senate voted overwhelmingly in \nsupport of this concept by a vote of 59 to 39. That is a strong sign \nthat this Senate wants transparency.\n  In the House of Representatives, this concept passed the House \nFinancial Services Committee by a vote of 43 to 28 and was incorporated \ninto the House version of the Wall Street reform bill that was approved \nby the House last December. So a provision very similar to what I am \noffering is already in the House bill. So we are not talking about some \nkind of fringy idea. It has widespread support in the Senate. It is \nalready, to a significant degree, incorporated into the House bill.\n  This concept has the support of the Speaker of the House, Nancy \nPelosi, who has said Congress should ask the Fed to put this \ninformation ``on the\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\nInternet like they've done with the recovery package and the budget.'' \nIn other words, what she is saying is, if we look at the TARP bailout, \nwe have all the information we want--from who received that money, how \nit was paid back, et cetera, et cetera--it is out there on the Internet \nof the Treasury Department. That is where it should be. We want to \nbring that same type of transparency to the Fed.\n  This concept, interestingly enough, has already been supported by two \nFederal courts--two Federal courts--that have ordered the Fed to \nrelease all of the names and details of the recipients of more than $2 \ntrillion in Federal Reserve loans since the financial crisis started as \na result of the Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Bloomberg \nNews.\n  The Fed has argued in court that it should not have to release this \ninformation, citing, according to Reuters, ``an exemption that it said \nlets federal agencies keep secret various trade secrets and commercial \nor financial information.''\n  However--this is important; this is not Bernie Sanders speaking, but \nthis is a Federal court--the U.S. Appeals Court in New York disagreed \nwith the Fed's assertion. Here is what a unanimous--underline \n``unanimous''--three-judge appeals court panel wrote in their opinion. \nI quote them:\n\n       [T]o give the [Fed] power to deny disclosure because it \n     thinks it best to do so would undermine the basic policy that \n     disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective. If the \n     Board--\n\n  The Fed--\n\n     believes such an exemption would better serve the national \n     interest it should ask Congress to amend the statute.\n\n  That is what a three-judge U.S. appeals court panel unanimously said. \nThis appeals court decision upheld an earlier ruling by the Southern \nFederal District Court of New York that also ordered the Fed to release \nthis information.\n  In other words, we now have 59 Senators, 320 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, and 2 U.S. courts who have all told the Fed, in no \nuncertain terms: Give us transparency. Tell us what happened when you \nput at risk trillions of dollars of taxpayer money.\n  Based on the kind of grassroots support that exists in support of my \namendment, I think the overwhelming majority of the American people \nwant that transparency, and it is our job to give it to them.\n  I do understand this amendment will not be supported by every Member \nof the Senate. Some of them may come up and say: Well, it is not \naccurate, so I want to deal with this right now. They may state that \nthis amendment would take away the independence of the Fed and put \nmonetary policy into the hands of Congress. Every other day, there \ncould be a great debate here about whether we raise interest rates and \nthat we get involved in every detail of monetary policy. That is \nabsolutely not what this amendment does, and the language in the \namendment is very, very clear.\n  This amendment does not take away the court-appointed independence of \nthe Fed, and it does not put monetary policy into the hands of \nCongress. This amendment does not tell the Fed when to cut short-term \ninterest rates or when to raise them. It does not tell the Fed what \nbanks to lend money to and what banks not to lend money to. It does not \ntell the Fed which foreign central banks they can do business with and \nwhich ones they cannot do business with. It does not impose any new \nregulations on the Fed, nor does it take any regulatory authority away \nfrom the Fed. In fact, the amendment prohibits Congress and the GAO \nfrom interfering with or dictating the monetary policy decisionmaking \nat the Fed. We are very clear about this in the amendment. This \namendment simply requires the GAO to conduct an independent audit of \nthe Fed and requires the Fed to release the names of the recipients of \nmore than $2 trillion in taxpayer-backed assistance.\n  There is a lot more to say, and I look forward to saying it when the \namendment gets to the floor. Let me conclude by saying this: I don't \nremember the exact date--perhaps a year or so ago--when, as a member of \nthe Budget Committee, we were addressed by Ben Bernanke, the Chairman \nof the Fed. When he came before the committee, I asked Mr. Bernanke if \nhe would release the names of the financial institutions that received \ntrillions of dollars on near zero interest loans. He said he would not \ndo that. On that day, I introduced the legislation which now has 33 \ncosponsors.\n  So I look forward to hopefully tomorrow bringing this amendment to \nthe floor. I am proud of the kind of tripartisan support we have \ngotten. I am proud of the fact that we have people from every \nconceivable ideology who are fighting for transparency, and I hope we \ncan win this amendment and let the American people get an understanding \nof who received trillions of dollars of their money during the bailout \nperiod.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me address the amendment which we are \ngoing to be taking up first, I gather, on the so-called financial \nregulatory reform bill, the Boxer amendment.\n  The Boxer amendment, as I understand it, is a declarative statement \nthat taxpayers will not be responsible for any Wall Street bailouts. My \nunderstanding is that it is not a provision that would enforce itself \nor would in any way be enforceable in the legislation, but it certainly \nexpresses a sentiment I assume every Senator would share. The problem, \nhowever, is not just the fact that we are concerned that taxpayers will \nbe responsible for bailouts but the fact that bailouts will exist in \nany event and how that might affect people who have invested in or lent \nto an institution, what authority it would give the U.S. Government, \nand whether such a provision would apply as well to perhaps the biggest \nmiscreants here: Fannie and Freddie, the two government-sponsored \nenterprises that hold the vast majority of the mortgages that are \nunsound or on less than strong financial footing--I will put it that \nway. So the question is not so much whether taxpayers' dollars will be \nused--though this amendment, while expressing a good sentiment, doesn't \noperatively prevent that--but just as much whether Wall Street will \nstill be bailed out but in a different way. Will the appropriate \npolicies and institutions that should be in place to prevent this be \namended into the legislation?\n  If all we want to do is ensure failing institutions are liquidated, \nthen of course we can have a bankruptcy regime, and many people believe \nthat is the appropriate regime because it is a tradition of law. \nEveryone knows exactly how it works, where you stand, and it ordinarily \nhas been successful in liquidating firms that cannot pay their \nobligations.\n  After the Lehman bankruptcy and the contagion effects which \nsurrounded that, some believe bankruptcy wasn't really well suited to \nthese kinds of large financial institutions, and it may well be that \ntraditional bankruptcy would have to be modified in some respects in \norder to easily apply to the liquidation of a financial institution \nthat large.\n  One of the things, though, we need to do in figuring out exactly what \nthe right process should be is to make sure creditors aren't receiving \nspecial treatment--for example, the way they did when the auto \ncompanies were bailed out and when other firms were bailed out. \nOtherwise, we will actually be increasing moral hazard rather than \ndecreasing it, which is, of course, part of the exercise here.\n  A government-compelled fund that takes money from successful firms \nand transfers it to a failed firm, for example, regardless of how you \nseek to justify it--as an assessment or a recruitment or a tax or \nwhatever you might call it--is still a bailout. Ultimately, the \nquestion is not only who will pay for it but also, how does it scramble \nthe obligations and the prioritization of obligations compared to what \nbankruptcy would do?\n  The people who bear the cost of propping up a failed firm, for \nexample, have nothing to do with the fact that firm failed or with the \npoor decisions of that\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\nfirm. So if, instead of the American people, you are going to make \nother entities in its area--for example, a bank begins to fail, so you \nare going to make the other banks prop that bank back up. How is that \nfair to the shareholders or investors in the bank that has to do the \npropping up, or the groups of banks? They didn't have anything to do \nwith the poor decisions made by the management of the failed firm, \nwhereas you can argue that the lenders to the failed firm, the people \nwho invested in the failed firm, and certainly the managers of the \nfailed firm all had something to do with the direction the failed firm \ntook. Because of that fact, the bankruptcy laws have set out priorities \nas to who ends up bearing the risk of the failure of that firm. The \nlenders and the investors in failing companies lose control of the \nmoney they invested, and whatever resources remain are channeled by the \nbankruptcy court into productive endeavors or to pay the people who \nhave lent the money to the firm. That is exactly the opposite of what a \ngovernment-sponsored fund does in transferring resources from a \nproductive to unproductive purpose. Here, if it is not the taxpayers \nwho fund it, then it is fellow banks, let's say, or fellow financial \ninstitutions--again, people who had nothing to do with the failure of \nthe entity that is being acted upon.\n  Fortunately, there is a process that can address the problem of \nfailing firms, that does move resources into more productive areas and \nat the same time holds those directly responsible for the mistakes \naccountable. There are different names for this and it can take \ndifferent forms. One of them is called speed bankruptcy--in other \nwords, a form of bankruptcy that recognizes that in certain \ninstitutions you are going to need to quickly take hold of them and, in \norder to prevent contagion in the market, shore up their financial \nsituation so they cannot infect others and therefore cause a larger \nfailure than just relates to that particular company.\n\n  We should describe bankruptcy, first of all, to appreciate what this \ndoes. A firm becomes insolvent when its liabilities--which could be \npayments to bondholders, it could be payments to suppliers, it could be \nrepaying loans--are worth more than the assets the company has, assets \nsuch as land, capital, accounts, the value of intangibles, and even \nthings like reputation.\n  Over the last couple of years, we have seen the collapse or near \ncollapse of several well-known firms--for example, the GM and Chrysler \nauto companies, as I mentioned, Bear Stearns, AIG, the big insurance \ncompanies. We have also seen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are \nprojected to be dependent on government assistance for the foreseeable \nfuture--and by government assistance, of course, ultimately we mean the \ntaxpayers of this country. In the examples I cited above, the \ngovernment response was in effect to prop up the failed firm with \ntaxpayer funds.\n  This so-called speed bankruptcy and iterations of the idea would \ninstead convert a portion of the existing longer term debt of the \ncompany into equity. There are a lot of benefits, as you can see, to \nsuch a proposal. For example, with a large, complex firm that is in \nfinancial trouble, a lengthy process could create the kind of \nuncertainty that would otherwise undermine the ability of the company \nto continue once it exits the resolution process and, as I said, could \nalso infect others in these areas. A speed bankruptcy, on the other \nhand, would permit the firm to remain in operation, to keep running.\n  There is a paper that has been written on this that I think is very \ninteresting. Garret Jones at the George Mason University Mercatus \nCenter writes that this kind of proposal actually leaves bondholders \nwith something of value so they are not entirely wiped out and retain \nthe potential to make up for some of their losses if the equity shares \nthey receive in lieu of their bonds once again gain value. Here is what \nhe writes in this recent paper:\n\n       Friday's bondholders become Monday's new shareholders, and \n     the banking conglomerate can continue borrowing and lending \n     much as before, with little possibility of a short-run \n     crisis.\n\n  It is a little bit like debt or possession financing in a bankruptcy, \nbut it matters where you get the financing, and in this case creditors \nof one kind become creditors of a different kind, trading, in this \ncase, bond for equity in the firm.\n  Second, unlike government-sponsored bailouts, investors directly tied \nto the troubled firm bear the financial costs of the restructuring of \nthe firm.\n  Third, since many of the bonds are publicly traded and are therefore \nliquid, the process would be entirely transparent, and the reason the \nprocess could occur so quickly is because of that conversion.\n  Fourth, a debt-to-equity conversion leaves deposits untouched, \navoiding a potential run on the bank in the case of banks and financial \ninstitutions.\n  What steps and operations would be necessary to make this work?\n  First, an insolvent firm would be able to convert an amount of its \nlong-term debt specified in advance into stock in order to recapitalize \nand strengthen the institution. Under such a proposal, regulators would \nfirst need to declare that the institution is the risk.\n  Second, the firm would need to breach a certain specified capital \nlevel to actually trigger the conversion. Once this process occurred, \nthe restructured firm would emerge healthier, with less debt, with more \nequity, without any taxpayer money being used and without any money \nbeing used from other banks or other financial institutions.\n  For example, Pershing Square Capital Management released a proposal \nto convert $75 billion of Fannie Mae's $750 billion senior unsecured \ndebt into equity. For every dollar of senior unsecured debt, the \nbondholder would receive 90 cents in new senior unsecured debt and 10 \ncents in value of new, common equity. As a result, the new Fannie could \ntake advantage of its new capital. It has a dollar to expand its \nunderwriting. It can utilize increased cash flow to absorb expected \nlosses and, in the future, once conditions improve, to reduce its \nbalance sheet by gradually selling some of the mortgage assets on its \nbooks.\n  John B. Taylor writes today in the Wall Street Journal how to avoid a \nbailout bill:\n\n       You do not prevent bailouts by giving the government more \n     power to intervene in a discretionary manner. You prevent \n     bailouts by . . . making it possible for failing firms to go \n     through bankruptcy without causing disruption to the \n     financial system and the economy.\n\n  Here is the summary of what I am saying. Most of us here do not want \nto see taxpayer bailouts of these firms that have made poor management \ndecisions, have invested poorly, and have made mistakes for which \ntaxpayers should not be responsible.\n  That is the genesis of the Boxer amendment. But for the Boxer \namendment to be effective, two things will have to be done, and perhaps \nwe will have suggestions on how to change it. It would have to be \noperational and enforceable. As I said, the amendment is oratory \nlanguage--taxpayer funds should not be used for bailouts. We know that \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution is nothing more than that, a sense of \nthe Senate. It needs to have operational and enforcement language to \nhave meaning. It is my understanding that this language doesn't.\n  Second, the real question is whether instead of a bailout, where \ngovernment--I don't want to use the word bureaucrats--officials \nrepresenting the U.S. Government in one, two, or three different \nentities could, on their own, with little direction in congressional \nlegislation, determine that a firm now needs to be taken over or bailed \nout, and without very much legislative criteria to direct them as to \nhow to do it, or the circumstances under which it should be done, could \nbegin to unwind that firm, using taxpayer money that is later recouped \nor perhaps funding from a tax or an assessment on other banks, for \nexample, to infuse capital to keep it from going out of business. This \nis a way in which bankruptcy would ordinarily work, except that \nbankruptcy works according to a set of rules and traditions that have \nbeen developed over a couple hundred years that everybody is familiar \nwith, and which people took into account before they made investments \nin or lent money to a company in the first place. If they became a \nbondholder, they knew where the bondholders would be in the order of \npriority in the case of a bankruptcy. If it is secured, they would have \none level of security, and if it is unsecured, they are going to be at \nthe bottom of\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\nthe totem pole when it comes to distributing the assets of the \nbankruptcy. Lending is predicated upon their understanding of these \nwell-known rules and principles.\n  Moreover, they understand that a judge will be in charge, and he will \nput people under oath and cause them to testify so that you know \nexactly what the assets are, and you can understand what it would take \nto keep the company running or, in the event it does have to be \nliquidated, how the funds would be disbursed. A trustee is appointed, \nwho has a fiduciary responsibility, under the court rules, to manage \nhow the company comes out of bankruptcy, or to ensure that the rules of \nbankruptcy and the judgment are carried out. That is the way a \nbankruptcy works. It is a proper way to unwind or liquidate most \nbusinesses in this country.\n  I think those who say these financial institutions are different, we \nneed a different set of rules, first, have an obligation to tell us \nwhy. What is different about these entities that the bankruptcy laws \nsimply don't work? What would cause them to have a different set of \ntreatments? If there are some things--and I can think of a couple \nthings that distinguish them--then how can we modify the bankruptcy \nrules in effect to take into account those differences? One deficit, \none could posit, is the fact that a large financial firm could easily \nhave an effect on others invested in or who they invest in and, \ntherefore, in effect cause a domino effect in markets. That could \nhappen very quickly. Therefore, when you see signs of a problem, you \nneed to deal with that very quickly. That is where this idea of \nbankruptcy comes from. It doesn't take a government bureaucrat or a \ngovernment entity set up for this purpose to figure out that is what \nneeds to be done and how to do it. It can be done within the context of \nbankruptcy today or with relatively modest modifications in the \nBankruptcy Code, we could make those changes.\n  The fear a lot of us have is that the people who are not elected or \nconstrained by any particular power, except the limitations Congress \nimposes upon them--and in this bill those limitations are very \ngeneral--those people could make decisions and put somebody into this \nprocess to decide who gets paid how much, without any reference \nnecessarily, for example, to the Bankruptcy Code, who gets privileged \nand who isn't, and with whose money.\n  If you look at the example of the two auto companies, you find that \nlabor unions were substantially privileged to the exclusion of other \ninvestors. A lot of people thought this was wrong. It was contrary to \nthe way it would have evolved had they been in bankruptcy court. So \nwhat most folks would like to see is a process you can count on, that \nyou have rules of law established over time in the bankruptcy law that \nenable you to rely upon them, and not some unspecified, unclear process \nthat is run by some agency of the U.S. Government. While it is \ncertainly a step forward to say that taxpayers should not be on the \nhook for this, it is not enough to say that, A, because that is not \noperational or enforced, but, B, because there are other ways to do it \nthat represent a closer adherence to the rule of law that would be \nbetter at promoting investment or lending in the first instance, \nbecause of the clarity and predictability of the way the situation \nwould be treated in the event of a bankruptcy; and finally, that people \nwho are not responsible for the bad management decisions would not have \nany liability when that company is liquidated or comes out of \nbankruptcy operating again. Rather, the people who had been involved in \nthe company in the first instance would bear that obligation.\n  This is just one idea--one of many--as an alternative to the specific \nprovisions in the legislation. It is my hope that as we continue debate \nabout this portion of the bill, we can come together on a set of \nprinciples that would adhere more closely to the rule of law \nestablished in the Bankruptcy Code to the concept that those \nresponsible should be the ones who end up bearing the burden and that, \nin any event, as it appears most of us would agree, taxpayers should \nnot be responsible for the decisions made by the management of a \nfailing firm.\n  I wonder whether my colleagues want to speak. If not, I will suggest \nthe absence of a quorum. The Senator from Illinois wishes to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me basically set the stage on what we \nare doing in the Senate today and why it is so important.\n  This bill, which Senator Dodd of Connecticut has worked on for months \nwith his staff--1,407 pages--is basically a bill that has been designed \nto create financial stability in the United States. Even with this \ngreat economy we have and all of the financial institutions and \nbusinesses notwithstanding, this recession has brought us economic pain \nthat many of us have never seen in our lifetimes and only remember \nvaguely from our parents and grandparents describing the Great \nDepression.\n  What Senator Dodd and the Banking Committee set out to do was to \nbasically change the law to establish more oversight of financial \ninstitutions to make sure we never get into this mess again. It took \nquite a few pages to do it. This week, we start considering amendments \nto the bill, efforts to improve it, change it, and delete sections. It \nis the Senate in its historic role as a deliberative body.\n  Today, there are no votes and that is why there are few Members on \nthe floor. Amendments will be offered and the votes will start maybe as \nsoon as tomorrow if Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby can reach an \nagreement. It is worth a moment's reflection to understand why we are \nhere with a bill of this importance and magnitude, which may take a \nweek or more--probably more--before it is completed. The Pew Financial \nReform Project recently summarized what we have been through in this \nrecession. It is a painful reminder, but it is worth noting as we start \nthis debate. This is what they estimate to be the devastation caused by \nthe recession we are in: $100,000, the cost to the typical American \nfamily in combined losses from declining stock and home values; $360 \nbillion, the estimated loss in wages due to slow economic growth, in \nOctober 2008 through 2009, and that is a loss in wages of over $3,250 \nfor the average U.S. family because of the recession; $3.4 trillion, \nthe total loss in real estate wealth from July 2008 until March 2009, \nso roughly, on average, every household in America who owns a home lost \n$30,300 in value; 5.5 million, the number of additional jobs lost due \nto slow economic growth, and some 8 million Americans are unemployed, \nand another 6 million are discouraged and not looking for work; \n500,000, additional number of homes foreclosed upon during the most \nacute phase of the crisis; $7.4 trillion, total loss in stock wealth \nfrom July 2008 through March 2009. That is more than $66,000 per \nhousehold, and it was usually felt in retirement accounts and savings \naccounts of families all across America.\n\n  These are indications of what we have been through and, to some \nextent, are still going through. We are emerging from this recession, \nbut it was a devastating loss to families and businesses across \nAmerica, and a loss many are still trying to recover from. Senator Dodd \ntook on the unenviable task of looking at the laws we have on the books \nand asking: How can we strengthen them to avoid this from happening \nagain?\n  Of course, there are several things that stand out. Why did the \nUnited States get in the business of stepping up and saying we are \ngoing to take taxpayer dollars to save private businesses? That is what \nwe did. AIG, the largest insurance company in the world--initially, the \nFederal Reserve came in with some $85 billion when they were about to \nfail. If I am not mistaken, over the course of time, they added another \n$100 billion given to this one entity to keep it afloat. Why? Because \nthey had basically guaranteed with insurance policies business \ncontracts at every level in the American economy, and they were about \nto fail. They didn't keep an adequate reserve. So as these contracts \nstarted to fail, this insurance company couldn't pay off its promise. \nThe feeling was that the whole economy would collapse on itself if we \ndidn't prop up AIG to keep it in business.\n  The same was true for major financial institutions--institutions that\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\ndreamed up securities which had never existed before. They decided to \nstart packaging mortgages. So the mortgage I entered into in \nSpringfield, IL, with my local bank could have been sold off to another \nbank, and then to some other financial institution, and then chopped \nand diced into pieces, those pieces each going to a separate security; \nand people were investing in them, guessing whether my wife and I were \ngoing to make our mortgage payments.\n  As they went along, these rating agencies that are supposed to look \nat these securities and decide whether they are good or bad were giving \nthem sky-high AAA ratings, as good as a government security. Why? \nBecause there weren't many defaults in real estate mortgages and, \nhistorically, real estate values went up. So they said this is a safe \ninvestment. Meanwhile, there were people looking at derivatives, saying \nwe think this may be too optimistic, and we think maybe people are \nbeing loaned money for mortgages who might not be able to pay.\n  As we got into it deeper, that is exactly what happened. Banks and \nfinancial institutions were offering mortgages to people under no-doc \nloans, no document loans, which basically meant if you said, I am \nmaking $100,000 and my wife is making $100,000 and we have maybe \n$50,000 in debt, they would say: That is all we need to know; let's go \nto closing.\n  But where were the income tax returns and the documents to prove it? \nThey weren't worried about that because they would get the mortgage and \nquickly sell it off to somebody else. That created this house of cards \nthat eventually tumbled.\n  What Senator Dodd and the Banking Committee are trying to do is make \nsure we never get in the position where American taxpayers never have \nto be called on to prop up banks, financial institutions, and insurance \ncompanies which, if they failed, would bring down the economy.\n  The first amendment we have is from Senator Boxer of California. It \nhas been referred to by the minority whip, Senator Kyl, in his opening \nremarks. He referred to it and described it as kind of a sense-of-the-\nSenate offering. For those not familiar with how the Senate works, at \nthe end of the day, we have a long list of resolutions that we offer \nfor winning basketball teams and for national dairy ice cream dairy \nmonth, and fair play for Paraguay, and all sorts of things. These are \nsense-of-the-Senate resolutions, where we express our warm feelings for \nthe good things happening in this country.\n  This offering by Senator Boxer is not a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. It is an amendment to the bill. It is so short and direct \nthat I want to read it. It consists of three sentences. Listen to them \nin clear, plain English, and you will understand why Senator Boxer's \namendment is the right one for us to start with:\n  First:\n\n       All financial companies put into receivership under this \n     title shall be liquidated. No taxpayer funds shall be used to \n     prevent the liquidation of any financial company under this \n     title.\n\n  Second paragraph:\n\n       All funds expended in the liquidation of a financial \n     company under this title shall be recovered from the \n     disposition of assets of such financial company, or shall be \n     the responsibility of the financial sector, through \n     assessments.\n\n  Third:\n\n       Taxpayers shall bear no losses from the exercise of any \n     authority under this title.\n\n  This is not a greeting card. This would be a law with teeth \nprohibiting the taxpayers of America from ever being left holding the \nbag again when a bank makes stupid decisions and faces liquidation. \nThat is not a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It would be a law and \nshould be the first thing we pass.\n  Senator Boxer listened to the debate back and forth about taxpayer \nbailout. She said to me and others: I am going to make this clear. I am \ngoing to put it in as clear language as I can think of to make sure \nthat at the end of the day, we never go through this again. Her \nleadership on this amendment--it is right to be the first subject to be \nbrought up. Those on the other side who dismiss this as not being \npowerful enough need to take the 2 or 3 minutes it would take to read \nit. If they read it, they will understand it is powerful, direct, and \nunderstandable language that says we are never going to let the \ntaxpayers face this kind of obligation.\n  It is not the only provision in this bill. There are many others that \nhave been worked on for a long time. Senator Dodd negotiated with the \nother side literally for months trying to reach a bipartisan agreement. \nI know he tried. He tried hard with Senator Shelby, the ranking \nRepublican, with Senator Corker, a member of the committee, also a \nRepublican. At a committee hearing he held, the Republicans offered 400 \namendments, something of that nature. When the time came to call the \namendments so there would be an open debate and the bill could be \nchanged one way or the other, they made a decision not to call any \namendments, not to offer any changes to the bill.\n  I say on behalf of Senator Dodd, he has shown a good-faith effort to \ntry to make this a strong bipartisan effort. It is not too late. As we \nstart the debate this week, we have a chance to reach, I hope, some \nagreement and make this a strong bipartisan bill at the end.\n  But when I listen to Senator Kyl of Arizona talking about the goals \nof this bill and what we want to achieve, I am worried. You see, the \nRepublicans issued their summary of their substitute bill, the bill \nthey want to offer to replace this bill. Within that summary, there is \none thing that stands out: There is not a single provision in the Dodd \nbill which the Republican substitute would strengthen. There is no \nlanguage we could find in their summary where they say: We are going to \nmake sure we protect families and businesses and consumers more. Each \nand every section of their substitute weakens this bill, strengthens \nthe banks, and removes the oversight and transparency requirements in \nso many different areas.\n  When we take a look at the powers that the Dodd bill provides to the \nFederal Reserve, unfortunately this Republican substitute does not even \ngive those same powers so that the Federal Reserve which could require, \nfor example, more leverage requirements so that a bank would have more \nmoney in the bank to back up investments they would make, liquidity \nrequirements, those are all weakened by the Republican substitute. Time \nand again their approach to this bill to avoid an economic disaster is \nto water it down.\n  Last week, they had a different strategy. The strategy was a \nfilibuster strategy to stop us from even coming to this bill. When they \ncould not sink the bill, they decided they would let us move forward \nand try to water it down. I don't think that is a move in the right \ndirection for the American economy. I hope we will stand against \namendments which weaken this bill.\n  It is estimated that the financial industry is spending over $100,000 \na day in Washington on lobbyists who are trying to get us to weaken or \ndefeat this bill. One may not see them as one walks around Capitol \nHill. Believe me, they are busy at work--on the telephones and visiting \nthe offices--asking Members to weaken this bill.\n  I hope we have the fortitude to say no because this is something that \nneeds to be done. This bill needs to be passed. If anything, we need to \nstrengthen provisions of it.\n  There is one section that means a lot to me on consumer financial \nprotection. I offered a separate bill on the subject before it came up. \nHistorically, we gave consumer financial protection to a lot of \ndifferent agencies. Sadly, none of them took it too seriously.\n  I can recall when the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, \nwas up for reconfirmation just a few months ago. I talked with him in \nmy office. He said: Over the years, the Federal Reserve was given \npowers to protect consumers. He said: What happened was we never used \nthem. Recently we have started to, but historically we did not use this \nauthority.\n  We had a situation that when it came to the safety and soundness of \nbanks, they were doing their job, trying to make sure the banks had \nenough in reserve, that their practices were meeting the law. But when \nit came to protecting the people, the customers of the banks, they did \nnot really apply themselves to that situation. That was repeated in \nseveral other agencies.\n  What Senator Dodd has done is to create the strongest consumer \nfinancial protection law in the history of the United States of \nAmerica. He is not\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\ncreating a massive bureaucracy as his critics say. Rather, he is saying \nwe will have one agency with its own funding and its own authority \nwhich will be able to look at legal documents that Americans, families, \nand businesses deal with every day to protect us from the tricks and \ntraps into which we can run.\n  There will be more complete disclosure when it comes to signing an \nimportant document--such as a mortgage, credit card agreement, a \nstudent loan, an automobile loan, a retirement plan--so that \nindividuals will be empowered across America to look at the facts and \nmake the choice that is best for them.\n  We are not going to create any kind of guardian angel society. People \nmay still make a bad decision, but they will do it with their eyes wide \nopen instead of being lured into a document which has a secret clause \nthat ends up exploding and hurting them financially.\n  It happened not that long ago. My colleagues may remember if any of \nthem have been to real estate closings, sitting down in that bank \noffice at a table with your spouse, with two ballpoint pens in hand as \nthey turned the corners of the documents and you signed away for about \n20 or 25 minutes. About halfway through you say: What is this again? \nOh, don't worry, it is standard boilerplate, just required by the \ngovernment; been through it all; done it a thousand times. Off you go.\n  At the end, you put the ballpoint pen down, stand up, shake hands, \nhand a check, get the keys, go to the new house. But you never know \nuntil a later time whether there is a clause or provision in one of \nthose agreements that can come back to haunt you. Let me give an \nillustration.\n  In the days of subprime mortgages, people used to be lured in to take \na mortgage on a house because the payments were so low: In the first \ncouple of years you mean my monthly payment is going to be half of what \nI was paying, and I can have this big house? It's a deal. In the third \nyear, there is going to be a change, but the home is going to go up in \nvalue. And off you go and sign up.\n  Some people did not seriously take into consideration that things \nmight go bad for them personally, such as losing a job or the value of \nthe home may not go up as promised or the interest rate may go sky high \nand they cannot handle it.\n  In the early mortgages, they had a prepayment penalty. That one \nclause, that one sentence meant those people at that moment in time \nwould face the worst economic situation of their lives because instead \nof being able to renegotiate a different mortgage with a different bank \nwith affordable terms, there was a penalty built into their original \nmortgage that cost them tens of thousands of dollars they could not \npay, and they ended up in foreclosure and ended up losing their homes \nand lost their downpayments. Many of them lost their life savings \nbecause of one sentence in that stack of closing documents.\n  The purpose of this consumer financial protection agency is to make \nsure we shine a light on those provisions so that people know when they \nmake a decision what that decision means.\n\n  Now come the Republicans, and they have come up with a substitute, at \nleast their leadership has. I don't know if it speaks to all the \nRepublicans. They may not agree with it.\n  In their summary, it appears they start carving out different groups \nthat will not be covered by consumer financial protection. We have them \nin my hometown of Springfield, IL, and you may have them in yours too. \nThese pay-day loans, title loans, where you come in and hand the title \nof your car over and they give you a basic loan and say: We are not \ngoing to take your car away.\n  The next thing you know, interest rates are going up, you refinance \nthe loan, and pretty soon you may lose your car. It appears in the \nRepublican substitute those folks in their business ventures should not \nbe covered by the Financial Consumer Protection Act. Go figure. Some of \nthe shabbiest credit operations in America are going to be exempt under \nthe Republican approach to this bill. I don't think it makes much \nsense.\n  They also, when it comes to check cashers, currency exchanges, debt \ncollectors, some of the used car dealers, start cutting out exemptions, \nthese lobbyist loopholes that are carving out different financial \ninstitutions which will not be subject to this kind of consumer \nprotection.\n  That is a step in the wrong direction. We ought to make sure \neverybody is onboard. Groups have come to me from Illinois and said: \nCould you just acknowledge the fact that our operation has been clean, \neverybody loves us, we are good neighbors? No, everybody should play by \nthe same basic rules of disclosure and honesty. Good businesses can \nlive with that standard. Those that are not so good, maybe they should \nnot be in business.\n  When it comes to the attorneys general in the States across America, \nthe Republican substitute says they cannot enforce the provisions we \nare putting in here. That is a step in the wrong direction. That \nweakens this good bill. I hope we do not succumb to that proposal.\n  There are a number of other things in here. I will not go through it \nin detail. One of the staff refers to it as a ``term paper.'' It goes \non page after page summarizing what the Republican substitute will do.\n  It basically weakens the credit rating agencies I mentioned earlier. \nRemember the ones that gave AAA ratings to bad securities? Senator Dodd \nstarts addressing these with review of their practices, and the \nRepublican substitute weakens that. How can that be any good, to weaken \nthat after the experience we have been through?\n  That is the debate we are going to face. I hope my colleagues, during \nthe course of this week, will have the opportunity to take this good \nbill, this strong bill, and make it stronger. I will offer a few \namendments along those lines. If those on the other side of the aisle \nwant to join in that effort, I welcome them to see what they have to \noffer. But if those who come to the floor to offer amendments to weaken \nthis bill, to weaken the oversight, to have less transparency and less \nsecurity, they are virtually eliminating a cop on the beat that we need \non Wall Street to make sure we never, ever experience the kind of \neconomic crisis we are currently experiencing across America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, I thank our colleague from Illinois \nfor his predictable eloquence. He is not a member of the Banking \nCommittee, but I began to think he was listening to him talk. He has a \nwonderful awareness and knowledge of the legislation, and I appreciate \nthat very much. It is a complicated area of law. The fact that he has \nspent as much time analyzing what is in the bill and the important work \nthat has been done over the many months we have been involved in this \ndebate is something I appreciate very much. I thank him.\n  I know my friend from Kentucky is here as well. I will not take long, \nI say to Senator Bunning.\n  I am one who is supportive of the Boxer amendment. It is \nstraightforward. The Senator from Illinois read the amendment. What I \nthink is important is in the very first line it says, ``At the end of \ntitle II, add the following.'' That is the resolution title.\n  As the Senator from Illinois said, this is not a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. Title II of the resolution title is a title the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Warner of Virginia, and Senator Corker of Tennessee \nwere the principal authors of on a bipartisan basis in November or \nDecember. I asked a number of my colleagues if they were interested in \nworking on various sections of the bill. Senator Warner and Senator \nCorker had a strong interest in the resolution sections of title I and \ntitle II of the proposed legislation, the too-big-to-fail concept, \nsomething which I believe every Member of this Chamber endorses.\n  None of us wants to ever again be put in the situation that unfolded \nin the fall of 2008 when we saw a check for $700 billion being written \nout to stabilize a number of large financial institutions in the \ncountry.\n  The good news is that at the end of all of that, we are getting money \nback. But, obviously, it was traumatic to go through all of that, to \nwatch institutions that should have been far more cognizant of the \ndifficulty they were getting into, and when they got into deep trouble, \nin order to stabilize the\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\neconomy or have what the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the \nSecretary of the Treasury warned that had we not stepped in could have \ncaused the entire financial system of this country of ours to melt \ndown, to use their words exactly, in the fall of the 2008. All of us \nhere collectively started with how do we write a piece of legislation \nthat would minimize the events that unfolded over the last several \nyears.\n  Once again, the statistics get repeated frequently on this floor, but \nthey are deserving of being repeated. Mr. President, 8.5 million jobs \nhave been lost, 7 million homes went into foreclosure, a 20-percent \ndecline in retirement incomes, a 30-percent decline in home values, the \n$11 trillion to $13 trillion--that is with a ``T,'' trillion dollars--\nin loss of household wealth. Senator Durbin enumerated a number of \nthose statistics more on an individual basis or a family basis.\n\n  So we are determined, as we begin this process, that we begin with \ntitles I and II. The titles of the bill don't always reflect \npriorities, but in this case they do. There is nothing more important \nwe do in this bill than to end the too-big-to-fail concept--the notion \nthere is an implicit guarantee that if you get in trouble as a \nfinancial institution, whatever it may be, that the Federal Government \nwill bail you out when that happens. So we have worked very hard, over \nmany months, to craft the language that will actually bring us to that \nconclusion; in the rare case, resolution; in most cases, bankruptcy or \nreceivership, where management gets fired under our legislation or \nwhere creditors lose, shareholders lose their market value or the value \nof their shares, there is a tremendous decline there. This is a very \npainful process to go through but a necessary one.\n  What Senator Boxer has crafted is merely, in a sense, restating what \nwe have in the legislation, in title I and title II, but to make it \nmore clear and more emphatic, using all the tools we have written--and \nthat is a significant section of this bill--with a tremendous amount of \ninput from people whose knowledge and background in this area was \ncritically important.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, because our colleague from Arizona is correct, \nthere were issues involving bankruptcy that we had to work on in this \nlegislation. With the cooperation of the Judiciary Committee as well, \nwe were able to fashion what we have in this bill to end too big to \nfail. Senator Boxer's amendment emphasizes that point.\n  When she says in her amendment, very clearly, that all financial \ncompanies put into receivership--which is what the language of titles I \nand II does--under this title shall be liquidated. Shall be liquidated. \nNot maybe or we hope you are or wouldn't it be a nice thing if you were \nbut you shall be liquidated. What words do my friends not understand in \nthat sentence?\n  No taxpayer funds. The second sentence. No taxpayer funds shall--\nagain, for those who know the English language, that is not may--be \nused to prevent the liquidation of any financial company under this \ntitle. I don't know how much more clear you can be. Again, I commend \nher for the language because I think it is the kind of language that \nanyone ought to be able to understand.\n  All funds expended in the liquidation of a financial company under \nthis title shall be recovered from the disposition of assets of such \nfinancial company or shall be the responsibility of the financial \nsector through assessments. In other words, they shall pay, not the \ntaxpayers. Again, I don't know how much more clearly you could write \nthe language.\n  What we did through page after page and chapter after chapter and \ntitle after title, if you will, was to legally tell you how we do this. \nBut Senator Boxer has then put an exclamation point on it by telling \nyou this is what all this means, in case anyone fails to understand it.\n  Then, in the third sentence, taxpayers shall--again--bear no losses \nfrom the exercise of any authority under this title of the bill.\n  So I applaud and thank my colleague from California for the language. \nAgain, we think we have done it. But, look, anyone who tells you they \nhave written the perfect bill, be careful of them. I have been around \nhere long enough to know there is no such thing as the perfect bill. \nSenator Shelby, my partner, the ranking Republican and the former \nchairman of the committee, and I are working on additional language \nthat some have raised as a way to tighten this down even further, \nshould there be any doubts. My hope is, shortly, maybe even as early as \ntomorrow, we will be able to present a united front on how we do that \nto further allay the fears some have that titles I and II don't quite \ncomplete what they were designed toward achieving in this legislation. \nSo I look forward to that.\n  I am a supporter of the Boxer amendment when it comes up. The other \nparts of this bill, again, we have talked a lot about. Senator Kyl \ntalked about various other ways of dealing with bankruptcy. He is \ncorrect; it is complicated. It is not a straight, normal bankruptcy \nbecause there are counterparties; that is, other people, other \ninstitutions that may be in very good shape, not in danger at all of \ncoming undone, that could be adversely affected by the financial \ncollapse of another firm. So we want to be careful, as we begin that \nprocess of liquidation, that we don't put the country at greater risk \nthan would be the case with the single company or the single \ninstitution going into receivership.\n  So there are aspects that have required a very thoughtful process \nand, again, the Presiding Officer--and I commend him for it--along with \nSenator Corker and others, has been very involved and has been able to \nwork on it over these many months. This is not a bill that was drafted \nover the weekend or in a few days. There has been a tremendous amount \nof work that has gone into it. Again, my hope is, as we gather in the \ncoming days on this bill, that we will be talking about what is in this \nbill and how it works, rather than people listening to some talking \npoints out of a political document about what they hope might be or \nmight not be in the bill in order to arrive at some political judgment. \nThis issue is far too serious. If we fail in this effort over the \ncoming days, then we will leave this country of ours so exposed to the \nexact situation we saw in the fall of 2008.\n  We know in the world in which we live today, it isn't just a matter \nof what happens in our own country--all the headlines we have read \nabout now over the last several weeks of a small country in the \nMediterranean--Greece--going through great economic difficult has all \nof a sudden put Europe at risk financially. The Euro has declined in \nvalue, the debt instruments have lost their value. Now the IMF has \njumped in, and the Europeans apparently may have jumped in, but let it \nbe a warning to people that we are not living in a world any longer \nwhere an American institution, an American bank or some financial \ninstitution gets in trouble; we are now talking about a world where \nwhat happens in Shanghai, what happens in Europe, what happens in small \ncountries can affect all of us.\n  We need to recognize that in this 21st century, the rules we are \noperating on basically were written 100 years ago or more and we need \nto update those rules and regulations to make it possible for us to \nmanage the next crisis when it comes, and it will come, certainly. When \nit does occur, will we be able to deal with it effectively, early on, \nso as not to watch it explode across this country and cause as much \ndevastation as the present events over the last 2 years have?\n  That is what this effort is all about. It is not more complicated \nthan that, although the answers can be complicated as we try to fashion \nthem in a way that makes sense. I pray this will not become an \nideological or political debate. We bear far too great a responsibility \nto our fellow citizens not to give our best judgment on how to resolve \nthese matters. It ought not to be a question of who wins and who loses \n6 months from tomorrow when it will be election day--6 months tomorrow, \non November 4. I know there is a great preoccupation with that. I don't \ndeny that. But our efforts on this bill ought not to be wrapped around \nthat conclusion. We ought to be trying to do our very best to fashion \nthe steps, the rules that will allow us to minimize the effects of \nanother economic crisis.\n  I can't imagine walking away from this session of Congress, after all \nthe effort that has been made to bring us\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\nto this point, not to sit down and resolve these matters in a way that \nallows us to move forward. So I intend to be supportive of the Boxer \namendment. I hope and believe Senator Shelby and I can agree on a \nsecond set of ideas to present to our fellow colleagues tomorrow. I \nhave listened over the weekend. We have worked very hard with all our \ncolleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, who have come up With \nadditional ideas they would like to incorporate as a part of this bill, \nand we are working with them. My hope is we can lay those out in the \nnext 2 or 3 days to reach agreement on some of those matters.\n\n  There will be some matters which we probably can't resolve, despite \nour good efforts. If that is the case, then we should have a good, \nhealthy debate for an hour or two, then vote in this Chamber and decide \nwhether to accept or reject various ideas. That is the way this \ninstitution was designed to work. So in the coming days, I intend to be \nstanding at this very spot, acting as the manager of this bill, along \nwith Senator Shelby, and again the members of the committee who spent \nso much time and effort over the last number of months will be a part \nof this discussion. They offered their intelligence, their background, \nand their information that I think will enlighten and inform not only \nthe membership but the country as well to what we are trying to \nachieve.\n  I look forward to that debate, when we begin in the next 24 hours, \nand hope that over the next week or so we can conclude that debate; \nthat we will have that good kind of civil conversation, partisan at \nvarious points, as I am sure it is apt to be, but remind each other \nthat we bear a joint responsibility to get this right before we adjourn \nthis Congress and to see to it that the American people have a good \nanswer, at least the best answer we can give them under the \ncircumstances, as to how to minimize the effects that have caused so \nmuch harm to our country over the last 2 years.\n  With that, I thank my colleague from Kentucky, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about \nfinancial reform and the bill the Senate is considering right now. I \nhave made no secret of my desire to pass a strong financial reform bill \nand rein in excesses of our largest financial companies. No Senator in \nthe Banking Committee or in this Chamber has been a stronger voice \nagainst the financial industry enablers at the Fed than I have been. I \nhave fought every bailout that has come through this Congress as well \nas the bailouts that the Federal Reserve and both the Bush and Obama \nadministrations put in place without the approval of the Congress. I \nwish to pass a bill that ends bailouts and puts strong restrictions on \nreckless activities in our financial sector. Unfortunately, the bill \nbefore the Senate not only fails to end bailouts, it does the opposite \nand makes them permanent. This bill will also lead to future financial \ndisasters because it ignores the root causes of the crisis and thus \nfails to put the necessary handcuffs on key parts of the financial \nsystem.\n  The primary goal of this bill should be to end bailouts and the idea \nof too big to fail. Instead, the bill makes too big to fail a permanent \nfeature of our financial system. It concentrates regulations of the \nlargest financial institutions at the Federal Reserve and removes only \nsmall banks from Fed supervision. The Feds failed as a regulator \nleading up to the crisis and should not be the regulator of any banks, \nbut now Federal regulation will be a sign that a firm is too big to \nfail. On top of the new Fed seal of approval for our largest financial \ncompanies, this bill creates a new stability council that will \ndesignate other firms for the Fed to regulate and, thus, too big to \nfail.\n  Federal regulation of the largest financial firms is not the only way \nthis bill makes too big to fail and bailouts permanent. The largest \nbank holding companies and other financial firms will now be subject to \na new resolution process. Any resolution process is, by definition, a \nbailout because the whole point is to allow some creditors to get paid \nmore than they would in bankruptcy. Even if the financial company is \nclosed down at the end of the process, the fact that the creditors are \nprotected against the losses they would normally take will undermine \nmarket discipline and encourage more risky behavior. That will lead to \nmore Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIGs, not less.\n  The bailouts in this bill come with a cost beyond the moral hazard \ncreated by protecting creditors. Despite claims that the financial \nindustry will pay for the bailouts, payments into the bailout fund are \ntax deductible, which means taxpayers are directly subsidizing the \nbailouts.\n  The bailout fund is not the only way this bill keeps taxpayers on the \nhook for future bailouts. First, the bill does not shut off the Federal \nReserve's bailout powers. While some limits are placed on the Fed, the \nbill still lets it create bailout programs to buy up assets and pump \nmoney into struggling firms through ``broad-based'' programs. Second, \nthe bill creates an unlimited new debt guarantee program at the FDIC \nthat can be used to prop up firms instead of closing them down. Both of \nthese bailout powers put taxpayers directly at risk and make bailouts a \npermanent part of the financial system.\n  Instead of putting all these bailout powers into law, we should be \nputting failing companies into bankruptcy. Bankruptcy provides \ncertainty and fairness, and protects taxpayers. Under bankruptcy, \nsimilar creditors are treated the same, which.prevents the government \nfrom picking winners and losers in bailouts. Shareholders and creditors \nalso know up front what losses they are facing and will exercise \ncaution when dealing with financial companies. Later this week I will \njoin several other Senators in offering an amendment that will update \nour bankruptcy laws to deal with modern financial firms and permanently \nend bailouts.\n  If this bill is not going to take away government protection for \nfinancial companies and send those that fail through bankruptcy, then \nit should make them small enough to fail. Decades of combination have \nallowed a handful of banks to dominate the financial landscape. The \nfour largest financial companies have assets totaling over 50 percent \nof our annual gross domestic product, and the six largest have assets \nof more than 60 percent. The four largest banks control approximately \none-third of all deposits in the country. This concentration has come \nabout because creditors would rather deal with firms seen as too big to \nfail, knowing that the government will protect them from losses. I \nwould rather take away the taxpayer protection for creditors of large \nfirms and let the market determine their size. But if that is not going \nto happen we should place hard limits on the size of financial \ncompanies and limit the activities of banks with insured deposits. Any \nfinancial companies that are over those size limits must be forced to \nshrink. This will lead to a more competitive banking sector, reduce the \ninfluence of the largest firms, and prevent a handful of them from \nholding our economy and government hostage ever again.\n  Along with not solving too big to fail, this bill does not address \nthe housing finance problems that were at the center of the crisis. \nFirst, there is nothing in this bill that will stop unsafe mortgage \nunderwriting practices such as zero downpayment and interest-only \nmortgages. There is a lot of talk of making financial companies have \nskin in the game, but when it comes to mortgages, the skin in the game \nthat matters is the borrower's. Second, the bill ignores the role of \ngovernment housing policy and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have \nreceived more bailout money than anyone else. The bill does not put an \nend to the GSE's taxpayer guarantees and subsidies or stop the \ntaxpayers from having to foot the bill for their irresponsible actions \nover the past decade. On Friday the Wall Street Journal reported that \nover 96 percent of all mortgages written in the first quarter were \nbacked by some type of government guarantee. Until we resolve the \nfuture of the GSEs, the private mortgage market will not return and the \nrisk to the taxpayers will continue to increase.\n  This bill also does nothing to address the biggest single factor in \nthe current financial crisis and most other crises in the past--\nflawed Federal Reserve monetary policy. Nothing in this bill will stop \nthe next bubble or collapse if the\n\n[[Page S3024]]\n\nFed continues with its easy money policies. Cheap money will always \ndistort prices and lead to dangerous behavior; no amount of regulation \ncan contain it.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, the bill concentrates regulation of the \nlargest financial firms at the Federal Reserve, despite the Fed's long \nhistory of failed regulation. Leading up to the crisis the Fed already \nfavored the interests of the large banks, and by only removing its \nsupervision of small banks the Fed will become even more of a \ncheerleader for Wall Street. In an earlier version of this bill, bank \nand consumer protection regulation were removed from the Fed and placed \nin a new bank regulator. Unfortunately, that was undone in the current \nversion and the Fed gets more power for both jobs.\n  No one has criticized the Fed more than I have, for its failure to \nuse its consumer protection powers to regulate mortgages. But I just \ncannot understand keeping consumer protection inside the same Fed that \nignored that job for decades. This bill takes a dangerous approach to \nconsumer protection by separating it from the safety and soundness of \nfinancial companies. It also goes even further by letting the Fed reach \ninto businesses that had nothing to do with the financial crisis.\n  Finally, I want to mention the credit rating agency portion of the \nbill. Our goal should be to reduce investors' reliance on the agencies. \nInstead, the bill will give investors a false sense of security by \nsetting new standards to get certified by the government. Also, \nallowing the rating agencies to be sued will discourage new agencies \nfrom entering the market and further concentrate power in the hands of \nthe largest agencies that have performed the worst.\n  I have many other concerns about the bill that I will not mention on \nthe floor today, but they are explained in detail in the minority views \nsection of the committee report. As the bill stands today, it will not \nsolve the problems in our financial system. It is regulation without \nreform. But I hope we can work together to get a bipartisan bill that \nwill put an end to too big to fail forever.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss Wall Street reform, \nbecause we must get this bill right if we are to prevent another \nfinancial crisis like the last one, which almost destroyed our country. \nThe newspapers are filled with reasons why this is so important: In \nEurope, because a sovereign debt crisis is threatening to become a \nfull-blown bank crisis, the governments of the EU are using taxpayer \nfunds to bail out Greece.\n  The hearings before Chairman Levin's Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations have riveted the Nation on fraud at the heart of the \nfinancial crisis; the widespread use of fraudulent stated-income loans \nby Washington Mutual; the abject failures of the bank regulatory \nagencies; the willful neglect of the credit rating agencies; and, \nfinally, the hopelessly conflicted practices of Goldman Sachs, which \nput its own trading activities above any sense of duty to its \ncustomers.\n  In particular, over the past few weeks, much has been spoken and \nwritten about solving the problem of banks that are ``too big to \nfail.'' As many of my colleagues know, Senator Brown and I, along with \nSenators Casey, Merkley, Whitehouse, and Harkin, introduced a bill to \nplace strict limits on the size and leverage used by systemically \nsignificant banks and non-banks alike. We are now offering this \nlegislation as an amendment to the financial reform bill, because we \nbelieve that Congress must reduce these megabanks to a manageable size \nand cap the leverage they may use in order to limit the risk they pose \nto our economy. We should never again have banks that are too big to \nfail.\n  As the recent investigations by Chairman Levin, the Financial Crisis \nInquiry Commission and others have shown: Even the best-intentioned \nregulators are no match for gigantic financial institutions, which are \nstructurally complex, functionally opaque, and global in scope. Just as \nimportantly, these financial institutions purposely operate to evade \nregulatory oversight by means of regulatory arbitrage, accounting and \nreporting practices that frustrate transparency, and so-called \nfinancial innovation that regulators have no chance of fully grasping \nin real time.\n  To surrender our Nation's economic security to unelected and mostly \nunconfirmed regulators is both unwise and undemocratic. It is also a \ngamble. For those of my colleague who do trust the current set of \nregulators and have faith in them,--I am sure of those. I trust our \nregulators.--I would ask: Who will be the next president? Which \nregulators will he or she name to oversee the largest banks? What will \nbe their regulatory philosophy? And how much determination and \nenthusiasm will they bring to the task of forecasting bank risk and \nrisk to the U.S. economy? I submit, no can answer those questions.\n  And while resolution authority is necessary, why would we believe \nthat it will work for a $2 trillion megabank with operations in more \nthan 100 countries? And as we saw just months ago, such banks do not \nsimply fail on their own. The very problems that affect one megabank, \nsuch as a fall in the value of widely held assets like mortgage-backed \nsecurities, will affect every other big bank at the same time. That is \nwhat is happening in Europe today. The EU has decided to bail out \nGreece, before the panic spreads to Portugal, Ireland and Spain.\n  That is why to me the choice is clear. We must do more to act \npreventively.\n  Making the largest banks smaller is a necessary, but not sufficient, \nproposal. It is a complementary idea to the regulatory solutions \ncontained in the current bill, which is a good bill.\n  In the 1930s, this body had the courage and foresight to pass laws \nthat maintained U.S. financial stability for generations. But a decade \nago, too many forgot the wisdom of those laws. That is our challenge \ntoday in the Senate. We can either do nothing, which would be dangerous \nand irresponsible. Or we can direct the regulators to do a better job, \nwhich may work for a time. Or we can build a strong, clear safeguard to \nsecure the American economy and to protect the American people from \never having to bail out megabanks again.\n  The current bill has many provisions that I support, but, as Moody's \nreports, ``the proposed regulatory framework doesn't appear to be \nsignificantly different from what exists today.'' We must go farther.\n  The Brown/Kaufman amendment is not as dramatic as it seems nor is it, \nI believe, fraught with unintended consequences. Very large banks will \nstill exist under this bill. But they will not be so big that they are \n``too big to manage and too big to regulate,'' as former FDIC Chairman \nBill Isaac has said. And the leverage they use, the ratio of capital to \nassets, which is the very basis for how risky they become, will be \nstatutorily capped.\n  In fact, the extra layer of protection provided by this legislation \nis the least we should do. Under Brown-Kaufman, big financial \nconglomerates like Bank of America and Citigroup will still have \nbalance sheets that exceed $1 trillion, about half of their current \nsize. In other words, Citigroup would be about the size that it was in \n2002, when it was still very competitive in the U.S. and overseas. The \nbalance sheet of an investment bank like Goldman Sachs would be scaled \ndown from $850 billion to a more reasonable level of just above $300 \nbillion, or around $450 billion if Goldman exits the bank holding \ncompany structure. Lest anyone think that this is punitive: Goldman \nSachs's assets didn't exceed $100 billion until 2003. That means under \nthe worst case of this bill, their assets will be three times as big as \nthey were in 2003. The firm is currently well over 10 times the size it \nwas when it went public just over 10 years ago.\n  A recent report by Andrew Haldane, the executive director of \nFinancial Stability at the Bank of England, has two charts depicting \nthe incredible growth and concentration that occurred within our \nfinancial system over the last 10 to 15 years.\n  The first chart shows how the averse size of a commercial bank \nrelative to GDP has tripled over the 15 years. By the way, this looks \nvery much like the chart we had on housing process right before the big \ncrash. Look at that exponential growth. If you want to see what \nhappened, 1999 was when we repealed Glass-Stegall. Of course, this \nincrease was driven by the growth of the\n\n[[Page S3025]]\n\nmegabanks, not by the growth of community or regional banks.\n  The second chart shows how concentrated the U.S. banking system has \nbecome in just 10 years. The top three banks represented approximately \n20 percent of overall bank assets in 1999, the time of the repeal of \nthe Glass-Steagall Act. In fewer than 10 years, this percentage has \ndoubled, with these top three banks now representing more than 41 \npercent of total bank assets.\n  And the government's response to the financial meltdown has only made \nthe financial industry bigger? None of this includes what happened in \nthe meltdown: JP Morgan swallowed Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; \nBank of America absorbed Merrill Lynch; and Wells Fargo bought \nWachovia.\n  Why would we want financial institutions this gigantic? And people \nare telling me how do you unravel this? First thing we are going to do \nis now that the finance is set, undo these things we did during the \nfinancial crisis. That is not for me to decide. What we should do is \nput the limits up there and let people decide how they are going to \nreach the limits. The last 2 years proved beyond dispute that \nmanagement and risk committees at America's most prestigious firms were \nunable to effectively track, measure, and mitigate their exposures.\n  As Andrew Haldane recently noted: ``risk and counterparty \nrelationships outstripped banks' ability to manage them. . . . Large \nbanks grew to comprise several thousand distinct legal entities. When \nLehman Brothers failed, it had 1 million open derivatives contracts.''\n  Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin recently admitted: ``There \nisn't a way for an institution with hundreds of thousands of \ntransactions a day involving something over a trillion dollar that you \nare going to know what's in those position books.'' That is Robert \nRubin one of the smallest men I have ever met on finance and also on \nthe Government's approach to finance. If leaders of these massive \nfinancial institutions have no idea regarding their systemic risk, what \nhope do regulators have?\n  The truth is that these financial institutions have become so large \nand complex that regulators rely upon the banks and the markets to \nself-regulate. Under the Basel II Capital Accord, determinations on \ncapital adequacy became dependent on the judgments of rating agencies \nand, increasingly, the banks' own internal models. Modeling is fine, so \nlone aa the banks stay between bright lines which should be drawn by \nCongress. Otherwise, if regulators issue rules governing capital \nrequirements that depend on the banks to use their own models to \ndetermine adequacy of their capital and liquidity, then as a practical \nmatter such regulation becomes meaningless, and is no longer \nregulation.\n  Indeed, regulators have long had all the tools they need to increase \ncapital and restrict banks from engaging in activities that pose a \nserious risk to the safety, soundness or stability of a bank holding \ncompany. But they failed to do it.\n  The regulators failed for many reasons, but they failed in part \nbecause so much of the risk is hidden and difficult to understand. \nInstitutions like Lehman and Citigroup brazenly engaged in accounting \ngimmicks to evade regulations that were imposed on them. Lehman \nimplemented ``Repo 105'' to hide the true extent of its liabilities at \nthe end of each reporting quarter. At the end of each reporting \nquarter, they came up with something so that they could take \nliabilities off the balance sheets so regulators and even shareholders \ndid not know what their true economic position was. In the second \nquarter of 2008 alone, it moved $50 billion temporarily off of its \nbalance sheets without telling regulators, ratings agencies, or even \nits own board or shareholders. SEC and Federal Reserve regulators \nstationed at Lehman Brothers never caught on. And the Lehman CEO \nclaimed he never knew about it. Is it not amazing, a CEO of a \ncorporation, all of the money he is making, $50 billion each quarter \noff the balance sheet being hidden, and he never knew anything about \nit. At the same time, Citigroup and others held more than a trillion \ndollars in off-balance-sheet vehicles to avoid capital requirements for \nlending. When market conditions soured, tens of billions of dollars in \nliabilities suddenly appeared back on their balance sheets to the \nsurprise of regulators and shareholders alike.\n  Some argue that it is the quality of those regulatory standards that \nmust be improved, and that they must be finely tuned and calibrated if \nthey are to affect the behavior of the large banks.\n  Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael Barr recently noted, markets \nwill ``undoubtedly evolve'' beyond what any law says. But, he said, \nregulators are now pushing for new global capital standards that will \nbe ``more robust, higher and better quality, less pro-cyclical, and \ninclude global agreement on a leverage ratio.''\n  That will be very helpful, but it is not a solution. The history of \nfinancial regulation has proven that strong and sweeping statutory \nstandards are far tougher to evade than technical regulations that \nprescriptively set requirements. The Financial Times reported recently \nthat banks are already developing new ways to arbitrage the global \ncapital standards to which Secretary Barr refers. In other words, they \nare finding ways around the rules before they are even finalized.\n  That is why we need statutory standards on the leverage and size of \nthese megabanks, as provided in the Brown-Kaufman SAFE Banking Act. \nWhile some technocrats may say that they are blunt tools, I say that \nthat is precisely the point: the amendment provides a clear line that \nbanks can not evade and regulators can not ignore, thereby making both \naccountable.\n  The Federal Government cannot continue to subsidize these mega-banks \nand permit them to grow by taking on ever greater risk and speculation. \nDean Baker and Travis McArthur of the Center for Economic and Policy \nResearch compared the borrowing costs of the 18 largest banks, all of \nwhich have over $100 billion in assets, to smaller ones. They estimated \nthat the effective government subsidy because of the implicit guarantee \nthat they are too big to fail results in a 70-80 basis point borrowing \nadvantage over smaller banks, resulting in lower borrowing costs equal \nto approximately $34 billion. We are not saying they are too big to \nfail, what the market is saying, if you are a bank that is big enough \nso it looks like it is too big to fail, you can borrow for 70-80 basis \npoints less than smaller banks. Fed Chairman Bernanke has noted that \nthis is unfair competition to smaller banks. I agree. I wish I would \nhear more from smaller banks. As a result, less money flows to local \ncommunities, and small businesses have trouble getting affordable \nloans.\n  Nonetheless, there are still those who argue that we need megabanks, \nthat there are economies of scale that allow $2 trillion banks to \nbetter service large U.S. global corporations and help us compete \nglobally. They offer no evidence to support this claim, however, \nbecause there is none. At least I have not been able to find any.\n  There are no academic studies proving that in banking, bigger is \nbetter and more efficient beyond $100 billion in assets. While big \ncorporations on some occasions need to access particularly large \namounts of capital, Wall Street banks typically form syndicates to \nspread the risk. And while megabanks have large balance sheets that \nmight allow them to take on a large amount of underwriting risk, it is \nnot clear whether this is good for the customer or the financial system \nas a whole. By having lots of smaller institutions participate in an \nunderwriting, the corporate customer is apt to get better pricing \nbecause it will be accessing a wider variety of retail and \ninstitutional distribution channels. The financial system is also safer \nby not having large concentrations of proprietary positions in loans \nand securities, or even worse, by having these institutions ``hedge'' \nthose large exposures with esoteric products that no one understands \nand that are often hidden off balance sheet.\n  Nor is there research that demonstrates that the U.S. needs large \nbanks in order to ``compete'' with massive foreign banks.\n  It is true that only 6 of the 50 largest banks in the world are based \nin the U.S. Many banks on that list have a history of government \ninvolvement, some were even owned by their governments. Virtually all \nof these batiks benefit from implicit or explicit government \nguarantees. Many, including\n\n[[Page S3026]]\n\nthe largest bank on the list, the Royal Bank of Scotland, have been \nrecipients of massive bailouts.\n  Ireland is in the midst of a painful process of bailing out its \nlargest banks. Switzerland put together an approximately $60 billion \nbailout package for one of its largest banks, UBS. The U.K.'s bailout \nsupport for its banks exceeds $1 trillion. The case of Iceland provides \na cautionary tale for all nations on how a government can be completely \noverwhelmed by the collapse of its largest financial institutions.\n  And while French and German banks have enjoyed only modest, direct \nbailouts, through the EU and IMF debt relief provided to Greece, these \nbanks have received a massive, indirect government bailout. The Wall \nStreet Journal reports that German and French banks carry a combined \n$119 billion in exposure to Greek borrowers and more than $900 billion \nto Greece and other vulnerable Euro countries, including Ireland, \nPortugal and Spain. French banks have almost $80 billion in exposures \nto Greece, while German banks have $45 billion in exposures to the \ncountry.\n  Given these circumstances, other countries face just as urgent a need \nto break apart their megabanks.\n  What about Canada, many ask? Its large banks did well during the last \ncrisis. But there are significant differences in our two countries. \nFirst, there was no wave of financial deregulation in Canada. Canadian \nbanks are subjected to tight mortgage origination standards and tough \nleverage limits, something U.S. financial institutions and their \nregulators completely ignored for the last decade. Second, in Canada \nthe government insures the most risky mortgages, and I don't think we \nwant to go back to doing that. Finally, not one of Canada's largest \nbanks is near the size of any of the five largest U.S. banks. In fact, \nthe largest Canadian bank is not even a third of the size of the \nlargest U.S. bank. What's more, under the limits of the Brown-Kaufman \nAct, our megabanks would continue to be much larger than the largest \nCanadian banks.\n  Some officials have argued that ``most observers'' think that \nbreaking up the big banks would lead to more risk, not less; that \nbigger banks are more diversified and therefore less risky than smaller \nbanks. That makes no sense to me. As the governor of the Bank of \nEngland, Mervyn King, recently observed, ``Banks who think they can do \neverything for everyone all over the world are a recipe for \nconcentrating risk.'' That is one of the reasons why he, too, favors \nbreaking up the megabanks as the solution to ``too big to fail.''\n  I believe the view of most observers is best summarized in the review \nof the literature in ``13 Bankers,'' the book by Simon Johnson and \nJames Kwak. Breaking up the banks is not a populist idea in the \npejorative sense of that word. It is supported by smart, informed \npeople outside the Washington-Wall Street corridor who understand what \nis happening, including three presidents of the Federal Reserve Board \nand a host of economists and academics.\n  Even Alan Greenspan, in his recent speech at the Brookings Institute \nlooking back on ``The Crisis,'' stated clearly: ``For years the Federal \nReserve had been concerned about the ever larger size of our financial \ninstitutions. Federal Reserve research had been unable to find \neconomies of scale in banking beyond a modest-sized institution. A \ndecade ago, citing such evidence, I noted that `megabanks being formed \nby growth and consolidation are increasingly complex entities that \ncreate the potential for unusually large systemic risks in the national \nand international economy should they fail.' Regrettably, we did little \nto address the problem.''\n  Anyone can come up with reasons for maintaining the status quo, for \nallowing oversized megabanks to continue to be too big to fail. But \ngiven the recent economic disaster, the burden of proof should fall on \nthose who want to retain our currently dangerous concentration of \nfinancial power. Repeating the mantra of U.S. competitiveness and the \nidea that ``this is not about size but about risk and \ninterconnectedness'' are only excuses for an unjustified failure to \nact.\n  The question is what must we do to ensure that a financial crisis \nlike the great recession, which continues to cause millions of people \nto be out of work and lose their homes, never happens again? The Brown-\nKaufman amendment would add another layer of protection to our \nfinancial sector, and would make it much less likely that U.S. \ntaxpayers will ever be asked to bail out Wall Street again.\n  Brown-Kaufman is a modest, even conservative, proposal to restore the \nsize of banks to where they were a decade ago. It will also impose a \nstatutory leverage limit to prevent megabanks from taking on too much \nrisk--a fact about our amendment that is often overlooked.\n  Sometimes, the buck must stop with Congress. We can take strong steps \nto undo the harm of the last decade, or we can punt responsibility to \nthe very regulators who failed us in the first place. Either way, the \nAmerican people will hold us responsible. So let us act responsibly and \nprotect them from further harm.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wasn't planning on speaking today, but I \nhave had the opportunity to preside for the last couple of hours. I \nheard my friend from Arizona earlier today make some comments about the \nfinancial reform bill. I rise to address them.\n  Before doing so, I commend the Presiding Officer for his comments \nthis afternoon, comments with which I may not fully agree, but he makes \na very persuasive and interesting case about how we get this right. \nClearly, we have to make sure our goal is setting rules and regulations \nthat will stand the test of time. We have to make sure we end the \nnotion of too big to fail.\n  I know the approach of the Presiding Officer is to look at size. I \nthink the committee's approach, which I share, is to look at \ninterconnectedness, to give regulators the ability to unwind \norganizations if they can't prove they have a rational way to be \nunwound through a bankruptcy process.\n  Reasonable people can disagree, but we absolutely agree on the goal: \nmaking sure the American taxpayer never has to hear ``too big to \nfail,'' particularly too big to fail where the American taxpayer has to \npay the bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his comments. I know the debate \nwill continue.\n  Earlier today, my friend, the Senator from Arizona, spoke on the \nbill. As somebody who has been involved in portions of this bill for a \nnumber of months, the Senator from Arizona and I share common goals. We \nwant to make sure that taxpayers are not exposed, that we end bailouts, \nand that we put rules of the road in place for the 21st century for the \nfinancial system. My hope is that in some of the workings between \nChairman Dodd and Senator Shelby, they will find common agreement on \ntitles Senator Corker and I worked on, where they might improve the \ninitial draft.\n  What I hear time and again from all of our colleagues is a \ncommonality of goals. My hope is that at the end of the day we will \nhave legislation that has broad bipartisan support.\n  Let me go back to my colleague from Arizona. He had a strong \npreference for bankruptcy. His concern was that bankruptcy in every \ncase can take care of every financial institution's unwinding, that \nbankruptcy provided predictability. He mentioned in passing a new \nconcept called speedy bankruptcy and cited certain scholarly articles \non it, speedy bankruptcy that had some portion of a certain aspect of \nthe capital structure that would convert certain debt into equity in \nthe event of this process. He made the comment that even having \nresolution in the process would always lead to bailouts. I respectfully \ndisagree and want to take a moment to further explicate what Chairman \nDodd's bill does in terms of how he approached these same issues in a \nbipartisan way.\n  First, we believe the default option should always be bankruptcy. \nBankruptcy is a clear and established set of\n\n[[Page S3027]]\n\nrules. It gives creditors, equity holders a predictability about what \nhappens in the event of a firm getting into trouble, getting into \npotential insolvency, and gives a path toward going out of business. \nBut what we have seen at least to date is that bankruptcy sometimes is \nneither speedy nor, at least in its current form, always able to take \ncare of enormously large, complex financial institutions.\n  I believe it was at the end of last week that there was a story in \neither the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal that pointed out \nthat the Lehmann bankruptcy process is still ongoing, with fees in \nexcess of $400 or $500 million being charged to try to unwind this \nfirm.\n  One of the things I have heard is, if a firm goes into bankruptcy, \nthere are these dollars that will still be needed to unwind the firm in \nan orderly process. Those of us who drafted the bill said that this \nunwinding process, if we are going to use resolution instead of \nbankruptcy, should be prefunded by the financial industry itself, which \nwould benefit. My colleagues believe that perhaps it would be better if \nthe Treasury or some other institution borrows money that then is \nrepaid from the financial industry itself. Again, reasonable people can \ndisagree whether we prefund or postfund, but the facts remain. The \nunwinding of any firm takes time and resources. At the end of the day, \nwe have to make sure the taxpayer is protected. That is Point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2. I agree with my colleague from Arizona when he says that \na new tool we could use for these large, systemically important firms \nto make sure there was a price for them getting too large and there was \nan ability to make sure they could be unwound in a regular process \nwould be the creation of a new form of debt in the capital structure, \ndebt that, in the event of a crisis, would convert into equity, dilute \nexisting shareholders--be, in effect, a check on management because \nthey would also be diluted in this event.\n  I urge my colleague from Arizona to recognize that we have put that \ninto the bill already. We have created a convertible debt component \nthat all of the systemically important firms would have to build into \ntheir capital structure and, in effect, would allow this to be \ntriggered even prior to a crisis point. So rather than being used only \nat the moment of crisis, it could actually be used as a speed bump in \nadvance as one of the early signs of a crisis coming.\n\n  Again, it is one of the reasons why we have created a Systemic Risk \nCouncil that allows for higher capital requirements, focused on \nleverage, focused on better risk management plans, putting this new \ncontingent debt structure within the overall capital structure of the \ninstitution. And there are the funeral plans, or the plans where we are \nasking, again, for these large institutions to outline how they will \nunwind themselves through a bankruptcy process.\n  That process has to be approved by the regulators. It is a process \nwhereby if the regulators do not approve it, they could actually come \nto the conclusion that there is no way to unwind this firm during \nbankruptcy and, consequently, they could actually do what the Presiding \nOfficer requires and say: This firm then, consequently, has to be \ndownsized--or certainly their international operations have to be split \noff or spun off because there is no appropriate way to unwind this firm \nin the event of a bankruptcy process. So again, I think the goal of my \ncolleague from Arizona of making sure there is an orderly, planned \napproach through bankruptcy to unwind these large firms is in place. So \nwe agree there.\n  The fact that there is the creation of this new debt structure within \nthese large firms--that would be debt that would convert to equity--\nthat is in the bill, and actually it is even better than what my \nfriend, the Senator from Arizona, has proposed because it could be \ntriggered even before a crisis.\n  Where I guess I differ from my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, \nis that while he and I strongly believe in the bankruptcy process and \nthe preference toward bankruptcy, we believe that in certain \nextraordinary cases--and if we have done our job, hopefully, \nextraordinary cases that rarely, if ever, may happen--you still have to \nhave an ability to have a resolution authority.\n  Why is this the case? Well, as we saw in the crisis in 2008, there \nwere times when perhaps the balance of the industry realized that the \nfirm was rapidly falling into insolvency, but as the firm went down \nthis path toward insolvency, the management of the firm refused to \nrecognize that, consequently potentially putting not only the firm in \njeopardy but because of the fact that if that firm, in effect, fell \nfully insolvent, it could actually threaten the whole safety of the \nsystem.\n  So after conversations with folks from across the political spectrum, \nwe thought in these extraordinary times there needs to be this kind of \ntrigger of last resort in terms of using a resolution process. It is a \nresolution process to put appropriate guardians in place, requiring the \nTreasury, the head of the FDIC, the head of the Fed, to all act in \nconcert, to put a judicial check in place so, again, no future \nadministration might overuse this power.\n  As Senator Boxer's amendment will further reaffirm, resolution will \nmean the firm will go out of business, that equity will be toast, \nmanagement will be toast, the unsecured creditors will be toast. This \nwill be an effective death panel for a financial institution.\n  As my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, has pointed out, at least \nif a firm chooses bankruptcy, they may emerge on the other side, out of \nthe bankruptcy process, at least semiwhole. If you go into resolution, \nyou are not coming out the other end. This will be like: Once you check \nin, you never check out. Your firm is going out of business. There may \nbe parts of that firm, because they are systemically important--a \nclearing process, or some other systemically important part of this \ninstitution--that may have to be redeposited elsewhere. And it has to \nbe done in an orderly process. But the firm, as it was priorly \nconstrued, will no longer exist. Never again will we do what we did in \n2008, where the American taxpayer came in and shored up these firms in \ntheir current status. Resolution will never be chosen by any rational \nmanagement team or any rational group of shareholders.\n  I hope my friends, who want to make sure we end bailouts, who want to \nmake sure we have an orderly process, will, again, recognize--and there \nmay be ways to improve upon it--we have put together a bill that has a \nstrong preference toward bankruptcy, that puts in place the requirement \nthat the regulators have to bless this bankruptcy plan, no matter how \ncomplex you are, and if you cannot get that blessing then maybe parts \nof your institution need to be spun off in advance. We have already \nadopted the component of contingent debt that would convert into \nequity. Again, that threat of converting even in advance of a crisis \nwill be a check on a management team that wants to take undue risk.\n  There will be no existing shareholders who will want to be faced with \nwhat could be significant dilution even in advance of a crisis if the \nSystemic Risk Council said: Hold on here, you have now gone over that \ntripwire. You are going to get converted. You are going to get diluted. \nAgain, it is another check on the management team.\n  I do believe we have created a strong framework. But to ignore the \nfact that, as we saw in 2008, there may be times when either a \nmanagement team fails to read the handwriting on the wall and declare \nbankruptcy or the crisis comes perhaps because of not even management \nmalfeasance but because of a coordinated cyberattack or some other kind \nof catastrophic event that puts in jeopardy the system--to say never, \never could there be a time when we need an orderly resolution process \nto maintain the safety and soundness of the overall financial system, I \nbelieve, would be shortsighted.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to try to get this right in the coming weeks. I commend the \nchairman and the ranking member, Senator Shelby. I hope they are having \nthose conversations even as we speak. I look forward to continuing the \nconversation with the Presiding Officer on how we, again, can prevent \nthese kinds of actions from even taking place in the first place. How \ndo we deal with his approach of actually downsizing these institutions \nwith bright-line rules or our approach that tries to look, perhaps,\n\n[[Page S3028]]\n\nmore at the interconnectedness but still grants that ability to the \nSystemic Risk Council if there is no way for an institution to \ndemonstrate how it will unwind itself through bankruptcy?\n  Again, reasonable folks can disagree. But none of us should disagree \nwith the ultimate goal: ending too big to fail, making sure we no \nlonger have even the potential of taxpayer exposure, trying to bring \nmore transparency and fairness to this financial system, and, again, as \nthe Presiding Officer and I have talked about before, making sure \nwhatever comes out of this Chamber can stand the test of time so we can \ngive the market the predictability it craves but also the security to \nthe American people that we built ``financial rules of the road'' for \nthe 21st century that will truly work.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Thousand-year Rain Event\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Nashville and middle Tennessee have \nbeen hit with what the Corps of Engineers officials tell us is a \nthousand-year rain event--in a thousand years, we wouldn't expect to \nhave this much rain--and it is providing enormous hardship to the \npeople not just of Nashville and Davidson County but counties in and \naround Nashville. I wish to give a brief report on what we know about \nthat, what Senator Corker and I and Congressman Cooper and the other \nMembers of Congress from that region are doing, working together, so \nthe people of our area can know what to expect.\n  There is a telephone number to call, and I would like to give it. It \nis 615-862-8574. It is a telephone number for people in the Nashville-\nmiddle Tennessee area who are concerned about what to do, who have an \nemergency, and who want information about what help may be available to \nthem--615-862-8574.\n  The Cumberland River and the Harpeth River are the two rivers that \nare causing most of the problem, and we have been waiting all day for \nthe Cumberland River, which runs through Nashville on up to \nClarksville, to crest. That crest hasn't happened yet, and the latest \npredictions are, it might happen around 7 o'clock. It may be later.\n  In the meantime, the Corps of Engineers, with whom we are working, is \ntrying hard to minimize the damage from the lakes they are responsible \nfor. There are three major lakes in the middle Tennessee region: Old \nHickory, Percy Priest, and Center Hill. These lakes hold the water, of \ncourse. If the Corps of Engineers releases water from the overflow of \nthese lakes, that puts more water into the Cumberland River and that \nfloods Nashville more.\n  This is the latest report on those three lakes. The Corps is \ncurrently not releasing water from Percy Priest Lake, and they have \ntold us they will not release water from Percy Priest Lake until the \nriver crests. This is important information for people in downtown \nNashville. First Avenue, Second Avenue both have a lot of water. Some \nof the big buildings, the Pinnacle Building, has a lot of water. The \nfact that the Corps is not releasing water from Percy Priest Lake until \nthe river crests is an important piece of information.\n  The water level, on the other hand, at Old Hickory Lake is at \nhistoric levels, and the Corps is releasing water from Old Hickory Lake \nbut only when absolutely necessary to maintain the stability of the Old \nHickory Dam. Fortunately, the Corps is not having to release water from \nthe third lake, the Center Hill Lake. It has some room to spare.\n  This is an example of Congress and the Federal Government doing \nsomething right because, over the last several years, we have added \nfunds to the appropriations bills--I have and others as well--in order \nto improve the safety of Center Hill Dam. Because up until the last \ncouple years, the water level had to be lowered because the dam was \nweak. If the dam was as weak as it was 2 or 3 years ago, the Corps of \nEngineers would have had to be releasing a lot more water from Center \nHill Lake into the Cumberland River, causing more flooding in \nNashville.\n  Over the weekend, we have been in touch with Governor Bredesen's \noffice and Mayor Dean's office and they are doing a first-rate job. \nPart of my responsibility is to work with Governor Bredesen, and over \nthe last several years, on disasters as they occur, such as the tornado \nin Macon County, near Nashville, the tornadoes in Jackson and Madison \nCounty. The Governor and the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency--I \nused to be in charge of that agency when I was Governor--have a first-\nrate operation there, and they have been working hard ever since the \nrains hit.\n  The Federal Emergency Management Agency has a liaison stationed at \nthe TEMA--the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency--office, and they \nare working well together. What those people are doing is using every \navailable resource in support of State and local efforts to try to \nrescue people, to make life easier, to get the water plant running \nagain, and to begin to assess what the damage is, which is where the \nFederal Government generally can help.\n  As I mentioned, this is not just Nashville that is involved. Macon \nCounty, Williamson County, Montgomery County, Cheatham County--all the \ncounties right around Nashville up to Clarksville are involved. My \nchief of staff from Washington has been onsite in Nashville since last \nnight, my State field director has been onsite since last night as \nwell, and they are busy dealing with the local officials. I am prepared \nto go whenever it would be helpful, but there is no need for me to go \nand get in the way if there is nothing for me to do. Right now, the \nbest thing for me to do, along with Senator Corker and Congressman \nCooper, is to stay in touch with the Governor's office and the Mayor's \noffice and be ready to help with a disaster request when it is made.\n  When the Governor makes a disaster request, the procedure is, we then \ngo to work to help persuade the President--and I am sure he will act as \npromptly as he can--to approve that disaster. There are two or three \nkinds of help that may be forthcoming. One would be public assistance \nfor debris removal, to repair public buildings that are damaged, water \nor sewer facilities or infrastructure. For example, one of the major \nwater treatment plants is down, and the mayor has asked Nashvillians to \nconserve water. That may be an area where Federal support will be \navailable to help.\n  Then there is the matter of private assistance. Temporary housing may \nbe available. There may be loans available to businesses that are hurt \nand other forms of assistance to individuals and households.\n  This is a major event in our city. The Opryland Hotel--one of the \nbiggest hotels anywhere in America--has had to empty itself, and it has \n1,500 residents who are staying in a high school. We are told it may be \nseveral months before the Opryland Hotel is able to function again. We \nhope not because its tax revenues provide 25 percent of all the hotel-\nmotel tax revenues for the city, and that would come at a difficult \ntime.\n  So my purpose on the floor today is simply to express my concern to \nthe residents of the city where we live--in Nashville, TN--and to all \nothers who might be affected in the middle Tennessee area and to let \nthem know I believe Governor Bredesen and the mayor are doing a first-\nrate job in responding to the immediate requests, that the Federal and \nState management agencies are hard at work, that there is a telephone \nnumber that individual Tennesseans who have questions can call--it is \n615-862-8574--and that after getting themselves and their families in \norder, the best thing to do is to document your losses so when the \nGovernor makes his request for emergency disaster assistance and the \nPresident approves it, those losses can be proven and that help can \ncome more quickly.\n  The Governor will move as swiftly as he can on this. Our experience \nis, it is\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\nbetter to be complete than quick because we want to make sure, when the \nrequest comes in, that it involves everybody, that it involves all the \nclaims, that they are properly documented. That has been our experience \nbefore. So that is my report to the people of middle Tennessee. I want \nthem to know I care about it, that I am on the phone about it, we have \nstaff members on site, and I believe the Governor and the mayor and the \nFederal and State emergency agencies are doing all they can and we can \nhope for the best as the Cumberland River crests, we hope sooner rather \nthan later.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen).

Madam President, I rise to congratulate Scott Thoele \n(``Taylee'') of the Illinois Army National Guard on his promotion to \nbrigadier general.\n  General Thoele, as a colonel, led the Illinois Army National Guard \nduring its deployment last year to Afghanistan.\n  He commanded the 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, whose soldiers \nserved in that country from August 2008 to September 2009. The \nmobilization of his soldiers was the Illinois Guard's largest since \nWorld War Two.\n  Most of these men and women are civilian-soldiers from cities and \ntowns across Illinois. They have their own lives separate from service \nin our Armed Forces.\n  Most do not serve full time in the Guard. In the midst of living \ntheir lives--working at their jobs, spending time with their families, \nand participating in their communities--they have made a patriotic \ncommitment to their country.\n  They have said, if my Nation needs me to serve and to fight abroad, I \nwill answer the call.\n  And last year, 3,000 soldiers from Illinois left their jobs, their \nfamilies, and their communities to serve at the call of their Nation.\n  General Thoele is one of those soldiers. He lives in Quincy, IL, with \nhis wife and four children. In his civilian life, he works at First \nBankers Trust Company in the bank's audit department.\n  This was a difficult deployment for the Illinois Army National Guard. \nThey spent the year in Afghanistan in austere conditions. Their main \ntask was to train and mentor the Afghan National Security Forces, in an \neffort to help the Afghans take responsibility for their own safety and \nsecurity. They also provided security to the provincial reconstruction \nteams across Afghanistan. Eighteen Illinois soldiers lost their lives \nin service to their country. Dozens more were badly injured.\n  A long time ago, before he became President, there was a young \ncaptain from Illinois who answered the call when his State needed men \nto fight in the Black-Hawk war of 1832. He gathered 400 volunteers from \nthe Sangamon County State militia and traveled north to Prophetstown, \nIL, marching through miles of what author Carl Sandburg described as \n``swamp muck and wilderness brush . . . pushing and pulling when horses \nand wagons bogged.''\n  It was also a difficult war--as all wars are. Sandburg wrote that to \nthe men under the young captain, ``it didn't seem the kind of war they \nhad expected and they wrote home about it.'' But ultimately they did \ncome home, while young Abraham Lincoln went on to reenlist--and to \nserve his Nation in many ways.\n  I offer my thanks to General Thoele, who also continues to serve his \nNation, now as the Deputy Commanding General for the Army National \nGuard at the Army's Combined Arms Center in Kansas. Thank you for your \nwork in Afghanistan and for bringing our soldiers home safely. And \ncongratulations again on your promotion to brigadier general.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/03/senate-section/article/S3029-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3029-S3032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DISCLOSE ACT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, last Friday, I introduced S. 3295, the \nDISCLOSE Act, because Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on \nSpending in Elections. I am joined by 40 of my Senate colleagues as \ncosponsors.\n  Decades ago, Justice Louis Brandeis boldly said, ``Sunlight is said \nto be the best of disinfectants.'' That is exactly what this bill will \ndo--shine a light on the flood of spending unleashed by the Citizens \nUnited decision.\n  The DISCLOSE Act will drill down and give the public the information \nthey have a right to know. No longer will groups be able to live and \nspend in the shadows.\n  The Court spoke in the Citizens United decision. And while there is \ndisagreement with its ruling, there is room to maneuver. This \nlegislation does not circumvent the Court by reimposing a backdoor ban \non corporate spending. Instead, the DISCLOSE Act closes certain \nloopholes and relies on enhanced disclosure, an idea endorsed by the \nCourt. This legislation meets the test of constitutionality.\n  The aim of the DISCLOSE Act is simply to level the political playing \nfield so that special interests do not drown out the voice of the \naverage voter. It applies to corporations and advocacy organizations \nthe same rules that candidates already have to abide by. And it applies \nthese rules equally across the board. It covers corporations and labor \nunions alike, as well as 527s, social welfare organizations, and trade \nassociations.\n  The DISCLOSE Act will do the following:\n  First, new disclaimers on all television advertisements funded by \nspecial interests will be required in order to uncover who is really \nbehind the ad. If a corporation is running the ad, the CEO will have to \nappear to at the end to say that he or she approved the message, just \nlike a candidate must do today. If an advocacy organization is running \nthe ad, both the head of the organization running the ad, and the top \noutside funder of the ad, will have to appear on camera. Additionally, \na list of the top five funders to that organization will be displayed \non the screen. This will stop the funneling of big money through shadow \ngroups in order to fund ads that are virtually anonymous. For the first \ntime, the money can be followed back to its origin and the source of \nthe money will be public.\n  Second, an unprecedented level of disclosure is mandated, not only of \nan organization's spending, but also of its donors. In disclosing their \ndonors, organizations will have a choice--they can either disclose all \nof their donors that have given in excess $1,000, or they can disclose \nonly those donors who contribute to the group's campaign-related \nactivity account, if they solely use that account for their spending. \nAll spending intended to influence an election--be it on television, \nradio, print, mailers, robocalls, and billboards--would flow through \nthis account. And every donor who contributes more than $1,000 would \nhave to be disclosed. Organizations must not only disclose these donors \nto the FEC, but also to the public on their Web sites and to their \nshareholders and members through their annual and quarterly reports.\n  Third, loopholes created by the Court's decision are closed. The \nfirst loophole is closed by preventing foreign-controlled entities from \nspending unlimited sums in our elections through their U.S.-based \nsubsidiaries. This was a loophole specifically mentioned by Justice \nStevens in his dissent. Foreign leaders who don't have American \ninterests in mind shouldn't have the ability to influence our \nelections. The second loophole is closed by banning companies with \ngovernment contracts in excess of $50,000 from making unlimited \nexpenditures. The third loophole is closed by banning expenditures by \ncompanies that receive government assistance such as TARP. Taxpayer \nmoney should not be used to help corporations influence elections.\n  Finally, in an attempt to allow all candidates and parties to respond \nto ads funded by special interests, the current law granting lowest \nunit rate to candidates is expanded by giving those same rights to the \nparties on a limited geographic basis.\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in sponsoring and passing the DISCLOSE \nAct.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section by section analysis of the \nDISCLOSE Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           TITLE I--REGULATION OF CERTAIN POLITICAL SPENDING\n\n\n                       Sec. 101. BAN PAY-TO-PLAY\n\n       Prevent Government Contractors from Spending Money on \n     Elections. Government contractors would be barred from making \n     campaign-related expenditures, defined to include independent \n     expenditures and electioneering communications. This is an \n     extension of an existing ban on contributions made by \n     government contractors. Before Citizens United, corporations \n     could not make such campaign-related expenditures. A $50,000 \n     contract threshold will be included to exempt small \n     government contractors.\n       Prevent Corporate Beneficiaries of TARP from Spending Money \n     on Elections. Corporations that received bailout funding from \n     the federal government should not be permitted to use \n     taxpayer money to influence elections. This section would \n     prohibit bailout beneficiaries from making campaign-related \n     expenditures. Once that money is repaid, however, the \n     restrictions would be lifted.\n\n\n         Sec. 102. PREVENT FOREIGN INFLUENCE IN U.S. ELECTIONS\n\n       While foreign nationals, including foreign corporations \n     (those incorporated overseas), are banned from making \n     contributions or expenditures to influence U.S. elections, \n     the opinion in Citizens United created a loophole for \n     spending by domestic corporations controlled by foreign \n     nationals. To close the loophole, the legislation extends the \n     existing prohibition on contributions and expenditures by \n     foreign nationals to include domestic corporations under the \n     following circumstances:\n       1. If a foreign national owns 20% or more of voting shares \n     in the corporation, which is modeled after the control test \n     in many states, including Delaware;\n       2. If a majority of the board of directors are foreign \n     nationals;\n       3. If one or more foreign nationals have the power to \n     direct, dictate, or control the decision-making of the U.S. \n     subsidiary; or\n       4. If one or more foreign nationals have the power to \n     direct, dictate, or control the activities with respect to \n     federal, state or local elections.\n\n\nSec. 103. PREVENT ORGANIZATIONS FROM COORDINATING THEIR ACTIVITIES WITH \n                         CANDIDATES AND PARTIES\n\n       The legislation ensures that corporations and unions are \n     not allowed to coordinate campaign-related expenditures with \n     candidates and parties in violation of rules that require \n     these expenditures to be independent.\n       Current FEC rules bar corporations and unions from \n     coordinating with congressional candidates and parties about \n     ads that refer to the candidate and are distributed within 90 \n     days of a primary election or within 90 days of the general \n     election. For Presidential contests, current FEC rules \n     prohibit coordination on ads that reference a presidential \n     candidate in the period beginning 120 days before a state's \n     Presidential primary election and continuing in that state \n     through the general election.\n       This legislation would do the following:\n       For House and Senate races, the legislation would ban \n     coordination between a corporation or union and the candidate \n     on ads referencing a Congressional candidate in the time \n     period starting 90 days before the primary and continuing \n     through the general election. For presidential campaigns, the \n     legislation would ban coordination between a corporation or \n     union and the candidate on ads referencing a Presidential or \n     Vice Presidential candidate in the time period starting 120 \n     days before the first presidential primary and continuing \n     through the general election.\n\n\n                Sec. 104. POLITICAL PARTY COMMUNICATIONS\n\n       The legislation provides that any payment by a political \n     party committee for the direct costs of an ad or other \n     communication made on behalf of a candidate affiliated with \n     the party is treated as a contribution to the candidate only \n     if the communication is directed or controlled by the \n     candidate.\n       Party-paid communications that are not directed or \n     controlled by the candidate are not subject to limits on the \n     party's contributions or expenditures.\n\n TITLE II--PROMOTING EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE OF CAMPAIGN-RELATED ACTIVITY\n\n       The legislation ensures that the public will have full and \n     timely disclosure of campaign-related expenditures (both \n     electioneering communications and public independent \n     expenditures) made by covered organizations (corporations, \n     unions, section 501(c)(4), (5), and (6) organizations and \n     section 527 organizations).\n       The legislation imposes disclosure requirements that will \n     mitigate the ability of spenders to mask their campaign-\n     related activities through the use of intermediaries.\n       It also requires disclosure of both disbursements made by \n     the covered organization and also the source of funds used \n     for those disbursements.\n\n             Subtitle A--Reporting Improvements to the FEC\n\n\n                   Sec. 201. INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES\n\n       The definition of an ``independent expenditure'' is \n     expanded to include both express advocacy and the functional \n     equivalent of express advocacy, consistent with Supreme Court \n     precedent. Additionally, the section imposes a 24-hour \n     reporting requirement for expenditures of $10,000 or more \n     made more than 20 days before an election, and expenditures \n     of $1,000 or more made within 20 days before an election.\n\n\n                Sec. 202. ELECTIONEERING COMMUNICATIONS\n\n       This section expands the definition of ``electioneering \n     communications'' to include all broadcast ads that refer to a \n     candidate within the period beginning 90 days before a \n     primary election, until the date of the general election. Any \n     such ``electioneering communication'' is subject to the \n     disclosure requirements in the bill. The section also expands \n     the reporting requirements for electioneering communications \n     to include a statement as to whether the communication is \n     intended to support or oppose a candidate, and if so, which \n     candidate.\n\n            Subtitle B--Expanded Requirements for Disclosure\n\n\n         Sec. 211. IMPROVED DISBURSEMENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n       The legislation would require corporations, labor unions, \n     and section 501(c)(4), (5), or (6) organizations--as well as \n     section 527 organizations--to report all donors who have \n     given $1,000 or more to the organization during a 12-month \n     period if the organization makes independent expenditures or \n     electioneering communications in excess of $10,000.\n       If an organization makes a transfer of funds to another \n     person for the purpose of making an independent expenditure \n     or electioneering communication, the organization shall be \n     treated as making an independent expenditure or \n     electioneering communication. A person shall be deemed to \n     have transferred funds for the purpose of making campaign-\n     related expenditures if there have been substantial \n     discussions about such expenditures between the person making \n     the transfer and the person receiving the funds, if the \n     person making the transfer or the person receiving the \n     transfer knows (or should have known) of the intent to make \n     campaign-related expenditures by the person making the \n     transfer or if making the transfer or the person receiving \n     the funds made a campaign-related expenditure in the last \n     election cycle or the current cycle.\n\n\n             Sec. 212. DISCLOSURE OF GENERAL TREASURY FUNDS\n\n       If a donor to a covered organization specifies that his \n     donation may not be used for campaign-related activity, the \n     organization is restricted from using the donation for that \n     purpose, and may not then disclose the identity of the donor. \n     The organization's CEO must certify to the donor within 7 \n     days that such funds will not be used for campaign-related \n     activity.\n       If a covered organization makes a disbursement for \n     campaign-related activity, the CEO must file a statement with \n     the FEC certifying that the expenditure was not made in \n     coordination with a candidate, that funds designated by the \n     donor not to be used for campaign-related activity have not \n     been used for any campaign-related activity, and that the \n     spending has been fully disclosed and made in compliance with \n     law.\n\n\n    Sec. 213. CREATION OF SEPARATE CAMPAIGN-RELATED ACTIVITY ACCOUNT\n\n       An organization can establish a separate ``Campaign-Related \n     Activity'' account to receive and disburse political \n     expenditures. If an organization makes campaign-related \n     expenditures exclusively from its separate account, then it \n     is only required to disclose only donors who have contributed \n     $10,000 or more for unrestricted use or donors who have \n     contributed $1,000 or more specifically for campaign-related \n     activity.\n\n\n       Sec. 214. ENHANCE DISCLAIMERS TO IDENTIFY SPONSORS OF ADS\n\n       Require Leaders of Corporations, Unions, and Organizations \n     to Identify that they are Behind Political Ads. If any \n     covered organization (corporation, union, section 501(c)(4), \n     (5), or (6) organization, or section 527 organization) spends \n     on a political ad, the CEO or highest ranking official of \n     that organization will be required to appear on camera to say \n     that he or she ``approves this message,'' just like \n     candidates have to do now.\n       In order to prevent ``Shadow Groups'', Require Top Donors \n     To Appear in Political Ads They Funded. In order to prevent \n     individuals and entities from funneling money through shell \n     groups in order to mask their activities, the legislation \n     will include the following requirements:\n       The top funder of the advertisement must also record a \n     stand-by-your-ad disclaimer.\n       The top five donors of non-restricted funds to an \n     organization that purchases campaign-related TV advertising \n     will be listed on the screen at the end of the advertisement. \n     This has been used very successfully in Washington State and \n     is the model for this section in the legislation.\n\n      Subtitle C--Reporting Requirements for Registered Lobbyists\n\n\n Sec. 221. REQUIRING REGISTRANTS TO REPORT INFORMATION ON INDEPENDENT \n             EXPENDITURES AND ELECTIONEERING COMMUNICATIONS\n\n       In an effort to add to the transparency of lobbying \n     activities, all registrants under the Lobbying Disclosure Act \n     must disclose the\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\n     following information on their semiannual reports: the date \n     and amount of each independent expenditure or electioneering \n     communication of $1,000 or more, and the name of each \n     candidate referred to or supported or opposed.\n\n   Subtitle D--Filing by Senate Candidates with the Federal Election \n                               Commission\n\n\n       Sec. 231. FILING BY SENATE CANDIDATES WITH THE COMMISSION\n\n       In addition to the increased disclosure and transparency \n     placed on outside organizations, the legislation will \n     incorporate language from the bipartisan S. 1858, which \n     requires Senators to electronically file their campaign \n     finance reports directly to the FEC.\n\n    TITLE III--DISCLOSURE OF CAMPAIGN-RELATED ACTIVITY TO MEMBERS & \n                              SHAREHOLDERS\n\n\nSec. 301. ENHANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF POLITICAL EXPENDITURES \n          TO SHAREHOLDERS AND MEMBERS OF COVERED ORGANIZATIONS\n\n       All campaign-related expenditures made by a corporation, \n     union, section 501(c)(4), (5), or (6) organization, or \n     section 527 organization must be disclosed on the \n     organization's website with a clear link on the homepage \n     within 24 hours of reporting such expenditures to the FEC. \n     Additionally, all campaign-related expenditures made by a \n     corporation, union, section 501(c)(4), (5), or (6) \n     organization, or section 527 organization must be disclosed \n     to shareholders and members of the organization in any \n     financial reports provided on a periodic and/or annual basis \n     to its shareholders or members.\n\n                    TITLE IV--TELEVISION MEDIA RATES\n\n\n     Sec. 401. PROVIDE LOWEST UNIT RATE FOR CANDIDATES AND PARTIES\n\n       Current law allows for candidates to receive the lowest \n     unit rate for airtime in order to get their message out over \n     the airwaves.\n       If a covered organization (which includes corporations, \n     unions, section 501(c)(4), (5), and (6) organizations, and \n     section 527 organizations) spends $50,000 on airtime to run \n     ads on broadcast, cable, or satellite television that support \n     or oppose a candidate, then that candidate or political party \n     committee is allowed to receive the lowest unit rate for that \n     media market.\n       The broadcaster must also ensure that the candidate or \n     political entity has ``reasonable access'' during \n     nonpreemptible airtime.\n\n                       TITLE V--OTHER PROVISIONS\n\n       This Title contains the judicial review, severability, and \n     effective date sections.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in \nElections Act, also called the DISCLOSE Act.\n  I want to thank Senator Schumer for his work on this important bill \nand say that I plan to support it every step of the way.\n  Before I discuss the merits of this legislation, I think it is \nimportant to provide some context.\n  This bill is a legislative response to a Supreme Court decision. In \n2002 we passed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. The law was \nbipartisan, widely supported, and we firmly believed it to be \nconstitutional based on prior decisions of the Court.\n  In 2003, the Supreme Court upheld portions of the law in the case of \nMcConnell v. Federal Election Commission.\n  But on January 21 of this year, the Roberts Court handed down a 5-4 \ndecision striking down parts of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.\n  That decision--Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission--flew \nin the face of nearly a century of congressional law. It also \noverturned two prior rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court. The overturned \ncases were McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, 2003, and Austin \nv. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 1990.\n  The case is not alone. It is part of a trend of decision after \ndecision from the Roberts Court overturning prior precedents. I have \nreal concern that this Court is going out of its way to rewrite and \nreinterpret prior law. Its decisions seem to favor corporate interests \nover the interests of the American people. We have heard talk of \n``activist'' courts before and I fear that is exactly what we have \ntoday.\n  The Citizens United decision may be the most troubling one yet. This \ndecision does not only impact one group of people or one area of the \nlaw--it affects the very way our elections and our democratic system \nare run.\n  The Court's decision in this case opened the door to unlimited \ncorporate spending in federal elections. It held that the first \namendment of the Constitution protects the rights of corporations, and \nprotects their right to spend freely--in the millions or even the \nbillions of dollars--on election ads to support or defeat their favored \ncandidates.\n  This means that an oil company like ExxonMobil could spend any \nportion of its billions in profits to elect a candidate who will let \nthem drill more, or to defeat a candidate who opposes their drilling \nplans.\n  It means that Xe Services, formerly known as Blackwater, and other \ndefense contractors could spend unlimited sums toward the election of \ncandidates who view their defense positions favorably.\n  And large banks like JPMorgan Chase would be free to use their \ncorporate treasury funds to attack candidates who favor financial \nregulation.\n  This last example, of course, is a very real and present situation. \nThe questions on the floor right now are of great importance--should \nthe credit default swaps and derivative contracts that have wreaked \nhavoc on our economy be regulated, and how? These are questions we need \nto answer with the interest of the American public and our economy in \nmind, not the possibility that JP Morgan could launch a multimillion \ndollar attack against us if we don't bow to their demands.\n  As Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 testified at a Rules Committee \nhearing, ``It would not take many examples of elections where \nmultimillion corporate expenditures defeat a member of Congress before \nall members quickly learn the lesson, vote against the corporate \ninterest at stake in a piece of legislation and you run the risk of \nbeing hit with a multimillion-dollar corporate ad campaign to defeat \nyou.''\n  The Supreme Court's decision is based on constitutional law. They get \nthe final word on the Constitution, and they have spoken. So our \nresponse unfortunately has to be made with one hand tied behind our \nback. The DISCLOSE Act is a powerful attempt to show the public the \neffect of this decision and to ensure that our election process will \nremain transparent.\n  Here is what the bill would do:\n  First, it would require new disclaimers so that the American public \nknows who is behind an ad they see on TV.\n  If a corporation runs an ad, the CEO must stand up and say that they \napproved the message. If an advocacy organization runs the ad, the head \nof the organization and the top outside funder must appear. The point \nis simple--if you are behind an ad, say so, and let the public know.\n  Second, the bill would impose new disclosure requirements.\n  Organizations will have to disclose all of their donors who have \ngiven over $1000 or who have contributed to their election spending \naccounts.\n  Let me give you an example from the National Law Journal of why these \ndisclosure and disclaimer rules are important.\n  Last summer, an organization called America's Health Insurance Plans, \nor AHIP, collected between $10 and $20 million from major health \ninsurance companies such as Aetna, Cigna, Kaiser Foundation, \nUnitedHealth Group, and Wellpoint. AHIP funneled these funds to the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, which set up two separate entities called the \n``Campaign for Responsible Health Reform'' and ``Employers for a \nHealthy Economy.'' These two shell organizations then engaged in \nwidespread advertising to oppose health reform. Although the health \ninsurance companies were the primary funders of the ads, the American \npublic had no way of knowing that by the time the ads appeared on TV.\n  The DISCLOSE Act will require disclaimers that name an ad's top \nfunders and disclose where the money came from. I think this is \nimportant, and I believe it will be an important step forward in true \nvoter education and transparency.\n  Third, the bill will prevent foreign-controlled entities from \nspending unlimited sums in American elections through their \nsubsidiaries.\n  Under current law, foreign companies cannot directly contribute to \ncandidates or air election ads, but their U.S.-based subsidiaries can \nand often do. According to the Washington Post, since 2007, U.S.-based \nsubsidiaries of foreign corporations have contributed more than $20 \nmillion to Federal campaigns through political action committees.\n  The rules will prevent a corporation from making contributions or \nspending on election ads if a foreign national\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\nowns 20 percent or more of its voting shares; a majority of the board \nof directors are foreign nationals; foreign nationals have the power to \ncontrol the decision making of the subsidiary; or foreign nationals \ncontrol election-related expenditures.\n  Fourth, the bill will prohibit any company with government contracts \nin excess of $50,000 and any company that receives TARP or similar \ngovernment assistance funds, from making unlimited election \nexpenditures.\n  The point here is simple--if your business relies on government \ncontracts or government assistance for its revenues, you should not be \nin the business of trying to buy seats for your friends or take them \naway from your enemies.\n  Finally, the bill will expand current law to allow political parties \nthe same ability as candidates to get television ad time at the \n``lowest unit rate'' in certain situations and in certain geographical \nareas.\n  The Roberts Court's decision in Citizens United was, I believe, the \nwrong one. It protected corporations at the expense of drowning out \nindividuals' free speech. It threatened to put democratic elections in \nthe United States up for sale. And it will, I believe, lead to voters \nhaving less reliable information about candidates--not more.\n  The DISCLOSE Act cannot solve all of the problems created by the \ndecision, but it is a critical step forward. The bill will ensure that \nthe American public knows who is funding an ad when they see it on \ntelevision, and it will close loopholes that could have otherwise \nallowed unlimited spending in our elections by foreign nationals and \ncorporations receiving government assistance.\n  I believe it is essential that we pass this bill quickly, and I look \nforward to working with Senator Schumer and others to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/03/senate-section/article/S3032-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, each May, since 1978, we have \nhonored the rich heritage and countless accomplishments of the many \nAsian Pacific Americans in our country. I am delighted to recognize \nAsian Pacific American Heritage Month and to pay tribute to the \nstruggles and enormous contributions of Asian Pacific Americans to our \nNation's history and culture.\n  May was chosen for Asian Pacific American Heritage Month to \ncommemorate both the arrival of the first Japanese immigrants in 1843, \nand also the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, which \nwas constructed in large part by Chinese laborers.\n  ``Lighting the Past, Present, and Future'' is the theme for this \nyear's celebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. This \nphrase recognizes both the plight and extraordinary achievements of the \nAsian Pacific American community as they have forged ahead to become a \nsuccessful and vital segment of American society.\n  Currently, Asian Pacific Americans constitute one of the fastest \ngrowing minority communities in the United States, and California is \nhome to the greatest number of Asian Pacific Americans. There are over \n15 million Asian Pacific Americans in the Nation, with more than 5 \nmillion living in California. In addition, there are thousands of Asian \nPacific Americans currently serving in our Armed Forces, defending our \ncountry and securing freedom abroad.\n  With this wealth of diversity, our State is enriched by many famous \nethnic enclaves such as San Francisco's Chinatown and Japantown, \nWestminster's Little Saigon, Los Angeles's Historic Filipinotown and \nLong Beach's Little Cambodia. As the Asian Pacific American community \nhas grown, these historic neighborhoods have become vibrant centers of \ncultural exchange and learning.\n  The Asian Pacific American community has enthusiastically answered \nthe call to public service, and as a result, we see more Asian Pacific \nAmericans in government leadership. Throughout my career, I have worked \nwith many extraordinary Asian Pacific American leaders, in particular \nSenators Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, two longtime \nstalwarts of the Senate. Joining my colleagues this year in Congress \nwas Representative Judy Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected \nto the House of Representatives, becoming the 12th Asian Pacific \nAmerican elected official currently serving in Congress. In addition, \nDr. Steven Chu was appointed as Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nEnergy, the first Asian Pacific American to hold the position. A new \ngeneration of leaders has emerged, who will no doubt continue to lead \nnot only their community, but the Nation to new heights.\n  This past year has also meant many firsts for the Federal bench: two \nAsian Pacific American nominees, Ed Chen and Lucy Koh, for the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California, where there has \nnever been an Asian Pacific American district judge; the confirmation \nof the first Chinese American woman to be a district court judge, Dolly \nGee; and the confirmation of the first Vietnamese American district \ncourt judge, Jacqueline Nguyen. I recommended Magistrate Judge Chen and \nJudge Nguyen to President Barack Obama, as well as Professor Goodwin \nLiu for appointment to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, confident \nthat their strong legal backgrounds and unique perspective will be \nvaluable additions to the Federal courts.\n  As we celebrate the rich and diverse Asian and Pacific Islander \ncultures during this month, we are not only recognizing many notable \nachievements, but we are also reminded of the struggles and sacrifices \nendured to live and experience the American dream.\n  The Senate has worked on a number of major pieces of legislation this \nsession, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \nwhich I proudly voted for and the President signed into law in March. \nIn addition to providing health care to 2.3 million uninsured Asian \nPacific Americans nationwide, the bill will provide subsidies to Asian \nPacific American small businesses, close the Medicare ``doughnut hole'' \nfor all Asian Pacific American seniors, and provide more resources and \nstrong data collection provisions that will help address racial and \nethnic health disparities. In a community where 52 percent of Asian \nPacific Americans delay or forgo routine and preventative treatment due \nto the high cost of medical care and where cancer is the leading cause \nof death, access to quality medical care is vital.\n  This is a great beginning to health care reform and I look forward to \ncontinuing the work with my Federal medical insurance rate authority \nbill. My legislation would create a rate authority that would oversee \npremiums charged by the health insurance industry and provide a \nsafeguard for Americans against soaring premium increases. Access to \naffordable medical care is a necessity of life that I will work hard to \nprotect for all Americans.\n  In the Asian Pacific American community where about 60 percent of the \npopulation is foreign-born, immigration reform is a central and \nimportant issue. For example, although Asians and Pacific Islanders \nmake up about 39 percent of all family sponsored immigrants, they \nrepresent nearly half the backlogs in family reunification visas. I \nrecently cosigned a letter with Senator Barbara Boxer to President \nObama, urging his continued support for fixing our broken immigration \nsystem. As we address immigration reform, it is imperative that we \nsupport effective solutions and a commonsense approach that would keep \nfamilies together, while improving the state of our economy.\n  At such an unprecedented moment in the Nation's history, there is no \ndoubt that these are only two of the many challenges that the Asian \nPacific American community will be faced with in the upcoming year. \nHowever, Asian Pacific Americans are a resilient people and their \naccomplishments this year alone are a testament of their remarkable \nspirit and important role in the history and culture of the United \nStates.\n  I am proud to honor the tremendous strength, character, and courage \nof Asian Pacific Americans during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month \nand am confident that they will only continue to surpass these \nchallenges and further add to the vibrancy of the American landscape.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/03/senate-section/article/S3032-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3032-S3033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DR. RUSSELL ROSS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to recognize the passing \nof a\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\nmentor to me and many other political science students over the years.\n  Russell Marion Ross was a professor of political science for more \nthan 40 years at the University of Iowa. He died on Tuesday, April 27, \nat age 88.\n  Dr. Ross was an Iowan through and through. Born in Washington, IA, he \nreceived his bachelor and master degrees, and Ph.D. in political \nscience from the University of Iowa. He served as chairman of the \ndepartment for many years. In 1987, he wrote a book on the department's \nhistory for the Iowa State Historical Society. Following his \nretirement, he continued to teach long-distance education classes until \nthe time of his death. Dr. Ross began his association with long-\ndistance education while serving in the Navy on the aircraft carrier \nUSS Manilla Bay.\n  He was an expert on local government and politics. He wrote several \nbooks in his field, served as executive assistant to Governor Norman \nErbe in the 1960s, and was the mayor of University Heights for more \nthan 10 years.\n  Dr. Ross influenced numerous students over the years. Online \ncondolences included postings by two city managers who said Dr. Ross \nguided their vocations. Other postings came from those with fond \nmemories of Dr. Ross' friendliness, approachability, and honesty.\n  As Joel and Sandy Barkan of Washington, DC, wrote: ``He was devoted \nto the University, a good steward, and a straight shooter in the Iowa \ntradition. He will be missed.''\n  That is exactly the sentiment I have about Dr. Ross.\n  In 1957 and 1958, Dr. Ross was my professor at the University of Iowa \nwhen I was pursuing course work toward a doctorate in political \nscience. As an authority on state and local government, he would have \nbeen my adviser on my dissertation topic, which was the reorganization \nof state government to save money.\n  Professor Ross was an expert and very well-regarded in his field, \nsought after for decades by the news media for his sharp insight into \nIowa politics. He combined his significant knowledge with a plain-\nspoken common sense that cut to the chase. For example, in assessing \nthe Democratic Presidential caucus fight in 2000, Dr. Ross was quoted \nas saying of candidate Bill Bradley, who was slow to respond to attacks \nfrom Al Gore, ``He muffed it pretty badly.'' That was the bottom line \nin just five words.\n  So Professor Ross was generous with his insight. He also was generous \nwith his time. To a 23-year-old graduate student, as I was, an \naccomplished scholar can be intimidating and hard to approach. Dr. Ross \nwas the opposite. He always had time for his students, and all of these \nyears later, that's the first impression that comes to mind when I \nthink of him.\n  I didn't finish my doctoral program, but that had nothing to do with \nDr. Ross. I ran for the State legislature instead. With his generosity \nof spirit and knowledge, Dr. Ross helped me to find my calling, as he \nexcelled at his. Iowans are fortunate to have had such an outstanding \nperson in our lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/03/senate-section/article/S3033-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COLONEL KEITH ZUEGEL\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I want to take a moment to honor \nCOL Keith W. Zuegel of the U.S. Air Force on the occasion of his \nretirement after 28 years of dedicated service to our country.\n  After graduating from the Air Force Academy in 1982, Colonel Zuegel \nlogged nearly 2,000 flying hours across four aircraft and six \nairframes, including the F-111 ``Aardvark,'' achieving a master \nnavigator rating. He skillfully served in numerous operational tours, \nincluding assignments and experience ranging from the United States to \nEurope and the Pacific. Of distinct importance, his skills were put to \nthe test during the opening night of Operation Desert Storm. On January \n17, 1991, young Captain Zuegel distinguished himself in an attack on a \nheavily fortified target near Ali Al Salem Airfield, Kuwait. In the \nface of heavy antiaircraft fire and surface-to-air-missiles launched \nagainst them, Captain Zuegel, the F-111 weapons system officer, and his \naircraft commander elected to continue their attack. Their destruction \nof a hardened aircraft shelter greatly diminished the Iraqi Air Force, \nclearing the way for the eventual ground campaign to liberate Kuwait. \nHis heroic combat efforts that evening earned him a Silver Star.\n  Following his operational assignments, Colonel Zuegel served in a \nvariety of staff assignments, working for the Secretary of the Air \nForce, the Commander of U.S. European Command, the Commander of Joint \nForces Command, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His \nexperiences in those posts served him well, preparing him for the ``big \nleagues''--Director of the Air Force's Congressional Budget and \nAppropriation Liaison Office. In this role, he directed all Air Force \ncongressional appropriations work on the hill for the last 3 years, as \nwell as routine engagements and testimony by the Air Force's senior \nleadership with Congress. Through those interactions, my fellow Members \nof Congress have come to view him as a trusted ambassador in blue. The \nSecretary of the Air Force said that ``Zeugs is a key guy in the Air \nForce,'' while the chairman of both defense appropriations \nsubcommittees lauded his efforts. Speaking personally, I have \nbenefitted from Colonel Zuegel's work arranging congressional travel \nmore than once and have always found him to be not only a consummate \nprofessional and an astute representative of the Air Force but also a \ngracious host and a wonderful travelling companion.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in expressing our deep appreciation \nto Colonel Zuegel for his outstanding service. His character and \ndedication demonstrate the best of our Armed Forces. Colonel Zuegel has \nbeen a friend to my office, my constituents in North Dakota, and me. On \nthe occasion of his retirement, I wish Keith and his family all the \nvery best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/03/senate-section/article/S3033-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JANE KEATING\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Taxpayer \nAdvocate Jane Keating. Ms. Keating will be retiring in April 2010 after \n38 years of service to this country.\n  Former Oregon Governor Tom McCall once said, ``Heroes are not giant \nstatues framed against a red sky. They are people who say, ``This is my \ncommunity, and it is my responsibility to make it better.'' Jane \nKeating truly is a hero, for she has devoted much of her life to making \nthe United States and her community better.\n  Jane Keating began her career with the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, \nin 1972 as a tax auditor in Los Angeles. Jane held successively \nresponsible managerial positions with the IRS before coming to my home \nState of Oregon in 1985 as chief of the Taxpayer Service Division.\n  Because of Jane's outstanding service to the taxpayers, she was \nselected as the Taxpayer Advocate in August 1996. Jane has led this \noffice with professionalism, integrity, and a sense of dedication to \nthe taxpayers she serves. Her colleagues, her employees, and the public \nrespect Jane for the excellent service she provided for so many years.\n  It is an honor for me to recognize Ms. Jane Keating for her service \nto this country and to her community. She is indeed a true Oregon \nhero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/03/senate-section/article/S3033-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3033-S3034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13338 OF MAY 11, 2004, WITH \nRESPECT TO THE BLOCKING OF PROPERTY OF CERTAIN PERSONS AND PROHIBITION \n   OF EXPORTATION AND RE-EXPORTATION OF CERTAIN GOODS TO SYRIA--PM 51\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency, unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Missouri relative to urging \n     the Untied States Congress to strongly support the \n     continuation of horse processing in the United States and to \n     offer incentives that help create horse processing plants \n     throughout the United States; to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 8\n\n       Whereas, horse processing is the most tightly regulated of \n     any animal harvest, and the horse is the only animal that has \n     its transportation to processing regulated. If horse \n     processing plants are forced to close and export options are \n     eliminated, the Horse Welfare Coalition estimates that 90,000 \n     to 100,000 unwanted horses annually would be exposed to \n     potential abandonment and neglect; and\n       Whereas, the 90,000 to 100,000 additional unwanted horses \n     each year would compete for\n\n[[Page S3036]]\n\n     adoption with the 32,000 wild horses that United States \n     taxpayers are already paying $40 million to shelter and feed; \n     and\n       Whereas, the nation's inadequate, overburdened, and \n     unregulated horse rescue and adoption facilities cannot \n     handle the influx of the approximately 60,000 or more \n     additional horses each year that would result from a \n     harvesting ban, according to the Congressional Research \n     Service; and\n       Whereas, many zoo animal diets rely on equine protein \n     because it mimics what the animal would receive in the wild. \n     Veterinarians and animal nutritionists say it is the \n     healthiest diet for big cats and rare birds. If legislation \n     shuts down horse processing facilities, the only source for \n     this meat that is inspected by the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA) will be eliminated: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the members of the Missouri Senate, Ninety-\n     fifth General Assembly, First Regular Session, the House of \n     Representatives concurring therein, hereby urge the United \n     States Congress to strongly support the continuation of horse \n     processing in the United States and to offer incentives that \n     help create horse processing plants throughout the United \n     States, such as state-inspected horse harvest for export; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Missouri General Assembly \n     strongly encourage Congress to support new horse processing \n     facilities and the continuation of existing facilities on \n     both the state and national level; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Missouri General Assembly \n     urge Congress to oppose any legislation introduced in the \n     111th Congress that would restrict the transportation and \n     processing of horses in the United States and \n     internationally; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Missouri General Assembly \n     support the location of USDA-approved horse processing \n     facilities on state, tribal, or private lands under mutually-\n     acceptable and market-driven land leases and, if necessary, a \n     mutually-acceptable assignment of revenues that meet the \n     needs of all parties involved with the facility; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Missouri Senate be \n     instructed to prepare properly inscribed copies of this \n     resolution for the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and the \n     members of the Missouri Congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/03/senate-section/article/S3036-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LIEBERMAN, from the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs, with amendments:\n       S. 707.

Mr. President, I am honored once again to submit this \nresolution to the Senate commemorating our Nation's law enforcement \nofficers and National Peace Officers Memorial Day. The Senate's \nofficial recognition of National Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police \nWeek is a tradition I am\n\n[[Page S3038]]\n\nproud to carry out each year, and I look forward to the Senate taking \nup and passing this resolution.\n  In 2009, 116 law enforcement officers died while serving in the line \nof duty. We honor their memory. Though this is a decrease from 2008, it \nis no less tragic a loss to our Federal and State law enforcement \ncommunity and to their families and friends. Each year we commemorate \nthe bravery of so many in law enforcement, and our Nation's peace \nofficers deserve our commitment to provide them with the tools they \nneed to stay safe and to do their jobs as effectively as they can.\n  Currently, more than 900,000 men and women work tirelessly to protect \nour communities, our schools, and our children. They investigate and \napprehend the most violent criminals and strive to keep our communities \nsafe and secure. Since the first recorded police death in 1792, the \nnames of 18,983 law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice have been added to the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial.\n  I also take this opportunity to recognize that the names of 324 \nfallen officers will be added to the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial on May 13 during a candlelight vigil held in their honor. \nThese are officers from the past and present whose memory will be \npreserved for all time at the memorial, ensuring that their bravery and \nsacrifice will not be forgotten. I especially want to recognize two \nbrave Vermonters who gave their lives in the line of duty, and whose \nnames will be added to the Memorial this year: John Henry Collette of \nthe Addison County Sheriff's Office, died July 17, 1932, and Robert \nDaniel Rossier of the Vermont Highway Patrol, died September 9, 1935.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day provides the people of the \nUnited States, in their communities, in their State capitals, and in \nthe Nation's Capital, with the opportunity to honor and reflect on the \nextraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by those \nmembers of our police forces. More than 20,000 peace officers are \nexpected to gather in Washington in the days leading up to May 15, to \njoin with the families of their fallen comrades. It is right that the \nSenate show its respect on this occasion, and I am proud to honor their \nservice and their memory. I urge all Senators to join me in approving \nthis resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/03/senate-section/article/S3038-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 512--DESIGNATING JUNE 2010 AS ``NATIONAL APHASIA \n   AWARENESS MONTH'' AND SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF \n                                APHASIA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 512\n\n       Whereas aphasia is a communication impairment caused by \n     brain damage that typically results from a stroke;\n       Whereas aphasia can also occur with other neurological \n     disorders, such as a brain tumor;\n       Whereas many people with aphasia also have weakness or \n     paralysis in the right leg and right arm, usually due to \n     damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls \n     language and movement on the right side of the body;\n       Whereas the effects of aphasia may include a loss of or \n     reduction in the ability to speak, comprehend, read, and \n     write, but the intelligence of a person with aphasia remains \n     intact;\n       Whereas, according to the National Institute of \n     Neurological Disorders and Stroke (referred to in this \n     preamble as the ``NINDS''), stroke is the third-leading cause \n     of death in the United States, ranking behind heart disease \n     and cancer;\n       Whereas stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term \n     disability in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that there are about 5,000,000 \n     stroke survivors in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that people in the United \n     States suffer about 750,000 strokes per year, with \n     approximately \\1/3\\ of the strokes resulting in aphasia;\n       Whereas, according to the NINDS, aphasia affects at least \n     1,000,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that more than 200,000 people \n     in the United States acquire the disorder each year;\n       Whereas the National Aphasia Association is a unique \n     organization that provides communication strategies, support, \n     and education for people with aphasia and their caregivers \n     throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas, as an advocacy organization for people with \n     aphasia and their caregivers, the National Aphasia \n     Association envisions a world that recognizes the ``silent'' \n     disability of aphasia and provides opportunity and \n     fulfillment for people affected by aphasia: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2010 as ``National Aphasia Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) supports efforts to increase awareness of aphasia;\n       (3) recognizes that strokes, a primary cause of aphasia, \n     are the third-largest cause of death and disability in the \n     United States;\n       (4) acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and \n     study in order to find new solutions for individuals \n     experiencing aphasia and their caregivers;\n       (5) supports efforts to make the voices of people with \n     aphasia heard, because people with aphasia are often unable \n     to communicate with others; and\n       (6) encourages all people in the United States to observe \n     National Aphasia Awareness Month with appropriate events and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/03/senate-section/article/S3038-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3038-S3039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3762.

Mr. SCHUMER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 3217, to promote the financial stability of the \nUnited States by improving accountability and transparency in the \nfinancial system, to end ``too big to fail'', to protect the American \ntaxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive \nfinancial services practices, and for other purposes, which was ordered \nto lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title X, add the following:\n\n              Subtitle I--Financial Consumers Association\n\n     SEC. 1121. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Financial Consumers \n     Association Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 1122. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) financial services consumers and depositors are an \n     integral part of the financial system and are affected by the \n     safety and soundness of the financial industry;\n       (2) deceptive, illegal, and speculative financial practices \n     have harmed public confidence in the integrity and fairness \n     of many United States financial institutions, and threaten \n     the basic strengths of the United States economic system;\n       (3) contributing to the loss of public confidence are \n     perceptions of inadequate oversight and insufficient \n     independence between financial institutions and their \n     regulators;\n       (4) major factors contributing to the recent financial \n     crisis include regulatory failures to adequately police the \n     financial services markets for crime, unfair or deceptive \n     practices, fraud, lack of transparency, and mismanagement;\n       (5) the financial industry has enjoyed virtually unlimited \n     access to represent its interest before Congress, the courts, \n     and State and Federal regulators, while financial services \n     consumers have had limited representation before Congress and \n     financial regulatory entities;\n       (6) the resources available for organized representation of \n     consumers in the financial industry need to be expanded so \n     citizens can better monitor the performance of State and \n     Federal agencies that regulate their financial institutions \n     and participate in public policy debates regarding the \n     oversight of these financial institutions;\n       (7) the creation of a public purpose, democratically \n     controlled, self-funded, nationwide membership association of \n     financial services consumers is an effective way to enhance \n     the representation of consumers in the financial services \n     industry and to meet the expanding information needs of \n     consumers in the financial services market;\n       (8) the requirement that informational and statutory \n     inserts be included in the paper mailings and email \n     correspondence, digital or other electronic means, of covered \n     persons is essential to the creation, maintenance, and \n     funding of such an association;\n       (9) the Federal Government has a substantial interest in \n     the creation of a public purpose, democratically controlled, \n     self-funded, nationwide membership association of financial \n     services consumers to enhance their representation and to \n     effectively combat unsound financial practices;\n       (10) the creation of such an Association is not meant to \n     substitute for, but augment, the activities of existing or \n     future regulatory bodies whose sole or partial focus is the \n     protection of financial services consumers; and\n       (11) consumers have more complex financial choices today \n     than ever before, but not enough information with which to \n     make those choices.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to establish a public purpose, nonprofit, \n     democratically controlled, membership association of \n     financial services consumers;\n       (2) to give the Association a mandate to inform and \n     represent financial services consumers, and to further the \n     effective and vigorous oversight of covered persons;\n       (3) to establish democratic rules of governance for the \n     Association; and\n       (4) to require any covered person to periodically include \n     inserts concerning the Association within their statements \n     and billing statements to financial services consumers.\n\n     SEC. 1123.
