Mr. President, the power of our democratic system is that \neveryone has a voice. The responsibility of that system is that once \nthe votes are cast and counted, everyone must then accept and abide by \nthe outcome. I deeply regret that too many of my Republican colleagues \nhave yet to learn that lesson.\n  Let me explain as clearly as I can what happened in the Senate \nyesterday and what is continuing to happen this morning. I want to \nexplain it especially for the tens of thousands of Nevadans and 2.5 \nmillion Americans waiting for the emergency unemployment assistance \nthey have been told is on the way.\n  Yesterday afternoon, the Senate moved, at long last, to within one \nstep--one simple-majority vote--of passing long-overdue help for the \nunemployed. This is emergency help for those who have exhausted their \ninsurance benefits because these days it takes longer than ever before \nin recent memory to find a job. This is help for people who have lost \ntheir jobs through no fault of their own. Although they are still out \nof work, it is not for lack of trying. These are people who have tried \nand tried and tried to find work, who scour job listings, who send out \nresumes, who fill out applications, who go to interviews, but who have \nnot had any luck for weeks and months and, in some cases, multiple \nyears. At last count, there is only one open job for every five \ndesperate Americans to fill it.\n  So after several tries and with the help of two courageous and good \nRepublican Senators from Maine--Snowe and Collins--yesterday we moved \ncloser to that last step by an overwhelming vote, a vote of 60 to 40. \nIn the unique world of the U.S. Senate, 60 to 40 can be seen as a \nrazor-thin margin, but by any reasonable measure, it is a landslide. \nThat vote, by the way, was entirely in line with the wishes of the \npeople we represent--the people of Nevada, the people of New Mexico, \nall 50 States--who overwhelmingly demand that we--Republicans, \nDemocrats, and Independents--pass this aid. The support for this bill \ncomes from all over the country, both from those fortunate enough to \ncollect a paycheck and those desperate to get an unemployment check.\n  By Senate rules, the maximum of 30 hours can elapse between the \nsecond to\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\nthe last vote and the final vote, which requires just a simple majority \nof 51 or whatever the majority would be at the time. During those 30 \nhours, not a single letter or a single number in the bill will change. \nIn other words, we have to wait more than a day before we can see if \nhalf of the Senate supports the exact same bill a supermajority \nsupported the day before. That might not make much sense for those who \ndo not follow the Senate every day or even those who follow the Senate \nevery day. I understand that. In fact, historically, both sides have \nbeen able to come together and reasonably say: 60 is more than 51, so \nlet's just move on. They have said it. They have said: It is not our \ntime to waste; it is the American people's time. But that is just not \nhow things work in the new Senate and not with this Republican \nleadership. The minority--which, it is worth repeating, has already \nlost the debate and lost the vote on this issue--has decided to squeeze \nout every last second of that time, until they have no more delaying \ntools at their disposal, until they have no more procedural tricks up \ntheir sleeves, until they can no longer forcibly keep emergency \nunemployment checks out of the hands of the desperately unemployed.\n  The Republican leadership, supported by the overwhelming majority of \nits caucus, has stood--actually, what they have done is stand in front \nof a burning house and they have said: Everyone wants us to put out the \nfire, but we are going to sit back and wait a while before we turn on \nthe firehoses. This really is a dark day in the Senate and some feel \nbrings shame to the institution. But more than that, it hurts the very \npeople we were sent here to help. Why would someone in public service \ndo such a thing? Why would they be so callous? I do not know. I am \nreally at a loss.\n  Perhaps the overwhelming majority of Republicans think that since \nthey have turned their backs on the unemployed for so many months, what \nis another few days? Perhaps they think that when unemployment goes up, \ntheir poll numbers go up also. Perhaps they look at this widespread \nmisfortune and see an opening for their political fortunes or perhaps \nthey have convinced themselves that the longer the unemployed suffer, \nthe less likely they are to notice who is holding back the relief they \nneed.\n\n  It has long since been established that the unnecessary delays the \nSenate Republicans have forced surpass every possible historical record \nand defy every historical precedent. They defy both fairness and logic. \nBut when we look back at the unparalleled abuses of this new Senate, \nthis will be among the lowest points.\n  It is abundantly clear there are differences of opinion in this \nChamber on who is worthy of unemployment insurance and on how to fund \nthe emergency assistance. Differences of opinion are why we are here. \nBut that is no longer the debate. We have already fought that fight. In \nfact, we fought it over and over these past weeks. Now it is over. \nWhether by 60 to 40 or 100 to 0, it is done.\n  So this is where we stand: The votes have been cast and counted. The \nHouse has overwhelmingly voted to extend emergency aid. The Senate has \noverwhelmingly voted to extend emergency aid. The President sits, pen \nin hand, ready to sign this bill into law the minute it lands on his \ndesk. As soon as he does, the checks will go out and so will the fire.\n  Millions of Americans are waiting but not for the spoils that will \nmake them rich or jackpots that will help them buy luxuries they do not \nneed. No, millions are waiting for a fraction of their old income, \nchecks that will help them put food on the table this week, keep a roof \nover their heads this month, and keep the air-conditioning on this \nsummer. But the clock continues to tick. The unemployed continue to \nsuffer. And too many of our Republican colleagues--who for years have \nproven they have never seen an economic crisis they could not turn into \na political opportunity--continue to prove they have never seen an \nopportunity they cannot turn into a crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/21/senate-section/article/S6040-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later this morning, the President of \nthe United States will sign a financial regulation bill that was sold \nto the American people as a way of reining in Wall Street. Anyone who \nbelieves that did not read beyond the cover sheet because if they did, \nthey would discover instead a far-reaching government intrusion that \nwas endorsed by Wall Street and opposed by Main Street. Citibank thinks \nit is great. Your local florist thinks it will undermine their \nbusiness. When you cut through all the talking points about what \nfinancial regulation will do, the practical, real-world effect of this \nbill in the near term will be job loss. That is the real story.\n  For more than a year and a half, the President and his Democratic \nallies on Capitol Hill have pushed an antibusiness, antijobs agenda on \nthe American people in the form of one massive government intrusion \nafter another. And then they celebrate. Well, Americans are not \ncelebrating. Three million of them have lost their jobs since the \nDemocrats launched their stimulus. The folks who lost those jobs \ncertainly are not celebrating. Small business owners are already being \nhammered by the health care bill. They are not celebrating. And the \npeople who thought this Wall Street bill was supposed to rein in Wall \nStreet? Well, they are not celebrating either. They are upset, and \nrightly so.\n  As I stand here this morning, millions of Americans are struggling to \nfind jobs. Yet all they see in Washington is Democrats passing massive \nbills that at their core seem to have one thing in common: more job \nloss. It is almost as if it is a prerequisite for any Democratic \nlegislation--if it leads to more job loss, they will pass it. Americans \nare tired of this kind of ``reform.'' Job-stifling taxes, regulations, \ngovernment intrusion--these appear to be the three pillars of every \nDemocratic legislative effort. They are also the three things lawmakers \ncan do that are guaranteed to kill more jobs.\n  That is why it should not be a surprise to anyone that unemployment \nhas been scraping double digits since Democrats started ramming these \nso-called reform bills through Congress.\n  As a result of the health care bill, small businesses, student loan \ncenters, tanning salons, medical device manufacturers, hospitals, and \nmajor American employers have all either laid off employees or are \ntrying to figure out how not to. Just this week, we read a report that \nduring the process of the auto bailout, this administration decided to \nshut down auto dealers, without cause, effectively costing thousands of \nAmericans their jobs.\n  And now a financial regulatory bill that does nothing to reform the \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises that many people believe to have been \nat the root of the financial crisis this bill grew out of, that was \nmeant to rein in Wall Street but now is supported by some of Wall \nStreet's biggest banks, and that is meant to help the economy but which \nis expected to stifle growth and kill more jobs.\n  The American people are connecting the dots. They do not think this \nbill will solve the problems in the financial sector any more than they \nthink the health care bill will lead to lower costs or better care, any \nmore than the stimulus lowered unemployment.\n  Then there are all the unintended consequences of these bills. Just \nyesterday, we learned that the financial regulatory bill--a bill that \nwas supposed to put an end to the notion that some institutions are too \nbig to fail--may now have created a new set of institutions that are \ntoo big to fail. It was reported yesterday that some of the economists \nand experts who have studied this bill are worried it could leave \ntaxpayers on the hook in the event a new derivatives clearinghouse \ntakes on too much risk.\n  So a bill that was originally meant to prevent a situation such as \nthe one we faced in November of 2008 that was meant to prevent bailouts \nwill add to the list of institutions that are counting on getting \nbailed out.\n  That is on top of all the new regulations businesses are going to \nhave to deal with as a result of this bill.\n\n[[Page S6041]]\n\n  All told, this bill would impose 533 new regulations on individuals \nand small businesses--regulations that will inevitably lead to the kind \nof confusion and uncertainty that will make it even harder for \nstruggling businesses to dig themselves out of the recession.\n  It is just this kind of uncertainty that will continue to deter \nlending and freeze credit as lenders wait to see how they will be \naffected by the new regulations. And it is just this kind of \nuncertainty that businesses cite time and again as one of the greatest \nchallenges to our economic recovery.\n  The White House will declare this bill a victory. But for millions of \nAmericans struggling to find work, for millions of small business \nowners bracing themselves for all the new regulations they will have to \ndeal with, or ordinary Americans who wanted to see an end to the \nbailouts, this bill is no victory. When out-of-work Americans see \nDemocrats celebrating today, what they will see are lawmakers who have \ncompletely and totally lost touch and who have lost the trust of the \nAmerican people.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, some believe that if you say something long \nenough, even if it is without any factual basis, people will start \nbelieving it.\n  To think that banks--Wall Street--liked Wall Street reform is a \nstretch beyond our ability to comprehend. We needed to do something \nbecause Wall Street hurt America. They had a pretty good deal going \nthere. They could use our money and gamble it--different than Las \nVegas. They could gamble our money, and if they won, they kept it; if \nthey lost, they came back to us for help. That is a good deal, and we \nhave stopped that.\n  Does anyone think we should leave things the way they are? That was a \ncrisis waiting to happen again. George Bush's Secretary of the Treasury \nHank Paulson, when this bill passed, said it was a fine piece of \nlegislation. I am paraphrasing what he said. Knowing Hank, that is \nabout what he said. He liked the legislation, and he should know. He \nwas President Bush's Secretary of the Treasury when this collapse took \nplace.\n  This is all so quite interesting. My friend says that the stimulus \nhas caused job loss. Again, that is without any factual basis. In fact, \nit is just the opposite. It saved or created 3 million jobs. Remember, \nwe still have low unemployment because that started during the Bush \nyears back in 2006 when the economy started faltering. As an example, \nin the last 6 months of the Bush administration, 3 million jobs were \nlost.\n  Health insurance: Always they talk about health insurance. But \nremember, any poll we see today, the majority of the American people \nsupport what we did with health care. My friend was at a meeting we had \nyesterday, and we saw those numbers spread across the film we were \nshown.\n  Also, the reasoning is quite unique. My friend says we bailed out the \nauto industry. Isn't that a good thing we did? Isn't it a good thing \ntoday in America we have an automobile manufacturing sector? If it had \nbeen up to them, General Motors would be gone. If it were up to them, \nFord Motor Company would probably be gone. Chrysler would definitely be \ngone. We decided they needed help, just as New York City needed help 25 \nyears ago or so. They came out very strong. We are making money on what \nwe did in investing in Detroit's automobile industry.\n  It is also interesting--I have seen this at home--some of my \nRepublican friends criticized me for the bailout, the stimulus. Then I \nwas criticized because I did not get more money.\n  In a little bit, I am going to go down to one of the Federal \nbuildings for a signing of the Wall Street reform bill. What an \nimportant day for this country. After this financial collapse, we have \nreined in Wall Street. That is a day for celebration.\n  Think how much better this bill could have been had we had a little \ncooperation from our friends on the other side of the aisle. But we did \nplenty and, as has been said and written, it is the most significant \nchange in the financial world since the Great Depression.\n  The mere fact that one says something that is without foundation a \nlot of times and simply is untrue does not make it truthful the more \ntimes one says it.\n  Will the Chair announce the business for the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/21/senate-section/article/S6041-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today I rise to speak on the nomination \nof Solicitor General Elena Kagan to be a Justice on the United States \nSupreme Court.\n  After much consideration, I cannot support this nomination. I have \nbeen following this progress very closely. I have been reading her \nmemos and other documents from her career, and I watched her \nconfirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. I met with \nher one on one and was able to ask her eight different questions. \nUnfortunately, I find her unsuitable to serve a lifetime appointment as \na member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  When I spoke on the nomination of Justice Sotomayor last year, I \npointed out the problems of the Supreme Court and other judges trying \nto replace Congress and State legislatures. Important social issues \nhave been taken out of the political process and decided by unelected \njudges. I can say for certain that this is not the way the Founding \nFathers and the authors of the Constitution intended for it to work. \nThe creation of law is reserved for elected legislatures chosen by the \npeople. The Supreme Court is not a nine-person legislature created to \ninteract with or replace the U.S. Congress.\n  When judges and Justices take the law into their own hands and act as \nif they are a legislative body, it flies in the face of the \nConstitution. Because of this, whether it is the Supreme Court or the \nlower courts, many people have lost respect for our judicial system. \nThis cannot continue to happen.\n  In addition to the obvious constitutional concerns, if some day the \npublic and the rest of the political system begin to tune out the \ncourts and ignore their decisions altogether, it would be very \ndangerous for our country. I opposed Justice Sotomayor's nomination \nbecause I did not feel she understood this. I am afraid I have to say \nthe same for Ms. Kagan.\n\n  The first problem I wish to discuss is her lack of experience. \nAccording to a Congressional Research Service analysis, Justices \nwithout prior judicial experience practiced law for an average of 21 \nyears before their appointment to the Supreme Court. Recent polls have \nshown that an overwhelming majority of Americans feel that prior \njudicial experience is an important qualification to be a Justice on \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Of modern Supreme Court Justices, former Chief Justice William \nRehnquist was the last person nominated without judicial experience, \nand that was almost 40 years ago. However, Chief Justice Rehnquist was \na practicing attorney for years prior to his nomination.\n  Ms. Kagan herself said:\n\n       It is an embarrassment that the President and Senate do not \n     always insist, as a threshold requirement, that a nominee's \n     previous accomplishments evidence an ability not merely to \n     handle but to master the ``craft'' aspects of being a judge.\n\n  Prior to her appointment to the Solicitor General's job in 2009, Ms. \nKagan was a stranger to the courtroom. She never tried a case to \nverdict or served as a judge. She argued her first case as\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\na lawyer less than 1 year ago. While Ms. Kagan has a very extensive \nbackground in the law, both academically and politically, I do not \nbelieve she has mastered the craft of judging.\n  I have serious concerns that Ms. Kagan will have a very hard time \nseparating her personal views from the legal interpretation of the \nConstitution. While Ms. Kagan was dean of Harvard Law School, she \nbanned military recruiters from the Harvard campus during a time of war \nbecause she believed the don't ask, don't tell law, developed by the \nClinton administration in which she served--she called it a ``moral \noutrage'' of the ``first order.''\n  She worked for Bill Clinton in his administration. She argued that \nthe Solomon amendment, which Congress passed, despite its plain text \nand plain congressional intent behind it, allowed law schools to bar \naccess to military recruiters. Ms. Kagan herself wrote an e-mail to the \nHarvard community that in barring recruiters, she was acting in the \nhope that the Federal Government would choose not to enforce the law of \nthe land. I find it very troubling that a nominee to the Supreme Court \nwould change school policy and disregard Federal law during a time of \nwar because of her own personal beliefs. Fortunately, not a single \nSupreme Court Justice agreed with her position and noted that her \ninterpretation was rather clearly not what Congress had in mind.\n  As associate White House counsel to President Bill Clinton, Ms. Kagan \nplayed a critical role in the debate over partial birth abortions and \ndid everything she could to halt legislation going through Congress to \nban that horrible procedure. She worked with the medical groups \nsupporting the practice, rewriting their scientific conclusions to \nbetter reflect her preference on partial-birth abortion. The Supreme \nCourt relied on this language in their decision to overturn a Nebraska \nlaw banning this procedure. It appalls me that someone with no medical \nbackground would try to alter scientific conclusions to defend such a \nmonstrosity of a procedure.\n  In one memo, she advised President Clinton to support a Democratic \nalternative in order to ``sustain [his] credibility on [the issue] and \nprevent Congress from overriding [his] veto.'' This is concerning \nbehavior from someone who now wishes to serve on the highest Court in \nthe land. If she was willing to rewrite scientific conclusions, who is \nto say how far she would go with rewriting the Constitution?\n  I also have serious concerns about Ms. Kagan's hostility to second \namendment rights. While she was clerking for the Supreme Court Justice \nThurgood Marshall, Ms. Kagan was asked to consider a case similar to \nthe 2008 Heller case, in which the Court struck down the DC gun ban and \nfound that the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and \nbear arms. In examining this earlier case, Sandidge v. U.S., she wrote \nthat:\n\n       Mr. Sandidge's sole argument is that the District of \n     Columbia's firearm statute violates his constitutional right \n     to ``keep and bear arms.'' I am not sympathetic.\n       Those were her words.\n\n  It is not the job of the Supreme Court or any other court of the \nland, for that matter, to be sympathetic. That belongs best in \nlegislatures which can reflect the wishes of the people who voted for \nthe Members of those bodies.\n  Recently, supporters of individual rights and liberties won an \nimportant victory when the Supreme Court ruled in the McDonald case \nthat the second amendment was a fundamental right that is binding to \nall the States. I fear her appointment to the Supreme Court could undo \nthe progress from the Heller and McDonald decisions that recognize \nAmericans have the right to defend themselves. Throughout her \nconfirmation hearings, Ms. Kagan repeatedly stated she would accept the \nHeller and McDonald decisions as settled law. In her confirmation \nhearings, Justice Sotomayor also appeared to accept the second \namendment rights. Specifically, Justice Sotomayor said she understood \n`` . . . the individual right fully that the Supreme Court recognized \nin Heller.'' However, in her first year on the Court, she joined the \ndissenting opinion in McDonald saying:\n\n       I can find nothing in the Second Amendment's text, history, \n     or underlying rationale that could warrant characterizing it \n     as ``fundamental'' insofar as it seeks to protect the keeping \n     and bearing of arms for private self-defense purposes.\n\n  Finally, I was not satisfied with Ms. Kagan's responses regarding the \ncommerce clause and the limits of power of the Federal Government. \nRight now, we have the government taking over each sector of our \neconomy, from banking, as the majority leader and minority leader spoke \nabout, and the auto bailouts, which they both spoke about, to an \nunprecedented takeover of our health care system. In her testimony, Ms. \nKagan left no doubt that she sees virtually no limit on congressional \npower. This is extremely frightening to me, to say the very least.\n  The Framers of the Constitution made it very clear what the role of \nthe Court should be. Anyone appointed to the Supreme Court must be \nwilling to evaluate laws as they are written under the plain meaning of \nthe Constitution. A Justice should not be appointed in order to achieve \nspecific results in any case. We have no judicial record of Ms. Kagan's \nto look at to see how she would rule in any of these such cases. We \nonly have a record as an academic and a political adviser to look at as \nher qualifications to be a Supreme Court Justice. While Ms. Kagan has a \nvery impressive background, I do not have faith that she would fully \nrespect the roles of the judiciary and the legislative branch.\n  I am very sorry to say for just the second time while serving in the \nSenate that I will have to oppose a nomination to the Supreme Court, \nand I am not happy to do so. However, it is the constitutional role of \nthe Senate to provide confirmation for this position and my duty as a \nSenator to be a part of this process. On viewing the record of \nSolicitor General Kagan, I do not find her to be a suitable candidate \nfor a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and will vote \nagainst her whenever the Senate considers her nomination.\n  I thank the President, yield the floor, and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/21/senate-section/article/S6042-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6042-S6044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate voted for cloture on \nthe unemployment insurance extension bill. Unfortunately, we are still \ndelaying and deferring the final vote on this measure. This is \nessential to millions of Americans who need the money they receive--\nwhich, frankly, it is not a huge amount. In Rhode Island, the average \nweekly unemployment compensation is $360 a week. But they need to have \nsome certainty that this program is going to be there at least for the \nnext several months.\n  We have made a lot of points rhetorically. Now it is time to take the \nfinal vote, to move forward, and to deal with a more fundamental issue; \nthat is, how to create the jobs--now that we are providing some \nassistance to those who are unemployed. How do we go ahead and further \ncreate jobs in this economy so our unemployment rolls shrink?\n  That task is challenging. We have taken 2 months now to get to this \njuncture. In the past, extending unemployment compensation was a \nbipartisan initiative. It was done routinely and repeatedly. It was \nalways extended as long as the unemployment rate was at least 7.4 \npercent. Today the unemployment rate nationally is 9.5 percent. In my \nState of Rhode Island it is 12 percent. We are not alone. There are \nmany States that are very much mired in a huge economic crisis.\n  The other factor of this unemployment situation is that it has been a \nlong-term unemployment for so many people, nearly half of those \nunemployed. So the money they put aside, the rainy day money, the money \nthey put in the coffee can for that special occasion or that special \ntreat, has long been exhausted. This unemployment compensation is \nabsolutely essential for people.\n  There are many on the other side who will stand and say: We are all \nfor unemployment compensation; we just want to pay for it. Well, \nhistorically, we have not paid for it. It is truly an emergency \nexpenditure.\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\n  The other factor that is critical to notice is that unemployment \ncompensation does not add to the structural deficit. That is in sharp \ncontrast to the tax cuts, which my colleagues on the other side are \nurging be extended without paying for them, and in sharp contrast to \nthe largest expansion of an entitlement program since the 1960s, the \nMedicare Part D Program, which was not paid for. Those programs do add \nto the structural deficit because they are not replenished periodically \nin the good times because people qualify for them as soon as they hit \nan age--65--or as soon as they qualify by filing their income taxes. \nThose are structural deficit issues. Yet the other side says that is \nnot important. I can't figure that out.\n  If the deficit is so overwhelming, so all-consuming, then why are my \ncolleagues on the Republican side, first, suggesting we extend all the \ntax cuts of the Bush years without any offsets; and why did they, in \nthe past, vote for the creation of Medicare Part D, really? Why did \nthey vote for 2 wars that were unpaid for? There is something \ninconsistent in that.\n  As I pointed out, unemployment compensation is not a problem of \nstructural deficit because, as the economy recovers, people will \ncontinue to pay into the unemployment compensation trust fund through \npayroll taxes. In good times those funds increase so that in the \nunfortunate times we can provide assistance.\n  What we are doing now with this legislation is recognizing that this \nis a particularly challenging moment for families and for States, and \nthey need further assistance. Part of the legislation we have is fully \ncompensating the States for the Extended Benefits program, which, in \nother times, are shared 50 percent by the States and 50 percent by the \nFederal Government. In these extraordinary times, we have to pass this \nlegislation.\n  We also recognize, too, in terms of the offsets of the legislation, \nthat this is part of our overall attempt to stimulate the economy. For \nevery dollar of unemployment benefits, there is at least $1.60 or $1.90 \nin economic activity. It makes sense. When they get that $360 a week, \nthey take whatever resources they have and they go to the store. They \ndon't go off jetting to Europe on a vacation. They go to the store and \nbuy food, clothes, and those things that are essential to their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I am continually baffled by the reluctance, the \nresistance, and the obstruction of the other side in terms of doing \nwhat has to be done, and done promptly. It will be done in a way in \nwhich it will assist the recovery that we are beginning to sense \nthroughout the country.\n  I note the arrival of my colleague, the junior Senator from Rhode \nIsland. I think he is about to take the floor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Rhode \nIsland is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, first of all, let me compliment the \nwork of my senior Senator, Jack Reed, on this issue. When I first came \nto the Senate 3 years ago, Senator Reed had already established his \nreputation as somebody who fought passionately for unemployment \ninsurance for people who were out of work. He understood that a family \nwho is out of work, through no fault of their own, very often has the \nunemployment insurance they and their employers have contributed to as \ntheir only lifeline; that as our vibrant economy goes through ups and \ndowns, there are times when individual families pay a terrible price \nwhen the economy contracts, when jobs are lost, and when individual \nfamilies have to make what Vice President Biden called that ``longest \nwalk'' up the stairs to tell their kids, their families, they have lost \ntheir job.\n  At that time, that lifeline for a hard-working family who, through no \nfault of their own, is out of work is all important. Senator Reed knows \nthat well. He has been a champion on this issue, not just when it has \nbeen at the forefront of national attention as it is right now, but day \nin and day out, constantly fighting for the people in Rhode Island and \nfolks across this country who need this lifeline.\n  I wanted to say a few words to echo Senator Reed's comments. Rhode \nIsland still has 12 percent unemployment. We have the fourth worst \nunemployment of any State in the country. It has been that way month \nafter month after month after month, with individual families paying \nthe terrible price of the economic consequences of something that took \nplace well outside of Rhode Island. It was Wall Street that collapsed. \nIt was the big Wall Street banks. It was the bets by the Wall Street \nbanks in a wild derivatives market, a wild mortgage security market, \nthat tanked this economy, that required emergency action by Congress to \ntry to put it right before a real depression ensued, and that kicked \noff the great recession that we have been suffering since then. That \ngreat recession washed like a tsunami across our country, and it hit \nparticularly hard in my home State of Rhode Island.\n  In Rhode Island, we have 70,000 families who have somebody out of \nwork. It is actually probably more than that because the unemployment \nnumbers tend to undercount the actual harm. But the official count is \nover 70,000 families. I can promise you this: There aren't 70,000 jobs \nwaiting around for those people in Rhode Island. They are just not \nthere.\n  The notion that the Republican side has often developed, which is \nthat unemployment insurance contributes to unemployment; that people \nwho are looking for work need a little bit more motivation to go out \nthere and take a job, and if you could just threaten their families' \nsurvival, threaten their ability to have food on the table, threaten \ntheir ability to stay in their homes, and threaten their ability to \nafford health care, they will then be motivated enough and will go out \nand get those jobs--I don't know where they get that from, but it is \nnot from Rhode Island. We are a hard-working State. We don't have the \njobs to take 70,000 people and put them back to work as this economy \njust haltingly now begins to recover.\n  Six-thousand Rhode Islanders have lost their emergency unemployment \ninsurance benefits because of the stall tactics of the other side of \nthe aisle; 2.5 million Americans across the country have lost their \nbenefits. Those sound like big numbers. Behind every one of those 6,000 \nRhode Islanders is a family story, a story about an individual who has \nto face some hard choices about whether they are able to pay the \nmortgage, whether they are able to buy new clothes for kids when the \nkids go back to school, whether they are able to pay for their \nmedications, whether they are able to simply keep food on the table and \na roof over their heads.\n  It certainly played a crucial part in preventing economic disaster \nfor Sandy in Warwick, RI, who is 60 years old. She has a background in \naccounting. She has been unemployed now for 13 months and is trying to \nfind a job in that tough, tough, tough, Rhode Island economic climate. \nShe has applied for about 100 jobs. She is out there working. She is \nout there trying to find a place where she can put her skills back to \nwork the way she always did, but no luck so far.\n\n  Her lifeline was unemployment insurance. If the Senate Republicans \nhad been successful in their filibuster of this unemployment insurance, \nSandy would have lost what is now her only remaining source of income. \nThe consequences of that, obviously, are catastrophic for Sandy, for \nthe other 6,000 Rhode Islanders in that position, and for 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion Americans around the country.\n  The great argument we hear our friends on the other side make is: We \nunderstand how painful this is going to be. We understand that people \nare going to have to come home and tell their kids we are going to have \nto move. We can't keep our home any longer. You are going to have to \npack up your bedroom, put the stuffed animals in a box, and we are all \ngoing to have to clear out because I simply don't have the income.\n  Crossroads, our biggest shelter in Rhode Island, is packed. We have \npeople sleeping in conference rooms. But the Republicans say: You know, \nwe understand that is tough. We understand if you can't pay for \nmedication for your spouse, that is tough. As people start to think \nabout heading back to school in September, and you can't pay for \nclothes for the kids, you can't pay for pens, pencils, and schoolbooks, \nthat is tough. But something more important is at stake here, they tell \nus, and\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\nthat is our national debt. We have to worry about that more than the \ncare of American families who are out of work, through no fault of \ntheir own, because of the wild spree that Wall Street took under the \nBush administration.\n  I would think more of that argument if it were at least consistent, \nbut it is not consistent. It is an argument that they apply when \nregular working families are out of work through no fault of their own \nbecause of the Wall Street meltdown from the Bush policies. That is \nwhen they get all excited about how important the deficit is. But when \nit comes to, say, oh, tax cuts for billionaires, tax cuts for corporate \nCEOs, well, then a different rule prevails. Then the debt isn't so \nimportant. Then the deficit isn't so important. What is more important \nare the folks with the big salaries--the CEOs earning on average these \ndays 400 times what a regular average salaried worker gets paid--400 \ntimes more every day than the average worker. That is the kind of tax \ncut that is more important than the deficit.\n  I saw this cartoon the other day, and I wanted to share it on the \nSenate floor. I thought it was a pretty good description of where we \nare on this. Here are our friends on the other side. It says ``Senate \nGOP'' on this cranky fellow's hat, and a little cat on the front of the \nboat says ``jobless benefits,'' if you can't read it. The fellow is \nsaying to the little cat on the front of the boat: Too much weight. You \nget off the boat into the water. You are on your own. We don't care. \nActually, it ends at get off the boat. I added the rest. On the back of \nthe boat we see tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  But the Republicans do not see that. They do not worry about that. \nThey are not concerned about that. Since the estate tax went to zero, \nfour estates have been reported in the media of more than $1 billion--\nmore than $1 billion. Each estate has gone through tax free, at a cost \nto the Treasury, at a cost to the deficit and the debt of hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, and not a peep--not a peep--from the other side \nfrom those who are concerned about the deficit, when that is the issue. \nBut you get a poor family out of work, one lifeline left keeping them \nin their home, one lifeline left keeping food on the table, and giving \nthat lifeline the chop is something they are all for. That is something \nthey are all for.\n  Well, fortunately, what happened here in the Senate yesterday is they \nlost. They didn't lose on a fair-and-square up-and-down-majority-rules \nvote. They lost on a 60-40 filibuster vote. They made us win by 20 \npoints. Not just majority rules, the way it is in most places, but they \nforced us to 60-40 and we still won. So the unemployment insurance \nbenefits should begin to flow to those families who are in such \ndistress right now, and wondering how they are going to make it through \nthe next day, through the next moment.\n  But it is not enough for them, once losing the debate, to simply pick \nthemselves up, dust themselves off and, like good sports, go on to the \nnext disagreement. We have other things we will disagree about. Nope. \nThat is asking too much of our friends, unfortunately, to have that \nkind of good sportsmanship--to stand up, get back on the field and go \nback to the battle. We have to burn 30 hours of Senate floor time to no \npurpose. We can't do other work during this period. We can't do \namendments during this period.\n  We know how the vote is going to come out. Literally, no possible \npurpose is accomplished by requiring us to burn the 30 hours, except \ntwo things for sure will happen. One thing for sure that happens is \nthat all those families out there--those 6,000 Rhode Island families, \nthose 2\\1/2\\ million families across the country--will have to wait a \nlittle longer. They have been stretched to the very end of their \nbudgets and they are hanging on by their fingernails. But instead of \nsaying: Fair and square, okay, we tried. We threw up every obstacle we \ncould, but we lost 60-40, so let's go on to the next thing--nope, they \nare going to make them hang on for another 30 hours.\n  The other thing they accomplish through this is that they burn Senate \nfloor time. The Good Lord only gives us so much time. You can't get \nminutes back when they are gone. You can't get hours back when they are \ngone. You can't get days back when they are gone. We have a lot of work \nto do in this Chamber, and our friends on the other side would like to \nhave us do as much work as possible in as little time as possible, \nbecause, frankly, they want as little done as possible. So it actually \nsuits their goal to burn floor time to no effect here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  So that is what we are doing. I am here alone right now. Senator Reed \nwas here alone a minute ago. I suspect that when I leave, we will go \nback into a quorum call and time will tick, tick, tick, tick past with \nnothing being accomplished here. We could be working on jobs \nlegislation. We sure need that. We could be working on energy \nlegislation. We sure need that. There are a host of things Americans \nwant us to be working on. But the Republican side of this Chamber has a \nstrategy to prevent anything from getting done. Their policy is saying \nno, no matter what the question is--that is their answer, no matter the \nproposal--as long it comes from the Obama administration. That is their \npurpose, and they achieve that purpose when they burn this time.\n  So here we are on the Senate floor with time ticking away, second by \nsecond, minute by minute, accomplishing nothing other than burning 30 \nhours that, frankly, belongs to the American public. These are 30 hours \nwe should be accomplishing the public's business, moving on to the next \nissues and going forward.\n  I would hope that, if nothing else, out of the spirit of good \nsportsmanship, our friends on the other side would call this off and \nsay: All right, enough. We wish we had won. We want a world in which \nthe deficit only applies to unemployment benefits for working families \nand we get to dig big holes in the debt and the deficit when it is our \ntax cuts for the wealthy, but we lost on that one. Let us move on. We \nwill take the hand up off the field, we will dust ourselves off and \nmove on to the next one. If for no other reason than good \nsportsmanship, I would hope they would do that and call off this period \nof delay.\n  That would also allow us to get to other business. We may disagree, \nbut we might as well get to the business. We might as well have these \narguments out. We might as well have our fight. Let's not just kill \ntime here. So I hope my colleagues will reconsider. Time ticks away, \nawasting here. Everybody has work to be done. The American people await \nus, particularly on jobs legislation. There is an enormous amount we \ncould do to help them if we could simply get to it.\n  We have a small business bill we are trying to tee up that would \nprovide enormous value to the economy, including in particular Rhode \nIsland, where small business is so important. Small business is the \nheartbeat of Rhode Island's economy. To the extent we can provide \nadditional capital and support for small business, we could get to \nthat. We could be working on that right this minute instead of being \nstuck in this long delay, in this empty Chamber while 30 hours ticks \nuselessly away because our friends simply can't dust themselves off \nafter their defeat, stand up and go on to the next issue. They have to \nforce this long 30-hour stall.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer again for the time, I yield the floor, \nand I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, President \nObama stood with three long-time job seekers and reminded us that out-\nof-work Americans want to find work, and no one here, of course, \nquestions that. I hear every day from Arizonans who look for a job day \nafter day, week after week. They are just getting by.\n  I realize that few things can be more frustrating and demoralizing \nthan struggling to find a job and that the effects of unemployment for \nfamilies are deep and severe.\n  President Obama would have the American people believe congressional \nRepublicans have been blocking an extension of unemployment benefits in \norder to make some political point. He accused us of this again on \nTuesday and claimed we are refusing to help out-of-work Americans.\n  I wish to set the record straight. This is not a dispute about \nextending unemployment benefits. There is broad bipartisan agreement \nthat we should do that. Republicans have voted several times in the \npast to extend benefits. I have.\n  The dispute, rather, is over who should pay for those benefits. \nShould we finance this $34 billion obligation in the short term with a \nloan from a foreign government and pass the tab on to our kids and \ngrandkids or should we pay for it now by cutting other Federal \nspending? That is the question. It is a matter of who is going to pay \nfor the benefits we provide to people.\n  I do not think we should be sending that tab to our kids. I believe \nwe should pay it now. This is our generation. This is our problem \ntoday. We have an obligation to help take care of our fellow citizens \nwhen they are in time of need. We should find a way to pay for that. \nOur kids and grandkids are going to have their own problems in their \nday. We do not need to compound those problems by adding our \nobligations to those that they will need to deal with.\n  Republicans have offered an array of constructive solutions to the \nproblem, proposals to pay for what we are spending, including using \nunspent money from the President's failed stimulus package. Almost half \nthat money remains available.\n  We have tried five times to pass an extension of unemployment \nbenefits that does not add to the debt. But our Democratic colleagues \nhave repeatedly rejected our proposals. So the principal they are \ndefending is not the need for unemployment insurance extension, it is \nthat they will not pass a bill unless it adds to the debt. They will \nnot pass a bill to extend unemployment benefits unless it adds to the \ndebt.\n  The extension likely would have passed weeks ago if Democrats had \nsimply agreed to pay for it now by cutting other Federal spending. In \nthis $3 trillion budget that we have, obviously, there are plenty of \nplaces for us to find the offsets. Our national debt has been increased \nagain and again during this recession. That creates long-term burdens \nfor everyone--the employed, the unemployed, and generations to come.\n  While President Obama argues that we have increased the debt in the \npast to pay for other items, I will note that we were not in the middle \nof a debt crisis back then, for one thing. I suggest we pass a bill \nthat is paid for now and recalibrate efforts to encourage private \nsector job creation.\n  As unemployed Americans know, while unemployment benefits provide a \nlifeline, they are only a temporary fix. They are not a substitute for \nnew private sector jobs. I will venture a guess that everybody who is \nunemployed today would much rather have a job tomorrow than another \ncheck from the government for unemployment benefits.\n  So what do we do to create jobs and get the economy moving again? \nWell, you do not do it by borrowing more money. The President's job-\ncreation initiatives have been a bust. Since his enormous stimulus bill \npassed in February of 2009, the private sector has lost over 2 million \njobs.\n  While there has been some anemic economic growth since the recession \nstarted, employers are still clearly reluctant to hire. That probably \nhas to do with the reality that businesses, both small and large, look \ndown the road. They see massive tax increases beginning next year, on \ntop of all the new regulations imposed by this administration.\n  They hear about a proposed national energy tax and proposed new pro-\nunion policies. So they are reluctant to take a chance on the future \nbecause of all the uncertainty and the burdens we have already placed \nupon them. The key to job creation, and thus helping unemployed \nAmericans, is having stable and sound policies in place for employers \nto make long-term decisions.\n  More spending, taxing, regulating, and debt are not the answers. I \nwould hope we can find a way to extend unemployment benefits without \nasking our children to pay the tab for this generation's problems.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Water Quality\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has \ndominated the headlines since April 20. Because of that tragedy, we are \nmore aware than ever of the important role great water bodies and the \nrivers that feed them play in our economy, our environment, and even \nour sense of who we are as a people.\n  Late last month, the Environment and Public Works Committee reported \nout a number of bills addressing America's precarious water resources. \nThe committee approved a bill to hold BP accountable for the \ndevastation it has caused to the people and the ecosystem of the gulf.\n  As all of America has seen in the morning newspapers and nightly news \naccounts, the current $75 million limit on oilspill liability damages \nrepresents a very small fraction of the actual costs of the damage done \nby BP. Senator Menendez's bill, S. 3305, which the committee adopted, \nwill make sure that BP is legally bound to honor its pledge to pay all \nlegitimate claims. I am proud to be a cosponsor, and I look forward to \nthe adoption of this legislation by the full Senate.\n  As we do everything we can to make sure the BP Deepwater Horizon \ndisaster is not a knife through the heart of the Gulf of Mexico's \necosystem, we know that other great water bodies are also suffering. We \nare responding to those troubled waters as well. The Puget Sound, \nColumbia River Basin, Great Lakes, Long Island Sound, San Francisco \nBay, and, yes, the Chesapeake Bay, are each special and iconic, yet \neach is threatened by degraded water quality.\n  Marylanders know from our experience with the Chesapeake Bay, just as \nthe residents of the gulf are demonstrating for all Americans, that the \nhealth of these water bodies is critical to sustaining regional \neconomies, plant and animal species, our cultural heritage, and our \ntreasured way of life that has been passed on from generation to \ngeneration. The National Academy of Public Administration has \nrecommended ``making large-scale ecosystem restoration a national \npriority.''\n  Large ecosystem programs, from Long Island Sound to the Great Lakes \nto Puget Sound, are addressing some of the Nation's most complex water \nresource management challenges. For this reason, EPA's strategic plan \nprioritizes protecting these ecosystems as a complement to their core, \nnational water quality programs.\n  The Water and Wildlife Subcommittee that I chair has devoted \nconsiderable time to the Chesapeake Bay and, more recently, to the \nother water body bills.\n  I thank Chairman Boxer for her strong support on these bills, for her\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\nhelp in shaping the legislation, and for marshaling these bills through \nthe full Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  Throughout my career in public service, I have had no greater cause \nthan to save the Chesapeake Bay. There has not been one dramatic \nincident that has killed off our fisheries, oyster beds and crab \npopulations, so we have not seen the same sustained attention to lives \nand traditions ruined as we are witnessing in the gulf today.\n  That does not mean it isn't happening, family by family, across my \nState and my region. I have seen it and I am committed to doing \neverything I can to make sure the bay and the economy and ways of life \nit sustains don't die away.\n  The Chesapeake Bay encompasses 64,000 square miles. Its watershed is \nhome to more than 17 million people, with tributaries in Delaware, \nMaryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Presidents Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama have called it a national \ntreasure.\n  The Chesapeake is the economic, historic and cultural center of the \nregion, providing commercial waterways, important fisheries, and \ncountless recreational opportunities.\n  The first English settlers in the New World came here; Captain John \nSmith's original voyages of discovery in 1607 first mapped its borders. \nThe capital cities of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the United \nStates sit upon its major tributaries.\n  Since 1983, the Chesapeake Bay Program has undertaken a largely \nvoluntary effort to restore America's largest estuary. This State-\nFederal partnership program has provided innovative leadership and \nremarkable scientific understanding of the restoration effort.\n  In recent years, however, it became apparent that voluntary efforts \nto restore water quality to the Chesapeake and its tidal segments would \nbe unsuccessful.\n  The basin States agreed that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nwould be responsible for developing a basin-wide pollution reduction \nprogram. The Chesapeake Bay total maximum daily load, TMDL, would \naddress all segments of the Chesapeake Bay and tidal tributaries that \nare identified on the currently applicable lists of impaired waters by \nnitrogen, phosphorus and sediment of the Chesapeake Bay States under \nsection 303(d) of the Clean Water Act.\n  It is against that backdrop that I introduced S. 1816, the Chesapeake \nClean Water and Ecosystem Restoration Act. The purpose of S. 1816 is to \namend the Clean Water Act to improve and reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay \nProgram authorized in section 117 of the Act.\n  The bill has four primary objectives:\n  1. Establish a deadline of 2025, along with appropriate milestones, \nfor all restoration actions to be implemented throughout the Chesapeake \nbasin that will lead to attainment of water quality in the Chesapeake \nBay and its tidal segments; 2. Assure that the basin States, as \ndelegated authorities under the Clean Water Act, be given maximum \nauthority and flexibility to meet the restoration pollution limits \nthrough ``watershed implementation plans'' that each State designs for \nitself; 3. Require that the Federal Government be an active partner in \nthe restoration effort, by developing the overall pollution reduction \ntargets on a State-by-State basis through the Chesapeake Bay TMDL; \nimplementing the terms of the Presidential Executive Order; paying \nlocal stormwater fees; and providing clear and meaningful \naccountability for the basin States; 4. Provide the States, \nmunicipalities, developers, and especially agricultural producers with \nsignificant new tools and financial resources to meet the restoration \ndemands within the 15-year time frame contained in the legislation.\n  The bill authorizes a number of new grants programs, including two to \nassist local governments manage polluted stormwater and three to assist \nthe agricultural community manage nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment \npollution. Grants programs for States are expanded and a number of \nindependent reviews of the program's implementation and progress are \nrequired over the next 15 years.\n  I am proud that the Environment and Public Works Committee reported \nout this bill on a voice vote, without a single Senator expressing \nopposition.\n  In fact, each of the individual great water bodies bills that the \ncommittee considered was adopted in a similar nonpartisan fashion.\n  S. 1311, Gulf of Mexico Restoration and Protection Act, was \nintroduced by Senator Wicker and it addresses the long-standing issues \nfacing the gulf that predate the oil spill disaster that has dominated \nheadlines.\n  S. 3550, Columbia River Basin Restoration Act of 2010, is a bill \njointly developed by the junior Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley, and \nthe senior Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo. This bipartisan legislation \nwill address one of America's great river systems.\n  S. 3073, Great Lakes Ecosystem Protection Act of 2010, has several \nbipartisan sponsors, including Senator Levin and Senator Voinovich, who \nhave worked for years to protect the Great Lakes, which hold 20 percent \nof the fresh water on the Earth.\n  S. 3539, San Francisco Bay Restoration Act, sponsored by California \nSenators Feinstein and Boxer, will help direct the restoration of that \nessential estuary.\n  H.R. 4715, Clean Estuaries Act of 2010. Senators Whitehouse and \nVitter worked together on a substitute version of this House bill. It \nwill reauthorize the program that supports the 28 estuaries around the \ncountry that are part of the National Estuaries Program.\n  S. 2739, Puget Sound Recovery Act of 2009, sponsored by the Senators \nfrom Washington State, Ms. Cantwell and Mrs. Murray, addresses the \nrestoration of this water body, which borders two nations.\n  S. 3119, Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship Act, sponsored \nby New York Senator Gillibrand, will help with the recovery of this \nbody of water which serves millions of residents of New York and \nConnecticut.\n  Each of the restoration efforts takes a somewhat different approach \nto deal with the specific concerns of that region.\n  This is as it should be. Each of these great water bodies is unique, \nand each deserves its own restoration strategy developed by its own set \nof stakeholders.\n  I am proud of the work done by dozens of Senators from both parties \nwho have contributed their time and legislative expertise in drafting \nand supporting these Great Water Body bills.\n  These bills prove that we can work together on substantive \nlegislation in a constructive, bipartisan fashion. They prove that we \ncan say ``yes'' to bipartisanship, ``yes'' to meeting America's need \nfor clean waters, ``yes'' to locally driven restoration strategies, and \n``yes'' to a bright future for some of the most iconic places in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the opportunity to bring all of \nthese fine bills to the Senate floor for adoption.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to talk \nabout what is currently happening in the Senate, in my judgement, \nrepresenting a State with now the second highest unemployment rate in \nthe country--Michigan. We are glad not to be No. 1, but we sure would \nlike to be No. 50. We have an awful lot of people right now who are \nwaiting for us to complete action on extending unemployment insurance \nbenefits.\n  I continue to be appalled at the lengths to which the Republican \nminority will go to stop people who are out of work from getting some \nhelp. We are in a situation where we finally, after eight different \nvotes and weeks and weeks of trying, had enough votes to overcome a \nfilibuster. As we all know, that takes 60 votes. I am very grateful to \nour Republican colleagues from Maine for joining with us to make that \nhappen. We had a vote yesterday that was a supermajority vote. We\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\nknow extending unemployment benefits is going to pass because we had 60 \nvotes to overcome a filibuster and the vote on the actual bill only \ntakes 51.\n  We know we have the votes, but under the procedures of the Senate, \ntechnically, unless there is a bipartisan agreement, we have to wait 30 \nhours before we can actually vote. It used to be that once we secured \nthe votes of a supermajority, then everyone would agree: OK, the votes \nare there, and they would agree to yield back time so we would not have \nto wait; we could go on to something else.\n  That is not what is happening now. While people in Michigan and \naround the country are waiting, trying to figure out: OK, can I pay the \nrent tomorrow, can I get gas for my car to look for another job \ntomorrow, can I put food on the table tomorrow, what is going to happen \non Monday, what is going to happen on Tuesday--while people are \nwaiting, we have nothing happening on the floor of the Senate. We are \njust burning time, 30 hours of time. In my judgment, it is just mean, \nbecause when we look at what has to happen yet--we will pass the bill. \nWe know we are going to pass the bill. It has to go back to the House \nand then to the President for signature. This, at least, is the \ndifference between families getting some help on Friday so they can \nfeed the kids for the weekend or whether they are going to have to wait \nuntil Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday. For a lot of folks, for a lot of \nus--we have a salary, we have a job--that may not seem like much. For \nover 2.5 million people in this country who have lost their insurance \nbenefits--and these are insurance benefits. You pay in when you are \nworking to get some temporary help if you lose your job through no \nfault of your own. Mr. President, 2.5 million people think waiting from \nFriday to Monday is a big deal. They, in fact, think Thursday and \nFriday is a big deal. We have a situation that, frankly, I cannot \ncharacterize any other way than saying it is just plain mean.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Michigan. \nHer State more than any State in the Nation has been hit harder by this \nrecession and high employment. I am sure, as I have found and the \nPresiding Officer has found back in Illinois, that many of these people \nwho are out of work are desperate; that in the Senator's State of \nMichigan, it has been rough for a long time.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from the State of Michigan, for those who \nmay not follow where we are at this moment in the Senate, if she could \nhelp refresh my recollection. Is it not true that we tried three or \nfour times to get the Republicans to go along in a bipartisan way to \nextend unemployment benefits to those who lost their jobs through no \nfault of their own so they could keep their families together while \nthey are searching for work?\n  Isn't it also true that this historically has been something where we \nput the party labels aside and say: This is an American emergency, just \nlike a tornado hitting Chicago or Springfield, IL, or flooding hitting \nsome part of Michigan; that we will stand behind the people of our \ncountry, the 8 million unemployed people who are struggling to get back \non their feet? Isn't it true that historically we have done this \nwithout this kind of political rancor and argument?\n  Finally, yesterday, when we got the breakthrough--we have our new \nSenator from West Virginia, Carte Goodwin, who came in to succeed the \nlegendary Robert C. Byrd. He cast the deciding vote, with two \nRepublican Senators, I might add, who richly deserve credit for it. At \nthat point, we could have moved forward to send these unemployment \nbenefits, give these people in Detroit and Chicago peace of mind, and \ninstead the other side of the aisle is insisting that we burn 30 hours \noff the calendar and even consider amendments on such issues as the \nimmigration law in Arizona, the future of the estate tax--all these \nunrelated issues. Is it true that is where we are in this moment of \ntime, where there are no votes taking place on the floor of the Senate?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I say to our distinguished leader in the \nSenate--and I thank him for his advocacy--he is exactly right. We have \nwaited--I am not sure now if it is 10 or 11 weeks--trying to extend \nunemployment benefits. We have had multiple votes. We finally get the \nvotes through all kinds of different means. We finally get the votes \nyesterday, and it is unheard of that we would be in this spot, after \ngetting a supermajority of 60 people and after having this go on as \nlong as it has. It is unheard of. Never before with a Democratic or \nRepublican President have we ever seen this, but now we are stuck \nagain, and I don't understand why. I cannot fathom the motivation of \nwhy the folks on the other side of the aisle, the leadership on the \nother side of the aisle, would say: Let's wait another 30 hours, which \nfor most people means it is on into next week, and most people have \nalready been without that little bit of $250 or $300 a week. We are not \ntalking about a lot of money.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right.\n  Ms. STABENOW. But it is a difference between having a roof over your \nfamily's head, food on the table, and not. So now we are pushing into \nnext week.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would yield for a question, through the \nChair.\n  I have a chart given me by my staff that says in my home State of \nIllinois--and the State of the Presiding Officer--137,600 people in \nIllinois have had their unemployment benefits cut off because of the \nfilibusters on the Republican side, and our numbers show 104,000 people \nin Senator Stabenow's State of Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not to mention the State of the Republican minority \nleader, Kentucky, with 32,200 people who have had their unemployment \nbenefits cut off.\n  I would say to the Senator from Michigan that I am contacted by these \nfamilies, and they describe to me what life is like when they lose that \n$250-a-week check and they are out of work. First, they exhaust their \nsavings, then they start putting off paying bills, and then they pray \nto God they don't get sick because they have lost their health \ninsurance. Then comes the day of reckoning. One lady called and said: \nThey are cutting off my gas to my home, and the electricity is next. \nAnother said: I am 1 month away from moving out of my little efficiency \ninto my car. That is where I am going to have to live.\n  That is the reality of life, and that is while these people are \nlooking for work. Imagine those burdens--and anyone facing them would \nbe preoccupied by them--at the same time trying to dress up nicely, put \non a happy face, and fill out the forms to find a job.\n  I ask the Senator from Michigan what she is finding with these people \nwho have been cut off from basic unemployment benefits because of the \nRepublican filibuster.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Well, you are exactly right. I also hear, on top of \nthat, about people who have done what we have told them they should \ndo--they should go back to school and get retraining. So they go back, \nand the only reason they can actually afford to go back to school to go \nthrough one of the job training programs is that small check that has \nallowed them to have a little income for their family while they do \nwhat we have told them to do, which is to get a different skill to go \ninto a different career and then hope there will be a job there.\n  I have had so many e-mails from people not only about losing their \nhomes and what is happening to their families but that they have had to \ndrop out of school. Well, how does it make any sense, when we are \ntrying to make sure people are productive in the workforce and are able \nto find a job that people are dropping out of school because of this as \nwell?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me ask this question of the Senator, through the \nChair.\n  I have had heard an argument from the other side of the aisle that \nsays these checks make people lazy; that they don't go out and look for \nwork. With $250 a week, they take it easy.\n  These aren't the people I am talking to in Illinois. I would ask the \nSenator from Michigan, who sees thousands of people who have been out \nof work for long periods of time, what she thinks about this Republican \nargument that unemployment checks make people lazy.\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Well, people in Michigan are extremely offended by \nthis, and I am very offended on their behalf. The people we are talking \nabout have never been out of work in their lives. They are mortified. \nThe idea of having to go get food assistance is unbelievable to them. \nThese are people who built America. They built the middle class. It is \nnot their fault Wall Street had the crisis.\n  We had the good fortune to be with the President signing a bill that \nwill change that, but it is not their fault what happened. It is not \ntheir fault there was recklessness on Wall Street and then the \nfinancial system collapsed so small businesses can't get loans and \nmanufacturers can't get loans.\n  It is not their fault we went through a decade of policies where the \nprevious administration was not enforcing trade laws so our jobs went \noverseas. It is not their fault they find themselves in this economy. \nSo they are saying to me: I want to work. Hey, I want a job. I don't \nwant to extend my unemployment benefits. Give me a job.\n  That is what we are focusing on too. I say to the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, one of the things I find doubly insulting about \nwasting this time is that the legislation we are trying to get to is a \nsmall business bill so small businesses can get loans to hire people. \nSo we are trying to create jobs and, instead, all this time is being \nwasted on an effort just to try to help people get by.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let's get to the hot-button issue--the deficit. Because \nevery Republican who comes to the floor tries to explain why we should \nchange the rules when it comes to unemployment compensation, why we \nshould deny to millions of Americans that basic unemployment check to \nget by while they are out of work, by saying it is all about the \ndeficit.\n  I would ask the Senator from Michigan if she would reflect on the \nfact that many of the same Republican Senators making that argument \nwere Senators who, when they had a chance under the previous President, \nadded to our deficit by waging two wars without paying for them, who \nadded to our deficit by giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica without paying for them, and in fact doubled the debt of the \nUnited States in 8 years' time with that economic policy and those \ndecisions.\n  These same Republican Senators--such as Senator Kyl of Arizona--now \nargue that if we give more tax cuts to the wealthy people in America \nand take that money out of the Treasury and add it to the deficit, it \ndoesn't count because tax cuts for wealthy people don't count when it \ncomes to this deficit discipline they want.\n  I ask the Senator from Michigan: How do you reconcile this; that all \nof a sudden now this is all about a deficit, which the Republican \nSenators virtually ignored for 8 years while we reached the stage of \ntoday.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Well, the Senator is absolutely correct. That is the \nfundamental question. It goes to a question of values and priorities. \nWe will never get out of deficit with over 15 million people out of \nwork, and that doesn't count people working two or three or four part-\ntime jobs or who are underemployed. If people aren't back to work, \naren't able to purchase as consumers, aren't able to contribute, we \nwill never get out of deficit, which is why we start with jobs in the \nbeginning.\n  But to add insult to injury, we hear that giving another round of tax \ncuts to the only part of the American public that has dramatically \nincreased its income--those who are at the very top; the top 1 and 2 \npercent--doesn't matter if it adds to the debt. Adding to the debt for \ntax cuts for wealthy people doesn't count, but changing the rules, such \nas we have never done before, and focusing on helping out-of-work \npeople does count. That counts. We can't do that, if it is somebody who \nis out of work. But we don't worry at all about deficits when it is \nhelping the privileged few.\n  I can't imagine that. That is not the America I know and the majority \nof Americans care about right now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Michigan, by way of a \nquestion in closing, that it would seem to me a person who is \nunemployed, who doesn't get the basic check they need to survive and is \nforced to live in their car, that is a more compelling argument to me \nthan giving a tax break to someone who needs to buy a newer car. That \nis what is being argued on the other side of the aisle. It is a \ncomplete mismatch of priorities.\n  What I struggle with is the notion of how many times the Senator and \nI have been called on, as Members of the House and Senate, to stand by \nsome part of America that is struggling--farmers who are struggling \nbecause of drought or flood, people who are victims of flood and \ntornadoes or our friends in the Gulf of Mexico whose lives are changed \nbecause of BP. How many times have we said, as an American family, we \nstand together? When it comes to something as basic as food on the \ntable and utility bills for the poorest people in America because they \nare out of work--when there are five unemployed people for every \navailable job--why in the world our Republican friends want to take it \nout on them at this point in time I don't understand.\n\n  If there is anything this Congress should do, it is to rally behind \nthose who have lost their jobs and are worrying about losing their \njobs--those working part time, the Senator just referenced, and who \nwant to work full time. If we can't stand together as a Senate behind \nthose families, I think we have lost something very basic. I know I had \nto put that in the form of a question, so I am going to hazard a guess: \nDoes the Senator?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Well, I absolutely agree. I wish to thank the Senator \nfor his continuing leadership and passion on this issue.\n  I would simply say, if over 15 million people out of work in this \ncountry isn't an emergency, I don't know what is. Those are the folks \nwe are fighting for right now--the people who want to work, the people \nwho have been part of this great middle class in our country and who \nnow find that slipping through their fingers because of a global \neconomy, where we have not understood the rules should be fair, where \nwe have had policies put into place that affect only the privileged \nfew, with the theory that it will trickle down to everybody else.\n  You know what. I wish it had. I wish the policies of the former \nPresident and my friends on the other side had worked. I don't want \npeople to be out of work. If trickle-down economics would work, I would \ncelebrate it. But my folks are still waiting for the trickle down. They \nare still waiting. Instead, what is happening to them is they have lost \ntheir jobs or they are finding themselves with fewer hours or they are \nfinding themselves in a situation where they are working two jobs, \nthree jobs just trying to hold it together. I mean I have seen numbers \nthat show almost half the families in Michigan have somebody in their \nimmediate family who has lost their job.\n  The idea of saying that somehow that is all because people are lazy, \nwell, I would not say the words I would truly like to say, but I would \njust say that is a bunch of bunk--the idea that somehow Americans who \nhave worked all their lives and are caught up in this are somehow just \nlazy. But this goes to a broader pattern that is extremely concerning \nto me, and it is the difference in world view and how we view what \nshould happen and what is important in our country.\n  When we had a bill in front of us--the President just signed it \ntoday--to put back some commonsense regulations on Wall Street so there \nare no more big bailouts and consumers can get good information to be \nable to protect themselves and their 401(k)s and their savings and to \nbe able to address all the jobs--the 8 million jobs lost since the \nfinancial crisis started over a year ago--and when we have a bill on \nthe floor that takes on the big banks, the big bonuses, the \nrecklessness of some on Wall Street, our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle vote no. Almost every single one of them sided with the \nbig banks and the big bonuses.\n  We are going to have a big debate about whether to extend tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest Americans, whether we should give even bigger tax \ncuts to the top couple hundred families with huge estates in this \ncountry--to do even more than President Bush did on tax cuts for the \nwealthy and the wealthy estates that are literally only 200 or 300 \nfamilies in the country. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwill argue for that. They will argue that is the right thing to do. \nThat is a different\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\nview. It is a different view than we have about what is happening in \nthis country and where the priorities ought to be.\n  Middle-class families in my State are saying: What about us? What \nabout us? The big banks got their bailout, what about us? That is why \nwe have been focused on jobs and on innovation. While we aren't out of \nthe hole--we are nowhere near out of the hole--we are at least digging \nour way out. There were 750,000 a jobs a month being lost when \nPresident Obama took office. We changed the focus to working families, \nto middle-class families, and by the end of the year that was zero. Now \nwe are gaining 100,000 or 200,000 a month, but we are at least gaining.\n  I am not happy at all about the unemployment levels in Michigan. But \nwhen President Obama took office we were looking at 15.7 percent--\nunbelievable--and that is just the people being counted. Now it has \ncome down a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, and now it is 13.2. \nThat is still way, way too high, but at least it is moving in the right \ndirection. We had 8 years of it moving in the wrong direction and we \nhave turned the ship and it is beginning to turn around.\n  The problem we have is that while it is slow in terms of job \ncreation, too many families are caught in the middle on this, waiting \nfor that next job, wanting that next job that is going to pay enough so \nthey can care for their family. They are caught in a situation they \nnever thought they would be in, in their life and they are embarrassed \nand they are mortified and they are angry. They are looking at the \nSenate and saying: What is going on here? You can't even get it \ntogether to do what every other President, Democrat and Republican, has \ndone in the history of our country to come together and to understand \nthis is an emergency--15 million people plus is an emergency--and that \nwe ought to be extending the small unemployment insurance benefits to \nfamilies who are caught in this.\n\n  That is what this is all about. We find ourselves in a situation \nwhere we are wasting time right now on the floor of the Senate that we \ncould be using after voting to extend unemployment benefits to go on to \nsmall business, which is also absolutely critical for us. The No. 1 \nconcern from businesses is the inability to get a loan, to get the \ncapital they need to extend their line of credit to do business or be \nable to expand, to get the loans they need. That is the bill we have \nwaiting in the wings. That is the one we are trying to get done.\n  Instead of focusing on that, which is jobs and small business, which \nis the growth engine of the country, we wait. We watch the clock--30 \nhours. For whatever reason I do not know. But I think it is a shame.\n  I want to close reading a letter. I get thousands of e-mails. I am \nsure my colleague does too. I find them very heartbreaking. I want to \nread a little bit to put it in the Record, from Philip, from Belding, \nMI:\n\n       I have just learned I exhausted my unemployment benefits. I \n     am going to school under the worker retraining programs \n     through Michigan Works. I have a mere 5 months left until I \n     graduate. I am raising my daughter on my own. My life has \n     been a rough ride, trying to do this on the limited funding \n     already.\n       Now I have to make a choice. This is an incredibly hard \n     choice. I have to quit training to get a job or continue \n     training and live with no income whatsoever. My decision must \n     be made in the best interests of my child. I worked \n     tremendously hard to be at the top of my class in my training \n     and now I am faced with the fact that it was all for nothing.\n       The last year of hard work and study is lost. The grants I \n     received for Michigan Works were used fruitlessly. I know you \n     are fighting for me and all the others in my position but I \n     feel I need to let someone know . . . what is happening.\n\n  There are so many people who have sent letters and e-mails and who \nhave called me. They are just trying to play by the rules and care for \ntheir families and get another job or go back to school or do the \nthings we all want to do for our families to be able to live a good \nlife, be able to have that American dream as we define it. It is \nextremely unfortunate that we find ourselves in a situation where we \ncontinue to see objections and blocking and efforts just to stop \nsomething as basic as temporary assistance for people who have lost \ntheir jobs.\n  We will get this done. We will get it done. It will pass. The \ndifference between what is happening here and what could have been if \nwe had gotten it done yesterday is it is going to be a few more days \nbefore somebody gets the help they need. I do not know how many people \nwill lose their houses because those few more days mean they can't make \nthat payment in time and they end up on the street or how many missed \nmeals, how much hunger, how many times their kids go to bed at night \nhungry because we are wasting all this time on the Senate floor.\n  I can tell you there are many of us, those of us on our side, who \nunderstand what this means for people. We are deeply sorry families are \nin this situation. They need to know we are going to continue to fight, \nwe are going to continue to be there, we are going to continue to do \neverything we can to support them and their families until everybody in \nthis country who needs a job and wants a job and is able to work has \none and can get themselves back on their feet and have the kind of life \nthey want for themselves and their families.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Johanns pertaining to the introduction of S. 3622 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, we are spending time today in so many \nways talking about where the American people are right now with regard \nto this horrific economy, where we had and still have some of the worst \njob numbers in a long time.\n  Fortunately, the economy is recovering. The American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act, which I voted for, and many of us did, has a positive \nimpact along with other job creation strategies. We are happy about \nthat. But we know we still have a way to go to fully recover.\n  One of the best ways to ensure that those who are out of work, \nthrough no fault of their own, can get from a situation of joblessness \nto a job, is to make sure we use programs that we put in place over \nyears and that workers and families have contributed to to give them \nthe opportunity for unemployment benefits as they transition or go \nacross that very long bridge from unemployment to a situation where \nthey are back at work.\n  We have had months and months of debate about this issue. Finally, \nyesterday, we were able to get beyond yet another hurdle that was \nerected by the Republican side of the aisle, and now we are at a point \nwhere we are beyond that procedural hurdle.\n  Instead of allowing the Senate to finally at long last vote on \nunemployment insurance and to extend it, to give families some peace of \nmind in this terrible economy they have lived through, to give \nbusinesses some certainty in terms of what the job picture will look \nlike in a matter of months, and also to take a step when we extend \nunemployment insurance, to take a step in the right direction to \ncontinue to jump-start the economy--one of the best ways to do that is \nby extending unemployment insurance, because when you do that, you have \nan additional benefit. The obvious benefit is to a worker and his or \nher family and, by extension, the community or neighborhood they live \nin.\n  But there is yet another benefit, a second or a third benefit, that \nis depending on how you count each benefit. You know, if you spend a \ndollar on extending unemployment insurance, you get a lot more than a \ndollar back.\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\n  So you spend a buck on unemployment insurance, by one estimate--Mark \nZandi--you get more than a buck sixty back. The Congressional Budget \nOffice tells us that number may be higher. It might be $1.90 that you \nget back if you spend a dollar. So there is an economic benefit for the \nwhole country when we extend unemployment insurance. This isn't simply \nabout the obligation I believe we have to help those families who don't \nhave a breadwinner, as someone who has lost their job, to help them get \nthrough this difficult period. That is reason enough to extend it and \nit is reason enough to treat it as the emergency it is and to even, in \nmy judgment, add to the deficit to do that. But there is also that \nother benefit, isn't there, the benefit to the economy overall--spend a \nbuck and get a lot more back--because we know that when we extend \nunemployment insurance, those dollars go right back into the economy \nand create other jobs and other economic activity and therefore \neconomic opportunity for people who have nothing to do--have no \nconnection to unemployment insurance. Thank goodness a lot of people \ndon't have to worry about unemployment insurance because they still \nhave a job. They have some security.\n  So there are at least two or three basic reasons we should be \nextending unemployment insurance. With all of the evidence, with all of \nthe very compelling and, I would argue, irrefutable evidence that this \nis good for workers and their families, it is necessary to help them, \nand it is also good for all of us in the larger economy because of the \njump-starting and stimulating aspect of the expenditure of those \ndollars, you would think the folks on the other side of the aisle would \nagree with us. But they haven't for many, many weeks.\n  Now we know we have the votes to get this done. Yet they are still \nallowing all these hours to pass that they could waive very easily and \nsay: We know we lost--I am speaking from the Republican side of the \naisle--we have lost the procedural votes, so let's just vote on final \npassage and get this extension approved. They seem to want to play \npolitics with the critically important issue for the American people. \nWe are going to extend the unemployment insurance, and it is going to \nhappen. So why would you insist on the hours that are required--not \nrequired but the hours that are part of the process and allow that to \nslow this down?\n  I was on the floor yesterday talking about a number of \nPennsylvanians. One gentleman I spoke about, I talked about, reading \nfrom his letter, the worry he had, a gentleman out of work, worried \nabout his family, worried about his 12-year-old daughter who has cystic \nfibrosis, worrying about how he is going to have insurance cover her \ncondition, and also worrying about whether he can make ends meet, would \nhe find a job, would he be able to provide for his family. That worry \nis universal when it comes to this issue, the worry a parent feels when \nthey lose their job and lose their health care, the worry that consumes \nthem when they feel they are helpless, almost, to provide for their own \nfamily.\n  We point to individuals within our States who write to us or send us \nan e-mail or somehow communicate with us about their own circumstances.\n  Not too long ago, I received an e-mail from a woman named Kimberly. \nShe and her husband have two children in college. Her husband has been \nout of work for a year. It is hard to comprehend that, what it is like \nto need a job to provide for your family and you not only don't have a \njob but you don't have a job for a year or longer. So many families \nhave been living through that.\n  She said:\n\n       We have been struggling for a year while he looks for full-\n     time employment with which he can again support our family.\n\n  Then, speaking about her job, she says:\n\n       I don't make a lot of money. I don't make enough to support \n     us. And I especially don't make enough to put my kids through \n     college.\n\n  Then she goes on to say:\n\n       We may not starve, but we won't be able to pay our \n     creditors. We'll be looking at possible bankruptcy. I may \n     have to pull my daughter out of her 4-year university and \n     send her to a community college, and we won't be able to buy \n     clothes or even enjoy simple pleasures like dining out or \n     going to the movies.\n\n  Something as simple as that.\n  I spoke yesterday about a woman who had written to me, Rachel, who \ntalked about her husband having lost his job and deciding to join the \nNational Guard in order to be able to have some job, some livelihood, \nas well as be able to get a little bit better health care coverage.\n  These stories are real. They are not anecdotal. They are common in \none sense or another. There might be differences from one family to the \nother, but there are a couple of universal realities here for people. \nJoblessness, being out of work, does, in most instances, lead to a \nsituation where you lose your health insurance coverage. Joblessness \nrobs people of their basic dignity. It diminishes their confidence in \ntheir own worth, their own value to their family, whether it is a \nmother being out of work or a father or a sibling. This kind of worry \nand anxiety plus the basic insecurity of not being able to pay bills is \nhorrific, absolutely horrific, something that not many people--maybe a \nfew, maybe a few Senators can understand it, but not many can \nunderstand what it is like not to have income and not to have health \ncare.\n  Everyone here, every Senator has a steady income. It is reliable. It \nis there every month. You get paid every month. Every Senator gets \nhealth care coverage. We have that security for ourselves and for our \nfamilies. I realize that some at some point in their lives might have \nan experience that would give them an insight into what someone is \ngoing through now who is unemployed, but not many, not many U.S. \nSenators, not many Members of the House of Representatives or those who \nwork with us in the Federal Government.\n  So when folks come to this floor and talk a lot about, we want to \nhelp, the argument basically is, we want to help, we understand, but we \ndon't want to run up the deficit. They make that argument. I wish the \nsame folks who make that argument and the passionate arguments about \nthe deficit and not using an emergency strategy to help the unemployed, \nI wish they had that same sense of worry and outrage about the deficit \nwhen they were giving tax breaks--hundreds of billions of dollars--to \nvery wealthy Americans, hundreds of billions year after year after year \nto very wealthy Americans and not being too worried about the deficit \nin those days. In fact, some on the other side of the aisle were heard \nto say at the time that deficits don't matter; that if it is tax cuts, \nif that is your priority, if you want to vote, if you want to put forth \nand move forward a tax cut policy for the very wealthy, at that time, \nin their judgment, there was nothing wrong with running up the deficit.\n  Now when we make the argument that this is an emergency, the way it \nhas been treated for years by people on both sides of the aisle--\nunemployment insurance in the midst of a horrific recession is, in \nfact, an emergency--and they voted that way, now they are inconsistent, \nnot only inconsistent when it comes to all of a sudden insisting that \nthey can't support anything that would increase the deficit even in a \nlimited manner--that is inconsistent, but I believe it is even more \noutrageously inconsistent when you say: I will vote for tax cuts for \nthe wealthy and run up the deficit, but I am not going to take steps to \nincrease unemployment insurance or to extend unemployment insurance.\n  So what you have is not only hypocrisy and blatant inconsistency, but \nyou have hypocrisy and inconsistency and political gamesmanship that is \nhurting real people. There are hundreds of thousands of people. If we \nlook across a couple of months, literally millions of Americans have \nbeen denied unemployment insurance and will be denied unemployment \ninsurance if these games keep playing out, if these political obstacles \nare erected every couple of weeks or every couple of months.\n  It is a very basic choice: We can vote right away and get beyond this \nand extend unemployment insurance or we can still have the games people \nare playing and the hypocrisy we have seen on display and continue \nplaying games while people are out of work, while people are hurting, \nand while families are suffering. It is very simple. There is no kind \nof in-between here--you are either on one side of this issue or the\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\nother. Then we can get through this period. I think we can move on to \nother debates about our economy, about how our job-creation strategies \nare working. We can have debates about the deficit and a lot of other \nissues. But the first thing we have to do is make sure we are taking \nevery step necessary to help people who are out of work through no \nfault of their own and to continue this recovery by creating the jobs \nthat we know have been and will continue to be created as we move \nforward. But we have to get beyond this. We should not be waiting hours \nto get this final vote in place so we can pass an extension of \nunemployment insurance and move forward and help those workers and help \nthose families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor to visit about the \ncontinuation of revelations to the American people about the health \nbill that has been signed into law by the President. I come as someone \nwho has practiced medicine in Wyoming, taking care of the families of \nWyoming for the last 25 years. I come as someone who is the medical \ndirector of the Wyoming Health Fair, offering low-cost blood screens, \nlow-cost preventive services to let people identify health problems \nearly so they can get early treatment, keep down the cost of their \nmedical care. This is something we have done all around the State of \nWyoming for almost a quarter of a century now.\n  I come today to offer a doctor's second opinion. I have done this \nevery week since the health care bill became law because every week \nthere is a new revelation, a new finding, something that once again \naffirms what those of us who opposed this health care bill and this law \nhad said would happen if this actually became law.\n  I come to the floor to tell my colleagues what I have found in the \nlast week. After all, the goal of health care reform was to lower \ncosts, to increase quality, and to improve access for patients around \nthe country. I continue to believe week after week, as Americans learn \nmore and more about this law, that this is a law that is going to be \nbad for patients--I heard that as I traveled the State of Wyoming this \npast weekend talking to folks; bad for providers, nurses and doctors \ntaking care of patients; and something that is going to be bad for \npayers, people who are going to have to pay the bills for their own \nhealth care, because costs are going up, people paying for their own \nhealth insurance because costs are going up, taxpayers who are going to \nhave to pay for this because those costs continue to go up.\n  I come to the floor having just taken a look at the Sunday New York \nTimes, an article by Robert Pear: ``Changing Stance, the Administration \nnow Defends Insurance Mandate as a Tax.'' I stood on this floor week \nafter week hearing people on the other side of the aisle say: No, this \nisn't a tax. Now, all of a sudden the administration says differently. \nBut then who can forget Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, who said: \nYou don't get to find out what is in the bill until the bill is passed.\n  There have been so many broken promises made by this administration \nand this President to the American people. It is no surprise that a \nmajority of the American people continue to want to have this law \nrepealed and replaced.\n  Well, let's review a couple of those promises. One is the President \nsaid:\n\n       The plan I'm announcing tonight--\n\n     and he said this to a joint session of Congress, with those \n     of us here attending--\n\n       The plan I'm announcing tonight. . . .will slow the growth \n     of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and \n     our government.\n\n  Well, the Chief Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid said, of course, \nthe President is wrong.\n  Then the President said: If you like your health care plan, you will \nbe able to keep your health care plan, period. He said: No one will \ntake it away, period. He said: No matter what, period.\n  But then the Chief Actuary of Medicare and Medicaid said 14 million \nAmericans would lose their employer-sponsored health coverage under the \nlaw. And when the White House came out with its own recommendations and \nrules and regulations, even they have said a majority of Americans who \nreceive their health coverage through work will not be able to keep the \ncoverage the President of the United States promised them they could \nkeep.\n  And now the one where the President said: I can make a firm pledge. \nUnder my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any \nform of tax increase.\n  He went on to be specific. He said: not your income taxes, not your \npayroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.\n  That is what the President happened to say.\n  Well, that was not just a candidate speaking that way. Even as \nPresident, in September of 2009, in a speech before Congress, President \nObama again promised the American people:\n\n       The middle class will realize greater security, not higher \n     taxes.\n\n  What a difference a year makes. The President's new health care law \ndoes contain tax hikes--lots of them. In fact, there are at least 18 \nnew taxes in the health care law, and it raises approximately $500 \nbillion over a 10-year period.\n  Here are a couple of examples: new taxes on medical devices and \nsupplies, new taxes on brandname prescription drugs, new taxes on \nhealth insurance providers, increased Medicare payroll taxes on \nemployers. But the most egregious is the individual mandate tax. That \nis the one that the American people are so concerned about right now. \nThe new health care law requires all Americans to buy Washington-\napproved health insurance, and they have to do it by the year 2014. If \nthey do not, they have to pay. Some call it a penalty, others call it a \nfine. For the first time in our Nation's history, the Federal \nGovernment is ordering the American people to use their own hard-earned \nmoney to buy a specific good or service.\n  Most people I talk to, who see through all of the games and the \nwording, say this is a tax. Even ABC News's George Stephanopoulos \nclearly pointed this out during a September 2009 interview with then \nPresident Obama. In that interview, Mr. Stephanopoulos pressed \nPresident Obama, pressed him to admit that the individual mandate is a \ntax. He asked President Obama:\n\n       But you reject that it's a tax increase?\n\n  And the President responded:\n\n       I absolutely reject that notion.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, apparently your own administration disagrees \nwith you. And clearly your Justice Department disagrees with you. \nBecause as the New York Times reported, on July 16--just this past \nSunday--it said:\n\n       Administration officials say the tax argument is a linchpin \n     of their legal case in defense of the health care overhaul \n     and its individual mandate, now being challenged in court by \n     more than 20 states and several private organizations.\n\n  It is so interesting. Just the first paragraph:\n\n       When Congress required most Americans to obtain health \n     insurance or pay a penalty, Democrats--\n\n  In this very Chamber--\n\n     denied that they were creating a new tax. But in court, the \n     Obama administration and its allies now defend the \n     requirement as an exercise of the government's ``power to lay \n     and collect taxes.''\n\n  So there you have it. The article says the Justice Department now \nbelieves--the Justice Department takes direction from the President--\nthe Justice Department believes the individual mandate penalty is a tax \nprecisely because it generates money, $4 billion per year through 2017. \nThat is according to the Congressional Budget Office. So you have the \nPresident promising the American people one thing and directing his \nJustice Department to say exactly the opposite.\n  Well, you might say, is this partisan? No. We are talking about a New \nYork Times article. The New York Times goes on to quote Jack Balkin, \nwho is a professor of law at the Yale Law School. This is somebody who \nactually supports the health care law. This is a supporter of the \nhealth care law. What does he say about President Obama? He said he \n``has not been honest with the American people about the nature of this \nbill.'' He says: ``This bill is a tax.''\n  So here you have a supporter of the health care law, a supporter--a \nYale Law School professor--who goes on to say of President Obama, he \n``has not been honest with the American people about the nature of this \nbill.'' He said: ``This bill is a tax.''\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\n  We have President Obama's own administration now admitting the \nindividual mandate to buy health insurance is a tax increase. Well, \nthis clearly violates the President's repeated promises that no one--no \none--making less than $250,000 a year would see a tax increase.\n  Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation confirms the tax hikes in the \nhealth care law absolutely will hit millions of middle-class, working-\nclass families struggling in this economy.\n  Once again, we see and hear the President of the United States \npromising the American people one thing and delivering something \nentirely different.\n  The President went on national TV and said his individual mandate was \nnot a tax. Now the President's administration says it is.\n  So I come to the floor again today with a doctor's second opinion, \noutlining the broken promises of this health care law--the broken \npromises made by this President and this administration to the American \npeople, and forcing through, cramming down their throats, against the \nwishes of the American people, a law the American people did not want, \nand still do not want. Because if you go to any senior center, if you \ngo to any civic organization, if you travel around this country and you \nask the question: Under this law, do you believe the cost of health \ncare will go up, all the hands will go up. And if you ask the question: \nDo you think the quality of your own care under this new law will go \ndown, the same number of hands continue to go up.\n  That is why it is important we repeal and replace this health care \nlaw with something that is patient centered, with something that \nfocuses on patients, not Washington bureaucrats and not insurance \ncompany bureaucrats. There is no reason to not allow Americans to buy \ninsurance across State lines. There is no reason not to allow Americans \nwho want to buy individual insurance to get the same tax breaks. They \nshould be able to get the same tax breaks as those who get their \ninsurance through work from the big companies with those tax breaks.\n  We have to allow people to have individual incentives if they stay \nhealthy and take measures to keep down the cost of their own care. We \nhave to deal with lawsuit abuse, which was essentially neglected in \nthis over 2,000-page health care law. We need to encourage and allow \nsmall businesses to join together to get the cost of their health care \ndown and the cost of their insurance down.\n  Those are the things that will get the cost of care down--not this \nmonstrous bill that is bad for patients, bad for providers, and bad for \nthe payers of health care. That is why week after week I continue to \ncome to the Senate floor to once again go over what we have learned in \nthe past week. This week we have learned the President of the United \nStates, who promised there would be no increased taxes, has now changed \nthe tune of his entire administration and his Justice Department by \nsaying: Oh, no, we are changing our stance. Now the insurance mandate \nis a tax.\n  I offer my second opinion, and it is time to repeal and replace this \nhealth care law.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        PRAISING JAYNE ARMSTRONG\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise once more to honor one of \nAmerica's great Federal employees.\n  Last week, the Senate focused a lot of its attention on reforming our \nregulation of Wall Street. As important as that is, we must not forget \nthat the health of our economy depends on the success of businesses on \nMain Street. Small businesses form the backbone of our prosperity and \nembody the American dream for millions of families.\n  From the colonial merchants at our beginning to those who opened \nstores in frontier towns in the 19th century, from the mom and pop \nshops in the postwar years to the online start-ups of our day, small \nbusinesses have driven our economy.\n  Over the past 57 years, the Small Business Administration has been \nhelping small business owners obtain loans and find resources to help \nthem prosper. By guaranteeing loans that small businesses take out from \nbanks, the SBA enables entrepreneurs to grow and develop their \nbusinesses with confidence, which helps create jobs and improve local \neconomies.\n  It was created out of the old Reconstruction Finance Corporation, \nwhich was set up during the Hoover administration to lend capital to \nbusinesses hurt by the Great Depression. The SBA was founded in 1953, \non the cusp of an economic boom that saw the proliferation of new small \nbusinesses throughout the Nation.\n  In 1964, the SBA's Equal Opportunity Loan Program helped tackle \npoverty by encouraging new businesses started by entrepreneurs living \nbelow the poverty line. In the aftermath of natural disasters, the SBA \nprovides emergency assistance to help keep small businesses running. \nToday, the SBA continues to play an important role in helping small \nbusiness owners launch and grow their businesses.\n  The great Federal employee I am honoring this week has worked at the \nSBA for 16 years.\n  Jayne Armstrong currently serves as the SBA district director for \nDelaware. I have known her for several years, and I have seen firsthand \nher dedication to helping Delaware small businesses thrive.\n  Jayne, a native of Pittsburgh, worked in advertising, high-tech \neconomic development, and higher education development before joining \nthe SBA in 1994. She holds bachelor's and master's degrees from West \nVirginia University. First serving as the district director for West \nVirginia and regional advocate in the SBA's Office of Advocacy, Jayne \nhelped organize the White House Conference on Small Businesses in 1995. \nShe also represented the SBA in Russia during the first-ever formal \nexchange between American and Russian entrepreneurs the following year.\n  Since coming to Delaware and, Mr. President, I should add that she \nhas lived in my home State for the past 10 years--Jayne has become one \nof the greatest advocates for First State entrepreneurs. She has helped \nhundreds of Delawareans turn ideas into businesses. Nothing, including \nthe economic downturn, slows her down in her drive to help small \nbusiness owners obtain the loans they need to open or expand.\n  Jayne has placed a particular emphasis on helping entrepreneurs take \nadvantage of SBA loan programs created through the Recovery Act, such \nas Queen Bee Beauty Supply in Smyrna, a minority woman-owned business, \nand Miller Metal Fabrication in Bridgeville, a design engineering and \nmanufacturing company.\n  These are just two of the hundreds of businesses that have Jayne and \nthe SBA to thank for helping them get their start or expand into new \nopportunities.\n  Jayne is also substantially involved in our State's nonprofit \ncommunity. She serves on the boards of Girls, Inc., the Caesar Rodney \nRotary Club, and Delaware Tech's Entrepreneurial Advisory Consortium, \namong others. Former Governor Ruth Ann Miller appointed her to serve on \nthe Delaware Commission for Women.\n  The SBA serves as a fitting example of how the Federal Government \nworks with the private sector to fuel job creation--a goal we are \ncontinuing to focus heavily on in this Congress.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Jayne Armstrong and all \nof the men and women at the Small Business Administration for their \nhard work to help our small business sector grow and prosper. They are \nall truly great Federal employees.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           American Jobs Act\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today, hopefully, we will finally extend \nunemployment insurance to those who can't find a job in this difficult \neconomic climate. Our next task is to help small employers and \nentrepreneurs grow their businesses and hire new workers. That is the \nonly way we will fully emerge from this recession.\n  Over the past 15 years, small businesses have created almost two-\nthirds of the new jobs in America. Small businesses are the cornerstone \nof New Hampshire's economy. Over 96 percent of businesses in the \nGranite State are small businesses with fewer than 500 employees. That \nis why we need, once we have passed the extension of unemployment \ninsurance, to pass the Small Business Jobs Act as soon as possible. \nThis is legislation that will dramatically increase lending to small \nbusinesses, it will enhance the ability of small companies to export, \nand it will provide tax relief to small firms.\n  I am proud that as a member of the Small Business Committee I helped \ncraft this bill under the leadership of the chair of that committee, \nSenator Mary Landrieu, and ranking member Senator Olympia Snowe. I want \nto thank both of them for their work and for their leadership on this \nbill.\n  While many community banks in New Hampshire have increased their \nlending, I consistently hear from small businesses that they have run \nout of financing for the working capital they need. Last year, my \noffice organized a financing fair to bring together lenders and small \nbusinesses who need financing, and over 500 people showed up. It was a \nhuge turnout. But still, wherever I go in New Hampshire, small business \nowners tell me they are running out of financing options. In some \ncases, their only choice is to turn to credit cards, often personal \ncredit cards, paying exorbitant interest rates to get the working \ncapital they need to keep their businesses going.\n  The small business jobs bill will enhance Small Business \nAdministration loan programs that help small businesses in New \nHampshire and throughout the country as they try to access the credit \nthey need to hire workers, to grow their businesses, and to weather the \neconomic storm.\n  In the past year, many small businesses in New Hampshire have taken \nadvantage of the enhancements to the SBA programs that were included in \nthe Recovery Act. One business owner in New Hampshire, Janet Dunican, \nwas able to save her business with an SBA loan. Janet owns an \ninnovative manufacturing company in Hooksett, NH. She has over 50 \nemployees, and what they do is help take trucks that are owned by other \nsmall businesses and transform them by adding custom-fit utility \nbuckets--the kind we see when the cable company fixes the power lines \nafter a storm.\n  When Janet needed a loan to save her company, she looked everywhere \nfor help. But with credit tight and with this uncertain economy, she \nhad a hard time finding a bank that would finance her project to keep \nthe business afloat. Then she turned to a bank that participated in an \nSBA loan guarantee program. She was able to work with her bank to get \nthe credit she needed to save her business.\n  Unfortunately, too many small businesses can't take advantage of loan \nguarantees because the loans have been too limited, and they do not fit \ntheir needs. But the small business jobs bill opens these programs to \nmore businesses. It increases the size of the loans that businesses can \nobtain, it allows small businesses to refinance their debt at lower \nrates, and it extends the higher guarantee rates that were included in \nthe Recovery Act. The SBA estimates that these provisions will put over \n$5 billion in credit into the hands of small businesses.\n  The bill also funds successful State small business lending \nprograms--programs that have helped save many small businesses and \nhelped others finance their growth. These programs, such as our own--\nthe New Hampshire Business Finance Authority's Capital Access Program--\nand other successful small business lending programs, can quickly get \ncredit into the hands of the small companies that need it the most.\n  The bill also includes a proposal that I worked very hard on to allow \nmore small businesses in New Hampshire to access the SBA's Express Loan \nProgram. The Express Loan Program is popular with banks in New \nHampshire because it cuts redtape and allows them to use their own \npaperwork in making the loans. It is a simple way to quickly put \nworking capital into the hands of small business owners.\n  Another important way we can increase the bottom lines of small \nbusinesses is by helping them sell their products overseas, something I \nhave been supportive of for a very long time. Of the small- and medium-\nsized businesses in this country, only about 5 percent are selling into \nmarkets overseas. Yet 99 percent of those markets are outside of the \nUnited States. For many of these small businesses that would like to \nexport, it can be very challenging because, unlike big companies, they \noften don't have the technical capacity or the resources to identify \nnew markets, to go on trade missions, and to market their products to \nforeign buyers.\n  The small business jobs bill will help these small firms access new \nmarkets because it boosts Federal and State programs that help small \nbusinesses export their products. It also strengthens SBA export \nfinancing programs so that small businesses can get loans to put them \nin a better position to compete locally.\n  Finally, this legislation also provides over $12 billion in targeted \ntax relief for small businesses. These are tax cuts that will help free \nup capital for small firms to make investments and, most importantly, \nto hire workers because that, in fact, is what the small business jobs \nbill is all about. It is to help provide the boost that small \nbusinesses in New Hampshire and across the country need, not just so \nthey can be successful and grow, but so they can create jobs--the jobs \nthat we need to put people back to work in this country.\n  I am excited that we are going to be taking up this legislation. I \nhope it is going to be today. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this critical bill to help improve job prospects for people \nacross the country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               Estate Tax\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, every day it becomes harder and harder \nfor me to listen to my Republican friends who race down to the Senate \nbreathlessly telling the American people how concerned they are about \nthe $13 trillion national debt we have and how ``we have to get our \nfinancial house in order.'' That is what they tell us every single day. \nBut a funny thing happened: under the leadership of President George W. \nBush, these very same Republicans turned a recordbreaking Federal \nsurplus left by President Clinton into recordbreaking deficits. Back \nthen, as we all recall, not so many years ago, their rallying cry was \n``deficits don't matter.'' That was articulated by Vice President Dick \nCheney. This ``deficits don't matter'' philosophy gave us two wars that \nwere not paid for, including the war in Iraq, which may end up costing \nus $3 trillion. It gave us $700 billion in tax breaks--no worry about \npaying for those tax breaks that went to the very wealthiest people in \nour country. It gave us $400 billion in an unpaid-for prescription drug \nMedicare Part D bill. And, of course, it gave us a $700 billion bailout \nof Wall Street developed by President Bush and his Secretary of the \nTreasury, Mr. Paulson. No worry; in those days, we did not have to pay \nfor any of that. It is OK, just add it onto the debt of our kids and \nour grandchildren.\n  But it seems our Republican friends recently, about a year and three-\nquarters ago, had a change of heart. Coincidentally, that was when \nPresident\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nObama came into office. I am sure it was just a coincidence, but now it \nappears that deficits do matter. For 8 years, deficits didn't matter. \nNow they do matter. Now they are telling us we cannot afford to extend \nunemployment benefits to over 2 million Americans who lost their jobs \nin the worst recession in modern history. They tell us we just cannot \nafford to invest in our economy to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure \nor transform our energy system, which would create, over a period of \nyears, millions of good-paying jobs. We can't do that. We don't have \nthe money to do that.\n  The Republican hypocrisy is about to reach a whole new level, \nliterally, today. In the name of fiscal responsibility, while they \noppose every effort to help the middle-class and working families of \nour country, today an amendment is going to come onto the floor which \nis specifically designed to provide huge tax breaks to millionaires and \nbillionaires. In other words, there is no money available to help \ndesperate families who have lost their jobs, but there is all kinds of \nmoney to provide huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\n  Finally, last night, as a result of the appointment of a new Senator \nfrom West Virginia, we got the 60 votes we needed to end the Republican \nfilibuster so that we can extend unemployment benefits. But instead of \nallowing this bill to pass yesterday, as common decency would allow, so \nwe can begin to get the money out to those families who are wondering \nright now how they are going to buy the food they need, pay the rent, \npay the mortgage, the Republicans are forcing the Senate to wait \nanother 30 hours before final passage.\n  Adding insult to injury, my good friend from South Carolina, Senator \nDeMint, wants to suspend the rules so the Senate can take up \nlegislation to permanently repeal the estate tax. This, even for the \nSenate, is really weird and really extraordinary. In the midst of \ntelling us how serious the deficit is, how serious the national debt \nis, these folks want to give tax breaks to billionaires by permanently \nrepealing the estate tax and, as this chart shows, adding more than $1 \ntrillion to the deficit over 10 years. That is a very unusual way to \ndeal with our deficit crisis, by adding $1 trillion to the national \ndebt over a 10-year period. Furthermore, as this chart shows--and maybe \nthis is the most important point I want to make in my brief remarks--\nonly a tiny fraction of estates from death in 2009 owed any estate tax. \nIn fact, 99.7 percent of Americans would not receive a nickel from \nSenator DeMint's legislation.\n  Four years ago, every Republican except two voted to completely \neliminate the estate tax, a tax that has been in existence since 1916 \nand impacts only the very richest families in America, the top three-\ntenths of 1 percent. Let me tell you who the major beneficiaries of \nthis huge tax break would be. Would it be the average middle-class \nworker who during the Bush years saw a $2,200 decline in his income, \npeople who really need the money? No, they are not being helped by Mr. \nDeMint or the repeal of the estate tax. Would it be a small \nbusinessperson, the people who are creating almost all of the new jobs \nin our economy? Would small business be helped when we repeal the \nestate tax? No, not those guys. Would it be a single mom who wants to \nsend her kid to college for the first time in their family's lifetime? \nNo, that single mom is not going to be helped, not anybody on Social \nSecurity, not the people who need the help the most. They don't get one \npenny from the repeal of the estate tax, as Senator DeMint is \nproposing.\n  Who benefits? Who are the beneficiaries of the estate tax or, as my \nRepublican friends and their pollsters like to refer to it, the death \ntax? If we pass what Senator DeMint wants us to do today, completely \nrepeal the estate tax, it would provide an estimated $32.7 billion tax \nbreak for the Walton family, the founders and owners of Walmart--a \n$32.7 billion tax break for a family that is worth almost $87 billion. \nSome people here may think the Walton family--worth almost $100 \nbillion--is in desperate need of a tax break at a time when we have a \n$13 trillion national debt. I am not one of those people. I do not \nthink they do.\n  But it is not just the Walton family, obviously, who will benefit. \nOther very wealthy families will. Do you remember those hedge fund \nmanagers on Wall Street who made $1 billion a year or several billion a \nyear? They are going to benefit. Those are the guys--the people who \ndrove us into the recession, who made huge amounts of money gambling on \nWall Street. They will be very happy if that amendment passes. They \nbenefit. The Mars candy family will get an $11 billion tax break; the \nCox cable family, $9 billion tax breaks.\n  Remember, this law has been in existence since 1916. And remember \nagain, it only benefits the top three-tenths of 1 percent, and 99.7 \npercent of the American people, working people, middle-class, lower \nincome people, upper middle-class people, don't benefit one nickel from \nthis tax break which costs us $1 trillion over a 10-year period.\n  At a time when our country has a $13 trillion national debt, the \nhighest level of childhood poverty in the industrialized world, a \ncrumbling infrastructure, a desperate need to transform our energy \nsystem--I see Senator Boxer, who has been a leader in that effort--it \nis beyond comprehension to me that anyone at this moment in American \nhistory would advocate huge tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  This concept of the estate tax was developed by Teddy Roosevelt. He \nwas concerned about two things. He was obviously concerned about \nraising revenue for the Federal Government, but he was also concerned \nabout making sure we did not maintain an oligarchy in the United States \nwhere billionaire families--people worth tens of billions of dollars \nnow--are able to give away their fortunes to their own heirs. He \nbelieved in a meritocracy and that it was appropriate that those people \npay a fair share of taxes.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       The absence of effective state and especially national \n     restraint upon unfair money-getting has tended to create a \n     small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful \n     men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power . \n     . . Therefore I [Teddy Roosevelt] believe in a . . . \n     graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes, properly \n     safeguarded against evasion and increasing in amount with the \n     size of the estate.\n\n  Teddy Roosevelt, 1910. I think our Republican friends have kind of \ndisowned Teddy Roosevelt, and we don't hear him quoted terribly much \nanymore.\n  In order to sell this concept of repealing the estate tax to the \nAmerican people, Republican pollsters--I have to admit, we have to be \nhonest about this--have done a very good job. They framed this tax \nbreak for billionaires into a death tax. So people on the street in \nBurlington, VT, come up to me and say: Bernie, I want to leave my kids \n$20,000. Why are they going to tax me? The Republican pollsters have \ndone a very good job and their lobbyists have done a very good job in \nmisleading the public. As usual, Republicans are using the old tactic \nof pretending to worry about the needs of ordinary people as a \nsmokescreen to serve the wealthy special interests.\n  That is what they do very well. If you are in the middle class and \nyou want to leave your family $1 million or $2 million or $100,000, \nthis doesn't apply to you; you don't benefit one nickel. This is for \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  The other thing they talk about is, we have to preserve the family \nfarm and the estate tax is wiping out family farms. I am a strong \nadvocate of family-based agriculture, and in terms of the preservation \nof family farms, the American Farm Bureau was asked to come up with an \nexample of one single family farm being lost as a result of the estate \ntax. They could not find one farm that had to be sold as a result of \nthe estate tax. This is not legislation to help family farmers. This is \nlegislation to help provide tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  Let me quote from an article that appeared in the New York Times July \n8, 2001:\n\n       Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist whose tax \n     advice has made him a household name among Midwest farmers, \n     said he had searched far and wide but had never found a case \n     in which a farm was lost because of estate taxes. ``It's a \n     myth,'' Mr. Harl said.\n\n  As it happens, I called up Professor Harl this afternoon, just a few \nhours ago. Interestingly, he told me he has conducted over 3,000 \nseminars on the\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\nestate tax and agriculture. This guy is an expert on the issue. I just \nwanted to get an update from him. What he told me 2 hours ago is that \nafter studying this issue for decades, he has not heard of one family \nfarm that had to be sold because of the estate tax--not one.\n  When my Republican friends talk about preserving the family farm--\nsomething we have to do--this estate tax issue has nothing to do with \nthat.\n  In terms of small business, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, as \nthis chart indicates, has estimated that only 80 small businesses and \nfarm estates throughout the country paid an estate tax in 2009, \nrepresenting 0.003 percent of all estates.\n  This legislation is not for the family farmer. This legislation is \nnot for small business. This legislation is specifically designed to \nprovide huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country, \nmillionaires and billionaires, at the same time as we have a $13 \ntrillion national debt.\n  Let me conclude by saying this.\n  We have heard our Republican friends week after week, month after \nmonth, coming down to the floor of the Senate and saying, no, we cannot \nextend unemployment benefits to desperate Americans all over this \ncountry who, through no fault of their own, have lost their jobs. We \ncannot afford to do that.\n  Finally yesterday we got the votes to go forward. But having said \nthat, that they cannot help working families and people who have lost \ntheir jobs, they are now coming down to the floor and saying, we \ndesperately need to give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\n  You know, Woody Guthrie had a song some years ago. The title was: \n``Whose Side Are You On?'' The Republicans have answered that loudly \nand clearly. But when it comes to the needs of the unemployed and \nuninsured, when it comes to protect the interests of the struggling \nmiddle class, the Republicans are deficit hawks. We know they are going \nto go after them. But if you are a billionaire family who needs a huge \ntax break that will cost $1 trillion over 10 years, they are on your \nside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont speaks in very \nclear words. When he says this debate is about whose side are you on, \nhe could not be more on target. We have a situation where we know that \nwhen President Obama took office and the Democrats were increasing \ntheir majority, we inherited the worst recession since the Great \nDepression. Those are not just words; that is a fact.\n  We inherited the worst deficit ever, because under the Republicans, \nthe hugest tax cuts ever to people earning more than $1 million a year, \n$1 billion a year, went right on the credit card; two wars went right \non the credit card; nothing paid for.\n  Then at the end of George Bush's term, when we started to see jobs \nbeing lost, 700,000 jobs a month, that is when we took over, and we \ntook some tough votes. We said to the American people: We are going to \nfocus like a laser beam on jobs and this economy, and we are going to \nget back on our feet. Yes, we are going to tackle that deficit.\n  I happen to have the privilege of having been sent here by my State \nwhen Bill Clinton was President of the United States. You know what. He \ninherited huge deficits, and he inherited a tough economic time, and we \nproved that we could both balance the budget and create 23 million \njobs. When George W. Bush took the keys to that Oval Office, it took \nhim a matter of minutes, figuratively a matter of minutes, to turn \nsurpluses into deficits, and to bring down the jobs market until we got \nto a point where we were losing and hemorrhaging jobs at 700,000 a \nmonth.\n  This is important for us to remember, because it is this date where \nwe say to our Republican friends, if you care about the people who are \ntrying desperately to get jobs, if you care about people who have been \nhit by this great recession, then come with us. Work with us. Let's \nmake sure we are there for those who deserve to have this help.\n  By the way, if I could say, the rules that go along with getting this \nunemployment extension, people do not talk about that much. You have to \nprove you are ready and willing to work. You have to prove you are \nactively seeking a job. You cannot have been fired for cause. And, by \nthe way, you have to have paid into the unemployment insurance fund as \nwell. This is unemployment insurance that the workers have paid into.\n  These are people who are actively seeking work. Guess what. When they \nget there, they find out there are five job seekers for every job. So \nwe say to our friends on the other side of the aisle, where is your \nheart? Where is your heart?\n  A couple of them proved that. They stepped up and voted with us. That \nis all. When history is written, I think this time is going to go down \nas a time when right triumphs over wrong, because we did get these \nvotes.\n  But guess what. Even though the other side knows we have those votes, \nthey are stalling and stalling and having us vote on amendments that \nwould give the wealthiest Americans their tax cuts, without paying for \nit. So when a deficit is caused by helping those who earn $1 million a \nyear, $1 billion a year, oh, they are happy with that. But when you are \ntrying to help mainstream America, middle-class America, the hard-\nworking people, oh, my goodness, where are they? They are not here. \nOnly to delay they are here. They are here to delay.\n  This is an important moment in history, because we always had \nbipartisan support for extending unemployment compensation. My God, we \nhad it when George W. Bush was President in 2003. The Republicans \njoined with us and extended unemployment. No problem. So I do not know \nwhere this is coming from.\n  You are going to hear: Oh, the deficit. That is hogwash. They admit \nit. They admit it. They do not care about the deficit. When they are \ncutting taxes for their friends, they said: It does not matter. I have \nchapter and verse, quotes from their leadership. So this is about \nvalues. It is about whose side are you on? I am on the side of the \nAmerican people, the working people. Most of us. Bernie Sanders is on \nthat side. The Republicans who are joining us in this vote today are on \nthat side today. This is a history-making day. It is the first time we \nhave ever had a standoff on this issue. It is the first time we have \never seen the Republican Party walk away from working Americans like \nthis. Again, when I was here and we balanced the budget, we created \nsurpluses. The Republicans were not with us on that. I can honestly \nsay, I voted to balance the budget. We did it, and we know how to do \nit, and we are going to do it. But do not turn your backs on people who \npaid into the unemployment compensation funds. It is insurance. They \npaid into it. And they have to be actively seeking work.\n  I wanted to read to you a couple of stories from my State, of real \npeople. But before I do, I want to talk about Mark Zandi. Mark Zandi, \nchief economist at Moody's, was one of the top economic advisers to \nthen-Republican Presidential candidate John McCain. He says that every \ndollar invested in unemployment benefits, such as we are going to vote \non today, produces $1.61 in economic activity. The CBO estimates it is \n$1.90.\n  Why is that? It is because the people who are getting those funds to \nsurvive are going to spend it in the local economy. They are going to \ngo out to the supermarket; they are going to go to the local gas \nstation. Economists of all stripes agree that there is an actual return \non investment here, let alone the morality of standing up for people \nwho, through no fault of their own, cannot find a job.\n  Let me read what a Sacramento woman said to me.\n\n       Days go by when I hardly sleep at all, worrying about our \n     bills. Since my benefits were cut off on July 1 at the end of \n     my first extension, we have had to concentrate all of our \n     income on paying the rent and buying food and gas. I have not \n     been able to pay any of our other bills. I don't know how \n     long we can make it like this.\n\n  I don't know how long we can make it like this. And our friends are \nstalling and stalling and stalling. Two months already they have \nstalled.\n  A city planner from Los Angeles writes:\n\n       The effects of the recession were especially acute for \n     anyone whose industry was decimated by the financial crisis. \n     Since municipalities are struggling and real estate \n     development is frozen, jobs in my industry are few . . . my \n     unemployment checks stopped abruptly last week before the 4th \n     of July. I\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\n     called my benefits office thinking this must be a mistake, \n     only to find that the benefits ended because Congress didn't \n     pass the Federal extension.\n\n  Another Californian said:\n\n       I am very scared of what might happen if I lose the \n     unemployment income. We don't want to lose our home. My \n     children catch me crying at times and ask me why are you \n     crying, mom? I can't tell them . . . Please pass this bill \n     until this economy strengthens and more companies start to \n     hire again.\n\n  If people on the other side of the aisle can have a good night's \nsleep knowing this is what is happening in the greatest country in the \nworld on our watch, then fine for them. But I have to tell you, this is \na defining moment of who we are as a Nation. As a Nation.\n  I actually had the experience of a political analyst, someone who \ncomments on politics, say, well, you could understand why people might \nneed two yachts, one on each coast. You know what. We better get back \nto the basics here: people who need to feed their families, people who \nneed to pay their rent, people who do not want to lose their home.\n  We have to do everything we can to revitalize the jobs market. We \nhave taken it from 700,000 jobs lost a month under the Republicans, and \nwe have turned it around, but not fast enough, not far enough.\n  That is why the bills we passed here are so critical. But we have no \ncooperation on that. It would be one thing if the other side said, you \nknow, let's not do unemployment, but let's work on jobs bills. Oh, no, \nthey do not want to work on jobs bills. We have got a small business \njobs bill. We are praying to God--I am--that we get one or two \nRepublicans. This is a bill that is supported across the board by \nchambers of commerce, everybody. I know, Mr. President, how hard you \nhave worked to make sure our community banks can start lending again to \nsmall businesses.\n\n  I have been through nine cities in my State. I have met with small \nbusinesses. They want access to credit. This small business bill is a \nterrific bill, and we can leverage it without it costing the Federal \nGovernment a dime, these loans to qualified small businesses through \nqualified and strong community banks, and leverage all of this to be a \nhuge stimulus, and it actually has. Because of the paybacks to the \ngovernment, we even make a little bit on it.\n  But we do not have our friends helping us with that. After they stall \nthis unemployment bill, they will stall into the night. Hey, it is \ntheir right. It is their right. But it is my right to talk about how I \nfeel about it.\n  They will start stalling small business just as they stalled the tax \nbreaks that they claimed they wanted. They stalled the bill that would \nhave given the research and development tax credit to businesses all \nover this great nation that need that tax break.\n  They have stalled a lot of other tax breaks to businesses. There are \nhuge tax breaks to small businesses in the small business bill they are \nstalling. So this is a moment in history. This is a moment when \npartisanship is way ahead of the needs of the people of this great \nNation.\n  I think it is a sad day when some of my Republican friends come down \nhere and start to demean the people, the people like the one who wrote \nto me, the woman who said: I am scared of what might happen if I lose \nthis unemployment income. We do not want to lose our home. My children \ncatch my crying and ask me why are you crying, mom? I cannot tell them. \nPlease pass this bill until this economy strengthens.\n  Well, I make this commitment: if we have to stay here through the \nnight, until 1 or 2 a.m.--I do not know what the other side wants; they \nhave got their plan of delaying this--fine, then we will stay here \nuntil we get it done. But we are getting this done, because it is the \nright thing to do, because it is the right thing to do to people who \nare actively seeking jobs, who have lost jobs through no fault of their \nown, who have paid into the unemployment compensation fund.\n  We are going to keep on working to create those jobs so we do not \nhave to be here again and again doing this. There are things we can do \nto set the stake for economic recovery. We have done some of them. I \nhave met the workers. I have met the workers in my State who are \nworking on the 405 freeway, the 215 freeway, the 805 freeway, the \nSacramento Airport, the Caldecott tunnel extension, the Doyle Drive \nextension, all up and down my State.\n  I have met those workers who have those jobs because of the Economic \nRecovery Act. Our Republican administration in California has stated \nthat at least 150,000 jobs have been saved or created, and other \nstudies show it is more than that. It is not enough. We have to keep \nworking at it. I am sad to say all we can hope for are two or three \nRepublican votes at that. We are grateful to those brave Republican \nSenators who helped us. We are grateful. I thank God for them that they \nhave the courage to stand and say yes to the American people, yes to \nAmerica's families, and no to partisan politics. I am so grateful to \nthem.\n  When I say that, it probably hurts them on the other side. I don't \nmean to do that. I am just being honest about how I feel about it. If \nanyone ever tells you one vote doesn't make a difference, one vote \nmakes a difference. We swore in a new Senator from West Virginia to \ntake the place of a leader, Robert C. Byrd, who lived his life for \nworking people, for the workers in the mines. How appropriate it was \nthat his first vote was to help working people, working people who, \nthrough no fault of their own, can't find work.\n  I will wrap up at this point. I am ready, so ready for this final \nvote. If we have to stay here through five motions and debate the fact \nthat the wealthiest American billionaires shouldn't have to help us \nwith this recession, I am happy to do that. I am a believer that we all \nhave to do our share. We all have to work together. Hopefully, tonight, \nwhatever time it is, or in the early hours of the morning, my \nconstituents, 200,000-plus in California, will be able to look at their \nkids and smile a little and say: Honey, we still have a chance. We are \ngoing to get out of these tough times. Honey, we are going to do it.\n  That is what this place should be about at a time such as this, \ncreating the policies that create the jobs, working together to do so \nbut never forgetting there are people who just need that bridge until, \nwhen they go for a job, there are not four other people there for the \nsame job. That day will come, if we can work together. I make that \ncommitment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleague from \nCalifornia. I am somewhat amazed to think she would imply we don't care \nabout the unemployed. The fact is, we do. I went through the list of \nthe things she mentioned, as did the Senator from Vermont. I was not \nhere in 2001. I was not here in 2003. I was not here when both the wars \nwere initiated. I had no part in any of that. But even had I been, the \nfact is, we can help two groups of people with this unemployment \ninsurance. There isn't anybody on our side of the aisle who doesn't \nthink we ought to pass extended unemployment benefits. To state or \nimply that is absolutely absurd. It is not about stalling. The majority \nleader did not allow one amendment to allow us an opportunity to have a \nvote on whether we ought to pay for it.\n  The question isn't whether we help the unemployed. Every time we have \noffered ways to do so--as a matter of fact, five times it has been \nrejected that, in fact, our grandchildren should not have to pay for \nthe unemployment benefits of the people who are unemployed today. Five \ntimes it has been rejected. Multiple times we have chosen to not do the \nresponsible thing for two groups of people. It is easy to come to the \nSenate floor and throw darts at people who have a drastic disagreement \non where we stand in this country. But to imply that they don't care is \nout of bounds. The people in Oklahoma who are not getting unemployment \nchecks today I care about just as much as the people who don't have a \njob who aren't getting one. But there is another group of people whom I \nam pressed to serve in Oklahoma as well; that is, their children. The \nassumption that this body can't make the hard choices to eliminate \nthings that are much less important, much more wasteful, an absolute \nwaste of Federal dollars and eliminate those things to pay for \nunemployment insurance is out of the bounds of reality.\n\n[[Page S6057]]\n\n  My colleague from California mentioned several times that all the \npeople who are getting these extended benefits have paid into a fund. \nThey paid zero. This is extended benefits. The extended benefits are \n100 percent paid for by Federal tax dollars. It is the 26 weeks, the \nroutine unemployment, that is paid for through the unemployment fund. \nThe extended benefits, long-term benefits, don't come from any pot of \nmoney except the pot of money of our grandchildren's future.\n  Let's put that to rest. There is not a Republican or a Democrat or an \nIndependent in this body who does not want these folks to get extended \nunemployment benefits. We do. The question is, at a time when we are \ngoing to borrow $1.6 trillion this year alone against the future of our \nchildren, whether maybe we can find $30 billion, that doesn't come \nanywhere close to the priorities of helping people who are unemployed \ntoday. I reject out of hand the idea that we don't have any compassion. \nThe fact is we do.\n  As a matter of fact, our compassion is both short term and long term. \nWe are thinking about the habits of Congress that continually put the \ncredit card into the machine and borrow against the prosperity and \nwell-being of generations that follow. Let's not have any more talk \nabout the fact that we don't want people to have unemployment. We do. \nWe do want them to have unemployment. Multiple times we offered ways \nfor that. It may, in fact, pass this afternoon or early this evening \nthat we are going to extend them and not pay for it. But as the Senator \nfrom California said: It is a defining moment. It certainly is. Is the \nFederal Government, in this difficult economic situation, going to at \nleast make some small attempt to rein in the $300 billion worth of \nwaste, fraud, abuse, and duplication in the Federal Government? The \nanswer we get is no. Discretionary programs over the last 2 years, not \ncounting the stimulus--we can have the stimulus debate some other \ntime--have risen 19.6 percent, when the average wage went up less than \n2 percent. The Federal Government is now twice as big as it was in \n1999, not counting the stimulus. We have 6,400 sets of duplicative \nprograms that the body will not touch. They are all designed to do good \nthings for people. They are highly inefficient, highly ineffective. Yet \nwhat we will do is not that hard work to get rid of the things that \naren't working. We will just charge our children so we can say we took \ncare of unemployment.\n  Hard times require hard decisions. What we are seeing is the easy way \nout. The easy way out is to not pay for this. The easy way out is to \ncharge it to our children and grandchildren. There is no difference in \nthe level of compassion. Everybody wants to take care of those who are \nunemployed. The easy way is to put it on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  The question is, Will we do the right thing for the country? Will we \ndo the best right thing for the country or will we do the easy thing, \nthe politically expedient thing, class envy, ``I am going make somebody \nlook bad because they don't agree with me on the timing of something'' \nor will we act as a body that will ensure both caring for the now and \nensuring the future? It is easy in the Senate to spend money you don't \nhave. The bias is for it. The hard thing is to take and do the best \nright thing. My colleagues, many on both sides of the aisle, in \nnumerous cases over the last 5\\1/2\\ years, have too often done the easy \nthing. We have all these fingers pointing at this administration did \nthis and this administration did this. There are plenty of problems for \nevery administration and every political party to be considered guilty \non because too often both groups have done the short-term politically \nexpedient thing rather than the best right thing for the country.\n  I had, at one of the events that my staff attended this weekend, an \nindividual in Oklahoma who lost his unemployment insurance. He said: \nYou tell Dr. Coburn to be sure and continue to pay for it. I want my \nunemployment insurance. I need my unemployment. I will not be able to \nmake my house payments unless I get that. But I don't want that to come \nfrom my children and grandchildren. I want it to come from the excesses \nand waste in Washington today.\n  So there is another viewpoint, even though we hear it is a critically \nnonpertinent viewpoint. This isn't a partisan issue. This isn't a \ndelaying tactic. This is a real philosophical difference on how we get \nout of the mess we are in.\n  A lot of my colleagues are not happy that I am a Republican a lot of \ntimes because I go after my party just as much as I go after anybody \nelse's. But the fact is, core principles matter. Go look at the history \nof republics. The Senator from California talks about a defining \nmoment. The defining moment for the Athenian Republic was when they \ndecided to start spending money they didn't have on things they didn't \nneed.\n\n  Here is our option today. The reason we are going to have motions is \nbecause we were given no opportunity to amend. That is the only reason \nwe will have motions to suspend the rules. It has nothing to do with a \ndelaying tactic. It has to do with a debate and a Senator's right to \noffer amendments. The Senator from California would be doing the same \nthing if the shoe was turned the other way. If she was precluded from \noffering amendments, she would find a way to offer an amendment, if she \nbelieved from a position, a conscientious position that can be defended \non the basis of facts. You don't have to agree with it, but you can't \ndeny there are economic factors that should play in how we pay for \nunemployment insurance.\n  You can demean us. You can say we are mean. You can say we don't \ncare. But the fact is, none of that is true. It is an absolute untruth.\n  The defining moment is, Will we embrace the quality that built this \ncountry in the first place? That is, being responsible for the problems \nthat are in front of us and not shifting that responsibility to \ngenerations that follow. That is what this debate is all about. When we \nleft here for one break, we had agreed with Senator Reid and Senator \nLevin about extending unemployment insurance. We were told by the \nSpeaker of the House that she wasn't about to set the precedent of \nstarting to pay for unemployment insurance. Why not? When we have a \n$1.6 trillion deficit, when we have $13.3 trillion worth of debt, when \nwe are mortgaging the future of our children, we are stealing \nopportunity away from them as we do it, why not? Why not meet the \nchallenges that are in front of us by responding in a way that says \nmeeting people's needs today is important, and it is important we not \ntake away from the needs of the future as we do so. Yet we are lectured \nthat it is a partisan debate.\n  There is nothing partisan about this. In my soul, I want to help \neverybody out there who is unemployed and facing the tough times. But \nalso in my soul is that I do not want to mortgage the future of any \nmore American children, when we have tremendous amounts of waste, \nfraud, and duplication that can easily be eliminated.\n  One of the motions I am going to offer is to cut $40 billion from the \nFederal Government. America, tell me what part of this you do not agree \nwith. The fact is, we are going to ask that we quit wasting money on \nreal property. We spend $8 billion a year maintaining property we do \nnot want. We have $80 billion worth of empty buildings. It is costing \nus $8 billion a year. Should we continue to spend that $8 billion or \nshould we not spend that $8 billion and take that $8 billion and pay \nfor unemployment insurance?\n  How about collecting unpaid taxes from Federal employees and Members \nof Congress. That is $3 billion. As to currently hired Federal \nemployees, it is already adjudicated they owe $3 billion. I think we \nought to pay it back. I do not think we ought to borrow from the future \nof our children and grandchildren because we do not have the guts to \nsay: Pay up. Quit cheating the Federal Government, employee of the \nFederal Government. That is a small number in terms of the number of \nemployees, but that is a big number: $3 billion. Let's have them pay \nup.\n  Why is it we are not going to eliminate $8 billion in bonuses to \nFederal contractors who did not meet the requirements to get a bonus, \nyet we gave the bonus anyway? Why not eliminate that rather than charge \nthis to our children? Tell me why you will not vote for that? Do you \nthink we ought to be paying bonuses to people who do not deserve them, \ncontractors? It is $6 billion over a 4-year period in just the\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\nDefense Department alone. But you do not want to get rid of that? You \nwould rather charge the money to our kids than make the hard choice of \nalienating some defense contractor or some government contractor \nbecause they got something they did not deserve in the past, when \nsomebody is unemployed who deserves to get unemployment insurance? I do \nnot understand it. Or eliminating nonessential government travel--one \nof the things President Obama wants to do. We spend billions--$14.8 \nbillion, in excess of that--on Federal travel. We are some of the worst \nabusers. Yet we will not discipline ourselves and set an example that \nwe can use a teleconference rather than getting on an airplane and \ngoing somewhere--a video teleconference. At a time such as this, when \nwe are having an economic problem, we will not make the hard decision \nto make tough choices that are maybe not as fun, maybe not as easy. \nWhat I have found is a video teleconference is a whole lot easier than \ntravel, but we will not make that hard choice. We are not going to tell \nthe agencies they are going to have to do it.\n  We will not even put on a Web site all the times we violate our own \nrules on pay-go. On February 12, we passed a law. It used to be a rule \nin the Senate, but now we passed a law. It is called pay-go. It says \nyou cannot have new spending unless you pay for it. Since February 12, \nwhen the President signed that law, we have violated it to the tune of \n$223 billion, where we said: Oh, time out. The pay-go statute does not \napply. We don't have to pay for it. We don't have to eliminate all the \ninefficiencies, all the duplication. We don't have to go after any \nfraud. We are just going to charge it to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Where is the integrity in that? Where is the integrity? Where is the \ncharacter in that? Where is the courage to do the tough thing that \naccomplishes both helping the people who are unemployed but helping our \nkids and helping our Nation? There is not any. There is none. It is the \neasy way out.\n  Lest you think I am making up this stuff, let me give you some \nexamples of Federal duplication. I will just give you four easy \nexamples. We have 70 different government programs--70 different sets \nof bureaucracies--that spend billions of dollars a year, and on none of \nthem is there a metric to measure whether they are effective to help \npeople with food who are hungry. Why 70? Why across six or seven \ndifferent agencies? Why not one or two programs keenly focused with \nmetrics on saying: Are we feeding them or not? Why not eliminate 68 \nsets of bureaucracy and overhead? That is a small one.\n  We have 105 different sets of programs to incentivize our young \npeople to go into math, engineering, science, and technology. It costs \n$3 billion a year, for 105 different programs, in 9 different Federal \nagencies. They are not in the Department of Education. They are \neverywhere.\n  Nobody knows the data, but nobody will vote to make them accountable, \nmake them transparent, eliminate the overhead, streamline the \nbureaucracy. No, we do not want to do that. This body has voted against \ndoing that multiple times when those amendments have been offered.\n  We have a total of 78 job training programs outside the Department of \nLabor, costing billions of dollars a year, none of which have a metric \non them. Yet we do not want to streamline that, eliminate it, get it \ndown to two or three that are focused--some on the chronically \nunemployed, some on the new workers coming in, some on those who are \nhandicapped who might need special assistance. No, we are going to keep \nthe 70-plus programs we have because they are somebody's baby, all of \nwhich are highly inefficient and none of which can prove effectiveness \nwhen you measure them with a metric because they do not have a metric. \nThey cannot demonstrate they are effective.\n  So the debate is not about whether we want to help people who are \nunemployed. The debate is about whether we want to help the people who \nare unemployed as well as the generations that follow us.\n  I am amazed, and continue to be so, how easily this body can abandon \ncommon sense. I do not know if we do not have it to begin with or if we \nare similar to a magnet, and it is two positives, so we repel any \ncommon sense. But nobody would run any organization--private, public--\nbusiness or anything else the way we run the agencies in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  When you start wanting to do something about it, the only thing you \nget is: We can't. Well, the American people are asking us today: \nPlease, do what you can. Do what you can. What we can do is we can pay \nfor unemployment for the next multiple periods of months by eliminating \nthings that are absolutely unnecessary.\n  Do you realize we can save $4.5 billion over the next 10 years by not \nprinting stuff that people do not want. It is all online. We can save \n$450 million a year just by putting common sense into the Government \nPrinting Office. It has been voted down three times on this floor this \nyear. Why not? Why do we continue to take the easy task when the future \nof our country is going to be determined on whether we take the hard \nroad and do the hard thing that benefits both the coming generations \nand those who are experiencing problems today?\n\n  I tell you why it is. It is because we say we care, but we do not. We \nplay the game, but we do not get in the game. Getting in the game means \nthat you get criticized, that you offer ideas, some of which may work \nand some of which may not, but you are not afraid to change the game \nbecause our kids' future, our country's future depend on changing the \ngame.\n  What we have heard today is the resistance to changing the game. We \ndo not have a future if we do not start making hard choices. It is an \neasy choice for me to vote with the Senator from California to pay for \nunemployment benefits. I want those people to get it. It is a hard \nchoice for me to vote against it and say: Let's pay for it. If, in \nfact, you will pay for it, I will vote with you. It is not like we \ncannot find $40 billion. Every third grader in this country can find \n$40 billion in this budget. There is no rocket science to it. There is \nso much waste, so much duplication, and so much fraud that anybody can \nfind it.\n  The question is, Do we have the will to do the best right thing for \nthis country? One of the things I have learned in 5\\1/2\\ years in this \nbody is that when people use straw men and people use half-truths, it \nis usually because they are hiding something. What is being hidden from \nthe American public today? What is this debate truly all about? Is it \njust about unemployment or is it about we like the way things are?\n  We do not want to change the way things are, we do not want to get \nout of our comfort zone to solve the real problems of America, so, \ntherefore, we will use all sorts of tactics to deflect what the real \nissues of the day are.\n  What are they? The Senator from California rightly outlines that \nmillions of Americans need unemployment compensation right now. I am \nall for it. What is the other truth about where we are? The truth is, \nthis country is on an absolute unsustainable course. The American \npeople have awakened to it. They know it.\n  As the Senator from California knows, this is not new for me. I have \nbeen doing this for 5\\1/2\\ years. So it did not matter if it was the \n``bridge to nowhere,'' which a Republican authored, or unemployment \ncompensation today, I think we use common sense and do the best right \nthing for America, not the politically easy thing.\n  So the challenge before us today is to go home and explain, when this \nbill passes, why we charged it to the least of us. That is whom we are \ncharging it to: to the least of us.\n  I told a story not long ago. In my profession as a physician, I have \ndelivered nearly 4,000 babies--maybe over that. I quit counting. But \nthe thing that has always gotten me, when I am delivering a baby--and I \nhave a mother there and a father there and that baby comes out--is to \nsee the glow on the face and in the eyes of those parents. The glow is \nabout hope and promise for the future and about what things can be and \nthe potential that is unlimited when that new life is here. You see it \nin the parents, and you see them puff up and say: Wow, what a \nphenomenon.\n  As I think about what we do today, we are stealing that. We are \ntaking it from those kids because we refuse to have the backbone and \ncourage to do the hard, yet the best right thing for this country.\n  We will hear a lot of speeches about how bad we are because we want \nto pay\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\nfor it. We will be talked down. It will be said that we want to \nobstruct. I honestly admit I don't want anything to go through this \nbody that isn't paid for. You can count on it every time. Everybody on \nthat side of the aisle, and most on my side of the aisle, have run in \ncross-wise with me on things that aren't paid for. They know. It is not \na fetish; it is that I actually recognize the long-term future of this \ncountry depends on us getting our fiscal house in order.\n  So it is a defining moment, as the Senator from California said. But \nit is not the defining moment she thinks it is. It is the defining \nmoment of whether this body is going to grab onto and truly accept the \nresponsibility given to us by the American people. Will we truly accept \nit? How we act on it determines our commitment to this country.\n  I don't disagree with those who just want to get it through and get \npeople paid. They have a right to have that position. I am not \ndemeaning that position. I am just saying the country can't last if we \nkeep doing it. Our kids don't have a future if we keep doing it. If we \nlook at the budget projections for our country, we will run--even with \nthe tax increases that are coming at the end of this year--we are going \nto run $1 trillion deficits until 2020.\n  Let me close with one final thought. We have a $4 trillion budget. We \nare going to run a $1.6 trillion deficit this year. That means we are \ngoing to borrow that from our children. The deficit by this time next \nyear will be close to $14 trillion.\n  Have my colleagues ever thought about what $1 trillion is? My \ncolleague from Georgia explained it to me. I didn't believe him, so I \ndid the math.\n  If we spend $1 a second, so that means we spend $60 a minute, or \n$3,600 an hour--$3,600 an hour, the wealthiest in our country probably \ndon't spend that, but let's say we did--how long would it take us to \nspend $1 trillion? The answer is 31,709 years spending $3,600 an hour \nbefore we ever get to $1 trillion. We get $1 trillion deficits $30 \nbillion, $40 billion at a time, which is the cost of this bill. The way \nwe start getting out of debt is to stop adding to it.\n  If we go back to February 12 when the law went into effect on pay-go, \nand we add this bill to it, we are going to be at $\\1/4\\ trillion since \nFebruary 12 that this body will have added to our children's deficit. \nIt is not our debt. Nobody in this room and probably very few people \nlistening to this debate are going to pay one penny against it. It is \nall going to be borne by the children coming.\n  So what is pay-go about? Pay-go is about this, America: You pay and \nwe will go spend. We are seeing evidence of it today on the Senate \nfloor. It is not just that we pay; We pay, our children pay, and our \ngrandchildren pay. We are going to pay with real dollars, but our \ngrandchildren are going to pay with lost opportunity, lower levels of \neducation, lower levels of everything in the future.\n  There is not one problem in front of this country we can't solve. We \ncan't solve them by borrowing money that we don't have to spend on a \ngood thing, let alone a bad thing, but on a good thing while we allow \nhundreds of billions of dollars to be wasted every year in this \ncountry.\n  So when we hear the cry that somebody doesn't care, we have to ask \nthe question, What do they care about? Can we care for those who are \nunemployed today as well as care for our kids? Yes, we can. It is \nreally not all that hard, with the examples of waste and duplication. \nThere is $100 billion worth of fraud in Medicare that we can document. \nSo there are all sorts of things we can do. The question is, Do we have \nthe courage? Will we step to the line? Will we do what is best for our \nchildren and the unemployed? That is the question. It is not that \nsomebody doesn't have compassion for the unemployed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much, Mr. President. As Senator Coburn was \ntalking about the need to balance the budget, I was remembering that I \nvoted to do that. With the leadership of Bill Clinton and the \nDemocrats, we not only balanced the budget but we created surpluses. It \nwas a great feeling. We did it, we know how to do it, and we will do it \nagain.\n  Let's talk about what is before us right now. It is not about the \nunemployed versus our children. Our long-term unemployed have children, \nand these children are seeing their dads and moms with their heads in \ntheir hands, they see tears, and they don't know why. I have letters \nfrom my constituents. They don't know what to tell their kids. They are \nworking so very hard.\n  So let's talk about what is before us today. We know how to get to \nthe balanced budget. That is why we have budgeting. That is why we have \nauthorizing. That is why we have appropriations. That is why President \nObama has said he will cut the deficit in half at the end of his first \nterm, and I am confident that will be the case, and maybe we can even \ndo more. We know how to do that.\n  Hearing the Senator from Oklahoma say we are being partisan makes no \nsense at all. I sang the praises of my Republican friends who have \njoined with us in making sure we can extend unemployment benefits \ntoday. I thank God for them, frankly. So this isn't about partisanship. \nIt is about pulling together as a country and recognizing that we are \nin the worst recession since the Great Depression. It is no time for \npartisanship. It is time to pull together and help our kids and help \nour families and help those who, through no fault of their own, find \nthemselves in this predicament.\n  Why are we treating this like an emergency? That is what we are \ndoing. It is something that has always been done because it is an \nemergency. President Ronald Reagan signed three extensions of \nunemployment compensation without paying for it because he believed it \nwas an emergency and because he understood what we understand. He \nunderstood that when we, in fact, make sure unemployed people have this \ninsurance--which they paid into, by the way--they will spend it \nlocally, and every dollar of that unemployment compensation brings to \nthe economy either $1.61 under calculations done by John McCain's \neconomic adviser, Mark Zandi, or CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich said it yields $1.90.\n  Some of the proposals we have seen from the other side are to cut \nother jobs in order to pay for extending unemployment benefits. That is \nnot going to help us at this time.\n  So, yes, I remember the wonderful feeling I had when we balanced the \nFederal budget when Bill Clinton was President, when we created \nsurpluses as far as the eye could see. The debt was on the way down. \nThe minute the Republicans took over, they put tax cuts to the \nwealthiest on their credit card. They put two wars on their credit \ncard. Spend, spend, spend, spend, spend. All that work we did was, \nunfortunately, reversed.\n  What is before us today is a very simple proposition. My friend from \nOklahoma says he cares deeply about the unemployed. I have no reason to \ndoubt that. He should join us today in voting to extend these benefits. \nRonald Reagan saw it clearly. He extended them three times as \nemergencies because it is an emergency. He knew it was \ncounterproductive to cut other jobs to pay for the extension of \nunemployment benefits.\n\n  We know how to balance this budget. Pay-go is a part of it. Pay-go: \nPay for everything you do except emergencies. That is what we should be \ndoing because to do otherwise is counterproductive.\n  I am so grateful we are nearing the point where we can extend these \nbenefits. Yes, we have been delayed. We have been delayed for 2 months. \nI read letters into the Record before. Here is one:\n\n       I have kept up a relentless job search. I have applied for \n     at least 600 jobs. This is discouraging, not receiving any \n     information back. Days go by when I hardly sleep at all \n     worrying about the bills. We have had to concentrate all of \n     our income on paying the rent and buying gas. I can't pay for \n     other bills.\n\n  Another Californian:\n\n       I am very scared of what might happen if I lose the \n     unemployment income. We don't want to lose our home. My \n     children catch me crying at times and ask me: Why are you \n     crying, Mom? I can't tell them. Please pass this bill until \n     this economy strengthens.\n\n  So, again, this isn't about the way the Senator from Oklahoma phrases \nit.\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\nHe makes it sound as though children aren't involved in this situation. \nThey are. They are the children of the unemployed. So it is clear that, \nyes, we are going to have to tackle the deficit. Of course, we are \ngoing to have to tackle the deficit. We don't need to be lectured about \nthat because we are the party that did it. We are the party that \ncreated the balanced budget. We are the party that created the \nsurpluses, plus 23 million jobs, and the other side, unfortunately, \ndidn't take very long to turn that whole thing around. This economy \nwent into a ditch, and we are working hard to get it out of that ditch.\n  So I wish to close with this: Let's take care of this emergency. It \nis going to help our families. It is going to help our children. It is \ngoing to help our local communities when people can go down and buy the \ngas at the local gas station, buy the food at the local grocery store, \nand be able to be stable in the community. Then let's get back \nimmediately to working on bills that are going to create jobs.\n  The small business bill that the Senator from Oregon has worked so \nhard on and the Senator from Louisiana has worked so hard on, and many \nof us have worked with them, that is a good bill and it is 100 percent \npaid for. It even has a plus to it. It is going to create jobs through \nsmall business. Small business creates more than 60 percent of the jobs \nin this Nation. We have a chance to help those who are struggling.\n  So we need to get this bill behind us and go to the small business \nbill. We are going to need 60 votes. They are filibustering that as \nwell. So everything we do takes 60 votes.\n  If I read the list of supporters for the small business bill, it \nincludes the Chamber of Commerce, the regional Chambers of Commerce, \nand businesses and community banks. They want to see this bill happen \nbecause our small businesses need access to credit. Our very good small \nbusinesses are being turned away. I visited so many of them. They are \nthriving even in this climate, but they need to expand and they can't \nget access to the capital.\n  So, please, let's not see a filibuster there as well. Please, let's \nnot see delay there as well. Let's do this unemployment compensation, \nget the assistance to the people who deserve it, those who are actively \nseeking work, who can't find it through no fault of their own, and who \npaid into the unemployment compensation fund. Let's get that behind us. \nThat will help our communities. Then let's get to the small business \nbill. It is a small business jobs bill. Let's do the right thing. We \ncan get this economy back on its feet, but we need to work together.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, during the debate, I had a chance to sit \nin the chair for a while and listen to one of my colleagues from across \nthe aisle. In the space of just a short period of time, that colleague \nturned this into a debate about courage, about integrity, about \ncharacter, and about easy versus hard choices. In other words, he took \nall of his time to use attacks on those who do not share his version of \neconomic policy and where our country should go. Rather than making the \narguments, he made the personal attacks.\n  He also said something that struck me as right-on, which is that \noften when people are using personal attacks, they are trying to \ncamouflage and only give half the story and trying to set up a straw \nman. That is certainly accurate.\n  What is the real debate we are having on the floor? Well, on one \nside, there is the argument--an argument I would weigh in favor of--\nthat says we need to put this economy back on track, put families to \nwork, and that it is through jobs for American families, and that we \nwill restore the financial foundations not only of families but of our \ncommunities and of our Nation as a whole.\n  There are certain key things we can do now to accomplish that. Those \nthings include helping our school districts create a bridge through \nthis recession so we don't see thousands of teachers being laid off. \nThere is a provision to assist our school districts in the Defense \nsupplemental bill we will have in the Senate in the near future.\n  Second, we can assist families who are unemployed through no fault of \ntheir own and help them create a bridge through this recession.\n  Third, we can help our small businesses create jobs because there is \na dysfunction right now in which our community banks that best \nunderstand Main Street are at their leverage limits and therefore \ncannot make additional loans. Indeed, the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve was speaking to this challenge in the Capitol just an hour \nago--the systemic dysfunction in which capital is hung up and \nunavailable to our small businesses. It is our small businesses that, \nby utilizing that capital, can seize economic opportunity and put \npeople back to work. It is a good strategy to enable those funds to be \navailable to small businesses and help recapitalize community banks. It \nmakes money for the Treasury. The CBO estimated it will make $1 billion \nfor the Treasury. It does it by enabling $300 billion in liquidity to \nsmall businesses. The CBO estimate of the funds that come back to the \nTreasury doesn't include the revenue created by families who are put \nback to work and pay income taxes or by small businesses that are more \nsuccessful and pay more in business taxes.\n  So it is a win-win. We create a path by supporting our States through \nfunds for education, and we create a path through this recession by \nhelping families who are unemployed because the economy is in such a \nmess. We create a path out of this recession by creating jobs for \nAmerican families by supporting our small businesses through our \ncommunity banks. That is one version of how we can go forward.\n  My colleague across the aisle has a different version. The different \nversion is--and this is the leadership of the Republican side that has \nbeen talking about this all this week. Their version is, no, instead of \nhelping families, small businesses, and schools, we want to extend the \nBush tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. That is the path out of this \nrecession, say my colleagues across the aisle.\n  There is a fundamental difference of economic strategy involved. What \nis striking to me is that we have a lot of information about the \nstrategy being proposed by my colleagues across the aisle because this \nwas the Bush Presidency strategy. We tried it. We found out that when \nyou give away the National Treasury to the wealthiest Americans, you \ndrive this Nation into debt. In fact, under the Bush administration, we \ndoubled our national debt.\n  Under the very idea and plan for which my colleagues across the aisle \nare advocating, we drove this Nation's economy into the ground. To \ncounteract that, the Bush administration said: Let's deregulate the \nbanks and Wall Street and make everything move a little faster, and \nmaybe consumers will spend a little more and banks will take more risk, \nand we will take away all the lane markers and the traffic signals in \nour financial system, and, by golly, somehow we will make this economy \nflourish.\n  Do you know what. They built a house of cards. It was a house of \ncards built on predatory mortgages and the securitization of those \nmortgages, with extraordinary leverage of up to 40 to 1 under that \nderegulation. That house of cards came down, and that house crashed on \nthe American family, and that American family lost their savings for \nretirement. Families in my State lost their jobs, and the unemployment \nrate is huge. The families lost the health care that went with their \njobs. Well, that is not a very pretty picture. But my colleagues, who \nbrought us that Bush economic nightmare that crashed on the heads of \nthe American families, are coming to this floor and saying: We want \nmore of the same.\n  Earlier, my colleague across the aisle characterized that strategy as \nthe ``tough'' choice, while he characterized the strategy of helping \nAmerican families and small businesses and schools as an ``easy'' \nchoice. Well, let's try to set these pejoratives or characterizations \naside and just say that they are different choices--one, the revival of \nthe Bush strategy, which is something like the summer sequel to a cheap \nhorror story that wrecks the economy of the United States. That \nstrategy is sitting as a potential idea and threat to our Nation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask, through the Chair, if my friend will\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\nyield for me to make a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I am pleased to yield to the majority leader for that \npurpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture \ntime be considered expired, after the use or yielding back of time \nspecified in this agreement; that upon the expiration of time, \namendment No. 4426 be withdrawn; that debate on the motions to suspend \nthe rules with respect to H.R. 4213, and that the motions not be \ndivisible, as specified here, be limited to 20 minutes each, with the \ntime divided equally between the proponents and the majority leader or \nhis designee; that upon the expiration of all time, the Senate proceed \nto vote on the motions to suspend in the order in which offered; that \nafter the first vote and prior to each succeeding vote in this \nsequence, there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided as specified \nabove, with succeeding votes limited to 10 minutes each; that upon \ndisposition of the motions, the motion to strike, which is at the desk, \nbe agreed to; no further motions or amendments be in order; that the \npay-go statement from the Budget Committee be read into the Record, and \nwithout further intervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to \nvote on the motion to concur with amendment No. 4425, as amended; \nfurther, that the motions to suspend be those which appear on pages \nS6034 and S6035 of the Congressional Record of July 20: two Coburn \nmotions, the Brown motion, and two DeMint motions.\n  I also ask that my friend from Oregon now have whatever time \nnecessary to complete his statement. How much time does he need?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that my request be amended in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for everyone's information, we should be \nable to proceed through these pretty quickly. It is likely--and this \ndoesn't take away from the statements to be made by my friends on the \nother side, and we may not use much of our time--that we can move these \nalong fairly quickly. There will be five votes, and, as indicated in \nthe consent agreement, the first will be the regular time, and after \nthat there will be 10 minutes on the final four.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I note that there are a couple of issues \nraised that really are false issues. One is in regard to the debt. My \ncolleagues across the aisle are proposing a massive increase of the \ndebt by extending the Bush tax cuts, and they are saying that helping \nthose who are unemployed through no fault of their own is an increase \nto the debt. This is coming from the same folks who brought us the Bush \npolicy, the ones who doubled our national debt during the Bush \nadministration and created the house of cards that crashed down upon \nthe American families over the last 2 years.\n  So it is not about debt. When it comes to our children--and I hate to \nsee the abuse of this argument--sound economic policy is the right \nthing. If we put families to work, those families are far healthier, \nthose families have a foundation, they have a future, and they \nrecognize there is a horizon that is brighter. They recognize they will \nbe able to move forward to create opportunity for their children. That \nis the foundation of a successful family. But giveaways to the \nwealthiest at the expense of helping families is wrong for our \nchildren. If you don't put people back to work, you don't create an \neconomic revival, you don't create revenues in the Treasury, and \ntherefore you don't create the ability to pay down that debt.\n  So do we want the Bush policy 2, the nightmare that doubled our debt, \nor do we want the investment in families and education that we had \nunder the Clinton administration and that we have under the Obama \nadministration, which will put money back into the Treasury? I think \nthe choice is clear: Let's shore up small businesses and our families, \nlet's shore up education, let's put this economy back on track, and \nlet's put people to work, and in so doing we will address and resolve \nthe issue of the deficit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I enjoyed the prior \nspeeches. I don't necessarily agree with them, but I enjoyed them. \nThere is plenty of blame to go around. We can go back to the fact that \nthe majority party has been in charge for 4 years and President Bush is \nno longer in charge, so saying Bush this and Bush that--that gets old. \nWe need to focus on problem-solving today.\n  One of the prior speakers mentioned that it takes 60 votes for \ncloture to move things forward. Sometimes you have those 60 votes. \nOther times, there are going to be 41. There are going to be 41 when \nyou try to overspend, overtax, and overregulate and, I feel, make it so \nbusinesses cannot move forward to create those jobs that were just \nreferenced and that we need to start to focus on.\n  Since I have been here, with all due respect, we haven't done much on \njobs at all. That is frustrating not only for me but for the American \npeople and the people of Massachusetts.\n  I am standing before you today to once again consider legislation to \nextend the unemployment benefits, and once again this legislation, as \nwe know, will add approximately $30 billion to our Nation's debt, which \nis currently $13 trillion and rising. To put that into perspective, I \nhave been here about 6 months, and I remember that when I first got \nhere, the debt calculator was about $11.95 trillion. It is now $13.1 \ntrillion--give or take--and rising, with no end in sight. I find that \ndeeply troubling.\n  While it is clear that it appears we have the votes to advance this \nmeasure and it will pass the Senate, I have felt--and I have talked \nabout it for a month now--that there is a better way. I stand before \nyou to propose an alternative that will be fully paid for by using the \nbank account and not the credit card because rather than putting the \ncost on that credit card and passing it on to our children and \ngrandchildren, it is the great-grandchildren who are being affected as \nwell.\n  Listen, we on this side of the aisle want to help as well, and my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle do too. It is not a partisan \nissue. I agree with the Senator who spoke before me. I agree with her. \nBut no one is disputing the value of these programs, not only what it \nmeans to the citizens of Massachusetts and across the country who are \nhaving a difficult time, but our economy, as we know, is slow. It is \nshowing signs every once in a while of recovering, but it is very slow. \nPeople out of work need extra assistance while they search for that new \nemployment.\n  What I want to debate is whether we continue our spending ways to add \nto the credit card, to the debt, versus finding ways to pay for it with \nthe money we have. I can tell my colleagues as the ranking member on \nthe contracting subcommittee, looking at the amount of waste in Federal \nGovernment, we can find a way to pay for this program by using the bank \naccount, not the credit card.\n  I am flabbergasted as to why we do not think outside the box. Some of \nthe speakers before me said the Republicans are doing this; the \nRepublicans are doing that. With all due respect, I have made many \nefforts to work across party lines, as you know, Mr. President, and as \nthe other Members do too. Bipartisanship is a two-way street. You \ncannot tell me we also do not have good ways and good ideas to finance, \nto find ways to solve these problems.\n  The American people have made it very clear they want elected \nRepresentatives in Congress to start paying for the initiatives we are \ntrying to push without raising taxes and start exercising the type of \nfiscal restraint they use in their own homes and that they use in their \nbusinesses.\n  Last month's vote on larger tax extenders legislation raised taxes by \nalmost $60 billion and increased the deficit by $33 billion. It was \ndefeated, and I feel rightly so. Congress must start listening to the \nAmerican people. They are telling us they are tired of the \noverspending, the overtaxation, the increasing debt, the \noverregulation, and the involvement in their lives. They just want to \nbe left alone and be able to go to work, pay the bills, take the kids \nout to a movie, pay for their mortgages, pay for school, and they do \nnot want to have this constant reaching\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\ninto their pockets--just take your wallet and give it to them, just \ngive it to them. Enough.\n  We have to start listening as a body. Forget the party bickering. \nForget all that. I am way past that. I proposed a fiscally responsible \nway to pay for everything we are trying to do today. We can find a \nfunding source without adding to the credit card, to that debt we all \nknow about and is rising uncontrollably. We cannot keep spending like \nwe are doing. I know it and many people in America know it.\n  This is not the first time Republicans have come to the floor to \noffer a path forward on emergency unemployment insurance that is paid \nfor. We tried four times already to do just that, and each and every \ntime it has been opposed.\n  As I said, my amendment pays for the cost of extending unemployment \ninsurance by rescinding unobligated stimulus funds and cutting other \nstimulus funds that are estimated not to be used for years. We have \nalready heard the stories about the waste and the fluff. Let's get the \nmoney out the door right now. Let's put it to work right now.\n  If this is an emergency as is being said, then let's get the money \nthat is not being used out the door right now.\n  My amendment reduces the deficit by $7 billion instead of increasing \nit by $34 billion, as the present legislation that is being proposed \nwill do.\n  Yes, my amendment is about hard choices. Recently, the Governors of \nboth parties expressed concerns about how the stimulus funds have been \nspent and whether the true impact is accurate. States have also weighed \nin asking Congress for extended unemployment benefits and additional \nFMAP funding. I believe we have a clear choice where we can offset the \namount of money we have and get it out the door, not using it as a \nWashington, DC, slush fund, as it is looked at in America.\n  The amendment I am offering today represents another compromise--\nlistening to the concerns of so many Americans and their calls to \nextend emergency unemployment insurance specifically but also not \nburdening future generations and making sure we can actually pay for \nthings, truly pay for things.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I have been in Washington for a little over 6 \nmonths now. Sometimes, as you might know, Mr. President, it seems like \n6 years. You have followed my voting record, as I said. When I see a \ngood bill, regardless of party, I will support it, no questions asked. \nOnce again, it is a two-way street. Bipartisanship is a two-way street. \nIt needs to come both ways.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  In closing, I move to suspend rule XXII, paragraph 2, for the purpose \nof proposing and considering my amendment No. 4492.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I move to suspend provisions of rule XXII \nfor the purpose of proposing and considering my motion to commit with \ninstructions with respect to H.R. 4213, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the motion is pending.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I move to suspend provisions of rule XXII, \nincluding germaneness requirements, for the purpose of proposing and \nconsidering my amendment No. 4493.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the motion is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from \nMassachusetts. The blame game has gone on long enough. There is \ncertainly enough blame to go around. But I need to remind the majority \nthat they have been in control of Congress for 4 years. Presidents do \nnot write economic policy, spend money, or add to the debt. Congress \ndoes. The Democratic Party has been in control of both Houses since \n2006.\n  When the Democrats took control, unemployment was below 5 percent, \nthe economy was growing, and the debt was half of what it is today. \nCertainly looking at the projected debt of this administration, we are \nlooking at tripling the national debt over the next decade.\n  It is time for us to focus on solving problems rather than trying to \nwax eloquent about a President who effectively did not write economic \npolicy for over 4 years.\n  It is important today that we are extending unemployment benefits. \nBut it is curious to a lot of us when the majority has often said \nunemployment compensation is one of the most important forms of \nstimulus, that when Republicans ask that we pay for the extension of \nunemployment benefits with unspent stimulus money, there appears to be \noutrage. Instead, there is a strong consensus on the Democratic side \nthat we not pay for this; we just add it to the national debt.\n  I, frankly, do not think we can help people for a few months by \nbankrupting our country. We know our debt is unsustainable. To bring up \nbill after bill that we are not even willing to talk about how we pay \nfor is disturbing to millions of Americans right now.\n  I certainly support my colleague from Massachusetts, as well as my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, who are presenting amendments today, \nreasonable, commonsense ways that we can pay for the unemployment \nbenefits extension so that helping people today does not diminish the \nquality of life of millions of Americans tomorrow.\n  Another issue that is going to affect millions of Americans is in \njust over 5 months tax rates for almost every American who pays taxes \nis going to go up. It is something that is not talked about, and \nRepublicans are not talking about a tax cut. We are talking about \nkeeping current tax rates the same.\n  A few weeks ago, I offered an amendment that would at least keep \ncapital gains and dividend taxes the same rather than allow them to go \nup--dividend taxes to nearly 40 percent and capital gains from 15 \npercent to 20 percent. Many senior citizens count on dividends, as well \nas cashing in their retirement savings. Capital gains and dividend \ntaxes have a huge impact on our senior citizens as well as millions of \nother Americans. Unfortunately, the majority voted this amendment down \nand voted effectively to raise these taxes on Americans.\n  Income taxes will go up. But today I want to focus on what I think is \nprobably the most immoral tax that we impose on people from the Federal \nlevel, and that is the death tax.\n  This year, the death tax is gone, the first year since the early \n1900s. Americans who work and save, start businesses, start farms, \ntheir heirs do not have to sell their property in order to pay the \ndeath tax.\n  The Heritage Foundation says if we allow the death tax to go back up \nto 55 percent, it will cost Americans over 1.5 million jobs because \nthis is not just for the people who pay the death tax, it is for the \npeople who work in the businesses and the farms that are often \nliquidated or at least sold in part to pay this heavy tax.\n  What right does the government have to take someone's property \nbecause they die? They have paid taxes on the property and on the \nincome throughout their entire lives, and many times they paid a very \nhigh tax rate if they worked hard and made a good living.\n  What right do we have when they die to take that property? Why should \nthe government get a bigger inheritance from someone dying than their \nfamily?\n  That is what is going to happen if we allow the majority to continue \nwith their plans to allow the death tax to go up. This will cost lots \nof jobs, break up many family businesses and family farms, and cost, as \nI said, 1.5 million jobs. It makes absolutely no sense at all.\n  I am going to offer an amendment today to keep current tax rates the \nsame for the death tax which was eliminated this year.\n  Another amendment I am going to offer relates to the Arizona \nimmigration law. I took the time to read the immigration law that \nArizona passed and found that much of what has been reported in the \nmedia is completely false. I was actually stunned as I read through it \nhow often it refers to just the enforcement of existing Federal law. \nThere is nothing in it about racial profiling, except that we cannot do \nit, and we cannot stop someone if we suspect them of being illegal. We \ncan only\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\nask for documentation if we stop them or arrest them for some other \ncrime. This is, in effect, the Federal law.\n  It is interesting that the Obama administration is suing Arizona for \nenforcing Federal law while ignoring many sanctuary cities that openly \nflaunt their resistance to Federal law. It makes no sense in a free \ncountry, in a democracy where we are built on the rule of law, for the \nFederal Government to try to intimidate the people of Arizona who are \nonly trying to protect themselves.\n  As many Americans know, Arizona waited for years for the Federal \nGovernment to do its job, to secure the borders, and to protect the \npeople from the drug trafficking, the human trafficking, and the people \nwho come across and who have murdered the citizens there.\n  Many States are suffering the same fate of a Federal Government that \nhas failed to secure our borders and to protect our people.\n  The amendment I am offering today is going to disallow any funding to \nbe used by the Federal Government to carry out this lawsuit against \nArizona. This is something we know, if the American people could vote \ntoday, they would vote in favor of. The question is, Will the majority \nvote to support the people of Arizona or to support this political move \nthat we are now seeing from the White House to attempt to intimidate \nthe people of Arizona?\n  I can say proudly that the people of Arizona are not going to be \nintimidated by this government. If we can provide some help today, that \nis certainly what I intend to do.\n  Mr. President, I wish to offer a couple of motions.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  In accordance with rule V of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I move \nto suspend rule XXII for the purpose of proposing and considering a \nmotion to commit with regard to the estate tax, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the motion is pending.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, according to rule V of the standing rules \nof the Senate, I move to suspend rule XXII for the purpose of proposing \nand considering a motion to commit with regard to the Arizona \nimmigration law, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the motion is pending.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my high school English teacher always used \nto say: All right, let's review things. So let's review things just for \na moment.\n  I have listened to some of this debate in the Senate today, and as \nbest as I can tell, we have people standing, saying the deficit is a \nbad thing. I think there is general agreement about that in the Senate, \nand we have to do something about it. There is general agreement about \nthat.\n  They say: We are going to make our last stand here on this deficit \nwith respect to those who are out of work and who need extension of \nunemployment benefits. We were quick to give help to the wealthiest \nAmericans, to the biggest investment banks that needed help. We gave \nhundreds of billions of dollars to those interests at the top of the \neconomic ladder, who nearly ran the country right into the ditch. But \nthose at the bottom of the ladder, who are out of work, who are \nunemployed, and who are having trouble, that is where they say they are \nmaking their last stand on deficits.\n  So let me try to understand this with a review. We are told the \ndeficit is too high; that we cannot give help to the unemployed in the \nmanner we used to give help to the unemployed. We always did that when \nthere was an economic downturn. We have always done that. But, oh, by \nthe way, what we need to do is to repeal the estate tax for the \nwealthiest individuals in America. I don't know. I took mathematics in \na high school senior class of nine students, and I passed it at least. \nI can understand how things add up now and then. But I don't know how \nthat adds up at all.\n  There are those coming to the floor of the Senate and having great \napoplexy about giving help to the unemployed. By the way, some have \neven said: You give help to the unemployed, it just discourages them \nfrom work. Well, you know something, a guy told me the other day about \na young third grader who was asked in his school--it was going to be \nhis birthday--what he would like for his birthday; what kind of \nbirthday present he would like. This little third grader said: A \nflashlight. The guy said: A flashlight? He said: Yes, so I can read at \nnight. They turned off our electricity.\n  How many in this room would even understand having your electricity \nturned off and having a third grade son who can't read at night because \nthere are no lights and asking for a flashlight as a gift? There is \nnobody in here who is unemployed--not one person in this room. This is \na roomful of people who take their showers in the morning, not at \nnight. They get up and put on a blue suit, a pressed white shirt and a \ntie and come to work--all fully employed--and we talk about the \nunemployed.\n  We are short 20 million jobs in this country. There are millions of \npeople out of work. Five million manufacturing employees alone have \nlost their jobs in the last 9 years. As we ran into this deepest \nrecession since the Great Depression, a whole lot of folks--yes, at the \nlower end of the economic ladder and in middle-income areas--have lost \ntheir jobs and can't find another job. When they worked, from their \npaychecks they paid a small premium for unemployment insurance. They \npaid for that insurance, and now they can't get the extension of that \nunemployment insurance in the Senate. Why? Because the last stand on \ndeficits is to take place with respect to restricting the ability of \nthose who are out of work from getting the funds to extend their \nunemployment benefits. That is the last stand.\n  Did my colleagues make that last stand with regard to the big \ninvestment banks that ran into trouble? No, not at all. They rushed \nthat aid in on a pillow. Can we help you? How much do you need? But now \nthat it is the folks at the bottom of the ladder, all of a sudden we \ndon't have the capability.\n  Some of my colleagues just complained about speakers who wanted to \ntalk about the past. You know, if you don't understand the past, you \nare destined to repeat it. I understand that neither side is much of a \nbargain--Republicans and Democrats. This country deserves more from \nboth sides. I understand that. But I also understand what has caused \nthis problem. I was on the floor of the Senate in February of 2001. By \nthe way, when President Clinton left office 2 months prior to that we \nhad the first budget surplus in 30 years--over $200 billion in surplus. \nPresident Bush said: You know, we have these projected surpluses now \nfor 10 years. Let's get rid of them. Let's give big tax cuts, with the \nbiggest by far going to the wealthiest Americans.\n  I stood on the floor and said: Let's be a little conservative. What \nif something happens? They said: You know what, we are going to give \nthese tax cuts, and the biggest cuts are going to the wealthiest \nAmericans. If you made $1 million a year, that bill gave you, I think, \n$80,000 a year in tax cuts. So everyone on that side voted for it. \nAbsolutely. Happy to vote for it, to reduce this country's income. What \nhappened? Very quickly, we ran into a recession. Then we had a \nterrorist attack against our country on 9/11. Then we were at war in \nAfghanistan, then at war in Iraq, and this Congress appropriated \nmassive amounts of money as it sent young men and women to war and did \nnot pay for one penny of it--not a penny. All of it went right onto the \ndebt.\n  Those who cry the loudest on the floor of the Senate these days, \nright now, are the very ones who voted to reduce this country's income \nwith the biggest benefits going to the wealthiest Americans. Yet now \nthey come to us and say: Well, you know, now we are making our last \nstand for the unemployed--to prevent the unemployed from getting what \nthey should get. By the way, while we are on the floor, they say: Why \ncan't we repeal the estate tax that will help the wealthiest Americans?\n  Let me mention the estate tax for a moment. First of all, my \ncolleague said death tax. He knows, and I know, there is no such thing \nas a death tax. If my colleague should die, his estate is not\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\ntaxed. His entire estate goes tax free, under current law, to his \nspouse. It is true this year there is zero estate tax for anybody, and \nmy colleague didn't mention that was created in an architecture of tax \ncuts in 2001 that many of us voted against.\n  By the way, that turns out to have been just fundamentally goofy. \nThey created estate tax relief that goes down, down, down, and down to \nzero in this year and then springs way back up in 2011. We didn't do \nthat. That wasn't us. That was the other side. Now what they say is \nthat they would like to repeal the estate tax altogether because they \nthink it is a tax on death. It is not. It is a tax on inherited wealth \nand they know that.\n  But this year, because there is zero estate tax, about four \nbillionaires have died and not one penny of their estate will be taxed \nand most of their estates were never taxed. They were growth \nappreciation of stocks and various assets never subject to a tax. Most \npeople have an income and it is subject to a tax. They help send kids \nto school with that tax, pay to build roads, pay for police, pay for \ndefense. But that runup in tax for the billionaires or that runup in \nincome, I should say, has never borne a tax to support anything. My \ncolleagues say: You know what, I want to make sure it doesn't ever bear \na tax. Let's have the little folks pay a tax. Let's have the rest of \nthe folks pay a tax but not the people at the top.\n  What an unbelievable irony that on the very day that we have people \ndigging in the heels of their cowboy boots and saying we are making our \nlast stand to prevent the unemployed from getting unemployment \ncompensation they deserve--on the very day that they say we can't do \nthat--they come to the floor of the Senate saying: But what we have to \ndo as a priority is to relieve the richest Americans, the wealthiest \nAmericans, of the obligation to pay estate tax. If there is any \nnarrative that tells the American people whose side they are on, this \nlittle vignette describes it completely, in my judgment.\n  Let me mention that the reason it is important to understand how we \ngot to this point is, we will never get out of it unless we understand \nthat. A lot of my colleagues have been perfectly content for most of \nthe decade standing on this floor deciding that we will ship men and \nwomen to Iraq and Afghanistan to fight, but we will not pay for \nthe cost of a penny of it. They have been perfectly content to do that. \nI have come to the floor of the Senate to say: You know what, sacrifice \nworks a number of ways in this country. If we are going to ask young \nmen and women to sacrifice their lives, to go 12,000 miles away and \nstrap on body armor in the morning and risk their lives by going in \nharm's way, perhaps we could ask the American people to provide the \nmoney to pay for it.\n\n  I have proposed that in the Senate. President Bush, at one point, \nsaid: You all do that, and I will veto the bill. My colleagues were \ncontent to say: Let's spend the money and put it all on the deficit. We \nwill send kids to war and they can come back and pay the bill. That is \nhow we got here. The second portion of how we got here is about 10 \nyears ago we passed what was then called financial reform. I voted \nagainst that as well. That said to the biggest financial institutions \nin this country: Katy bar the door. Do whatever you want. We will not \nwatch. We are taking away the protections that existed since the Great \nDepression. We will not look and we will not care.\n  As a result, we saw in recent years unbelievable speculation and \ngambling. It was not business, it was just flatout gambling. We saw the \ncreation of exotic instruments--CDOs, derivatives, credit default \nswaps, naked credit default swaps, and the like--and we saw \nunbelievable, rampant gaming going on as opposed to thoughtful \ninvesting in this country's future. As a result, this country nearly \nhad an economic collapse.\n  It is important for us to understand how that happened because we had \nregulators come to town who were supposed to regulate, and they boasted \nabout being business friendly: Don't worry, we will not look. There is \na new sheriff in town and this sheriff doesn't have a weapon. So don't \nworry about it. Then we saw a decade go by in which this country's \neconomy nearly collapsed. So that is how we got where we are. It is \nimportant for people to understand that.\n  They say: Let's not review the past, but let me review one final \npoint. When President Obama walked through the White House door, had he \ngone to sleep for 12 months, had he done nothing at all, he would have \nhad a $1.3 trillion budget deficit because that is what the previous \nPresident left him--$1.3 trillion on autopilot.\n  Having said all that, let me say this. This deficit, in my judgment, \nis unsustainable. It cannot continue. We have to diffuse it. This is a \ntimebomb that will destroy this country's economy inevitably at some \npoint. We can't have a government the size and cost of which is such \nthat the American people are either unable or unwilling to pay for it. \nYou can't do that. So we have to fix it, and we have to fix it \ntogether. But if we don't learn from what happened, if we don't \nunderstand the past decade of what happened--going from a $200 billion-\na-year budget surplus to the largest deficits in history and to a near \neconomic collapse--we are destined to repeat it.\n  Again, it seems to me that everybody here are people of good faith. I \ndon't come here suggesting that there are people of bad faith here, but \nthere are some people with bad judgment here, for sure. All you have to \ndo is look at the record. Those who say: Let's don't look at the \nrecord, I guess they do not want the record to be understood. I think \nthe only way we get out of this unbelievable deficit and debt trap is \nto understand what has caused it. I will tell you this for sure. We are \nnot going to get out of this mess by having people come to the floor of \nthe Senate and say that one of the biggest problems in the country is \nthe death tax, when no such tax exists. What an unbelievable spoof. \nDeath tax my eye. We have a tax on inherited wealth and the only people \nwho have been paying it are the people at the upper income levels.\n  We have had a $3\\1/2\\ million-a-year exemption for the husband, and a \n$3\\1/2\\ million exemption for the wife. That was last year's exemption. \nThat means you don't pay a penny unless you have $7 million clear, \nhusband and wife. How many families have that? But that is not enough, \nmy colleagues say. In the middle of all this economic trouble we face, \nin the middle of wars and a near economic collapse, what is their \npriority? Get rid of the so-called death tax, which doesn't exist, or \nperhaps I can rephrase it for them: Get rid of the tax on inherited \nwealth for the wealthiest of Americans.\n  These are billionaires' best friends, I guess. I have nothing against \nbillionaires. I guess I wish I was one. But when billionaires die, \nthey, I think, ought to expect to be able to contribute something to \nthis country. It is unbelievable to me. I hope people have listened to \nthis discussion today and understand that their priority is to \neliminate the estate tax, the tax on inherited wealth, which would only \napply to the wealthiest Americans. It is unbelievable to me.\n  I have seen other unbelievable things, some of which have led to this \ncurrent economic trouble. I hope perhaps in calmer times and perhaps \nmore sober times we can discuss the best of what both parties have to \noffer this country because I think both parties do make a contribution.\n  We cannot wait much longer. This is not something we can delay, it is \nnot something we can decide to postpone. This country is in trouble. We \nhave a deep Federal budget deficit. It comes from the steepest decline \nin the economy since the 1930s. As a result of that decline, we have \nvictims at the bottom of this economic ladder who have not had work, in \nsome cases for 2 years. They wake up in the morning feeling helpless \nand hopeless, wondering, How on Earth can I find a job? What do I tell \nmy family today?\n  This Congress, in my judgment, ought to at least pay as much \nattention to those folks at the bottom of the economic ladder as it has \npaid in the last 2 years to the interests at the top of the economic \nladder. We shoveled hundreds of billions of dollars toward those at the \ntop--the most comfortable pillows to make them rest, the medicine to \ncalm their nerves. But when it comes to the people at the bottom, Will \nRogers had it best. Here is what Will Rogers said 80 years ago and it \napplies today in this Chamber. Will Rogers said: ``The unemployed here \nain't eating regular but we'll get around to\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\nthem as soon as everybody else gets fixed up OK.''\n  Let me say this. A whole lot of other folks got fixed up at the top \nof the economic ladder, at the top of this country's economy. A whole \nlot of folks got fixed up and it is the case that the unemployed here \n``ain't eating regular,'' and this Congress, this Senate ought to care \nabout that. It is part of our responsibility. Then let's get about the \nbusiness of having a real debate, a thoughtful rather than thoughtless \ndebate about all of the issues that affect us, such as spending and \ntaxing, and let's use real terms, not things like ``death taxes'' that \ncome from a pollster who decides they want to fool people. Let's use \nreal terms in serious discussions between adults and try to figure out \nhow we fix what is wrong with this country to put this country back on \ntrack.\n  This country deserves better. It is the first generation of \nAmericans, I think, that believes its kids are not going to do as well \nas they did. We have to change that. This country has a lot to offer \nwith a good future if we make some good decisions going forward.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for weeks we have sought to continue \nextended emergency unemployment benefits. We must do this because, \nwhile our economic recovery has begun, it has a long way to go. Our \neconomy is not yet generating enough jobs to put people back to work \nwho are searching for work. The repercussions of the worst financial \ncrisis in generations are still felt across our country.\n  And so to help Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own, we have sought to continue these extended unemployment \nbenefits. We have met opposition and delay. Yesterday, we finally broke \nthrough the Republican filibuster that was the source of that delay.\n  Now we have a chance to do what we should have done weeks ago. In \nState after State, thousands of people await our decision, including \nmore than 70,000 in my State. We cannot give them back the weeks of \nanxiety our delays have caused. But we can act today. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure and give struggling American \nfamilies the help they need and deserve.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, this year is the first time in many \ndecades that death in America is not a taxable event. For the first \ntime in many, many years, folks who worked hard and built businesses, \nbuilt farms, do not lose what they have worked for when they die.\n  The Heritage Foundation estimates that if we do nothing as a Senate \nand allow the death tax to go from zero to 55 percent, America will \nlose 1.5 million jobs because when we take the money and the property \nof the people who are working and running businesses and farms, it not \nonly affects the families of those who die but those who work for those \nbusinesses and work on those farms.\n  It is immoral for us to take what people work for throughout their \nlives. Their property, their income has all been taxed at least once \nbefore. Let's do the right thing and vote for this amendment today. \nLet's keep the death tax at zero. This is not a tax cut; it is just \nleaving the tax rate the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this is an absurd amendment. This \namendment would provide $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top three-\ntenths of 1 percent, and 99.7 percent of the American people do not get \na nickel. Despite all the rhetoric we hear around here about fiscal \nresponsibility, this isn't paid for. It is another $1 trillion over 10 \nyears to our national debt.\n  I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to thank our colleague from South \nCarolina for giving us the opportunity tonight to decide whose side we \nare really on. We are talking about upward of $1 trillion in spending \nto help a few hundred of our wealthiest Americans. We would not be \nhelping small businesses or family farmers, all of whom we support \nhelping, but the wealthiest Americans--close to $1 trillion--or helping \n2.5 million people who lost their jobs, are out of work through no \nfault of their own.\n  The crash on Wall Street, the crisis on Wall Street, which, \nunfortunately, colleagues chose not to vote to repair and to fix, has \ncaused a situation where families are hurting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

I am just to speak for 1 minute now and turn it over to \nthe good Senator from Oregon, who will speak for a few minutes on this \nsubject, and then the Senator from Washington State, as we wait for the \nunderlying paperwork that is going to support this effort to appear. We \nthought we would not let this time be wasted.\n  We have just finished a very important vote on unemployment \ncompensation that is going to extend benefits for 15 million Americans \nwho are out of work. It was a very tough negotiation, but we got it \ndone. Now we move on to another very important issue, to try to help \nbuild our way, find our way, out of this very difficult economic time \nin our country.\n  The Democratic leadership, occasionally with a few Members from the \nother party, have passed some very tough but important votes to make \nthat happen under President Obama's\n\n[[Page S6068]]\n\nleadership. We are going to continue to do that tonight and through the \nnext couple days and in the next 2 weeks, until we take a short break, \nand then come back, of course, in September to continue our work.\n  One of the bills we are going to move to right now is the small \nbusiness lending bill, a jobs bill, the jobs bill focused on small \nbusiness, because as all of us on this side--and I think some on the \nother side--recognize, this recession is going to end as quickly or as \nsoon as we can deliver significant help in terms of capital, access to \ncapital, reduction in regulations, and reduction in taxes to small \nbusiness.\n  It is not that complicated. The jobs that are going to be created in \nAmerica are not going to be created by the large corporations. In fact, \nthere have been several front-page articles in the Washington Post, the \nNew York Times, the Times-Picayune, my hometown paper, saying that \nactually the big corporations are making profits, they are hoarding \ncash, they are waiting because there is uncertainty out there on any \nnumber of fronts.\n  We cannot solve that entire uncertainty in the next few weeks or even \nmaybe in the next few months, but we can lay down building blocks that \nwill start increasing demand, giving access to capital to small \nbusiness. Hiring will begin, and then the way forward will be more \nclear. So that is basically what this small business package does. It \nhas three main components. I am not going to go into any detail because \nthe Senator is here to speak. But one component came out of the Finance \nCommittee with very broad bipartisan support. It is a tax-cut package \nfor small business, about $12 billion--quite significant. Senators \nBaucus and Grassley and others worked on that package, and we will \ndiscuss that at some future time.\n  The other piece came out of the Small Business Committee. There are \nprobably eight or nine major items that came out with good bipartisan \nsupport that will help to expand and strengthen the SBA programs, which \nis one of the pieces, one of the essential pieces of this bill.\n  There are three very important pieces. The tax cuts of $12 billion \nfor small business--not for big business, not for Wall Street but for \nMain Street businesses, $12 billion of tax cuts. There is a very strong \nbipartisan provision for small business. But there is one piece in the \namendment that we will offer in a minute. It is going to be a LeMieux, \nLandrieu, Merkley, Boxer, Cantwell, and Klobuchar amendment we will \noffer in few minutes.\n  This is going to add a lending piece to this bill for small business. \nIt is a small business access-to-capital piece. It is not for banks, it \nis for small business. I would like to now turn it over to Senator \nMerkley, who has been one of the lead designers and advocates and \nchampions. He has been extraordinary. He has held any number of \ntownhall meetings in his State. The people of Oregon should be \nextremely grateful for his tenacity on this, to stand up to many \ndoubters here--or some doubters--to fight for this program.\n  We intend to fight for it because it is for small businesses, and \nthey are desperate. We have spent about a year and a half up here \ntalking about big business, international business, international tax \ncode, bailing out Wall Street.\n  Well, these three Senators on the floor tonight will start the \ndiscussion about helping small businesses on Main Street. If we do not \ndo this, and if this is not in the package, it is going to be a gaping \nhole that will exist in this package. I believe we can get this \nincluded in this package and that this will secure a great legacy for \nthis Congress, to turn our attention to getting capital to businesses. \nTwenty-seven million small businesses are out there saying: Does anyone \nknow that we are out here?\n  Well, I want you to know that Senator LeMieux from Florida, Senator \nLandrieu from Louisiana, Senator Merkley from Oregon, Senator Cantwell, \nand I believe more than 60 Members of this Senate hear you, and we are \ngoing to fight now, over the course of the next couple days, to see if \nwe can deliver for you $30 billion access to capital, which could, \nbecause it leverages itself 1 to 10, turn into about $300 billion for \nsmall business in America.\n  They deserve it. They are the ones that are suffering. These are the \npeople who are losing 20 years of work, 10 years of work, not the fat \ncats, not the big business, not the Wall Street banks that are racking \nup profits out of the ceiling because we have fallen all over ourselves \nto stabilize Wall Street.\n  Well, we are about ready to put down a big fight for Main Street. You \nare either going to be for Main Street or you are against Main Street. \nWe are going to see who is going to stand and be counted. This Senator \nis standing. I would like to ask him now to add his voice to this \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, thank you, and thank you to the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and your clarion call to go into battle, to fight for \nsmall businesses in our Nation.\n  We all know small businesses are the job-creating factories in \nAmerica and that if we do not go to battle for our small businesses, \nthat, indeed, we will be in this recession for a very long time, which \nwill be certainly bad for our small businesses, it will be bad for all \nthe citizens who would be employed by those businesses, and will \ncertainly be bad for all those trapped in the deep, long recession. So \nI thank the Senator for her leadership.\n  Also, I would like to thank very much Senator Cantwell for her \noutspoken advocacy on behalf of small businesses and on behalf of this \neffort to provide liquidity; to my colleague from California, Senator \nBoxer, who got involved very early as a partner in creating a plan to \nhelp address this fundamental challenge.\n  That challenge is the small businesses are having their credit lines \ncut and they are going to their community banks and their community \nbanks are observing that, unfortunately, they are at the leverage \nmaximum allowed under the rules so they cannot do additional lending.\n  So here we have banks that would like to lend. We have small \nbusinesses that would like to borrow and be able to put more people to \nwork, to seize opportunities in our economy. But they cannot do it \nbecause we have this malfunction. This malfunction is the \ncapitalization of community banks that enables them to lend more.\n\n  So this provision addresses that malfunction. It provides a mechanism \nto recapitalize community banks that are healthy. That then enables \nthem, under the existing leverage requirements, to provide additional \nlending to small businesses across America.\n  Well, this wins on every level. First, it makes money for the \ntaxpayer. CBO estimates it will bring in $1 billion of revenue, and \nthat is not including the additional revenue from personal income taxes \non the folks who get jobs because small businesses put people to work. \nIt does not include the additional revenue from the small businesses \nthemselves and their share of taxation.\n  So thriving individuals with jobs and thriving small businesses will \ncreate additional feedback to our Treasury, helping us to attack the \ndeficit, in addition to the billion dollars that CBO estimates.\n  A couple questions have been raised about this strategy. One question \nthat has been raised is: Well, will not community banks possibly take \nthe additional capitalization and then sit on the funds? Indeed, that \nis a concern that has been addressed in the design of the program. The \nprogram says community banks will pay a dividend back to the Treasury \nof 1 percent if they provide the full leverage of lending to small \nbusinesses and 7 percent if they do not and somewhere in between if \nthey are in between.\n  So you have a 7-to-1 provision. That is a huge incentive for the \ncommunity banks to follow through and seize the lending opportunities, \nnot sit by and wait for a sunnier day, if you will.\n  A second question has been: Well, is it possible that banks in this \nsituation will make loans that they should not make? The answer there \nis no as well because the bank's profit is on the line. These are not \nguaranteed loans. If these loans fail, the banks would suffer. So this \nutilizes our community banks' wisdom and knowledge about what merits \nadditional capital and what does not.\n\n[[Page S6069]]\n\n  This is why this public-private partnership is powerful. It is \npowerful because it uses the expertise of the community banks, powerful \nbecause it puts people to work in small business, powerful because it \nallocates capital to the places where the small business entrepreneurs \nand the banks see that there is an opportunity to grow the business and \nto grow this economy.\n  A third concern has been that these funds might go to community banks \nthat are in trouble. To address that issue, this program requires for \nthe community banks to be healthy, as rated under a rating called the \nCAMELS rating.\n  Each letter in the term ``CAMELS'' stands for a component of the \nanalysis of the health of the community banks--C for capital, for \nexample; M for management; L for liquidity, and so forth. Healthy banks \nget the opportunity to increase their leverage and assist small \nbusinesses so they can thrive and put people to work. And we as a \nnation can find a path out of this deep dark recession.\n  I will wrap up my comments there and say this is the sort of \ncommonsense effort to address a key chokepoint in the economy that we \nare expected to address by the citizens. It is right for the taxpayer. \nIt is right in terms of alleviating the deficit. It is right for \nputting people to work. It is right for Main Street America. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in getting this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Washington \nState.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the chair of the Small Business \nCommittee, Senator Landrieu, does such a fabulous job standing up for \nsmall business. She is making sure in this battle that someone is \nstanding up for individual business owners all across America who have \nhad a horrible time getting access to capital. I thank her for her \nleadership, for making sure the voice of Americans, who have been \ntalking to their Senators for months and months and months about the \nproblem with access to capital, are heard.\n  I thank Senators Merkley and Boxer for originally sponsoring this \nlegislation and this amendment to improve access to capital for small \nbusinesses. They both have been listening to their constituents in \nCalifornia and Oregon and know how critically important it is to pass \nthis legislation.\n  I ask my colleagues who haven't made up their minds about this \nproposal to check with their offices in their States to find out if \nthey have heard from small businesses expressing their frustration \nabout the lack of access to capital. If they actually listen to what \npeople are saying in their States, they will find story after story of \npeople who are frustrated, angry, and questioning how it is that Wall \nStreet could get a bailout that was without any specifics about when \nthe Treasury was going to get paid back, yet Main Street is being \ndenied access to capital right and left.\n  I know my colleague has traveled his State. I know the chairman of \nthe committee has traveled her State. I know my colleague from \nCalifornia has been all over her State. We have heard about more and \nmore companies. I had a Washington company in Vancouver that basically, \nwhen the Bank of Clark County was taken over by the FDIC--and even \nthough the bank that took them over was getting TARP funds, this \nbusiness had its performing lines of credit cut right out from under \nthem. That just happened overnight. Another business in the same area \nimmediately had their line of credit cut. Another company, Vancouver \nIron and Steel, had never missed a payment on its loans, but it lost \nits line of credit. Another high-tech company that had international \ncontracts was doing everything. Their line of credit was pulled right \nout from under them. They are still having challenges. Another company \nin Richland, WA, that was a biofuels company and had fuel cell \ntechnology had their lines of credit reduced. This made them stop \ntaking advantage of increasing their payroll and their access and the \ndemand for new alternative energy technology. I had another small \nbusiness in the Spokane Valley that had been wanting to hire additional \nstaff and to get a new business location so she could improve things. \nObviously, she had an existing business. She was not given access to \ncredit. Another enterprise back in the Tri-Cities was forced to \nwithdraw their funding, and a project is on hold until they get another \nline of credit.\n  These are all businesses that are operating, that had relationships \nwith their banks, had performing lines of credit, and have had that \ncredit cut right out from under them.\n  I ask my colleagues, when are we going to stand up for small \nbusinesses that have had trouble getting access to capital, that have \nbeen penalized? I don't think any of these community banks about which \nwe have been talking were doing derivatives. I don't think they were \ndoing the incredible types of activity that got us and our economy into \nthis mess. What they want to know is, if they didn't cause this mess, \nhow is it that when it came to the big banks, everybody said: Yes, here \nis the opportunity for you; here are the keys to the Treasury; here is \nall the money, but now, when it comes to making sure community banks \nare loaning to small businesses, people are saying: No, Main Street \ndoesn't have the same priority as Wall Street.\n  I hope America is listening tonight. I have never asked, but I hope \nAmericans will call their Senators tomorrow and make them understand \nthat they have been put in a precarious position. They have struggled \nthrough this economic crisis without access to capital, without help \nand support, without the bailout Wall Street was given. They want to \nknow, are their Senators going to stand up for them and help them with \na program, as my colleague from Oregon said, that basically is paid for \nand is budget neutral. In fact, the terms of these agreements will \ngenerate $1.1 billion and help us reduce the deficit. Small business is \nasking for an effective lending program through the community banks. \nThat is all they are asking for. We gave Wall Street a bailout without \nany terms and conditions on repayment. Main Street wants to know if \ntheir Senators are going to stand up for them and get an access to \ncapital program small businesses can take advantage of.\n  The chairman knows these numbers well, but 75 percent of new job \ngrowth in America comes from small businesses. But they are not going \nto be able to grow and expand and innovate if they don't have access to \ncapital. Right now, they are not getting access to capital because of \nthe new requirements that were put on after this financial crisis that \nthey were asked to adhere to. We didn't ask Wall Street to adhere to \nthat; we basically said: Here is your bailout.\n  Please, call your Senators. Make sure they hear your individual story \nabout your business, how you didn't get access to capital, why it is \nimportant to get this program. If Americans call their Senators and \ndiscuss this program with them, we will get the votes we need to secure \nthis legislation and empower Americans who are really going to restore \nthe economy.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Senator is aware that all 59 \nDemocrats support Main Street, and we have been joined by the Senator \nfrom Florida, Mr. LeMieux. This is the LeMieux-Landrieu-Merkley-\nCantwell-Boxer amendment. We will be joined by others. Would the \nSenator say again how we are going to explain that we did send billions \nto Wall Street with virtually no terms whatsoever, and now we have an \nopportunity to send money to small businesses on Main Street and we \ncan't get a supermajority of Senators to do so? How are we going to \nexplain this?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I am sure some people will give us the details about \nwhat they believe the terms of the deal for Wall Street were. But it is \nsafe to say there was no specific date that Wall Street had to pay back \nthe money. No one ever asked them if they would be viable with or \nwithout the money. They were--in the blink of an eye, in some cases--\ngiven access to Treasury funds.\n  This is a program that has been done in a transparent process, with \nthe input of lots of Members, input from both bodies, discussed by the \nTreasury Secretary in many public forums. It was in the President's \nState of the Union Address as a priority to get access to capital, the \nrequirements and specificity of banks that want to apply. This isn't \npicking winners and losers\n\n[[Page S6070]]\n\nsuch as what was done in the haste of October, 2 years ago. This is \nabout a bill that is an open process for banks that want to \nparticipate. These are the terms the Federal Government is setting up \nfor participation, a very open and transparent process. The main \ndifference is one was a bailout, and this is a lending program. I want \nto know why my colleagues don't support it, if they don't, because I \nthink America supports making sure there is access to capital. They \nwant to know why is it that the CEO of an AIG or another company can \nget access to all the capital they need from the Federal Government, \nbut when it comes to a small business, they can't go to their community \nbanks and get access to capital at this critical moment.\n  I hope we can resolve this issue and move forward. I hope Americans \nwill call and speak up about this. Maybe there are some States that \nhave not been rocked as hard. Maybe there are States that were not in \nthe same situation as some of the ones we have heard from tonight. But \nit is safe to say that Americans have been squeezed by what has \nhappened by this implosion of the economy. They know that their \ningenuity can help restore the economy, that they need access to \ncapital.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  We are joined now by the Senator from Rhode Island, who has been \nanother champion for small business. He knows, as we all do, that small \nbusinesses are the engines that are going to lead us out of this \nrecession. I am sure he has some information to share with us about his \nsmall businesses in Rhode Island. They must be absolutely flabbergasted \nthat we are even having this debate because, as the Senator knows, \nthere wasn't really this much debate when we sent billions to Wall \nStreet with virtually no strings attached. Now we actually have to \nfight hard--we are going to have to do this for a couple days--to try \nto get some capital to small businesses in all of our States. This \nisn't a bank program. It is a small business program. It is a small \nbusiness program for Main Street, the companies that have had their \ncredit card rates raised, the companies that have had their lines of \ncredit cancelled without notice.\n  Could the Senator from Rhode Island give us any more information as \nto what he is hearing in his State and why he thinks there are some \nRepublican leaders who are adamantly opposed to this? It is mind-\nboggling to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Landrieu and also \nSenators Merkley and Cantwell, who spoke before me, for the \nextraordinarily hard work they have put in to bring us to this moment. \nThis is the culmination of a lot of hard work against what was for a \nlong time unanimous Republican opposition. We couldn't get this done \nbecause we couldn't get one vote from a single Republican to help small \nbusiness through our community banks. Thankfully, Senator LeMieux has \nbroken the ice. Now we are in a position to go forward. There may well \nstill be significant parliamentary maneuvers by the other side to slow \nit down and delay it rather than have it go smoothly, as it should.\n  The situation in Rhode Island is pretty dire. We are a small business \nState, and we have more than 12 percent unemployment. The situation in \nwhich that takes place is the one my colleagues have described.\n  The big banks are hoarding cash. They have been given access to the \nTreasury, and they are borrowing money at extremely favorable rates, \nbut it is not filtering out. It is being invested for their own \naccount, building up their balance sheets, not getting through to \nbusinesses, particularly not to small businesses. The big corporations \nare hoarding cash. That is putting pressure on employment and on small \nbusiness. So for a small business, even if you are profitable, even if \nyour loans to your bank have consistently been performing, the \ntightening up of credit on the community banks has restricted the funds \nthat are available to even solidly performing small businesses that \nwish to invest and hire.\n\n  The solution for this is a wonderful one that Senator Landrieu, \nSenator Merkley, and Senator Cantwell recommended, and that is to turn \nto our local community banks that were not a part of the Wall Street \nproblem and know where the good businesses are. They have existing \nrelationships with them. They would love in many cases to loan to them. \nThey just don't have the capital. So this provision would bring \ntogether the capital available from the Federal Government and the \nexpertise of the local community banks to meet the urgent need of \nAmerica's small businesses. The market for capital has tightened so \nmuch that this kind of a mechanism makes a lot of sense. The government \nloans capital, and there is a fee. It is not giving it away; it is \nearning a fee, and it frees up additional capital for the banks in turn \nto loan, the local community banks, to bring their expertise to bear on \nthose businesses. So the bank then loans the capital and it gets out \nthe funds and the small businesses gather funds and from that capital \nthey are able to go out and hire and invest and help to begin to \nfurther improve the economic climate.\n  This is a good idea. It is timely. I hope as we go forward. The good \nsense that Senator LeMieux has shown and the priority he has put on \nsmall business and local community banks is able to sink in a little \nbit further. Frankly, I wish we had been able to do this some time ago, \nbut the absolutely unanimous blockade from the Republican Party has \nprevented this.\n  I will close by saying that having been a party to many of these \ndiscussions as the Senator from Louisiana has been keeping us abreast \nof her negotiations, I know what a long ordeal this has been for her. I \nknow how tenacious the Senator from Louisiana has been on this. She has \nfinally been successful in terms of delivering what is now a bipartisan \namendment, and it is a great moment. I congratulate her and I look \nforward to working with her toward success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  I wish to continue to speak as is required, not seeing anyone else on \nthe floor. I appreciate the opportunity while we are waiting.\n  I love the analogy the Senator from Rhode Island mentioned about the \nblockade. We have breached the blockade. For the last 8 months there \nhas been an inexplicable silence on the other side of this aisle as to \nwhy we cannot lend money to small businesses in America through the \nprivate sector. This is not a direct Federal lending program. This is \nnot bloating the Federal budget. I hear from the other side every \nsingle day: Private sector solutions; reduce the deficit. May I say \nagain to them now on the floor of the Senate that I have tried so hard \nover the last 8 months to explain this to them individually, and only \none--only one so far--Republican Senator has heard the cries of his \nsmall business. Only one.\n  This is not a government program for banks. It is a public-private \npartnership lending strategy for small business. Have they not noticed \nthat small businesses have closed their doors? Have they not noticed \npeople in long unemployment lines that weren't just workers, they were \nbusiness owners? Are they not listening? I am the chair of the Small \nBusiness Committee. I guess that is why I feel so protective of the \ncommunity. It is not because I am such a great Senator; it is because I \nam a protective person, I guess. Some of my colleagues say it is \nbecause I am the oldest of nine children and I grew up protecting my \neight little brothers and sisters. My dad laughs when I say this, but \nit is the truth.\n  I feel as though I have 27 million small businesses out there that \nhave been a steady stream into my office since I became chair, begging \nwith me, pleading with me, saying: Senator, does anyone know we are out \nhere trying our best? You keep bailing out the big banks. You keep \ngiving money to big corporations. Does anyone--anyone in Congress--hear \nus? I keep assuring them: Yes, people do hear you. We know how \ndifficult it is. So I said: This isn't going to be a problem, ``Ms. \nNaive'' that I must be. This isn't going to be a problem. I am sure we \ncan do this.\n  So I start talking to my colleagues and, sure enough, Senator Merkley \nand Senator Boxer had a beginning of an idea that had some problems \nwith their general ideas, so we removed\n\n[[Page S6071]]\n\nthose problems. We kept fashioning it. It kept getting better and \nbetter. The President then started talking about it. The Secretary of \nthe Treasury started getting excited about it. We started lining up \nhundreds of endorsements from the independent banks, the community \nbanks; almost every small business association in America. I am so \nexcited I am thinking: You know, this is going to work. Then we get the \nscore back from CBO and it doesn't cost anything. It makes $1 billion. \nIt earns $1 billion. I am thinking: This is great. Our Republican \ncolleagues can't possibly be against something that is a public-private \npartnership. It is not direct lending by the Federal Government. It is \nnot creating a new bureaucracy. It is using the healthy community banks \non Main Street that know our constituents, they know their customers, \nthey know the businesses. They know the businesses. They want to help \nthem, but they have restrictions on their capital. So this program \nallows them--voluntary, it is not mandatory; there are no onerous \nrestrictions. You don't have to cap your salaries. You just have to be \nable to make good loans, and if you do, you will be rewarded by getting \nmoney at a cheaper rate than you normally would, so the community bank \nmakes a little money. The small business gets the loans. We create \njobs. People get employed. The recession starts ending. This is too \ngood to be true. I guess it is, because lo and behold, I start hearing \nthat the Republican leadership is opposed to this idea. I am still not \nbelieving what I am hearing.\n  I start going to each and every one and, sure enough, that seems to \nbe the case. It is a shame. I can't even explain it or understand it. \nIt has nothing to do with TARP money. It is not a TARP program. It is \nnot a bank program. It doesn't have anything to do with banks except \nthat we are working in partnership with banks to lend money to small \nbusinesses which are desperate for money.\n  I want to put up the chart to make it very clear. When the leadership \nover there comes and talks to me about banks not being supportive, they \nbetter come armed with some interesting data, because I have on the \nrecord the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, Neil Milner, president \nand CEO. There are not that many national bank organizations. There are \nonly a few, and all of them are here. So for the other side to come to \nthe floor and say there are some bank organizations that are not for \nthis, they better be specific. It may be the big banks. I guess the big \nbanks aren't for it. They can't even qualify for it. If the American \nBankers Association is not for it, I understand that. They can't \nqualify for this. This isn't for them. They already got their money.\n\n  This is for the small banks. The only way you can even be in this \nprogram is if you have less than $10 billion. This is for the small \nbanks. So if someone comes to this floor anytime in the next couple of \ndays to debate this and they say: Oh, but the ABA isn't for this, I \nguess they wouldn't be. They are not involved in it. It is not even for \nthem. Maybe the big banks are afraid of the competition from their \ncommunity banks; I don't know. But there are 7,500 community banks out \nthere and somebody should stand up for them. I know their PACs aren't \nas big. I know they don't give as many contributions. They don't have \nas much money as the big banks do. But they are in our neighborhoods, \nthey are in our communities, and they know the small businesses. If we \ngive them a little bit of help, a partnership, we could get some money \nto the small businesses of America.\n  So we have here Neil Milner, president of the Conference of State \nBank Supervisors; they are strongly for it; the National Small Business \nAssociation. This isn't a bank but a strong small business association; \nJohn Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of the Small Business Majority; \nIndependent Community Bankers of America and 28 State community bank \nassociations. We are working on the others. I don't know why we don't \nhave all 50, but we are working on it. Maybe there are a few community \nbank associations that are opposed to it. They have not shown \nthemselves. Maybe they will. But we have 28 community bank associations \nfor it, and the Independent Community Bankers. We have the National \nBankers Association. They say:\n\n       The Obama administration--continuing its efforts to lift \n     the country out of a two-year recession--has hit a home run \n     with its proposed $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund. \n     This is not a bailout to small business and medium-sized \n     banks; it is, instead, a true investment in a brighter future \n     for America's working class.\n\n  It must be too good to be true, that we would actually pass an \namendment that would be an investment in Main Street, an investment in \nAmerica's working class. These people are working so hard right now at \nso many jobs to keep the roof over their heads, they don't have time to \nform PACs or give many contributions. I guess that is why we can't get \nsome people to stand up and listen, but we better listen to them \nbecause they are all going to be voting in the next election. They \nmight not have time to get organized to come to Washington and tell us \nabout their woes, but they can walk right on down to the polls, and I \nhope they will remember this debate when they do. Every single Democrat \nis going to vote for this--every single one on our side--and we are \ngoing to have one Republican so far, and I hope we can get another one \nor two or three. Maybe we will be surprised and get a half dozen.\n  There are also hundreds of organizations that are supporting this, \nand I am going to read the ones I have. The American Apparel and \nFootwear Association; the American Bankers Association. Let me correct \nmyself. They are for it. So for anybody who says they are not, they are \nfor it. Arkansas Community Bankers, Associated Building Contractors, \nCalifornia Independent Bankers, Community Bankers Association of \nAlabama, Community Bankers Association of Georgia, Community Bankers \nAssociation of Illinois, Community Bankers Association of Kansas, \nCommunity Bankers Association of Ohio, Community Bankers of Iowa, of \nWashington State, of West Virginia, of Wisconsin, Fashion Accessories \nShippers Association, Financial Services Roundtable, Florida Bankers.\n  I wish to thank the Florida bankers. They were very passionate in \ntheir advocacy, and both of their Senators are supporting this bill. I \nam extremely proud of Senator LeMieux and Senator Nelson who have stood \nup. They have listened to what their Florida bankers and Florida small \nbusiness people are saying. They have been a State that has been most \naffected, or almost as affected as almost any other--maybe more. \nFlorida has had a very difficult time. We bailed out the big banks. We \nbailed out the derivatives folks. We bailed out the swap kings and \nqueens. Go through Florida. Their little shopping centers are all \nboarded up. Their condos are empty. The little bakeries that used to \nbake the doughnuts for the people who came to the condos, they can't \nsell any doughnuts. There is nobody there to sell them to. Can we help \nthat bakery? I don't know why we can't seem to get anymore support from \nthe other side, because Senator Nelson and Senator LeMieux hear them.\n  The Governors of Michigan, Ohio, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, \nMassachusetts, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, \nWashington, West Virginia. Do you think these Governors would send us a \nletter on something such as this if they didn't need it or want it?\n  These Governors--Republicans and Democrats--are doing everything they \ncan every day to keep their small businesses. But because of the \ndeficits in their States--because of the deficits we are struggling \nwith because President Bush left us in a terrible situation--and \nDemocrats helped to get us in that situation as well, so I am not just \nblaming the other side. But when this President came in, the deficits \nwere huge. States have to balance their budgets. The occupant of the \nchair knows; he was a mayor. Mayors have to balance budgets. These \nGovernors write us and say: Please, do this lending program; it will \nhelp our small business, and we will start generating tax revenues. It \nwill help us get out of our deficit.\n  You would think the other side would respond to these Governors. \nEvidently, they have their ears closed. Independent Bankers of Texas, \nIndependent Bankers of Colorado, Independent Community Bankers of New \nMexico, Independent Community Bankers of South Dakota, Indiana Bankers \nAssociation, Louisiana Bankers Association.\n\n[[Page S6072]]\n\n  My team has been terrific at home, and we are facing a very difficult \nsituation with this moratorium. We are working very hard to modify it \nand overcome it. In addition to this, we have our own problems. But for \nheaven's sake, our bankers and small businesspeople know they need to \nget capital--right now, particularly.\n  Maryland Bankers, National Council of Textile Organizations, National \nRestaurant Association, National RV Retailers, National Small Business \nAssociation, Printing Industries of America, Small Business Majority, \nTravel Goods Association, Women Impacting Public Policy--I could go on \nand on, and I will.\n  I would like the other side, when they come back tomorrow--I know \neverybody took a dinner break, and I lost my appetite, so I stayed for \na while. I hope when they come tomorrow to debate this issue they will \nat least have the guts to hold up some associations that are opposed. I \nwould like to know who might be opposed to this, what association.\n  I said I would fight for small business as the Small Business chair, \nand this is one of the first big fights we are going to have. It \nprobably will not be the last. I don't know if we will win, but we are \ngoing to give it a good try.\n  As my colleague from Washington State said, if people are listening, \nI know they are finding it hard to trust things they hear in \nWashington. I don't blame them. It has been a tough time. I hope they \ncan trust me and those of us who have spoken tonight to say we are \ntrying hard to give them $30 billion, which we will leverage up to a \n$300 billion access to capital through their own community banks--\ncompletely voluntary on their part--at rates that are normal. It is \nlike they could actually borrow money at 6 and 7 and 8 percent instead \nof having to use their credit cards and pay 16 or 24 percent.\n  Evidently, there are people on the other side who like the idea that \nsmall businesses only have credit cards on which they pay very high \nrates. I think it is despicable. We tried to do that, and we were \nthwarted by them. We tried to get help on the small business credit \ncard side, but we were told we could not interfere with private \ncommerce. So small businesses out there are between a rock and a hard \nplace, through no fault of their own. The equity in their homes has \ndepleted substantially, so they cannot go take out a home equity loan.\n  The Republicans have made sure when they go to their credit card \ncompanies, they have to pay pretty high rates and they can't get help. \nNow when we offer them good loans at reasonable rates for their \nbusinesses through their own community banks they know, the Republican \nleadership tells us no. Maybe it is because they don't want this \nrecession to end so they can blame President Obama and the Democrats \nfor everything, and they can try to win the election. I hope that is \nnot the case because small businesses should not be a pawn in the next \nelection. We should be doing everything we can to help them.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment. Senator LeMieux and Senator Nelson \nfrom Florida have stood up, and I am hoping some of the other Senators \non that side will stand up tomorrow and the next couple of days so we \ncan get a good vote on this amendment and then pass the entire package.\n  Again, this is not a program for banks; it is a program for small \nbusinesses. It is a private sector partnership with community banks--\nsmall banks. Big banks cannot even qualify.\n  If you are a big bank in America, you can turn my speech off if you \nare listening. If you are above $10 billion, you can't be in this. It \nis only for the small banks and small business. That is all this is \nfor--a partnership of lending. It makes $1 billion over 10 years. It \nwill earn, it will generate, so the program doesn't cost anything. It \nearns $1.1 billion according to CBO score. So the taxpayers get some \nmoney at the end.\n  But that must be just too good for some people I don't know. I am \nlooking forward to the debate. I think I am the last person to speak \ntonight. I will be here early on the Senate floor tomorrow. I will be \nhere all day tomorrow. I cannot wait for someone from the other side to \ncome and give me either one organization that is opposed to this or one \ngood reason they can't vote for this amendment because we are going to \nvote on it. We are going to vote on this amendment, and it will be very \nclear that the 60 people who vote for it--and maybe 39 or 40 people who \nvote no--or maybe we will have 62 or 63 or 64--maybe we will end up \nhaving everybody. I hope so. If all the people who have said they \nsupport this provision will call and let their Senators know, maybe we \nwill have success.\n  I may not win every battle as chair of the committee. I know I \nhaven't been able to deliver for small business all the things they \nwould like. I know they need more tax cuts and they need more \nregulation relief. But I know one thing they need; they need access to \ncapital. They don't want to have to go to Wall Street and beg for it. \nThey don't want to have to pay 18 and 24 percent on their credit cards. \nThey would like to walk down the street to their friendly banker whom \nthey know and extend their line of credit.\n  Why anybody in this Chamber would vote against them doing that, I \ndon't know. But we are going to find out.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am honored to share a Vermont community's \ntribute to the stout hearts and brave souls of the service men and \nwomen serving overseas.\n  This year, in recognition of Vermont's largest military deployment \nsince World War II, the townspeople of\n\n[[Page S6074]]\n\nClarendon, VT, sought a way to show their support for Americans \nstationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the town's elementary school, 39 \nchildren of the ages of 7 to 10 recorded a song called ``Box of \nKisses'' for our troops in the National Guard. With the help of two \nlocal musicians, James Mee and Michael Mugrage, the students of \nClarendon Elementary School devoted their lunch and recess time to this \nproject. Students also spent their free time handcrafting more than 500 \npaper boxes filled with brief personal messages and pieces of candy as \ntokens of their thanks for the sacrifices being made by these \nVermonters serving abroad.\n  Although Box of Kisses is being sent to hundreds of soldiers, this \ncommunity's project is a highly personal act for many families in \nClarendon. Within this school community of only 198 students, 12 people \nhave family members serving in Afghanistan. Marcelle and I are so proud \nof and grateful for our Nation's servicemembers and their families. So \nare Vermonters in every community throughout our State, who are showing \nsupport for our soldiers' families in ways small and large every day--\nby mowing lawns, babysitting, shoveling sidewalks, and through many \nother small kindnesses. Clarendon's story is another example of why I \nam proud to be a Vermonter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the Record an \narticle, published in the Rutland Herald, in which reporter Cristina \nKumka tells this heartening story from Clarendon.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, July 14, 2010]\n\n      Love in a Box: Vermont Residents Send Kisses to Afghanistan\n\n                          (By Cristina Kumka)\n\n       All it took was one small Vermont community and one song to \n     connect troops overseas with home.\n       Shortly after Vermont's largest military deployment since \n     World War II occurred this January, residents of Clarendon \n     and students from the town's elementary school wanted to do \n     something for 10 families in their community with loved ones \n     sent off to battle in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       Children in grades 2-6, some of whom with mothers or \n     fathers serving overseas, recorded a song by Rutland musician \n     James Mee and fellow artist Michael Mugrage called ``Box of \n     Kisses'' and made 200 CDs.\n       Then they crafted boxes using simple white paper and \n     crayons and filled each one with a note and red, white and \n     blue candy donated by the Vermont Country Store.\n       The children wrote what they knew--a simple ``thank you,'' \n     ``I love you'' or other thought--to remind 500 troops \n     individually what their purpose there was and how much their \n     sacrifice meant to the children.\n       Most of the project was documented--the song posted on \n     Internet and aired on public access television and student \n     fundraisers for materials and support filmed on DVDs.\n       The CDs and the boxes are in the process of being airlifted \n     or parachuted in to troops in populated or desolate areas of \n     the Middle East until each gift is gone.\n       What began as simple gestures intended to remind troops of \n     home has caught the attention of Americans across the \n     country.\n       Mee said that in all in his 30 years in the music industry \n     no other tune or project has drawn so much attention.\n       On Tuesday, Mee said he's been contacted by a major candy \n     company looking to invest in the children's idea, a top music \n     industry professional from New York and a Texas-based radio \n     station serving a million military personnel and other \n     listeners in more than 177 countries.\n       ``I feel like I'm in a Disney movie,'' Mee said.\n       The song he originally created 10 years ago as a love \n     ballad with the lyrics, ``When you're far from home, Feeling \n     like you're all alone, Don't be afraid . . . cause you're \n     always with us, When you open up your box of kisses,'' has \n     never been so popular.\n       But the exposure is mere icing on a larger cake, Mee said.\n       ``The kids are singing their hearts out, many who skipped \n     recess and lunch, and there's something about that,'' Mee \n     said. ``No matter how skeptical and cynical you may be, kids \n     singing like that just melts your heart.''\n       Clarendon's Maria Stephan is hand-delivering one of the \n     boxes and a copy of the song to First Sgt. Francisco Herrera, \n     for his three children. Two of his children, Abigail and \n     D.J., attend Clarendon Elementary School and were key members \n     of the volunteer project.\n       The project was a way for them to keep their dad close to \n     home even when he's away.\n       Stephan, a strategic planner with the Office of the \n     Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization who directly \n     reports to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said the \n     troops need reminders of home and America needs a reminder of \n     them.\n       ``People (some troops) have a sense when they come back \n     that it's a forgotten war,'' Stephan said.\n       ``With the whole McChrystal (former Gen. Stanley \n     McChrystal) thing . . . sometimes the dangerous stuff gets \n     forgotten,'' she said. ``It's nice to know people do care.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/21/senate-section/article/S6074-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       STRONG FAMILY 50TH REUNION\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishment of a truly remarkable American family. This summer, the \nStrong family celebrates their 50th family reunion here in Washington, \nDC, the site of their first annual reunion. Although the rich history \nof the Strong family has been centered in the Mid-Atlantic States, I am \nproud that one of their daughters, Cindy Strong Woolfolk, has been a \ndedicated member of my staff, and served the people of New Hampshire \nfor more than 11 years. In recognition of Cindy and her extraordinary \nfamily, Kathy and I offer our congratulations on this momentous \noccasion.\n  In the summer of 1960, Addie Cora Strong Dixon had a vision to honor \nand remember the life and legacy of her family by convening the first \nof many annual reunions. That first year's motto, ``Strong bond of love \nand support'', which so aptly describes Addie's love for her family, \nwould also characterize the subsequent reunions held throughout the \ncountry and attended widely by members of her family. This year's motto \nfor the Golden Anniversary Reunion, ``Celebrating Generations of a \nSTRONG Legacy,'' serves as reminder to the next generations of Strong \nchildren to continue this important tradition and carry on the legacy \nof their family.\n  Throughout the years, the Strong annual reunion has become a major \nevent not only for family members, but also for various notables who \nhelped to shape our country's history including Federal, State and \nlocal politicians. One such notable, Rosa Parks, attended the 1993 \nfamily reunion in Detroit. I am also told that Addie's famous pineapple \nupside down cakes and the family's North Carolina-style BBQ are some of \nthe best in the country.\n  On behalf of Kathy and myself, we extend our congratulations to Cindy \nStrong Woolfolk and her family. For those in the U.S. Senate family who \nhave had the pleasure of getting to know Cindy and experience her \nlaughter and warm personality, you have gained a sense of how special \nthe Strong family is through her.\n  We applaud the Strong family for reaching this significant milestone \nand wish them strength and longevity for many more years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/21/senate-section/article/S6074-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6074-S6075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KIMBERLEY PROCESS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to express my concern about the \nfuture of the Kimberley Process, the global voluntary initiative to \nstem the flow of conflict diamonds. Last week, key members of the \nKimberley Process, including governments, industry representatives, and \ncivil society groups, met in St. Petersburg to break the deadlock over \nwhether Zimbabwe should be certified to export its diamonds. A year \nago, a review mission of the Kimberley Process traveled to Zimbabwe and \ndocumented extensive smuggling of diamonds and abuses against civilians \nby police and army forces at diamond sites. This rightly led to \nZimbabwe's suspension from the process. However, Zimbabwe has \nthreatened to continue with its exports regardless, and there has been \na push by some Kimberley Process members to reinstate its \ncertification.\n  Last week's meeting resulted in an agreement allowing Zimbabwe to \nexport a limited number of diamonds on the condition that a new \nKimberley Process Review Mission is permitted to return to the country \nand monitor conditions. This may be a workable agreement on paper, but \nit can only succeed with the good faith efforts of all parties, not \nleast the Government of Zimbabwe. I am disappointed that members of the \nKimberley Process did not take a stronger stand against certifying \nZimbabwe's diamonds for export. Without proof that the government in \nquestion has changed the conditions that resulted in suspension, \ngranting certification may be undermining the core components of the \nprocess. The onus should be on a government to prove such change has \noccurred before it is reinstated, not after. Now if this agreement is \nnot implemented, I worry\n\n[[Page S6075]]\n\nthat it will be a significant blow to the credibility of the process.\n  Zimbabwe is not the only country raising issues that threaten the \ncredibility of the Kimberley Process. Last month, the Wall Street \nJournal reported that there continue to be abuses and killings by \nsoldiers and private security guards in Angola around diamond mines. \nAngola is reportedly the world's fifth-largest diamond producer in \nterms of overall value. Meanwhile, the United Nations Expert Group on \nCote D'Ivoire has reported for years on how groups in northern Cote \nD'Ivoire continue to extract and smuggle diamonds through neighboring \ncountries in violation of UN sanctions. Diamond smuggling is also \nreportedly rampant in Venezuela, while the government there continues \nto evade the Kimberley Process. Across these countries and many others, \nweak government controls and limited enforcement options are enabling \nillicit diamonds to continue to enter the legitimate trade.\n  The inability of the Kimberley Process to effectively address these \nproblems has exposed significant loopholes within the process. To begin \nwith, the Kimberley Process defines ``conflict diamonds'' as ``rough \ndiamonds used by rebel movements or their allies to finance conflict \naimed at undermining legitimate governments.'' While this definition \nmay have made sense in light of the civil wars in countries such as \nSierra Leone and Liberia, it does not capture abuses and violence \nperpetrated today by government forces in diamond-producing areas \naround the world. In addition, the process lacks a clear, agreed-upon \napproach for dealing with cases of noncompliance like Venezuela or \nZimbabwe. As we move into the 10th year of Kimberley's existence, we \nneed to take a serious look at how we can best ensure the certification \nscheme has real power to investigate, monitor, and curb the illegal \nflow of diamonds, including ensuring serious consequences when a \ncountry does not live up to its commitments.\n  Since its inception, I have strongly supported the Kimberley Process \nas a vehicle to stop the trade in conflict diamonds and protect \nconsumers and legitimate diamond producers from unwittingly \nparticipating in abuses. And the Kimberley Process has achieved a great \ndeal in this respect, despite being a voluntary process and thereby \nhaving obvious limitations. But now I strongly believe we need to see \nthe Kimberley Process recommit to its human rights agenda at the same \ntime that it deals with the technical and procedural challenges that \nhamper its effectiveness. We still have a long way to go in curbing the \nflow of conflict diamonds and ensuring they do not make their way into \nour markets.\n  For these reasons, I believe we must look seriously at the \neffectiveness of the Kimberley Process and consider revamping its \nframework so it has real teeth. Doing so will require strong \nleadership, and I believe the United States as the world's largest \nconsumer of diamonds and a key player in the creation of the process is \nwell positioned to provide that leadership. Senator Leahy and I have \nurged the Obama administration to put the United States forward to be \nvice-chair of the Kimberley Process for 2011 and thus chair in 2012. It \nis in our national interest to have a strong Kimberley Process, and it \nis a critical moment for the United States to exhibit leadership to \nthat end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/21/senate-section/article/S6075-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CLEAN WATER AGENCIES\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and share with \nmy colleagues an important milestone for the National Association of \nClean Water Agencies, NACWA. The association celebrates its 40th \nanniversary at its annual summer conference and meeting July 20 to 23 \nin San Francisco. This year's conference, ``Sustainable Resource \nManagement--Lessons from Clean Water's Past and Present,'' will surely \ninspire new solutions and innovative ideas to improve our country's \nwater quality and protect the health of our children and families.\n  Established in 1970 by a group of individuals representing 22 large \nmunicipal sewerage agencies, NACWA now represents over 300 of the \nNation's publicly owned wastewater utilities. NACWA grew up alongside \nthe landmark Clean Water Act of 1972, which has been enormously \nsuccessful at reducing pollution into our Nation's waterways. The 22 \nfounding agencies of NACWA united behind a related mission: to secure \ninvestment in municipal wastewater treatment and improve water quality. \nAs NACWA continued to grow and diversify, they have worked to promote \nwatershed management and the health of our ecosystems.\n  Today, NACWA has an active membership of publicly owned treatment \nagencies stretching from coast to coast. NACWA provides its members \nwith educational resources, community building, networking \nopportunities, and a forum for sharing best practices and building \nconsensus on water policy.\n  I am so pleased to acknowledge NACWA's long and distinguished record \nof environmental advocacy. Clean, safe drinking water is essential to \nall of us. The association has been a leader on a range of issues \naffecting our water supply. Over the course of my career in the Senate, \nI have had the pleasure of working with NACWA on important legislation \nincluding the Water Infrastructure Financing Act and the Water \nResources Development Act.\n  In 2008, I was honored to receive NACWA's Legislative Leadership \nAward for my efforts on the Water Resources Development Act, WRDA, of \n2007. This historic legislation is of critical importance to our \nNation's water quality and economy. WRDA 2007 garnered broad support on \nboth sides of the aisle, and I am again working with my colleagues to \npass a WRDA bill that will build on the important progress we made in \nWRDA 2007, continue investment in vital water resources projects, and \ncreate jobs rebuilding the Nation's aging water infrastructure.\n  I commend the members and staff of NACWA for their dedication and \nsupport for policies that advance clean water and a healthy, \nsustainable environment. Their efforts have certainly had a positive \nimpact on our Nation's environmental policy and water quality. I look \nforward to working with NACWA to improve our Nation's water quality, \necosystems and infrastructure for years to come by supporting \nlegislation that protects our Nation's waterways and water supply. \nTogether, we can ensure clean water for future generations. Please join \nme in celebrating the 40th anniversary of the National Association of \nClean Water Agencies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/21/senate-section/article/S6075-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/21/senate-section/article/S6075-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/21/senate-section/article/S6075-4", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6075-S6076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4684.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor an exclusion for assistance provided to participants in certain \nveterinary student loan repayment or forgiveness programs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my friend, Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, that will exempt \nVeterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program, VMLRP, awards from Federal \nincome taxation. I drafted this bipartisan bill with the intention of \nincreasing veterinary services in underserved shortage areas that lack \nadequate veterinary expertise.\n  The United States Department of Agriculture's, USDA, Veterinary \nMedicine Loan Repayment Program was authorized in 2003 by the National \nVeterinary Medical Services Act, NVMSA, to help qualified veterinarians \noffset a significant amount of the debt they accrue while pursuing \ntheir degrees if they in turn serve in high-priority veterinary \nshortage areas for a certain length of time. It also authorizes \nadditional loan repayments for service in Federal emergency situations. \nHowever, the awards are currently taxed at a rate of 39 percent. This \ntaxation is counterproductive and only delays delivery of veterinary \nservices to areas that are in desperate need.\n  In determining whether an area is eligible for assistance under the \nVMLRP, USDA has the ability to declare ``shortage situations,'' in \nwhich the Department makes declarations of veterinary shortage areas. \nCurrently, there are two circumstances that lead to such designations. \nThe first is by geography, when a given geographic area suffers a \nshortage of veterinarians overall. The second occurs when areas suffer \na shortage of veterinarians who practice in a particular field of \nveterinary specialty. My home State of South Dakota currently has four \ndesignated shortage situations. Two of these designations are statewide \ndesignations noting a shortage of practitioners in veterinary \nspecialties. On a national scale, there are 1,300 counties in the \nUnited States that have less than one food animal veterinarian per \n25,000 farm animals. Bear in mind, the demand for veterinarians across \nour country could increase 14 percent by 2016.\n  South Dakota is truly a wonderful place to call home, but it is not \nalways an easy place to earn a living. This is especially true for \nyoung people who are just starting out and are saddled with crushing \nlevels of school debt. I have long fought for legislation that makes it \neasier for students to pay off their loans and to encourage others who \nmay be reluctant to pursue higher education degrees, due to a lack of \nfinancial resources, especially when it comes to costly professional \ndegrees including veterinary medicine. My legislation will help \nstudents pursue their educational goals, while also providing important \nservices to underserved rural areas by enhancing the assistance \nveterinary graduates receive in exchange for meaningful public service.\n  Agriculture is the top contributor to our South Dakota economy. For \nthose farmers and ranchers who make their living in agriculture, this \nis more than a job; it is a way of life. Our ranchers, many of whom \noperate in very rural areas, rely on the access they have to qualified \nveterinarians to care for their livestock. Adequate access to \nveterinary care in rural areas is critical for both human and animal \nhealth, as well as animal welfare, disease surveillance, public safety \nand economic development across America. Everyone in America benefits \nfrom the veterinary services provided in even the most remote areas of \nour nation. As such, I am committed to doing all I can to help bring \nveterinarians to underserved parts of our state.\n  I am proud to have fought for the establishment of the VMLRP program, \nand through my seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. I have \nworked year after year to secure its proper funding. Unfortunately, \nhowever, the taxes assessed on these benefits prevent us from using \ncongressionally appropriated funding to the fullest extent. For every \nthree veterinarians selected for the loan repayment awards, an \nadditional veterinarian could also\n\n[[Page S6080]]\n\nbe selected if the program was made exempt from taxes. Such a tax \nexemption is not without precedent; Congress exempted from taxation the \nassistance received by participants in the National Health Services \nCorps, NHSC, several years ago, and I hope that my colleagues will join \nme in extending this same type of assistance to veterinarians \nparticipating in the VMLRP program.\n  It should be noted that 122 organizations from across our Nation have \nannounced their support for a tax exemption for VMLRP, including the \nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association, American Association of Equine \nPractitioners, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Sheep \nIndustry, the National Farmers Union, and the South Dakota Veterinary \nMedical Association, South Dakota Farm Bureau, South Dakota Cattlemen's \nAssociation, South Dakota Stockgrowers Association and many others.\n  Agriculture is the economic engine that drives our rural communities, \nand without viable family farms and ranchers, our small towns and Main \nStreet businesses throughout South Dakota and our nation would face \nsignificant hardships. It is absolutely essential that our agricultural \nproducers have access to the services they need to be successful and \nresponsible, and the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program \nEnhancement Act will help make that possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Veterinary Medical Association Governmental \n           Relations Division,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\nStatement of Support for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program \n                            Enhancement Act\n\n       The undersigned organizations urge Congress to pass the \n     Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program Enhancement Act, \n     which will provide a federal income tax exemption for \n     payments received under the Veterinary Medicine Loan \n     Repayment Program (VMLRP) and similar state programs.\n       Since Congress passed the ``National Veterinary Medical \n     Services Act'' (H.R. 1397, P.L. 108-161) on December 6, 2003, \n     it has appropriated $9.6 million for awards. About $3.75 \n     million will be used to pay taxes on the awards. Every dollar \n     spent on taxes is one less available for loan repayment \n     awards.\n       The first VMLRP awards to veterinarians practicing food \n     supply medicine and veterinary public health in federally \n     designated shortage areas across the country will be granted \n     by the end of fiscal year 2010. Veterinarians selected for \n     participation will receive up to $25,000 annually to repay \n     eligible student loans in exchange for three years of \n     practice in an approved shortage area.\n       Legislation amending the Internal Revenue Code to make loan \n     repayment awards tax exempt should take effect for taxable \n     years beginning after December 31, 2009. Each VMLRP award \n     including taxes for three years will cost approximately \n     $104,250 per veterinarian ($75,000 for loan repayment and \n     $29,250 for taxes). If VMLRP were tax exempt, one additional \n     veterinarian could be selected for every three awarded under \n     current law.\n       There is precedent for tax exemption. The VMLRP's \n     counterpart program for human medicine, the National Health \n     Service Corps (NHSC) which provides loan repayment for \n     primary care medical, dental and mental health clinicians, \n     was made tax exempt by the ``American Jobs Creation Act of \n     2004'' (H.R. 4520, P.L. 108-357), enacted on October 22, \n     2004. Prior to that NHSC awards were treated as taxable \n     income.\n       Exempting veterinary medical loan repayment and forgiveness \n     program awards from federal income taxation will lead to more \n     communities having access to needed veterinary care sooner \n     than they may otherwise. We strongly support Congress' \n     efforts to ensure that our nation's food animals are healthy, \n     that our food supply is safe and secure, and our public \n     health is protected.\n

                               \n      By Mr. JOHANNS (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3622. A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to finalize a proposed rule to amend the spill \nprevention, control, and countermeasure rule to tailor and streamline \nthe requirements for the dairy industry, and for other purposes;\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. Pesident, I rise today to offer what I consider to \nbe an enormously commonsense piece of legislation that is going to help \nour Nation's dairy farmers. No one can make up this stuff. If you can \nbelieve it, this legislation pertains to the EPA's regulation for \noilspills. I said that right. What do oilspills have to do with dairy \nfarmers, you might ask? Having grown up on a dairy farm myself, I \ndidn't think they had much in common at all. But EPA apparently thinks \ndifferently on this issue than I do.\n  The EPA currently enforces what are known as spill prevention control \nand countermeasure regulations, often referred to as SPCC regulations. \nThe purpose of these regulations is to prevent any oil from discharging \ninto U.S. waterways. It seems to make sense so far. Under SPCC \nregulations, facilities that store or use oil or fuel must put in place \na prevention plan so oil does not spill--that makes sense so far--or, \nif oil does spill, it is contained safely onsite.\n  I get all of that. These regulations have been in place since the \npassage of the Clean Water Act, dating back to the 1970s. We do not \nwant oil spilling in our waterways. The regulations are meant to avoid \nsuch spills. I think everybody is probably with me so far.\n  But there is one problem. Currently, EPA's definition of oil, under \nSPCC regulation, includes, of all things--milk. If that doesn't make \nyou want to scratch your head, if that does not occur to you as \nstrange--I have to tell you that is in fact what is going on here.\n  Under the EPA regulations, milk containers could be subject to the \nsame regulations as oil. Milk, which is made up of 80 percent water, \nwhich is an excellent source of calcium and protein--milk could be \nregulated in the same way as oil. That does not make any sense. I am no \nscientist but I don't think it takes a Ph.D. to see the difference \nbetween milk and oil. I have been drinking milk my entire life. As I \nsaid, I grew up on a dairy farm.\n  People drink milk because it is good for them. So these regulations \nare perplexing just standing on their own. But when we get a little \ndeeper it is even more confusing that EPA is getting involved in the \nregulation of milk at all.\n  The Food and Drug Administration already regulates milk storage under \nwhat is called the pasteurized milk ordinance. Requiring milk storage \nfacilities to also develop a SPCC plan would, of course, be costly, \nduplicative, and unnecessary.\n  Luckily, there is still some time remaining for us to address this \nissue. In January of 2009, EPA proposed to exempt milk storage from \nSPCC regulations. Way to go, EPA. If the dairy industry gets this \nexemption, they will not have to develop a plan to prevent milk from \nspilling.\n  Growing up on that dairy farm, I don't recall losing much sleep over \na little spilled milk out of the bucket, so that is a step in the right \ndirection. Unfortunately, and you will find this amazing, something \nthat is so vested in common sense has taken over 1\\1/2\\ years after it \nwas proposed. As I stand here today, the rule is not yet finalized. \nEvery day we wait for an answer from EPA is a day closer to a deadline \nfor compliance, which is November 10 of this year.\n  So the deadline to develop a spill plan is approaching. But the dairy \nfarmers still do not know whether they are going to need to comply. EPA \nhas been claiming they will extend the deadline until they finalize the \nrule, but so far we have not seen any action.\n  If they move at the same pace to extend the deadline as they have \ntaken to finalize the proposed rule, then you can see producers and \nfarmers are in big trouble. It has been over a year now. The dairy \nindustry deserves a simple, straightforward answer from the EPA. This \nshould not be tough, especially in the face of deadlines that are now \nonly a few months away.\n  Today, to address this problem, I am introducing legislation to \ncompel EPA to act. My bill requires the EPA to finalize the proposed \nrule exempting milk containers within 30 days. It also protects dairy \nproducers and milk processers by preventing EPA from punishing them \nuntil EPA actually provides clarification about what they are doing.\n  Even though these farmers and rural businesses are facing a deadline \nin a few months, they still do not know what, if anything, they will \nneed to do to comply, and that is not fair. This commonsense \nlegislation would simply help us get an answer from the EPA. It is very \nconcerning that anyone would ever equate milk handling with oil. That \nshould not be what is happening. Milk and oil should not be in the same \ncategory.\n  You know what. That is just good, old-fashioned farm common sense. \nBut it seems EPA officials are once again out of touch with mainstream \nAmerica. I encourage those officials to leave the Beltway. There are \nhighways that take you out of Washington. I invite them to visit a \nNebraska dairy farm with me. It will not take long for them to see the \nfoolishness of this regulatory effort.\n  Importantly, I urge them to act. Our Nation's dairy farmers have \nwaited long enough with a cloud of regulatory uncertainty hanging over \ntheir heads. But until then, my hope is my colleagues will join me in \nthis commonsense approach and deal with this problem.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeMINT (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Thune, Mr. \n        Coburn, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 3624. A bill to encourage continued investment and innovation in \ncommunications networks by establishing a new, competition analysis-\nbased regulatory framework for the Federal Communications Commission; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Jim DeMint, in introducing the Freedom for \nConsumer Choice Act. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation, which would require the Federal Communications Commission, \nFCC, to prove that consumers are being harmed by the lack of choice \nbefore it imposes new regulations.\n  Specifically, the proposed bill would require the FCC to weigh the \npotential cost of action against any benefits based on a showing of \nclear and convincing evidence that marketplace competition is not \nsufficient to adequately protect consumer welfare, and an act or \npractice is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers. I believe \nthis framework, along with a 5-year sunset on any regulation, would \nfoster a vibrant market for Internet services and content. This \nlegislation is necessary to combat the FCC's latest assault on the \nInternet.\n  In April, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals ruled \nthat the FCC had stepped beyond its authority by regulating the \nInternet with so-called ``net neutrality'' rules. Yet, it seems the FCC \njust will not take no for an answer. Just over a month after the \nappeals court ruled it had overstepped its bounds, the FCC sought to \nre-categorize broadband services in an effort to more actively regulate \nthe Internet and to establish a set of net neutrality principles. This \nregulatory overreach could jeopardize hundreds of billions of dollars \nin investment and accompanying hundreds of thousands of jobs that have \nresulted from an Internet governed by competition.\n  The only reason the FCC Chairman and his colleagues are taking this \npath is because there is no way they can get far-reaching and costly \nnet neutrality legislation through Congress. In fact it was recently \nreported that 282 Members of Congress, including 74 Democrats, asked \nthe FCC to drop its plans to reclassify broadband. Enough is enough. \nThe Government needs to keep its hands off the Internet so it can \nprosper and grow, benefiting consumers and our economy alike.\n  Net neutrality may sound like fairness but it is actually the \nopposite. Bandwidth is finite, like the finite number of lanes on a \nhighway, and network providers must innovate in order to accommodate \nthe burgeoning traffic. If the FCC takes control of the Internet, we \nwill have the inevitable result of all poorly designed regulations: \nbusiness decisions prejudiced by politicians and political decisions \nprejudiced by corporations. The Internet is about the most competitive, \nefficient and consumer-driven industry in the global economy. There is \na time and\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\nplace for federal economic regulation, but during a recession is not \nthe time, and the Internet is certainly not the place.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by pointing out that the Freedom for \nConsumer Choice Act is intended as a starting point for this debate. No \ndoubt further refinements will be made to this bill during the \nlegislative process. I am committed to moving this legislation forward \nand hope that my colleagues can join efforts to refine and enact this \nimportant bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 3625. A bill to enhance public safety by making more spectrum \navailable to public safety agencies, to facilitate the development of a \npublic safety broadband network, to provide for the spectrum needs of \npublic safety agencies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague Senator \nMcCain, to introduce legislation to ensure that we take advantage of a \nonce-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a coast-to-coast communications \nnetwork for our nation's first responders that is secure, robust and \nresilient.\n  As it stands now, the mobile device the average teenager carries has \nmore capability than those of the brave men and women who put their \nlives on the line for us each and every day and that's just wrong.\n  Today we introduce the First Responders Protection Act of 2010, which \nwill set aside the so-called D Block of spectrum for public safety \nentities and provide them the bandwidth they need to communicate \neffectively in an emergency.\n  I am proud to stand with the representatives of more than 40 \norganizations representing public safety officials, and with the ``Big \n7'' associations representing State and local governments, to call on \nCongress to put the D Block in the hands of public safety. Those groups \ninclude the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Sheriffs \nAssociation, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Major County \nSheriffs Association, the Metropolitan Fire Chiefs Association, the \nAssociation of Public-Safety Communications Officials, International, \nAPCO, the National Emergency Managers Association, the National \nGovernors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, \nthe Council of State Governments, the National Association of Counties, \nthe National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the \nInternational City/County Management Association.\n  Today public safety communicates on slices of scattered spectrum that \nprevent interoperable communications among agencies and jurisdictions, \nand that do not allow the large data transmissions that we take for \ngranted in today's commercial communications.\n  Securing the D Block for public safety will allow us to build a \nnationwide interoperable network for emergency communications that \ncould prevent the kinds of communication meltdowns we had during 9/11 \nand Hurricane Katrina.\n  But setting aside the D Block will also allow first responders to \nsend video, maps, and other large data transmissions over their mobile \ndevices. For example, firefighters' lives may be saved because they \nwill be able to access building specifications on their handhelds and \nknow all the exits of a burning building before they enter it.\n  I do not think it is wise, as the Federal Communications Commission \nhas proposed, to auction the D Block to commercial interests and then \nto hope that public safety will be able to piggy-back on it. In a \ncrisis, first responders need secure, reliable and quick communications \nthat are not disrupted by commercial traffic.\n  The First Responders Protection Act of 2010 will ensure that the D \nBlock is licensed to the same public safety broadband licensee that \ncurrently holds the license for 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band. The bill \nwould also provide up to $5.5 billion for a construction fund to assist \nwith the costs of constructing networks and up to $5.5 billion for an \noperation and maintenance fund for long-term maintenance of networks. \nThese funds would come from revenues generated by the auction of a \ndifferent band of spectrum to commercial carriers.\n  Achieving nationwide interoperability through adequate spectrum is a \nmajor recommendation of the 9/11 Commission that is unfulfilled. I urge \nmy colleagues to take bold action to remedy Congress's past inaction by \npromptly passing the First Responders Protection Act of 2010.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr, President, today I share the honor with Chairman \nLieberman of introducing the First Responders Protection Act of 2010. \nThis bill would provide 10 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz spectrum band \nto the public safety broadband licensee, make available funding for the \nconstruction, operation and maintenance of a nationwide interoperable \ncommunications network, and ensure proper governance.\n  In 2004, the 9/11 Commission's Final Report recommended the \n``expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum to public safety \nentities.'' Shortly thereafter, Senator Lieberman and I introduced a \nbill to provide spectrum to public safety; however the Senate voted \ndown that bill. We reintroduced the bill in 2005--a month before \nHurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. But our efforts were blocked. \nFortunately, Congress finally wrestled some spectrum away from the \ntelevision broadcasters in 2009 and provided it to public safety. \nHowever, public safety has additional spectrum needs.\n  Almost every other recommendation of the 9/11 Commission has been \nimplemented, but this important recommendation remains unfulfilled. I \ncan only imagine how many lives could have been saved on 9/11 if this \nspectrum had been available at that time. How many firefighters would \nbe alive today if they could have communicated with their battalion \nchief at the base of the World Trade Center? Recently, in Arizona, we \nhad a horrible murder committed in a rural area along the border. \nCochise County Sheriff Larry Dever has stated that the lack of \ninteroperable communications between the sheriffs' department and other \nlaw enforcement officers hindered the immediate investigation into \ntracking the suspect.\n  In 2007, I introduced legislation to auction the remaining public \nsafety spectrum to a commercial carrier that would then build out a \nnetwork for public safety. The FCC held such an auction, but no bidder \nmet the reserve price. Ten megahertz of spectrum remains available for \npublic safety's needs. The FCC has announced its intention auction this \nspectrum to a commercial provider.\n  Once this spectrum is auctioned, it will be impossible to ever get it \nback. That is why Congress must act now and provide the remaining \nspectrum directly to public safety. This legislation would do just \nthat.\n  Specifically, this legislation would license the remaining spectrum \nto the public safety broadband licensee that has been previously \napproved by the FCC as a qualified licensee and represents 38 national \npublic safety organizations. The legislation provides authority to \nlocal jurisdictions to make decisions on the spectrum use, network \nbuild-out and equipment. The men and women fighting crime and saving \nlives know what communications systems and technology are best for \nthem. Not Washington.\n  Lastly, this bill provides funds for grants to localities for the \nconstruction, operation and maintenance of an interoperable \ncommunications network. These funds will come from the proceeds of a \ncommercial spectrum auction, thereby not adding to our nation's \nburgeoning debt or raising taxes on all Americans.\n  As we approach the 9 year commemoration of the horrific events on \nSeptember 11 and the 5-year remembrance of the devastating tragedy of \nHurricane Katrina, it is disgraceful that police officers, sheriffs and \nfire fighters still don't have a nation-wide interoperable \ncommunications system. Our legislation provides the spectrum and \nfunding to first responders, while being fiscally responsible and \nensuring local control and conscientious governance.\n  This legislation is supported by the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the \nNational Sheriffs Association, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the \nMajor County Sheriffs\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\nAssociation, the Metropolitan Fire Chiefs Association, the Association \nof Public-Safety Communications Officials, International, APCO, the \nNational Emergency Managers Association, the National Governors \nAssociation, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Council \nof State Governments, the National Association of Counties, the \nNational League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the \nInternational City/County Management Association.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in providing public safety with the \ninteroperable communications network they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 3626. A bill to encourage the implementation of thermal energy \ninfrastructure, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Thermal \nRenewable Energy and Efficiency, or TREEA, Act, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Bond. I want to thank him for working with me on this bill, \nwhich is inspired by models in both of our states. It is good policy \nfor the environment, for creating jobs, and for increasing the \nefficiency of heating and cooling--a major yet often ignored part of \nour Nation's energy consumption.\n  As we think about carbon emissions and energy use, most of the \nconversation focuses on moving away from fossil fuels in the electric \npower sector. But over 30 percent of our country's energy use goes \ntoward thermal energy--heating or cooling our homes, public buildings, \nor industrial facilities. Thermal energy is enormously important for my \nstate of Minnesota, whether we're talking about heating in the midst of \na cold snowy winter or air conditioning on a blazing summer day, when \nadditional plants have to kick in to meet the demand.\n  Unfortunately, as we talk about changing the way we produce and use \nenergy, thermal energy is usually ignored. We talk about producing \nsignificantly more of our electricity from renewables like solar, \ngeothermal, or biomass. But what we forget is that we can much more \nefficiently produce thermal from these sources than we can from \nelectricity. After all, when we are talking about energy efficiency, we \nare talking about how much of the energy produced from a given fuel is \nnot lost as heat. Well, that heat has a value. That is heat that can \nheat the homes and buildings in Minnesota when it's 30 below zero.\n  That is what District energy systems have done in Minnesota and \naround the country. They supply hot water or steam and chilled water to \nbuildings through underground pipes for space heating, domestic hot \nwater, air conditioning, and industrial processes. There are tremendous \nefficiencies in heating and cooling buildings this way. Each building \ndoesn't have to have its own boiler, and instead of burning fuel to \nproduce electricity to heat a building, you take the heat directly from \nthe fuel and put it to productive use.\n  When you use renewable fuel to produce thermal energy--whether it's \nbiomass, geothermal, or solar-thermal--you cut down on greenhouse gas \nemissions at the same time. So capturing and efficiently using thermal \nenergy is a win-win-win. It is a win for the environment through lower \ngreenhouse gas emissions and much higher fuel efficiency. It is a win \nfor consumers and businesses, who get low, stable heating prices. It is \na win for the economy, because building and maintaining these systems \ncreates jobs.\n  Minnesota is a national leader in thermal energy--in St. Paul, we \nhave the largest District Energy system in North America. Most of the \nbuildings in downtown St. Paul are heated and cooled using energy that \nliterally comes from residents' backyards--tree trimmings and other \nwaste wood.\n  What does this mean? It means less electricity usage for heating and \ncooling, which frees up strain on the grid during hot summer days and \nfreezing winter nights. It means stable heating prices for consumers \nand businesses--thermal systems are flexible in their fuel and can \nswitch to the lowest cost fuel at any time. And if these systems run on \nrenewable fuels, it means less pollution contributing to global \nwarming.\n  But there are some barriers to overcome. Right now, the renewable \nenergy production tax credit is only available for electricity \ngenerated from renewables. We need to recognize the usefulness of \nthermal energy as well, and hence extend the production credit to the \ngeneration of thermal energy from renewables. That is exactly what our \nbill does: it allows thermal-only or combined heat and power facilities \nto access the production tax credit for their thermal energy, if it's \nproduced from renewables.\n  We also need to make some tweaks to existing financing structures \nlike tax exempt bonds. Currently, these can be used for financing \ndistrict energy piping distribution systems, but not the plant \nfacilities for producing the heating and cooling. Our bill would change \nthis. Finally, we need to make sure that the grant programs authorized \nin the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act are structured in a \nway that actually is helpful to thermal and combined heat and power \nfacilities. Our bill raises the grant caps for those programs to more \nrealistic levels that will allow large, more efficient projects to \nqualify.\n  This legislation is ultimately about being smarter on how we use \nenergy. It increases our energy efficiency, helps reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, and creates clean energy jobs. That is why it has the \nsupport of environmental groups, labor groups, the district energy and \ncombined heat and power industry, and organizations promoting energy \nefficiency.\n  I am very proud to be introducing this bill with my friend from \nMissouri, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to \nmake these modest changes to improve our use of thermal energy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3626\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) approximately 30 percent of the total quantity of \n     energy consumed in the United States is used to provide \n     thermal energy for heating and cooling building space, \n     domestic hot water, and industrial processes;\n       (2) thermal energy is an essential, but often overlooked, \n     segment of the national energy mix;\n       (3) district energy systems use 1 or more central plants to \n     provide thermal energy to multiple buildings that range in \n     size from campus applications to systems heating entire towns \n     or cities;\n       (4) district energy systems provide sustainable thermal \n     energy infrastructure by producing and distributing thermal \n     energy from combined heat power, sources of industrial or \n     municipal surplus heat, and from renewable sources such as \n     biomass, geothermal, and solar energy;\n       (5) as of 2009, the United States had approximately 2,500 \n     operating district energy systems;\n       (6) district energy systems provide advantages that support \n     secure, affordable, renewable, and sustainable energy for the \n     United States, including--\n       (A) use of local fuels or waste heat sources that keep jobs \n     and energy dollars in local economies;\n       (B) stable, predictable energy costs for businesses and \n     industry;\n       (C) reduction in reliance on fossil fuels;\n       (D) reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases; and\n       (E) flexibility to modify fuel sources in response to \n     future changes in fuel availability and prices and \n     development of new technologies;\n       (7) district energy helps cut peak power demand and reduce \n     power transmission and distribution system constraints by--\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\n       (A) meeting air conditioning demand through delivery of \n     chilled water produced with heat from combined heat and power \n     or other energy sources; and\n       (B) shifting power demand through thermal storage and, with \n     combined heat and power, generating power near load centers;\n       (8) combined heat and power systems increase energy \n     efficiency of power plants by capturing thermal energy and \n     using the thermal energy to provide heating and cooling, more \n     than doubling the efficiency of conventional power plants;\n       (9) according to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, if the \n     United States was able to increase combined heat and power \n     from approximately 9 percent of total electric generation \n     capacity to 20 percent by 2030, the increase would--\n       (A) save as much energy as half of all household energy \n     consumption;\n       (B) create approximately 1,000,000 new jobs;\n       (C) avoid more than 800,000,000 metric tons of carbon \n     dioxide emissions annually, which is equivalent to taking \n     half of all United States passenger vehicles off the road; \n     and\n       (D) save hundreds of millions of barrels of oil equivalent; \n     and\n       (10) constraints to significant expansion of district \n     energy and combined heat and power include--\n       (A) the lack of economic value in the energy marketplace \n     for the environmental, grid support, energy security, and \n     local economic development benefits of district energy \n     systems;\n       (B) relatively high project development costs due to the \n     variety of institutional, legal, and technical issues that \n     must be addressed; and\n       (C) the high costs of debt service, particularly in the \n     early years of systems development before a broad base of \n     customers has connected.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to encourage the implementation \n     of thermal energy infrastructure order to--\n       (1) increase energy efficiency;\n       (2) increase use of renewable energy resources;\n       (3) revitalize the infrastructure of the cities and \n     institutions of the United States;\n       (4) reduce local and regional air pollution;\n       (5) reduce emissions of greenhouse gases;\n       (6) reduce emissions of ozone-depleting refrigerants; and\n       (7) enhance power grid reliability and overall energy \n     supply reliability and energy security.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that, in energy \n     policy development and program implementation, the following \n     factors should be considered:\n       (1) Thermal energy represents a significant part of the \n     energy requirements of the United States, providing building \n     heating and cooling, domestic hot water, and industrial \n     process energy.\n       (2) There are many opportunities for meeting thermal energy \n     requirements directly through renewable energy sources or \n     recycled energy (such as recovered waste heat), without \n     generation of electricity.\n       (3) Policies and incentives for encouraging renewable \n     energy and energy efficiency should address thermal energy as \n     well as electricity.\n       (4) District energy systems provide an important means of \n     delivering sustainable thermal energy to consumers, and \n     provide energy security benefits, by--\n       (A) cutting peak power demand;\n       (B) reducing power transmission and distribution system \n     constraints; and\n       (C) providing flexibility to modify fuel sources in \n     response to future changes in fuel availabilities and prices \n     and development of new technologies.\n\n TITLE I--MODIFICATION OF CREDIT FOR ELECTRICITY PRODUCED FROM CERTAIN \n                           RENEWABLE SOURCES\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to ensure that United States global HIV/AIDS \nassistance prioritizes saving lives by focusing on access to treatment; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the introduction \nof S. 3627, The HIV/AIDS Save Lives First Act of 2010. This important \npiece of legislation will make crucial improvements to our approach to \nbilateral global AIDS efforts. As a practicing physician and former co-\nchair of President Bush's Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, I have \nintroduced this bill to ensure that our global AIDS continue to \nprioritize life-saving medical treatment and reduce the transmission of \nthe disease from mother to child.\n  The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief--known as PEPFAR--has \nbeen wildly successful and has begun to reverse the course of the AIDS \nepidemic worldwide. Two and half million HIV/AIDS patients from 30 \ndifferent countries currently have access to lifesaving treatment \nbecause of PEPFAR. A 2009 report found that from 2004-2007 as many as \n1.2 million lives had been saved because of the program.\n  In 2008, Congress and the President in an overwhelmingly bipartisan \nfashion passed the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global \nLeadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization \nAct of 2008 to continue the important life-saving work of the PEPFAR \nprogram.\n  It is of grave concern, then, that our fight against AIDS is now at \nrisk of failure. A recent New York Times article, ``At Front Lines, \nAIDS War Is Falling Apart,'' details how hundreds of thousands of \npatients are being denied promised care in countries such as Uganda--a \ncountry once held up as PEPFAR's success story. Government officials \nhave confirmed the rationing of treatment slots and have advised their \npartners to support ``an equitable system of triage for total ART \n[antiretroviral drug treatment]\nslots. . . .''\n  Former UNAIDS chief Dr. Piot remarked about past success and doubts \nabout the future: ``Then, we were at a tipping point in the right \ndirection,'' he explained. ``Now I'm afraid we're at a tipping point in \nthe wrong direction.''\n  We must not lose sight of the fact that HIV/AIDS is a disease that we \ncan diagnose, treat, and prevent. Not only does treatment save lives--\nit is the best prevention tool we have. Treatment lowers viral loads, \nwhich reduces the likelihood of individuals spreading the disease by as \nmuch as 92 percent. Treatment reduces transmission among partners, \neliminates baby AIDS, and keeps those with HIV in the medical system \nwhere they can receive proper counseling and care. And the availability \nof treatment is integral to promoting HIV/AIDS testing and early \ndiagnosis.\n  With the U.S. spending more than $6.7 billion on global AIDS efforts, \nwe are not losing the war on AIDS due to lack of commitment or \nresources. Instead, we are losing because of misplaced priorities.\n  We can eliminate the tragedies of baby AIDS and AIDS orphans and \nprevent the spread of HIV by focusing on saving lives by expanding \naccess to treatment.\n  It costs less than $300 a year to keep someone with HIV healthy and \nalive, about the same price to cover the airfare to send each of the \n25,000 participants to the ongoing AIDS conference in Vienna. If saving \nlives is truly our priority, we must ask every time we spend a dollar \nintended for AIDS relief if that dollar would be better spent paying \nfor lifesaving treatment that would keep a mother alive, a family \ntogether, or a baby born free of the virus.\n  If you ask Africans what PEPFAR is, they will tell you it is about \nAIDS treatment. It is the treatment component of PEPFAR that has made \nit the most successful U.S. humanitarian effort in history because it \nhas literally saved the lives of millions, preserved families and \ncommunities, and rescued countless babies from being born with an AIDS \ndeath sentence.\n  The PEPFAR program's long-term success relies on the promise of life-\nsaving medical treatment to those in need. Unfortunately, according to \na recent report the recent moratorium on new enrollees in the program \nhas already caused an estimated 3,000 deaths.\n  The HIV/AIDS Save Lives First Act strengthens the current policy that \nrequires a majority of all funding under PEPFAR be spent on life-saving \nHIV/AIDS treatment. Specifically, this legislation would increase the \ntreatment allocation to 75 percent of all PEPFAR funding. It also sets \nthe modest goal that by 2013 we treat 5 million people with HIV/AIDS.\n  Many claim that we cannot treat our way out of this epidemic, but \nthey ignore the simple truth that treatment is prevention. Analysts \nfrom the World Health Organization published research arguing we can \ndrastically reduce the transmission of AIDS and virtually halt the \nwidening epidemic in Africa within a decade through aggressive routine \ntesting and early treatment.\n  Other prevention efforts remain an important component of the \nprogram. Without the reliable promise of access to treatment, however, \nthe PEPFAR program will not enjoy long-term success. This legislation \nensures that the PEPFAR program fulfills its promises, saves the most \nlives possible, and reduces transmission of the disease.\n  The HIV/AIDS Save Lives First Act also allocates a small percentage \nof funding for the critical diagnostic screening that must be ramped up \ndramatically if we are to locate and treat every infected person in the \ncountries where PEPFAR operates. Finally, the bill acknowledges that \nevery baby infected with HIV by her mother during birth or \nbreastfeeding is a largely preventable tragedy. The bill would target \nbaby AIDS for complete elimination with 100 percent coverage with the \nmedical protocols that prevent almost all instances of mother-to-child \nHIV transmission.\n  The Save Lives First Act requires recipients of funding to spend no \nmore than $500 in annual PEPFAR funding per patient they treat. As \nrecently as 2008, documents provided by the administration show that \nthe PEPFAR program spent $1,100 in annual treatment costs per patient. \nThis is unacceptable--inefficiencies come at the cost of human lives by \nlimiting the number of patients PEPFAR can treat.\n  The most commonly prescribed drug regimen costs just $64 per year and \nmany organizations are providing care to patients for no more than $250 \nper year. For example, Doctors Without Borders has had remarkable \nsuccess in achieving treatment efficiencies and now reports that its \nper-patient treatment costs in Malawi were only $237 per year.\n  While costs may vary from country to country--and patient to \npatient--it is both reasonable and important that every funding \nrecipient under PEPFAR limit their aggregate per patient expenditures \nto $500 per patient. The costs of drug regimens continue to fall \ndramatically, and PEPFAR must take advantage by providing treatment to \nmore individuals.\n  The HIV/AIDS Save Lives First Act would require that any funding \nrecipient under PEPFAR be limited to a treatment allocation of $500 per \npatient treated. This act would also set the modest goal that PEPFAR \nwould treat 5 million patients by 2013. If the program's per patient \nexpenditures were down to $500 per patient, the program should actually \ntreat 6 million patients by 2013, and if everyone were as cost-\neffective as Doctors Without Borders, we could be treating 10 million \npatients.\n  In the rare instance of a country in which per patient expenditures \nremain above $500 per patient, it is more than reasonable to assume \nthat these more developed countries have the resources--along with \nother global partners--to ensure that the per patient treatment \nexpenditures ensure access to the highest-quality treatment for each \npatient.\n  Everyone can agree that dollars provided to HIV/AIDS treatment should \ngo directly to patient care--not bloated administrative budgets. A \ncommon way of protecting this important principle is to limit the \nadministrative budget for PEPFAR funding recipients.\n  The HIV/AIDS Save Lives First Act limits administrative overhead to \n10 percent of total expenditures for every\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n\nfunding recipient under the program. The bill also limits the State \nDepartment's administrative budget for PEPFAR to 10 percent of total \nfunding.\n  Again, treatment is prevention. But this strategy relies on \nidentifying HIV positive individuals who are unaware of their status \nand linking them to treatment and counseling. The first step to any \nprevention strategy is an aggressive testing strategy. Unfortunately, \nonly about 40 percent of people with HIV in developing countries are \naware of their status.\n  The HIV/AIDS Save Lives First Act sets aside 5 percent of PEPFAR \nfunding to dramatically ramp up rapid HIV diagnosis to identify people \nwho do not yet know their HIV status in order to get people into \ntreatment and early reduce their transmission rates through treatment \nand education.\n  This bill also sets a target of conducting 1 billion rapid tests by \n2013 and sets aside 25 percent of testing money to help countries \nimplement a policy of universal, opt-out rapid HIV testing.\n  Rapid testing and access to treatment are particularly important to \nend baby AIDS, babies being born infected with HIV or becoming infected \nduring their first year through breastfeeding, once and for all.\n  An estimated 430,000 children were born in 2008 newly infected with \nHIV, mainly through mother to child transmission. About 90 percent of \nthese infections occurred in Africa. Only 28 percent of pregnant women \nin Sub-Saharan Africa received an HIV test in 2008. Moreover, the World \nHealth Organization reports that access to AIDS drugs is severely \nlimited in developing countries, with fewer than 10 percent of pregnant \nwomen with HIV in those countries having access to medication for their \nown health.\n  Of course, dramatic gains are seen when universal testing of pregnant \nwomen and newborns is provided along with appropriate prophylaxis of \ninfections that are that are identified through testing. In the United \nStates, new cases of baby AIDS have been virtually eliminated. Studies \nhave found that 99 percent of babies were born uninfected if an \ninfected mother was diagnosed and proper treatment was administered.\n  Botswana, a country that used to have HIV infection rates as high as \n50 percent of child-bearing-aged women, instituted these interventions. \nNinety-two percent of pregnant women in the country are now being \ntested and the drop in HIV-positive mothers delivering infected babies \ndropped from 35 percent to 4 percent from 2004-2007, with 13,000 HIV-\ninfected moms being identified annually.\n  Prevention of mother-to-child-transmission, PMTCT, is cheap per life \nsaved: as of 2008, estimated costs of PMTCT drugs to prevent the spread \nof HIV for (1) mother/child pair was US$167--generics--and US$318--\nbranded--and the price of drugs and treatment have only declined since.\n  The HIV/AIDS Save Lives First Act sets a target of eliminating baby \nAIDS in all PEPFAR countries by 2013, and sets out expectations for how \nto work towards that target by screening 100 percent of pregnant women \nand newborns in PEPFAR countries and providing prophylactic or ARV \ntreatment for all HIV-positive moms or babies.\n  By emphasizing providing lifesaving treatment under the PEPFAR \nprogram, we can continue the enormous success we have had in saving \nlives and preventing the spread of this terrible disease. It is my \nsincere hope that my colleagues adopt these common sense policy changes \nthat will significantly reduce human suffering, keep families together, \nand save millions of lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S.J. Res. 35. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to a balanced budget; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my growing alarm \nabout the excessive amount of government spending that is adding to our \nnational debt at an exponential rate. We simply cannot continue to add \nthese annual trillion dollar-plus deficits to the amount to be repaid \nby those in generations to come. Today, I am introducing a measure that \nwould ensure that the futures of our children and grandchildren will \nnot be crippled by the reckless spending of those who control Congress \nand the White House today. After long study of this disturbing trend, I \nhave concluded that the best way to get a handle on this deficit \nspending is by amending the Constitution by requiring each Congress to \nput forth a balanced budget.\n  Amending the Constitution is no small task, nor is it a trifling \nmatter. Though hundreds, if not thousands, of amendments to the \nConstitution have been proposed, this founding document has been \namended only 27 times in our nation's history. Amending it now to deal \nwith overspending may appear to be a monumental undertaking. However, \nUtahns and other Americans across the nation have spoken loud and \nclear--no more excessive government spending that will add to the debt \nto be borne by the next generation.\n  The liberals in Congress have had their turn over the past couple of \nyears to try to revitalize our economy, and we still remain with \ntrillion dollar-plus deficits coupled with a stagnant unemployment rate \nof nearly 10 percent.\n  The economy did not turn sour yesterday. It went south nearly two \nyears ago, and the major accomplishments of the current Administration \nand its congressional allies is to enact an ineffective $1.1 trillion \nstimulus bill, an exacerbation of our entitlement crisis through the \ntrillion dollar-plus health care bill, and an invasive and job-killing \nfinancial regulatory bill. All of these further harmed our nation's \nfiscal health.\n  The measure I am proposing is straightforward. It would simply \nrequire Congress to submit a budget where the total outlays could not \nexceed total revenues. It would require Treasury to use any surplus to \npay down the Nation's debt. Any tax increase would have to be approved \nby two-thirds of the Members of Congress.\n  I realize that requiring a balanced budget will not necessarily end \nthe outrageous government spending that has occurred over recent years, \nbut it will at least provide Congress with a stronger incentive for \nfiscal responsibility. Balanced budgets are about more than sound \nfiscal policy; they are a moral responsibility that government often \nfails to meet. Individuals and families who live wildly beyond their \nmeans face dire consequences. Government should have to live by the \nsame standards, especially since this money belongs to the people. The \nConstitution is the most important tool by which the people place \nlimits on government and it appears that the Constitution is what it \nwill take for the government to live within its means.\n  The outstanding public debt is now over $13 trillion. That equates \nroughly to $42,000 for each American. This year we are estimated to add \nanother $1.3 trillion, which is about what we added last year. This is \nmore than $41,000 added to the debt every second. Most of this spending \nis going towards increasing the size of the Federal Government, \ncreating and expanding government programs, and providing more \nentitlements.\n  Economists agree that our Nation must get our outrageous deficit \nunder control. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently \nreleased its Long-Term Budget Outlook. In this report, the CBO projects \nthat the national debt will reach 62 percent of GDP by the end of this \nyear, the highest since the end of World War II. To put this in \nperspective, at the end of 2008, our debt was 40 percent of GDP and the \nhistoric average has been around 36 percent.\n  The CBO also projects that deficits will average about $600 billion \nannually from 2011 through 2020 and the national debt to grow by 67 \npercent by 2020. Congress needs to act now.\n  If anyone is still questioning whether this enormous debt poses a \nthreat to our economy, the warning signs are clear. The World Bank \ncautioned that we could have a double dip recession if the financial \nmarkets lose confidence in our ability to repay our debt. Federal \nReserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testified before the House Budget \nCommittee and said ``unless we as a nation make a strong commitment to \nfiscal responsibility, in the long run, we will have neither financial \nstability nor healthy economic growth.''\n  On Monday, President Obama gave a speech in the Rose Garden scolding \nRepublicans for what he believed was an effort to prevent the \nunemployed from receiving benefits. What he has failed\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\nto acknowledge is that both sides--Democrats and Republicans alike--\nagree on extending the additional unemployment insurance. What fiscal \nconservatives object to adding another $30 billion plus to the deficit. \nThe President said ``It's time to stop holding workers laid off in this \nrecession hostage to Washington politics.'' This same logic and \nrhetoric can be applied to our children and grandchildren who will be \nheld hostage by, and have to pay for, the irresponsible government \nspending this Congress passes today.\n  It is time for solutions and not just rhetoric. I believe that we can \nachieve a balanced budget while promoting economic growth. We have the \nstrongest economy in the world, for now. Let us not have our \nindebtedness create misery for us and generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/21/senate-section/article/S6087-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 589--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRINTING OF A REVISED EDITION \n OF THE NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF \n                           THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Bennett) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 591\n\n       Whereas July 26, 2010, marks the 20th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act has been one of \n     the most significant and effective civil rights laws passed \n     by Congress;\n       Whereas, prior to the passage of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, people with disabilities faced \n     significantly lower employment rates, lower graduation rates, \n     and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities, \n     and were too often denied the opportunity to fully \n     participate in society due to intolerance and unfair \n     stereotypes;\n       Whereas the dedicated efforts of disability rights \n     advocates, including Justin Dart, Jr., and many others, \n     served to awaken Congress and the American people to the \n     discrimination and prejudice faced by individuals with \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to craft \n     legislation making such discrimination illegal;\n       Whereas Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     and President George Herbert Walker Bush signed the Act into \n     law on July 26, 1990;\n       Whereas the purpose of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     is to fulfill the Nation's goals of equality of opportunity, \n     independent living, economic self-sufficiency, and full \n     participation for Americans with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits \n     employers from discriminating against qualified individuals \n     with disabilities, requires that State and local governmental \n     entities accommodate qualified individuals with disabilities, \n     requires places of public accommodation to take reasonable \n     steps to make their goods and services accessible to \n     individuals with disabilities, and requires that new trains \n     and buses be accessible to individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act has played an \n     historic role in allowing over 50,000,000 Americans with \n     disabilities to participate more fully in national life by \n     removing barriers to employment, transportation, public \n     services, telecommunications, and public accommodations;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act has served as a \n     model for disability rights in other countries;\n       Whereas all Americans, not just those with disabilities, \n     benefit from the accommodations that have become commonplace \n     since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \n     including curb cuts at street intersections, ramps for access \n     to buildings, and other accommodations that provide access to \n     public transportation, stadiums, telecommunications, voting \n     machines, and websites;\n       Whereas Congress acted with overwhelming bipartisan support \n     in 2008 to restore protections for people with disabilities \n     by passing the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, which overturned \n     judicial decisions that had inappropriately narrowed the \n     scope of the Americans with Disabilities Act;\n       Whereas, 20 years after the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, children and adults with disabilities \n     continue to experience barriers that interfere with their \n     full participation in mainstream American life;\n       Whereas, 20 years after the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, people with disabilities are twice as \n     likely to live in poverty as their fellow citizens and \n     continue to experience high rates of unemployment and \n     underemployment;\n       Whereas, 20 years after the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act and 11 years after the Supreme Court's \n     decision in Olmstead v. L.C., many people with disabilities \n     still live in segregated institutional settings because of a \n     lack of support services that would allow them to live in the \n     community;\n       Whereas, 20 years after the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, new telecommunication, electronic, and \n     information technologies continue to be developed while not \n     being accessible to all Americans;\n       Whereas, 20 years after the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, many public and private covered entities \n     are still not accessible to people with disabilities; and\n       Whereas the United States has a responsibility to welcome \n     back and create opportunities for the tens of thousands of \n     working-age veterans of the Armed Forces who have been \n     wounded in action or have received service-connected injuries \n     while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \n     Enduring Freedom: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 20th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n       (2) salutes all people whose efforts contributed to the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act;\n       (3) encourages all Americans to celebrate the advance of \n     freedom and the opening of opportunity made possible by the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act; and\n       (4) pledges to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to \n     identify and address the remaining barriers that undermine \n     the Nation's goals of equality of opportunity, independent \n     living, economic self-sufficiency, and full participation for \n     Americans with disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/21/senate-section/article/S6087-4", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6087-S6088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4494.

In the \n     case where the amount of small business lending has remained \n     the same or decreased relative to the institution's baseline \n     in the eighth quarter after the date of the capital \n     investment under the Program, the rate shall be 7 percent \n     until the expiration of the 4\\1/2\\-year period that begins on \n     the date of the investment.\n       (E) Rate following initial 4\\1/2\\ -year period.--The \n     dividend or interest rate paid on any preferred stock or \n     other financial instrument issued by an eligible institution \n     that receives a capital investment under the Program shall \n     increase to 9 percent at the end of the 4\\1/2\\-year period \n     that begins on the date of the capital investment under the \n     Program.\n       (F) Limitation on rate reductions with respect to certain \n     amount.--The reduction in the dividend or interest rate \n     payable to Treasury by any eligible institution shall be \n     limited such that the rate reduction shall not apply to a \n     dollar amount of the investment made by Treasury that is \n     greater than the dollar amount increase in the amount of \n     small business lending realized under this program. The \n     Secretary may issue guidelines that will apply to new capital \n     investments limiting the amount of capital available to \n     eligible institutions consistent with this limitation.\n       (G) Rate adjustments for s corporation.--Before making a \n     capital investment in an eligible institution that is an S \n     corporation or a corporation organized on a mutual basis, the \n     Secretary may adjust the dividend or interest rate on the \n     financial instrument to be issued to the Secretary, from the \n     dividend or interest rate that would apply under \n     subparagraphs (A) through (F), to take into account any \n     differential tax treatment of securities issued by such \n     eligible institution. For purpose of this subparagraph, the \n     term ``S corporation'' has the same meaning as in section \n     1361(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (H) Repayment deadline.--The capital investment received by \n     an eligible institution under the Program shall be evidenced \n     by preferred stock or other financial instrument that--\n       (i) includes, as a term and condition, that the capital \n     investment will--\n\n       (I) be repaid not later than the end of the 10-year period \n     beginning on the date of the capital investment under the \n     Program; or\n       (II) at the end of such 10-year period, be subject to such \n     additional terms as the Secretary shall prescribe, which \n     shall include a requirement that the stock or instrument \n     shall carry the highest dividend or interest rate payable; \n     and\n\n       (ii) provides that the term and condition described under \n     clause (i) shall not apply if the application of that term \n     and condition would adversely affect the capital treatment of \n     the stock or financial instrument under current or successor \n     applicable capital provisions compared to a capital \n     instrument with identical terms other than the term and \n     condition described under clause (i).\n       (I) Requirements on financial instruments issued by a \n     community development financial institution loan fund.--Any \n     equity equivalent capital issued to the Treasury by a \n     community development loan fund receiving a capital \n     investment under the Program shall provide that the rate at \n     which interest is payable shall be 2 percent per annum for 8 \n     years.
