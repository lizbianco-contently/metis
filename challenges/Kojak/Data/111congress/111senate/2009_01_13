Mr. President, following leader remarks, there will be a \nperiod of morning business for up to 1 hour, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each. The majority will control the first 30 \nminutes, and the Republicans will control the final 30 minutes. \nFollowing morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. \n22, the wilderness bill. Yesterday, I filed cloture on the bill. The \ncloture vote is expected to occur an hour after the Senate convenes \ntomorrow. We will be in recess today from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. \nfor our weekly caucus luncheons. The filing deadline for first-degree \namendments is at 2:30 p.m. today.\n  Mr. President, I have had a discussion with Senator Bingaman this \nmorning. He is going to see if there is something that can be worked \nout to have a limited number of amendments on the wilderness bill. He \nwill proceed to work on that. If, in fact, he can work something out \nwith those interested on the other side, then we will have a number of \nvotes on that. If they cannot work that out, then, as has been \nindicated in the past, we will go to cloture tomorrow. If we can work \nsomething out there, we can have those votes today and final passage of \nthe bill this afternoon.\n  We are going to move to the Ledbetter issue dealing with pay equity, \nthe statute of limitations--call it whatever we wish. That is something \nwe will move to this week. The Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, is \nnow here with us, and there is a very strict deadline when we must \nfinish that. We must have a vote on that by this Sunday. So we have our \nwork cut out for us. We have a lot to do.\n  These are very exciting times, as we know, for our country. We have a \nnew Congress. We have a new President. Senator McConnell and I have \ndone our utmost during these past many weeks to try to work together to \nget some things done here. We are now at a point where we have \nresolved, we believe, the issue relating to how committees are funded \nand what the ratios are going to be on the various committees, and it \nis easy for me to say that or Senator McConnell to say that, but it has \ntaken weeks of work to get that done. But we are moving forward. We \nhope the work of this next week will be in keeping with how we intend \nto maintain a degree of bipartisanship in the Senate during this \nCongress. We hope that, in fact, is the case. We will do our utmost to \ncomply with that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/13/senate-section/article/S319-7", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a couple brief observations with \nreference to what the Democratic leader just indicated. I want to say I \nappreciate the way in which we are going forward here. When he and I \nfirst came to the Senate, the notion that you would pass bills without \namendment was foreign to everyone. I think we are getting off to a good \nstart here with a kind of reestablishment of the Senate as it used to \noperate with amendments\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\nbeing appropriate. As members of his party said when they were in the \nminority, the Senate is not the House. I think there is a growing \nappreciation on both sides of the aisle that we ought not to operate \nthat way.\n  With regard to the organizing resolution, I agree with the majority \nleader that we are very close to being ready to move forward on that. \nIt is a difficult process for the two of us, but I think we have gotten \nclose to being at a point of completion, which is, of course, essential \nto beginning our business.\n\n\n                                  TARP\n\n  Now, on another matter, Mr. President, a few months ago some of our \nNation's top economic minds came to the Capitol to tell us about an \nimpending crisis. The crisis, of course, was the accumulation of toxic \nassets at banks here and around the world that threatened to paralyze \nAmerica's economy, jeopardizing the livelihood of literally millions. \nWithout action, we were told, the Nation faced certain calamity.\n  For many, the normal impulse would be to let the bad actors who \ncaused this mess face up to their mistakes. But since millions of \nfamilies and small business owners, who did nothing wrong, were caught \nup in the errors of the few, we decided, with some degree of \nreluctance, to approve funding for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, \nnow commonly referred to as the TARP.\n  Fearful of waste and abuse, Republicans insisted on a number of \ntaxpayer protections. We also insisted on releasing the money in two \ninstallments so we could review how the first one was spent before \napproving the second. Yesterday, a request for the second installment \nwas made. I had an opportunity to talk to the incoming President about \nthat matter yesterday.\n  Throughout this ordeal, I have not wavered on one basic principle: I \nvoted for the first installment on the condition that it be used to \nprevent a systemic--a systemic--economic collapse affecting every \nsingle American. And I continue to believe this money should be used \nfor the reason it was first approved. The current administration, \nregretfully, used these funds for the auto industry, a move I opposed. \nNow congressional Democrats are suggesting more of the same. The \nAmerican people still do not have assurances that this money will not \nbe wasted or misused to play favorites.\n  So far, the incoming administration has not said whether it plans to \nlimit the funds to their original purpose or to expand their use to \nhelp specific industries. The taxpayers are eager to hear the new \nadministration's plan, and so are Republicans in Congress. We will hear \nfrom the incoming administration soon. We will be happy to listen. They \nwill have a receptive, albeit cautious, audience.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/13/senate-section/article/S320-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about the contest in \nMinnesota involving the Senate seat currently held by Senator Norm \nColeman. Obviously, the other new Members of the Senate were sworn in \nlast week, but this seat remains empty, a winner yet undeclared.\n  To be clear, under Minnesota law, that is the way it has to be right \nnow because there is an election contest that has been filed in the \ncourts, and under Minnesota law, therefore, neither the Secretary of \nState nor the Governor can declare the seat filled.\n  Senator Coleman had been declared the winner on election night and \nthrough the ensuing administrative canvassing process. But throughout \nthe following State Canvassing Board stage of the proceedings, there \nwere numerous inconsistencies and problems uncovered, and the board-\ncertified totals were different. They are, obviously, at issue, and \nthey are preliminary.\n  The Minnesota State Canvassing Board totals, for example, include \nmore votes than voters in a significant number of the Minnesota \nprecincts. So, clearly, there is something wrong, and it has to be \nresolved by the court.\n  The Coleman campaign has followed Minnesota election law in filing an \nelection contest, and that comes before a three-judge panel in \nMinnesota before the end of this month.\n  The contest is based on significant errors. I wish to mention four of \nthese categories so folks will understand what is at issue.\n  First is newly discovered ballots which appeared for the first time \nduring the recount and are included in the State Canvassing Board \ntotals.\n  Second is missing ballots supposedly tallied on election night but \nwhich could not be found during the recount process--obviously a \nproblem.\n  Third is double-counting of duplicate and original ballots of the \nsame voter during the recount process.\n  Fourth is wrongly rejected absentee ballots and inconsistent \nstandards regarding what constitutes a wrongly rejected absentee ballot \napplied in different locations throughout the State.\n  Let me discuss each of these briefly in turn.\n  On the newly discovered ballots, there are 171 such ballots that \nappeared without explanation several days after the election in Ramsey \nCounty precinct Maplewood P6. Election officials were unable to \nreconcile the number of votes cast with the number of voters signed in, \nbut the board, nevertheless, included the additional votes in Al \nFranken's favor in its totals. Furthermore, the board directed that \nthis issue should properly be dealt with during the contest phase, and \nthat, of course, is now occurring.\n  On the missing ballots, there were 133 ballots in Hennepin County \nthat could not be found during the recount and were declared \n``missing,'' despite the fact that there are any number of possible \nreasons for the change, including the possibility that the ballots \nnever existed in the first place. But instead of following a consistent \nstandard and including the new recount total, the board reverted to \nelection night totals, again resulting in more votes for Al Franken.\n  On the double-counting, in at least 25 precincts in Minnesota, there \nare more votes than voters in the Canvassing Board's totals, and there \nare 150 separate incident logs prepared by local recount officials \ndescribing issues involving duplicate and original ballot counting. \nThis is due to the counting of both the voter's original ballot and a \nduplicate ballot which was created to take the place of the original \nballot, resulting in double-counting of some votes when both of those \nballots are included in the total. That is, obviously a blatant error \nand one that threatens the sanctity of ``one person, one vote.'' \nObviously, most people get one vote. Those who got more than one vote \nhave an advantage for whom they cast their ballot.\n  Both the Canvassing Board and the Minnesota Supreme Court directed \nthe issue to be dealt with during the election contest. So that issue \nis now being dealt with.\n  Finally, on the category of wrongly rejected absentee ballots, during \nthe recount process, a ``fifth pile'' was created for absentee ballots \nthat were rejected but not because one of the four reasons stipulated \nby Minnesota election law. This fifth pile was requested\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\nby the Franken campaign at the time they were trailing in the count, \nand the Canvassing Board granted the request without issuing any \ndirection to ensure consistency among the counties in their review. A \nvast number of these ballots, which happened to generate more votes for \nFranken, were included in the Canvassing Board total. However, the \nboard also refused to review over 160 ballots requested by the Coleman \ncampaign.\n  We can see there are obviously some issues to be resolved. The three-\njudge panel will be appointed. The campaigns will convene with the \npanel, set forth the ground rules for the election contest trial, and \nthen that will occur.\n  There are no stipulations for when the proceedings must be completed, \nand estimations are, at least from folks in Minnesota, that it could \ntake a month, if not more.\n  As a part of that context, the Coleman campaign has requested the \nreview of hundreds more ballots that may have been wrongly rejected. \nBecause of the size of the pool of ballots to be reviewed and the \nerroneous recount totals including questionable votes for Franken, \nSenator Coleman has expressed confidence that the numbers will revert \nback to where they were on election night and his lead will be restored \nand then he would be declared the winner.\n  Obviously, this is for the Canvassing Board and the court in \nMinnesota to resolve. It is not for us to prejudge the result at this \ntime. Unfortunately, the majority leader and his staff have publicly \nstated they would try to seat Al Franken while the contest is still \nproceeding, despite the fact there is not a signed certificate, which \nis required of every Senator. This dates back to 1884. This action, of \ncourse, was blocked, and we presume the process will continue in \nregular order to await the result of the proceedings.\n  It is true Al Franken attempted to declare himself the winner. \nYesterday, the campaign requested the Governor and Secretary of State \nsend him a certificate so he could be seated. But it was, of course, \nnot granted because both officials indicated correctly that would \ndirectly violate State law.\n  So we are left with the matter of a vacancy in Minnesota, with the \nissue to be resolved by the people in Minnesota, properly under their \nlaw, the Canvassing Board, and the three-judge court. For my part, I \ncertainly hope this phase will not fall prey to inconsistencies and \nproblems that have led some experts and newspaper editorials to claim \nthe election process needs to be fundamentally reformed. If it is done \nin the proper way and due care for the evidence that is presented, then \nhopefully everyone will be satisfied with the result and willing to \nabide by that result. It will then come to the Senate, and we will seat \nthe appropriate candidate.\n  The Republicans ask for nothing more. We are certainly hopeful our \nformer colleague and soon-to-be current colleague, Senator Coleman, \nwill resume his seat. But that is for the process in Minnesota to \ndetermine, not for that to be determined in some arbitrary way in the \nSenate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is reserved for this side of \nthe aisle?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 7 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, my good \nfriend from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/13/senate-section/article/S321-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S321-S322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REPORT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we received a report from the \nDepartment of Justice's Office of the Inspector General and Office of \nProfessional Responsibility about their investigation of allegations of \npoliticized hiring and other improper personnel actions in the Civil \nRights Division.\n  I held hearings on this situation. At the time, there was a Mr. \nBradley Schlozman who testified. I stated, at the time, that I did not \nfind his testimony credible.\n  Today's report confirms some of our worst fears about the Bush \nadministration's political corruption of the Justice Department. Not \nonly did senior Republican appointees violate Federal law by hiring \nbased on politics in the Civil Rights Division, they also lied about \nit. Indeed, they lied about it under oath when they were called to \nexplain themselves to Congress.\n  I am particularly disturbed about the findings that a senior Justice \nDepartment appointee, a very senior Justice Department appointee, \nBradley Schlozman, made false statements under oath when appearing \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee. Lying to Congress undermines the \nvery core of our constitutional principles and blunts the American \npeople's right to open and transparent Government. It is one thing to \nhave a witness come and say they disagree with the Members of Congress. \nThat is fine. Everybody has a constitutional right to do that. Nobody \nhas a right to lie under oath. Nobody has the right to break the law. \nAnd certainly a senior member of the Justice Department should not be \nable to consider himself above the law.\n  Not only did Mr. Schlozman lie to me and the Committee, but he then \nrefused to cooperate with the Justice Department's own internal \noversight offices' investigation into illegal hiring practices in the \nDepartment's Civil Rights Division. The clear determination that he \nbroke the law corrodes our trust in our system of justice and in the \nNation's top law enforcement agency. If somebody can break the law in \nour Nation's top law enforcement agency, the Department of Justice, \nwhat does that say to the rest of Americans? His actions, in fact, \nundermine the very mission of the Department's Civil Rights Division, \nwhich is charged with enforcing Federal law and prohibiting \ndiscrimination.\n  A strong and independent Civil Rights Division has long been crucial \nto the enforcement of our precious civil rights laws, and experienced \nand committed career attorneys have always been the heart and soul of \nthat Division. In the past, the people who worked there, no matter how \nmuch time you spent with them, you wouldn't know if they were \nRepublicans or Democrats. All you would know is that these folks, who \nare among the brightest and best lawyers in the country, are dedicated \nto serving the United States of America and upholding our laws.\n  Contrary to those traditions, however, which we have had in both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations, this report details \ntroubling revelations of political appointees who marginalize and force \nout career lawyers because of ideology, and, corrupt the hiring process \nfor career positions. It should come as no surprise that the result, \nand of course the intent, of this political makeover of the Civil \nRights Division has been a dismal--a dismal--civil rights enforcement \nrecord.\n  This report is just one of the final chapters in the regrettable \nlegacy of the Bush administration at main Justice, and it reinforces \nthe need for new leadership.\n  Now, more than ever, it is necessary to confirm new leadership at the \nJustice Department, starting with Attorney General-designee Eric \nHolder.\n  I compliment the Department's Office of Inspector General. They did \nnot allow politics to stand in their way. They went and investigated \nthis situation.\n  I do wish the current U.S. Attorney's Office, appointed by this \nadministration, had decided to prosecute someone for these deplorable \nacts. I think the only way you stop such blatant criminal violations, \nespecially by people who know better, people who are sworn to uphold \nthe law, is that they know they will go to jail for breaking the law. \nThat is what should have been done. They broke the law in the Bush \nadministration, and the Bush administration decided not to prosecute, \nand I think that raises real questions. Prosecution should be done no \nmatter who breaks the law.\n  I recall one of the people who testified in that same investigation \nwho said: We swear an oath to President George Bush. I said: No, you \nswear an oath to uphold the Constitution. Mr. President, that \nConstitution is the Constitution you are sworn to uphold and I am sworn \nto uphold. It is a Constitution that reflects all Americans. The \nGovernment is not of a person; indeed, whether you support an \nindividual or not, the Government is for all Americans. The \nConstitution is for all Americans. When somebody deliberately, \npurposely, sets out to subvert the Constitution of the United States\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\nand then lies about it--lies about it, Mr. President--I find that a \nheinous crime.\n\n  When we see some child who steals a car, they will be prosecuted, as \nprobably they should. But when you have a key member of the Department \nof Justice who lies under oath, who subverts the Constitution of the \nUnited States, that is all the more reason to prosecute that person. \nWhat Mr. Schlozman did was reprehensible, it was disgusting, and it was \nwrong, but it also contradicts the very core of America's principles.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer, like me, had the great \nopportunity to serve as a prosecutor, and I have every reason to \nbelieve he did not show fear or favor when he brought a prosecution, as \nI did not. I did not show fear or favor. Most prosecutors do not. Yet \nhere we have somebody who is part of the Justice Department lie under \noath and do it in a way to cover up and subvert the very laws that \nprotect all of us. Our civil rights laws are on the books to protect \nall of us. It protects all of us--White, Black, brown--no matter what \nour race, our creed. It protects all of us.\n  What has marked this country since the time I was a young lawyer in \nthe 1960s has been our adherence to those civil rights laws.

Mr. President, yesterday, President Bush announced that \nhe was sending to Congress formal notice regarding use of the second \nhalf of TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. As you know, under \nthat legislation, which Congress passed over my objection last year, \nonce $350 billion of the fund--half of the fund--is spent, and the \nadministration wants to begin spending the second half of the fund--the \nsecond $350 billion--the President has to formally notify Congress. \nUnder the program, Congress has the opportunity to basically veto \nmoving forward by affirmatively having to pass a resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  Again, President Bush took that first step of formally notifying \nCongress yesterday and today.\n  I come to the Senate floor to announce that I am introducing a motion \nof disapproval, and I encourage my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to think very seriously about this matter and to join me \nin this motion of disapproval. In doing so, I am immediately joined by \nseveral colleagues, and I want to thank Senators Bunning, Sessions, \nDeMint, Barrasso, and Inhofe for being original cosponsors with me of \nthe resolution of disapproval.\n  When we debated this very important matter on this floor several \nmonths ago, I expressed serious concerns. I will not go through my \ncomments then or my concerns, but unfortunately, sadly, many of them--\nvirtually all--have been proven true. The history of this program--the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program--has indeed been very troubled, very \nconcerning, and it raises far more questions and hesitations than it \nprovides answers for our ailing economy. So as we revisit this issue, I \ncannot support moving forward with this very troubled program, \nprimarily for five reasons.\n  First among those reasons is the most fundamental test we should \nbring to the matter: Has the program worked? I think it is very clear \nit has not worked. The purpose of the program was to ease the credit \ncrisis. The entire focus of the program was to get credit on the \nstreets of the American economy, to provide reasonable credit to \nconsumers and businesses. Yet our economy is still gripped by a real \ncredit crunch. So that fundamental purpose of the program, that \nfundamental test of the program has simply not been met.\n  Now, Mr. President, in this new year, and under the new \nadministration, we are going to debate and act on other measures, \nparticularly the stimulus plan, a stimulus plan which will spend \nupwards of $1 trillion that President-elect Obama has talked about and \nbegun to outline. Certainly, we must act on the economy. Certainly, we \nare in a very serious recession. Almost certainly, it is the most \nserious, the worst since World War II, and, certainly, the Federal \nGovernment needs to help lead the way, to be a big part of the solution \nto get us out of this deep financial recession. But as we move to a $1 \ntrillion stimulus program, why are we going to simply continue with a \nprogram that hasn't worked, spending another $350 billion? Again, as we \nmount trillions of dollars of new deficit spending, deficits upon \ndeficits, debt upon debt, surely we should think long and hard about \ncontinuing another $350 billion of spending in a very troubled program \nwhich has not begun to meet its fundamental goal.\n  The second reason I would suggest we should not continue down this \npath is that the entire program, as it was outlined to Congress, as it \nwas explained to us by the Treasury Secretary and others, has never \nbeen implemented. It was thrown out the window even before it could \nbegin to be implemented. As all of us remember, just a few months ago, \nwhen the Treasury Secretary proposed this idea before Congress, it was \nindeed supposed to be the Troubled Asset Relief Program under which the \nGovernment would buy troubled assets from a spectrum of financial \ninstitutions, get those assets off the books of the financial \ninstitutions, and make those institutions far healthier and far more \nable to extend credit to individuals and businesses across America.\n  That was the beginning, that was the middle, and that was the end of \nthe program. That was what every explanation, every presentation was \nabout as the Treasury Secretary, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, \nand others came to Capitol Hill to explain this program over several \nweeks. It wasn't part of the program, it was the entire program. Yet \nwithin a couple of weeks of Congress passing the Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram--again, over my objection--that plan was completely thrown out \nthe window. Congress acts to pass a $700 billion spending program, \nforging completely new ground in terms of economic policy and the \nGovernment's intervention in the market, and within a few weeks of that \naction, plan A is completely out the window and the Treasury Secretary \nsets about forming plan B and doing something fundamentally different \nthan was presented to Congress.\n\n  I have suggested over the last several weeks, along with my \ncolleagues, that alone should make the administration come back to \nCongress and get reauthorization for what is a completely new program. \nThat, again, is my second reason we should not continue the TARP and \ncontinue going down this path and spending the second $350 billion of \nthis program.\n  The third reason I would offer is closely related to the second. As I \nsaid, within 2 weeks of Congress passing this legislation, the whole \nprogram changed. The entire concept of buying troubled assets was out \nthe window, and Treasury had a brandnew plan, which was never presented \nto Congress and never discussed in any level of detail. So what has \nhappened is, the TARP has become a veritable slush fund for the \nadministration to do whatever it wants with it, to use it in whatever \nway it wants. After throwing the TARP idea out the window, Treasury \ncame up with a capital purchase program to purchase preferred stock and \nwarrants of certain institutions. It also established a systematically \nsignificant failing institution program, allowing Treasury to invest in \nany financial instrument, including debt, equity, or warrants \ndetermined to be troubled assets. Now Treasury says it ``continues to \nexplore other programs, including those focused on insurance, \nforeclosure\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\nmitigation, consumer lending, and more.''\n  This program has no definition, it has no limits, it is whatever \nTreasury and the administration want it to be. It is a wide open slush \nfund for whatever the perceived need or want is of the moment. Of \ncourse, the best example of that is use of funds from this program for \nthe auto bailout. After explaining for weeks that this program was not \ndesigned to do anything like the auto bailout, and use of these funds \nin an auto bailout would be completely inappropriate, the Bush \nadministration then proceeded to use some of this money on the auto \nbailout. It is wide open. It has no limits. It has become a slush fund \nfor whatever the administration believes it has to do at the moment. \nThat is not a proper way to move forward in terms of remedying the \neconomy.\n  Fourth, we should end this program, and we should pass my resolution \nof disapproval because there has been no accountability whatsoever on \nthis program. Remember, we spent a lot of time debating accountability \nmonths ago when this matter was before the Senate and before the House. \nThere were all sorts of promises about accountability. There were all \nsorts of protections put in the bill regarding accountability. Yet what \nhas that produced? That has produced the biggest embarrassment in terms \nof a lack of accountability, at least since Hurricane Katrina, and that \nis saying a lot.\n  The GAO and other watchdog groups report that the Treasury \nDepartment--the Treasury Department in charge of this fund--cannot even \ntell us precisely how the first $350 billion has been spent. Treasury \ndoesn't know, much less the watchdogs of other protections Congress was \nsupposed to have put in place.\n  Now, we hear all sorts of promises and commitments from congressional \nleaders and leaders of the Obama transition that this is all going to \nchange: There is going to be real transparency, there is going to be \nreal accountability, and we are going to know where every penny goes. I \ndon't doubt for a minute the goodwill and the honesty of those \npronouncements. I am sure the congressional leaders and folks in the \nObama transition who say these things mean it and want it. The problem \nis, I think folks were equally as sincere a few months ago, and it \nproduced absolutely nothing in terms of transparency and accountability \nand protection of taxpayers' hard-earned tax dollars.\n  Surely we should demand more than another round of promises. Surely \nat a minimum we need to see exactly what the plans for the second half \nof TARP are before we decide this matter. Surely we need to see the \ndetails of any new accountability program. Yet we have seen none of \nthat. Yet we are scheduled, in the Senate, to vote on this resolution \nwithin days without having any ability to see those plans, to see those \nprotections, to see those new accountability measures before the vote. \nWe cannot accept that. We must pass a motion of disapproval and only \nconsider continuing this type of program if it is represented to \nCongress with those protections, with those detailed plans.\n  Finally, my fifth and final reason for urging all of my colleagues to \njoin me in this resolution of disapproval is that, at its very core, \nTARP is a dangerous, heightened intervention of the Government in the \nprivate sector.\n  Let me restate what I said a few minutes ago. We are in the midst of \na horrible recession, which is still getting worse. It is almost \ncertainly the worst recession since World War II. Clearly, the Federal \nGovernment needs to play a leadership role in helping the country and \nthe economy turn the corner. I do not doubt that for a minute. But the \nsort of intervention of TARP and actions in the Treasury Department \nover the last several months are fundamentally different from any other \neconomic policy actions we take here at the Federal level. It is \npicking winners and losers. It is getting involved, not in the \ndirection of the economy but in individual companies, in individual \npotential bankruptcies, in individual mergers and deals and \nacquisitions. That is a level and type of intervention that is \nfundamentally different from broad fiscal policy, from broad monetary \npolicy. It really is moving the line significantly in terms of \nGovernment intervention in the private sector.\n  Going back to our original debate here in the Senate, that was one of \nmy most fundamental reservations from the beginning with TARP, that \ntype of detailed intervention--and, by the way, the invitation for \nmalfeasance and corruption that it can bring when Government \nbureaucrats are making very important life-or-death economic decisions \nregarding individual firms and individual transactions. I do not think \nwe should continue down that path. I think that path is riddled, \nlittered with mistakes and troubling actions by the Federal Government \npicking winners and losers, getting involved in individual companies in \na very direct way--individual transactions, putting the hand of the \nGovernment in the boardroom in that sort of really unprecedented way.\n  I urge all of our colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to think \ncarefully about this issue. We had a significant debate when this first \ncame to Congress several months ago, and we had several votes on the \nmatter. Obviously, eventually it passed without my support. But since \nthen, we have seen a lot, we have learned a lot, and a lot has changed. \nSince then, virtually all of the arguments against the program have \nbeen borne out and new concerns and new questions have arisen. They go \nto my five points. The program has not eased credit on the street. The \nentire premise of the program was thrown out 2 weeks after Congress \npassed it. No. 3, it has become a catchall slush fund and the purpose \nand parameters of the program change week to week. No. 4, there has \nbeen no accountability; Treasury cannot even tell us today precisely \nhow the first $350 billion was spent. No. 5, at its core this program \nis about Government intervention in a way we have not seen before, \npicking winners and losers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in this resolution of disapproval so we \ncan start anew, so we can put new protections in place, so we can act \non the economy but not simply continue down this path and spend another \n$350 billion, adding deficit on deficit, debt on debt, without a clear, \npositive result for American families.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I am honored to serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee in this body. The last couple of years have been very \ndifficult years in how the Department of Justice has been managed. We \nhave seen abuses of civil liberties in the name of trying to protect \nthe rights of our citizens when we have abused the rights of our \ncitizens; we found the Department of Justice tried to justify the use \nof torture in this country; the manner in which detainees were treated; \nthe politicizing of the Department of Justice--I could go on and on.\n  I thank Eric Holder for being willing to serve the public once again \nas President-elect Obama's nominee for the office of Attorney General \nof the United States. I think Eric Holder is the right person at the \nright time for the Department of Justice, and I hope his confirmation \nprocess will move forward.\n\n  We need an independent Attorney General. During the Bush \nadministration, we found that they politicized the Department of \nJustice in the firing of U.S. attorneys and in decisions as to\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\nwhether to proceed with criminal investigations. The list goes on and \non. Eric Holder has demonstrated throughout his entire career the type \nof independence we need in the next Attorney General of the United \nStates.\n  Let me give you one example. When the Independent Counsel who was \ninvestigating the President of the United States asked for additional \nauthority, Eric Holder was the one who made that recommendation to \nproceed even though it was not popular at all with the President of the \nUnited States. It is that type of independence that we need in the next \nAttorney General of the United States. He brings broad experience as \nformer judge, former U.S. attorney, and from the private sector.\n  We need to take politics out of the Department of Justice. During the \nBush administration, we found that politics was very much interwoven \ninto the personnel decisions made within the Department of Justice \naffecting career attorneys. That was not permitted, but it was done. We \nneed the next Attorney General to be one who will make sure politics \nhas no place in those types of personnel decisions.\n  Again, Eric Holder's career has shown his willingness to carry out \nhis responsibilities in a nonpolitical way. He has handled major public \ncorruption cases as a U.S. attorney against both Democrats and \nRepublicans. He understands the responsibilities of the Department of \nJustice.\n  We need our next Attorney General to reestablish the premier role of \nthe Department of Justice in the Civil Rights Division. The Civil \nRights Division historically has been the key agency to protect the \ncivil rights of the people of this Nation. We need the next Attorney \nGeneral to reestablish that in the Department of Justice. Once again, \nEric Holder has demonstrated that sensitivity that will restore the \nrole of the Department of Justice in protecting the voting rights of \nall Americans.\n  The list goes on and on and on. Bottom line, the next Attorney \nGeneral must restore the reputation of the Department of Justice. I \nbelieve he is the right person, but it is not only me. Let me read from \nsome of the record that has been presented to the Judiciary Committee.\n  Both law enforcement and civil rights groups support Eric Holder. The \nFraternal Order of Police writes that:\n\n       Our members reported that they found Judge Holder and U.S. \n     Attorney Holder an able and aggressive prosecutor.\n\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, which is a group of our \nmajor civil rights advocates in this country said:\n\n       Mr. Holder's various experience as a trial attorney, judge, \n     prosecutor and lawyer in private practice make him uniquely \n     qualified to run the Department of Justice. It would be \n     difficult to find a candidate more experienced in the \n     Department or better suited to lead it. His background will \n     render him ready to lead the Department from day one. His \n     even-mindedness and sound judgment will ensure that justice \n     is dispensed fairly and equitably. His professional \n     accomplishments and ability to put partisan politics aside \n     make him above reproach. His commitment to the rule of law \n     makes him the ideal candidate for the nation's top \n     prosecutor.\n\n  Now, that is the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, which, again, \nis comprised of the premier groups in this country that are out there \nfighting for the rights of the people of this country.\n  I would also draw my colleagues' attention to a January 7, 2009, \nletter received by the Judiciary Committee from several former high-\nlevel Department of Justice officials in the Republican administration. \nThey write:\n\n       We are pleased to be able to write in support of Eric \n     Holder, a man who stands with the most qualified who have \n     been privileged to be nominated to be Attorney General of the \n     United States. President-elect Obama's nomination of Eric as \n     the historic appointment of the first African-American \n     Attorney General should be hailed as a milestone. He is an \n     extraordinary lawyer and an even better person.\n\n  We need to move forward immediately in the leadership in the \nDepartment of Justice. I would urge my colleagues, let us move forward \non the confirmation process as quickly as possible. I look forward to \nEric Holder being the next Attorney General of the United States. I \nhope we will do that very shortly.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse.)

I support the United Nations Security Council \nresolution calling for an immediate and durable cease-fire. In my view, \nboth the Israeli airstrikes and the Palestinian rocket attacks must \nstop immediately, and Israeli ground forces should withdraw from Gaza. \nI regret that President Bush chose to have the United States be the \nonly Security Council member not to support this U.N. resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the U.N. resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Last week, the Senate responded to the hostilities by \npassing S. Res. 10, a resolution that I do not support. While I agree \nwith some parts of the resolution, I believe it left out important \nprovisions. The resolution called for Hamas to end the rocket and \nmortar attacks but it did not call on Israel to stop its airstrikes and \nground assault. Nor did the resolution call on Israel to withdraw from \nGaza. Moreover, I believe the resolution downplayed the humanitarian \nsituation in Gaza. Thousands of people in Gaza do not have access to \nfood, clean water, or medical care. The U.K. Foreign Minister, David \nMiliband, speaking about humanitarian conditions in Gaza said, ``the \nword `crisis', which is sometimes overused, is wholly appropriate'' to \ndescribe how bad things are. He made that statement to describe how bad \nhe saw that things are at this time.\n  I support Israel's right to defend itself. Israel has no stronger \nally than the United States, and we have no better friend in the region \nthan Israel. But friends can make mistakes.\n  The rocket attacks that Israel has suffered are unacceptable. But I \nbelieve Israel's use of force has been excessive and I do not believe \nit will help Israel achieve its long-term goals. Instead of weakening \nHamas, the incursion is boosting support for Hamas both among \nPalestinians and the Arabic world and it is undermining support for \nmoderates in the region. Instead of making Israel's enemies fear its \nmilitary power, I believe this conflict shows its enemies that they can \ntaunt Israel into reacting so strongly that it undermines its \ninternational support. Instead of rebutting the accusations that Israel \nhas ignored the long-deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the growing \ndeath toll and worsening living conditions will fuel similar \naccusations long into the future.\n  This violence is but another chapter of violence in the long history \nof the Middle East. What is needed is an international effort to broker \nan immediate truce and to build that into a lasting peace.\n  A lasting peace requires a two-state solution. It is hard to see how \nsuch an agreement can be achieved without the deep involvement and \nleadership of the United States. I have been disappointed that the Bush \nadministration has failed to lead the peace process for the past 8 \nyears. President Obama should not repeat that mistake after he takes \noffice next week. He should appoint a special envoy to the region soon \nafter his Secretary of State is confirmed by the Senate. President \nObama should commit his administration to a steady and persistent \neffort to engage both Israelis and Palestinians in finding a political \nsolution to the conflict that has long plagued this region.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         Resolution 1860 (2009)\n\n  Adopted by the Security Council at its 6063rd meeting, on 8 January \n                                  2009\n\n       The Security Council, \n       Recalling all of its relevant resolutions, including \n     resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002), 1515 (2003) \n     and 1850 (2008),\n       Stressing that the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part \n     of the territory occupied in 1967 and will be a part of the \n     Palestinian state,\n       Emphasizing the importance of the safety and well-being of \n     all civilians,\n       Expressing grave concern at the escalation of violence and \n     the deterioration of the situation, in particular the \n     resulting heavy civilian casualties since the refusal to \n     extend the period of calm; and emphasizing that the \n     Palestinian and Israeli civilian populations must be \n     protected,\n       Expressing grave concern also at the deepening humanitarian \n     crisis in Gaza,\n       Emphasizing the need to ensure sustained and regular flow \n     of goods and people through the Gaza crossings,\n       Recognizing the vital role played by UNRWA in providing \n     humanitarian and economic assistance within Gaza,\n       Recalling that a lasting solution to the Israeli-\n     Palestinian conflict can only be achieved by peaceful means,\n       Reaffirming the right of all States in the region to live \n     in peace within secure and internationally recognized \n     borders,\n       1.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n               Tribute to Navy Secretary Donald C. Winter\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, today it gives me great pleasure to \npay tribute to an outstanding leader and tremendous public servant, \nNavy Secretary Donald C. Winter.\n  When Donald Winter was sworn in as Secretary of the Navy on January \n3, 2006, he was charged with training, equipping, and organizing our \nsailors and marines in a time of war. He assumed these responsibilities \nat a time when the U.S. Navy was in the midst of an ambitious \nmodernization program across the board. A new class of destroyers, \naircraft carriers, submarines, cruisers, and others was in the \nproduction pipeline. It would take an extraordinarily talented, \nknowledgeable, and energetic leader to navigate the Department of the \nNavy through these transitions. We were fortunate to find such a person \nin Donald Winter. He was that kind of a leader. He immediately outlined \nhis priorities and then set to work on implementing them: Prosecute the \nglobal war on terror; build the future fleet; take care of our wounded \nand their families. Those were his priorities, and each day he drove \nthe Department to focus on these areas.\n  With 25,000 marines and 36,000 sailors in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere in the Central Command's area of responsibility, the Navy and \nMarine Corps have been playing a critical role in fighting this war. \nFrom providing maritime security in the Northern Arabian Gulf, to \nturning around a seemingly hopeless situation in al-Anbar Province, to \nproviding individual augmentees on the ground in Iraq, our sailors and \nmarines have been on the front lines and have been performing superbly. \nThese sailors and marines have always been foremost in Secretary \nWinter's mind, and they are the ones he has worked tirelessly to \nsupport in every way possible on Capitol Hill, within the Pentagon, and \nthroughout the Department of the Navy.\n  While supporting our brave warriors in harm's way, Secretary Winter \nalso focused on building the future fleet by instituting the most far-\nreaching acquisition reforms in decades.\n  I had the pleasure of traveling with Secretary Winter to Guantanamo \nBay in Cuba in May 2007. It was my second time returning to this island \nsince my arrival here in 1962. What I saw was the tremendous leadership \nability he possesses and his firm commitment to the men and women of \nthe U.S. Navy.\n\n[[Page S326]]\n\n  I would also commend Secretary Winter for his tireless efforts to \nensure that our Nation is doing everything in our power to take care of \nour wounded. Secretary Winter has been an outspoken and relentless \nadvocate for our wounded warriors, insisting on the highest possible \nstandards for every sailor and every marine.\n  So on behalf of the men and women serving under him in my home State \nof Florida, I salute Secretary Winter for his superior performance in \nleading the Navy and Marine Corps over the past 3 years. We wish him \nGodspeed in his future endeavors, and we thank him for his service to \nour Nation.\n\n\n                          situation in israel\n\n  Mr. President, the first and most sacred duty of any government is \nproviding for the safety and security of its citizens.\n  Hamas's repeated rocket attacks on the Israeli people created a \nsituation that required an Israeli response.\n  I was pleased to join my colleagues in cosponsoring S. Res. 10, which \nrecognizes Israel's right to defend itself against attacks from Gaza.\n  While diplomacy is always a preferable alternative, at some point any \nlegitimate government must take the necessary actions to safeguard its \npeople from acts of terrorism against an unarmed civilian population.\n  With more than 6,000 rocket attacks launched into Israel from Gaza, \nthe Israeli government acted reasonably in an effort to end the attacks \nagainst civilian targets.\n  These attacks are Hamas' latest attempts to advance their cruel and \nmurderous agenda.\n  Hamas first began as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, a \nterrorist group responsible for the assassination of Egypt's President \nAnwar Sadat.\n  As you might recall, Sadat was the first Arab President willing to \nmake peace with Israel.\n  Hamas has since claimed the lives of countless others throughout the \nregion.\n  In 2002, a Hamas suicide bomber killed five Americans and four \nIsraelis who were eating lunch in the cafeteria at Hebrew University in \nJerusalem. The bomb was smuggled in a backpack loaded with shrapnel, \nwhich maximized damage to the cafeteria and inflicted severe injuries \non more than 80 students.\n  Since coming to power politically in 2006, the terrorist organization \nhas hijacked the Palestinian people's agenda.\n  They have cynically used their own people as civilian shields and \nbrought harm to those who do not share their radical views. During the \nJune 2007 coup in Gaza, Hamas operatives killed a cook of Palestinian \nNational Authority President Mahmoud Abbas by throwing him from the \nroof of a 15-story building with his hands and feet tied. In the \ncurrent conflict, they have fired rockets at their own people. On \nDecember 26, two Palestinian girls aged 5 and 13 were killed when a \nrocket fell short of reaching an Israeli target.\n  Hamas openly admits it uses women and children as human shields. One \nHamas leader described this appalling practice by saying, ``For the \nPalestinian people, death has become an industry. . . . This is why \nthey have formed human shields of the women, the children, [and] the \nelderly.''\n  Instead of investing in their own people's well-being, in roads, \nschools, and hospitals, they have instead invested in the cache of \nweapons they are using to cause death and destruction in Israel.\n  As a result, Palestinians are suffering. They have limited access to \nbasic needs such as food and medicine. Their free speech has been \nsuppressed through violence. And their right to freely practice \nreligion has been replaced by a strong-armed enforcement of a radical \nbrand of Islam.\n  The largest beneficiary of Hamas's weapons purchases has been Iran, \nwhich has aided Hamas by training terrorists and offering advice in \nmaking deadly explosives and long-range rockets. Throughout the \nconflict, Hamas has turned into a Hezbollah-like Iranian proxy by \nthreatening Israel from the south. Iran's willingness to embolden \nterrorist organizations like Hamas poses a serious threat not only to \nIsrael, but also the United States.\n  While Iran's influence has been plainly apparent across the Middle \nEast, they have surreptitiously worked to advance their anti-American \nagenda in our own hemisphere. In recent years, Iran has aggressively \nincreased its Latin American presence by working with the leaders who \nhave found a commonality in the Iranian President's radical ways.\n  Iran and the regimes of nations like Venezuela and Cuba may not share \na common border, but they share an anti-American agenda that poses a \ntremendous risk to our Nation's security.\n  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad first visited Venezuela in 2006 \nand has since returned to visit the leaders of Cuba, Nicaragua, and \nBolivia. He has also hosted Latin American leaders in Tehran.\n  As a result of these meetings, Iran has entered into several economic \nand political agreements, including plans to finance new progovernment \ntelevision and radio stations in Bolivia and countries throughout the \nregion. These agreements help to fan the flames of anti-Americanism, \nwhich persists throughout the region.\n  The government of Argentina recently revealed they received $1 \nmillion from the Cuban regime to pay for anti-American protests during \nPresident Bush's visit there in 2005. Cuban families could have used \nthat money for food, but instead it was wasted on furthering the \nregime's anti-American agenda.\n  What has been lost on these Latin American leaders is the larger \nconflict at hand.\n  Iran is heavily invested in a conflict that has claimed the lives of \ncountless innocent civilians, and they will stop at no cost, continuing \nto aid in the destruction of American allies.\n  For our Nation, the next few weeks will be historic, but critical.\n  I am anxious to hear about President-elect Obama's plan to address \nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and I am hopeful his administration \nwill continue to reaffirm the U.S.'s historic commitment to the people \nof Israel.\n  I am also hopeful the administration will continue efforts to \npersuade Syria to stop yielding to Iran's devious demands. Syria must \nunderstand that Iran's interests do not serve the interests of the \npeople of the Middle East.\n  Egypt has taken significant measures in trying to stop Hamas's \nsmuggling of weapons and militants from Egypt into Gaza, but they must \ndo more.\n  One proposal I support deploys an international force of military \nengineers to monitor and destroy the tunnels along the Egyptian border \nnear Gaza.\n  I would also encourage the new administration to continue working \nvigorously with the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations on \nthe U.N.-sanctioned ``Annapolis Process'' to achieve a final status \nagreement between Arabs and Israelis that includes a viable, democratic \nPalestinian state living in peace with Israel and its neighbors.\n  And finally, I hope to see further progress in our efforts to train \nthe Palestinian Presidential Guard led by U.S. General Keith Dayton.\n  Although the recent outbreak of violence in Israel is troubling, I am \nhopeful a new cease-fire agreement can be reached very soon.\n  A true cease-fire with Hamas should include a guarantee for no more \nrockets and safeguards against rearming.\n  Both sides will soon realize that further loss of innocent life is \ntoo great a cost, and peace and security is the only viable way \nforward.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee and the new administration to find a way forward in Israel \nand ensure a plan for peace in the future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Guantanamo Bay Detainees\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to speak today about a topic \nthat is in the news, is important, and has to do with an area of \nLeavenworth, KS, very near the Presiding Officer's State, and in my \nhome State, about the issue of the Guantanamo Bay detainees.\n\n[[Page S327]]\n\n  My simple point on this issue is, there is a very strong push--and I \nunderstand that push, and it is one that has been going on for some \nperiod of time--to close Guantanamo Bay. I would simply make the point \nwe should not attempt to force-fit detainees where they do not belong \nand where it does not fit. I do not believe the new administration can \nlook my constituents in the eye and say to them they are going to be \nsafe with detainees at Fort Leavenworth as they are with military \nprisoners at Fort Leavenworth, and particularly not with what we are \ntalking about from Guantanamo Bay.\n  I have invited President-elect Obama and his team to come to \nLeavenworth to look at this facility, to see if this is something that \ncould fit and work. I do not believe it does at all. But I have invited \nthem there to come and to look and to make their own assessment.\n  I further call on the incoming administration to conduct a thorough \nstudy--a thorough study--of all possible locations where detainees \ncould be transferred. The study must seriously assess the legal and \nsecurity requirements for detainees, as well as the impact on the areas \nsurrounding a proposed detainee location.\n  In the end, I believe the detainees will probably need to go to one \nof three types of places: overseas, either in the custody of foreign \nnations or at U.S. military facilities abroad set up for these types of \ndetainees we have at Guantanamo Bay or on military land or at \nfacilities previously closed or scheduled to be closed under the BRAC \nprocess, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, or into a new \nfacility specifically designed for these detainees.\n  The administration is projecting they are going to sign an order \nright off when coming into office that is going to close Guantanamo \nBay. I am asking them, in looking at my State, in looking at the \nDisciplinary Barracks at Leavenworth, that they consider the nature of \nthe facility, the nature of the detainee, and make a careful assessment \nas to whether this fits in this situation.\n  Let me describe for you a little bit the situation of the \nDisciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, KS. Fort Leavenworth is a \nsmall facility. It is roughly 8 miles by 8 miles. It is a primary \nmission facility for education in the military. It is the Command and \nGeneral Staff College for the military, for the Army. They do an \noutstanding job of that. They do an outstanding job not only for the \nU.S. military--particularly for the Army--they have all branches of the \nservices that come there to be trained, but they also have, at any one \ntime, students from 90 different countries at this facility.\n\n  I recently spoke at a graduation exercise there with a number of \nstudents who were coming out of a program, and the President of Uganda \nwas there because his son was graduating from this program. One of the \nkey problems with relocating the detainees from Guantanamo Bay to Fort \nLeavenworth is that a number of Islamic countries will not send \nstudents now to Fort Leavenworth if detainees are being held there who \nthey don't believe should be detained in the first place. Then you \nstart to break these military-to-military ties that have been so \nimportant for us to be able to work in concert with--places such as \nSaudi Arabia or Kuwait or the good work we have been able to do in some \ncases back and forth in Pakistan, although not nearly enough. We need \nto do a lot more--and better. But if you break that tie, where you are \ntraining these military officers side by side and then building \nrelationships that work back and forth and then you start moving \ntoward: Well, the Saudis aren't going to send anybody to the Command \nand General Staff College in the United States because detainees who \nthey believe in their countries shouldn't be held are being held in the \nsame facility that is an 8-square-mile facility. Then the Kuwaitis \ndon't do it and the Pakistanis don't do it and you start breaking these \ntypes of ties.\n  The major purpose of Fort Leavenworth is education, not discipline. \nThen there is the problem with the nature of the Disciplinary Barracks \nitself. It is primarily a medium disciplinary facility at Fort \nLeavenworth, not maximum. We do not have the space to be able to \ncontain all the detainees from Guantanamo Bay. We don't even have \nenough space to contain what would be referred to as the worst of the \nworst from the Guantanamo Bay facility at the Disciplinary Barracks at \nFort Leavenworth. Plus, it is against the law to mix a U.S. military \npopulation, where we have had people from the U.S. military who have \ncommitted a crime and they are being held at the Disciplinary \nBarracks--you cannot mix that population under law with a population of \nforeign detainees. That is against the law. It is against conventions \nwe have entered into. So there is that legal hurdle that is there as \nwell.\n  Now let me further describe the facility. It has a major railroad \nthat runs through it. It has a train coming through on a regular basis \n10 to 15 times a day. The security concern that raises of moving \ndetainees from Guantanamo Bay--very high visibility--to the middle of \nthe country but a place where people could try to spring them, are they \ngoing to use the railroad track? Are they going to try to bomb or put \nbombs in the railroad coming through? It is a real problem. We don't \nhave an exterior fence. We have the Missouri River, but that is fairly \nnavigable to be able to move across for a terrorist population or \nsomebody who is trying to get into the perimeter of the facility to \nmake it through. So we are not set up that way. It is within a major \nurban area of Kansas City. Kansas City straddles both the Kansas and \nthe Missouri side. Leavenworth is on the edge of that, on the northern \nedge of that Kansas City complex. So you are moving the detainees from \nGuantanamo Bay in a confined facility away from major urban areas and \nright into a major urban area in the United States. That doesn't make \nmuch sense. It is going to be very difficult to do. It is going to be \nimpossible to do. And then to look my constituents in the eye and look \nthe constituents of the Presiding Officer in the eye and say: You are \ngoing to be as safe as if you have military detainees.\n  We are used to handling the prison population at Leavenworth. We have \na multiple set of facilities. We have a Federal penitentiary, we have a \nState penitentiary, we have a private penitentiary, and we have a \nmilitary penitentiary. The community is very well adapted to be able to \nhandle prison populations. It does it very well. But the community does \nnot want this population because they say we are not set up to be able \nto handle this population. I think this is a community that does not \nsay not in my back yard because they have been willing to take \nprisoners for some period of time. They are just saying they are not \nset up for this prison population in our back yard. We can't handle \nthis.\n  For all these reasons, I would urge the administration--the incoming \nObama administration--to take a very hard, serious scholarly view of \nwhat it is you can do with the Guantanamo Bay detainees. I would ask \nthem to take a very serious look at the logistical problems of \nLeavenworth.\n  I know a number of the people who are involved at Fort Leavenworth \nare deeply concerned about the fact that they have a number of \nschoolchildren who are educated on the Fort Leavenworth military base, \nbecause at the Command and General Staff College, we get people \nassigned there for a year, 2 years, sometimes longer periods of time \nand families move there. We have schools we operate on the military \nbase. We are deeply concerned about somebody coming in, wanting to make \na statement and going into one of those schools and taking the children \nhostage.\n  I have seen situations where a number of people are put in harm's way \nfor no good reason whatsoever, and seeing that this facility is not set \nup to be able to do this is one of them.\n  I have visited with people locally. I have a call scheduled with \nSecretary Gates. We have been putting this forward in legislative form \nin prior legislative sessions, and I will be in this legislative \nsession as well to make this point. If it had been easy to close \nGuantanamo Bay previously, I am certain the current administration \nwould have done it. It is a difficult task. But that doesn't mean that \nbecause it is a difficult task, then you do it fast. It means because \nit is a difficult task, you take your time and you do it right or you \nare going to create a lot more\n\n[[Page S328]]\n\nproblems down the road. This is one where I think the loss in this \nsituation is far greater--far greater--than any gain we would get in \nclosing the Guantanamo Bay facility, particularly in our relationship \nto Islamic countries.\n  I would plead with the new administration to look at this in a very \nserious and in a very clear and in a very analytical way, to make a \nwise decision that will stand for the future and not just create a huge \nset of problems for the future.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been interested for some long while \nabout new technology and the Internet and all those related issues.\n  I recall reading a couple of years ago a statement by the former \npresident of IBM in which he described the unbelievable leapfrog in \ntechnology and capability--most of it breathtaking. Most of us \nunderstand that because we use the Internet we can go anywhere in the \nworld at our fingertips on the keyboard, but he described something \nbreathtaking to me. He described the issue of storage density and the \nnew capability of storage density. He said that we are on the cusp now \nof being able to reduce in storage density all of the works that exist \nin the Library of Congress--I think it is somewhere around 14 or 16 \nmillion volumes of work--which is the largest repository of human \nknowledge that exists anywhere on Earth; to be able to store that on a \nvery small wafer the size of a penny.\n  Think of that: a wafer the size of a penny representing the storage \ndevice that contains the largest repository of human knowledge in \nhistory. Pretty remarkable.\n  Assume that you are able to walk around with a storage device the \nsize of a penny in your jacket pocket which you can put into a computer \nand peruse all that human knowledge that has been gained since the \nstart of human history. On that storage device would be a lot of \ninformation, but what wouldn't be on that storage device--of all the \nhuman knowledge accumulated since the beginning of time--would be how \nwe get out of this financial mess that the country is now in. There is \nno formula, there is no rule, there is no experience that would give us \na roadmap of how we get from here to where we need to be to get out of \nthis financial wreck.\n  We are indeed in a financial crisis. And the one thing that unites \nthe smartest economists in the country or the deepest thinkers or the \nlatest self-proclaimed greatest sage and all the rest of us, the thing \nthat connects us all, is none of us has ever been here before. We are \nall walking in the woods for which there is no map and all we have is a \nguess as to how we are to try to put this economy back together.\n  Now, some people say: Well, what does all that mean, this financial \ncrisis? How do we understand that there is this wreckage occurring in \nthe economy? Well, you can look at it a number of ways. You can look at \nthe people who have been saving for a long period of time, investing \ntheir 401(k) in a mutual fund or in the stock market. After 30 years of \nwork, they had a nest egg for retirement, but they have lost 40 or 50 \npercent of it, just like that. Half a lifetime of savings gone, like \nthat. That is one piece of evidence. It is pretty dramatic for every \nfamily in this country.\n  But there is other evidence as well. And that evidence especially, it \nseems to me, describes the crisis in our families in this country. If \nyou look at last month's unemployment report, it says, in a kind of a \nsanitary way, that 524,000 people lost their jobs. Well, what if you \njust say 523,999 and then focus on the one, just one person who had to \ncome home, in most cases, and tell a spouse: You know what, I have lost \nmy job today. No, I am not a bad employee. I have worked hard for that \ncompany for 10 or 15 years, but they laid employees off today. To that \none family, that is 100 percent unemployment, and that is a disaster \nfor that family. Think of it. Last month, over half a million Americans \nhad that discussion some night around the supper table: What are we \ngoing to do?\n  And it is not just the half million people who lost their jobs last \nmonth or 2.6 million people who have lost their jobs since this \nrecession started, and which has grown deeper; it is the hundreds of \nthousands and millions more who have not only had to say I have lost my \njob but who have had to say I have lost my house as well. It is pretty \nunbelievable.\n  This is an extraordinary country, with great strength, and an \neconomic engine that has been the wonder of the world. No one in the \nworld has done what we have done to expand the middle class and give \neveryone a feeling of opportunity. No one has done that. I have \ndescribed before the unbelievable accomplishments of our country. We \nhave survived the Civil War, survived a Great Depression, and we have \nbeen through two World Wars. We represent the beacon of freedom around \nthe world. We have always been a country that represents hope.\n  I have been in so many parts of this world and asked people: What do \nyou desire for your life? I remember being on a helicopter that ran out \nof gas between Nicaragua and Honduras in a mountainous area. We landed \nunder power but we landed because we had no fuel, and campesinos from \naround the region came to see who had landed in this helicopter. We \nwere stranded for about 4 hours until we were found. We had an \ninterpreter, and so during a discussion, through an interpreter, I \nasked a young woman, who walked up with others--she had about three or \nfour children with her, probably in her early 20s--what do you aspire \nto do for you and your family? Oh, I want to come to the United States, \nshe said. Why? Because the United States is where there is opportunity \nand freedom, she said. So in a discussion up in the mountains between \nHonduras and Nicaragua someone who had never seen an American \nunderstood America as a place for her and her family, a place of \nopportunity and freedom.\n  It is unbelievable what this place has represented to the rest of the \nworld. We split the atom, we have spliced genes. As I have said before, \nwe have cloned animals. We invent things--the silicone chip, plastic, \nand the radar. We cured smallpox and polio. We built the telephone, the \ntelevision, the Internet, and the computer. We built airplanes and \nlearned to fly them; built rockets to fly to the Moon. It is \nunbelievable what we have done. Our country is just that resourceful.\n  But we have found ourselves in recent months in a very deep hole. We \nfind ourselves right now perched on the edge of a cliff, and the \nquestion is: What do we do to try to restore economic health to this \ncountry so that next month the news is not another half million \nAmericans have lost their jobs; so that perhaps next month, or some \nmonth in the future the news will be that more Americans are working, \nmore Americans have found jobs, more Americans are owning homes. How do \nwe do all that?\n\n  The fact is, there is not anything in recorded human history that \nreplicates this and there is not anyone who knows what is the menu to \nuse to restore economic health. This country is in some very severe \ndifficulty.\n  I wish to talk about what all this means and what I think we have to \ndo. President-elect Obama came to the Senate today and spent time with \nthe Democratic caucus. He spent the lunch hour with us and spoke for \nnearly an hour. It was an extraordinary exchange of views. He is a very \ngifted person who I think has great promise and, I think, hope that we \ncan restore economic health to this country. He is going to need a lot \nof help. He is going to need a lot of us, Republican and Democrat. He \nis going to need the American people to join in an effort to restore \neconomic health to this country.\n  In the Thomas Wolfe book ``You Can't Go Home Again,'' he describes \nthe kind of unique character of the American people. He describes it as \na quenchless hope, boundless optimism, indestructible belief. I think \nthese qualities exist in this country and it has gotten us through many \ndifficult periods and will again and will this\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\ntime. But this will take some effort. This will not be easy.\n  I have described before what has caused much of this. It is not \nrocket science to describe it. We have seen what I think is an \nunbelievable carnival of greed, creating and trading exotic financial \ninstruments that had dramatic risks, attaching that risk to some of \nAmerica's biggest financial institutions and some of America's biggest \nbanks. To go right to the origin of it--I have said it before and I \nwill say it again and again, as long as I have an opportunity to speak \nabout this because you have to close the gate. You cannot restore \nconfidence in this country until you close the gate. Here is the house \nof cards that was built. We know what happens to house of cards in a \nhigh wind and all that, it has come down.\n  I described the other day, and I am going to once again, what is \ncalled a subprime mortgage scandal. They were advertising mortgages. We \nhave all seen it. We have seen these advertisements. Here is the \nCountrywide ad. It was the biggest mortgage bank in the country. It now \ndoesn't exist. It was subsumed into another company. By the way, the \nCEO of Countrywide, I am told--at least reading the newspaper--got away \nwith a couple hundred million dollars for himself so he is not exactly \nshedding tears about all this. But here is what they were advertising \nfor the American people: Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you \nhave late mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \nCall us. We would like to give you a loan.\n  Does that sound like sound business practices? It doesn't to me. What \ndoes it mean? The broker was able to get $10,000, $20,000 in bonuses \nfor the loan. The mortgage company took their cut. Then they \nsecuritized it. They sold the security and rolled it into others--like \nthey used to in the old days pack sawdust in sausage and roll it all \ntogether--they rolled these loans into a securities instrument, sold it \nup to hedge funds, sold it to investment banks. And they put prepayment \npenalties into it so borrowers were locked in, 3 years from the teaser \nrate, to interest rates that the borrower couldn't possibility repay \nand everybody was fat and happy and everybody was making a fortune--\nmillions of dollars. Everybody was making a fortune.\n  The problem is it was a lot of air. It was not just Countrywide. Zoom \nCredit Company--here is what they said in their advertisements:\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \n     preapprove you for a car loan.\n       Even if your credit's in the tank, Zoom Credit's like money \n     in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and \n     debt consolidation.\n\n  And then they finished with this:\n\n       Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--who cares?\n\n  Does that look like a good business practice to you? It looks like a \nPonzi scheme to me.\n  This morning the judge in New York said Mr. Madoff, who had a $50 \nbillion alleged Ponzi scheme, was not going to be incarcerated. He \napparently bilked people out of $50 billion, but he is spending today \nin a $7 million penthouse apartment in New York City because the judge \nsays: No, no, he should not be incarcerated. That was a Ponzi scheme, \napparently. People thought they had money invested with him. They, in \nfact, did not. It turns out there was not the money they thought was in \ntheir accounts.\n  But it is not just Mr. Madoff who had a Ponzi scheme. Do you think \nthis is not a Ponzi scheme, a company such as this says: If you are \nbankrupt, you cannot pay your bills, you have slow credit, you have no \ncredit, come to us; do you think that is not a Ponzi scheme? Because \nwhat do you think they did with that when they roped this customer into \ncoming to them for a mortgage? They said: Tell you what, we have a \nsweet little deal for you. We will give you a mortgage called no-doc, \nthat means you don't even have to demonstrate your income to us that \nwill demonstrate you can repay it--no-doc loans. By the way, we will \ngive you a mortgage, no documentation of your income, and we will give \nyou a mortgage in which you don't have to pay any principal at all, \njust interest. Or, if that is not good enough, you don't have to pay \nall the interest for the first year. If that is not good enough, we \ngive you a mortgage where we make the first 12 months' payments for \nyou. But wait, we will give you a teaser rate. You can pay 2 percent \ninterest rate. You can cut your home mortgage in half.\n  We don't tell you about the fine lines that say we are going to reset \nthe interest rate to a much higher level in 3 years and you are not \ngoing to be able to repay it. And, by the way, we are going to put a \nprepayment penalty in so you can't get out of this because--do you know \nwhat we are going to do with this mortgage? We are going to package it \nup with others, called securitizing it, and we are going to sell it so \nwe don't have any responsibility for it anymore and a hedge fund is \ngoing to buy it. Do you know why a hedge fund is going to buy it? We \nhave a prepayment penalty in there with high interest rates and it will \nreset in 3 years and we are going to make a lot of money. They were all \nfat and happy when they built this huge bubble and the bubble burst and \nit helped cause a collapse in this economy.\n  I say all of that just to say it is not over. Go to the Internet \nright now, and see if you can find what I found--no-documentation \nloans. We still have shysters out there advertising this kind of \nnonsense: We will give you a loan. You don't even have to document it.\n  What happened as a result of this? Some of the biggest financial \nnames in our country, it turns out, were investing deeply in what we \nnow understand is toxic assets. We all understand the word ``toxic.'' \nIt always used to be associated with a waste dump, toxic waste dump. \nMaybe toxic is an appropriate term. When the Treasury Secretary says \ntoxic assets, it seems to me the bowels of some of the biggest \nfinancial institutions represent toxic waste dumps because that is \nwhere these bad assets exist.\n  So the Treasury Secretary came to us when it looked like everything \nwas going to collapse and said I need $700 billion from the American \ntaxpayers and I need it in 3 days and I have a three-page bill I want \nyou to pass. Why? What I am going to do, I am going to buy these assets \nfrom the biggest financial companies in the country and relieve them \nfrom this toxicity deep in the bowels of the banks. I did not vote for \nit, but sufficient numbers of my colleagues voted for it to authorize \n$700 billion.\n  Now $350 billion has either been spent or committed. The scandal is \nwe cannot find out how the taxpayers' money has been used. To whom? For \nwhat purpose? Under what conditions?\n  We know in total there is about $8.5 trillion that has so far been \ncommitted by the Federal Government. That means the taxpayer is on the \nhook for about $8.5 trillion--the Federal Reserve programs, $5.5 \ntrillion; FDIC, $1.5 trillion; Treasury Department, $1.1. Do you know \nwhat? The Bloomberg News Corporation had to sue the Federal Government \nto get information about this. Isn't that unbelievable? They should not \nhave had to sue anybody.\n  Let me show you the statements that were made by the Treasury \nSecretary and others. Here is what the Treasury Secretary said on the \n23rd of October:\n\n       We need oversight, we need protection. We need \n     transparency. I want it, we all want it.\n\n  That is just words. It didn't mean a thing. There is no transparency. \nYou cannot find out what is going on. The Treasury Secretary took $125 \nbillion and shoved it at nine banks and said: I am going to invest in \ncapital. I changed my mind, I am not going to buy any assets. So the \nTARP program, which got its named for troubled assets--there are no \ntroubled assets purchased by the Secretary. He said: I changed my mind, \nnow I want to give capital to banks.\n  That is not necessarily a bad idea, except he took $125 billion and \nplugged it into nine banks, some of which didn't want it, and there \nwere no strings attached. He said: I am doing this because I want you \nto expand lending. There was no requirement they expand lending, no \nrequirement they not use it for bonuses or dividends.\n  If you ask the Treasury Secretary: Did they expand lending with the \n$125 billion of taxpayers' money you sunk into capital, his answer is: \nI don't know. Ask the banks. They tell you money is fungible, we are \nnot going to tell you that answer. We know don't know. But ask people \nwanting to get money from the banks. They will tell\n\n[[Page S330]]\n\nyou there is no additional lending or expansion of credit. It was just \na commitment on behalf of the American taxpayers of $125 billion in \nsearch of a solution that didn't exist because he didn't put strings on \nit or attach some conditions to it, so that is where we are.\n  Ben Bernanke, head of the Federal Reserve Board, said on the 24th of \nOctober, ``Transparency is a big issue.'' I guess so. It is certainly a \nmuch bigger issue, given what he has done. He has moved massive \nquantities of money through the Fed--by the way the Fed opened its \nwindow to direct lending to investment banks for the first time in the \nhistory of this country. They used to only do direct lending to FDIC-\ninsured banks. They opened the window to direct lending to investment \nbanks. The question is, Who got the money? Under what conditions? How \nmuch? The answer is, We don't know. We are not telling you.\n  That is unbelievable to me. There is nothing in the Constitution \nabout this. The Constitution is a short little document that talks \nabout powers, the powers of the executive branch, the powers of the \nlegislative branch, and judicial branch. You go read the Constitution \nand try to figure out whether you think the opportunity exists for \nsomebody, even in a crisis, to commit $8.5 trillion, $8.6 trillion on \nbehalf of the American taxpayer and then tell us you will not to get \ninformation about this? Go to court. That is unbelievably arrogant, in \nmy judgment.\n  Having said all that--which is, in some ways, therapeutic for me to \ngo through what has caused so much of this and to talk about the folly \nof the pursuit of a solution. That we cannot possibly succeed unless \nyou have conditions and attachments to those moneys that are being \nused--all of this, it seems to me, is wrapped in a circumstance where \nwe now find ourselves with a new President. He will be sworn in on the \nwest front of this building next Tuesday. He inherits the most \nsignificant set of economic problems I think of any President since \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt. I don't think there is much question about \nthat.\n  The question is, Where does this go from here? You know the law of \nholes: When you are in a hole, stop digging. The question is, How do \nyou stop digging? How do you find a way to put this back on track to \nsome sort of growth? Where is the bottom? How do you stop this from \nfalling off a cliff? There are all these folks, the so-called smartest \npeople in the room, who share with me and with my colleague from \nArkansas, who is the Presiding Officer--share the fact that none of us \nunderstand the answer. Nobody understands exactly what to do.\n  But I wish to say this: I think at the root of this is always, and \nwill always be, with this economy of ours, the issue of confidence. Do \npeople have confidence about the future? If they are living in a place, \nin a country and at a time when they can be confident about the \nfuture--confident for themselves and their kids, confident that they \nwill have a job, retain their jobs, have job security, have a decent \npayroll, have benefits in the future--then they are confident and do \nthings that manifest that confidence: buy clothes, take a trip, buy a \ncar, buy a house; they do the things that expand this economy. But when \nthey do not have confidence--and the American people at this point do \nnot--they do exactly the opposite, which contracts this economy. They \ndefer all those purchases and decide, you know what, we don't have \nconfidence that we are going to keep this job, have this income, \nprovide for our kids. We need to cut back, and that contracts the \neconomy.\n  So the question is this: It is not, as I have said often, about how \ndo you tune the engine on the ship of state. How do you go down to the \nengine room and take a look at every dial, gauge, lever, knob, and just \nadjust it just right?\n  In fiscal policy or in monetary policy, how do you adjust it? Tax \ncredits? M1B? Fiscal stimulus? It is not that at all, in my judgment, \nbecause there is not a perfect menu to provide confidence to the \nAmerican people. And it does not matter how you adjust those issues if \nyou do not find a way to instill confidence, the economy is going to \ncontract. So I have introduced legislation with a number of pieces that \nI think are essential to try to provide that kind of confidence. Let me \ndescribe them.\n  First and foremost, I do not think you can do this and give the \nAmerican people confidence unless you look back and look forward. That \nmeans accountability, and accountability means looking back and looking \nahead, it seems to me. I described the absurdity of Mr. Madoff running \na $50 billion Ponzi scheme, living in his $7 million apartment in New \nYork City, and the judge saying: That is okay. It seems to me there is \nan equal absurdity here of having the equivalent type of Ponzi schemes \nin which you loaded some of the biggest American financial institutions \nwith dramatic amounts of risk and debt and say: Well, now that is past, \nno one is accountable. It seems to me someone is accountable for that. \nAre they still around? Were they getting $20 and $30 million a year? \nSome of them were. There was a recent investigative piece by the \nWashington Post describing the person in charge of risk management and \ndescribing a trader at the same firm, both making somewhere in the \nneighborhood of $20 million a year. Who is accountable for that, for \nthe collapse as a result of the loading up of dramatic risk in an \ninvestment bank and then having the American taxpayers bail it out?\n  Here are some of the so-called biggest institutions that were deemed \n``too big to fail.'' Until this point, they have not only been ``too \nbig to fail,'' they have been ``too small to regulate'' apparently \nbecause we have a lot of folks in this town who do not want to regulate \nanything. They want to be willfully blind, including those we pay to \nregulate these entities. They are the ones who helped us decide long \nago, as a country: We are not going to look at derivatives, we will not \nregulate derivatives, and we are not going to regulate hedge funds. We \nare willing to countenance a lot of dark money out there because we do \nnot need to see it. You know, the high priest of that thought was, of \ncourse, Alan Greenspan, whose notion of how you handle all of this is \nself-regulation. Self-regulation will work just fine, he said. Well, it \nturns out that was a miscalculation to the tune of some trillions of \ndollars. It did not work fine.\n  Here is what we need to do--accountability going back. I have just \ndescribed Alan Greenspan. He came and testified. He said: ``I made a \nmistake in presuming the self-interests of organizations, specifically \nbanks and others, were best capable of protecting their own \nshareholders and their own equity in the firms.''\n  You know the old saying that there is no education in the second kick \nof a mule. We know this. We knew this. We have been through this in the \nGreat Depression. We were through the Gay Nineties and the Roaring \nTwenties. None of us lived then, but we learned the lessons and put in \nplace the protections to make sure it never happened again.\n  About 10 years ago, the Congress took apart most of those \nprotections. I voted against it. I thought it was a terrible decision. \nBut here we are paying the price for that.\n  Those protections, it seems to me, at this point need to be \nreconnected. So what should we do? Well, first of all, I think, in \naddition to a rescue plan of some type, or a stimulus plan, as it is \nbeing called, it seems to me you need some type of taxpayer protection. \nNobody is looking out for the taxpayer here, and the taxpayer is having \nto make the commitment through the Treasury Secretary, through the \nFederal Reserve, and through the Congress. Let's have a taxpayer \nprotection plan or a Taxpayer Protection Act.\n  One, I think we ought to extend the oversight, accountability, audit, \nand all the reporting provisions that were imposed originally by the \nTreasury Department under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act to \ncover any financial entity that provides emergency economic assistance \nto private firms. There ought to be complete transparency, no secrecy, \nnobody saying: We will not tell you, we will not show you, we will not \ndisclose to you.\n  Second, all private firms receiving emergency financial assistance \nshould be subject to the same set of rules and restrictions relating to \nexecutive compensation, golden parachutes, dividend payments, to name a \nfew.\n  You know, we had the auto industry executives come down here, and \nthey were widely pilloried for flying Gulfstream IVs wing tip to wing \ntip from\n\n[[Page S331]]\n\nDetroit to Washington, DC. It turns out that there were over 20 \ncommercial flights that day from here to Detroit and back. One could \nhave sat them in first class and provided them Dr. Pepper in a paper \ncup, or whatever it is they do in first class, between Detroit and \nWashington, DC, and they would have been fine. But they flew down wing \ntip to wing tip in Gulfstreams and, you know, making $2 million, $2.5 \nmillion a month, whatever it was. There was a lot of criticism about \nit--justifiable, in my judgment. I want the auto industry to succeed, \nbut that was not a very smart thing that day.\n  But the question is, Why it is just the auto industry? Where are all \nof those folks who ran some of those big investment banks into the \nditch? Where are the folks who caused that wreckage? How about the \npeople who ran these big mortgage companies that were selling these \nunbelievable mortgages to people with bad credit and getting big \nbonuses as a result? When are they going to be brought here under \nsubpoena and asked the same questions and subject to the same \nrequirements?\n  I think we ought to create a taxpayer protection prosecution task \nforce. I believe there is a lot of illegal activity that has not been \nuncovered. And I do not think it ought to be laid at the feet of some \nattorney general someplace in some State. There ought to be a Federal \nprosecution tasks force empaneled, and that task force must make it a \ntop priority to investigate and prosecute financial fraud cases and \nseek to recover any ill-gotten gains. The task force shall make \nrecommendations to the Congress, within 60 days, about extending the \nstatute of limitation in complicated financial crimes, if necessary.\n  There ought to be a reform commission on the financial system that \ndetermines the causes of this financial nightmare. And the commission \nwould report its findings, conclusions and make recommendations for \npreventing a similar debacle in the future. I do not think it is just a \nmatter of jump-starting the economic engine; I think you have to rewire \nthe system here. You have to rewire the financial system. This does not \nwork.\n  Securitizing instruments for which there was never any decent \nunderwriting because you did not have to underwrite if you were going \nto send the risk upstairs--that does not work. And you cannot have dark \nmoney out there beyond the gaze of regulators.\n  You do have to regulate. It seems to me you have to completely reform \nthe financial system, and I do think the people who caused this wreck \nare going to be the ones who are going to help us reform the system.\n  So those are four areas that I think we have to do on behalf of the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  You know, my sense is that everyone in this country wants this new \nGovernment to succeed. President-elect Barack Obama campaigned across \nthis country on the subject of change. We all understand the need for \nthat change. The fact is, there is plenty of blame to go around. Lots \nof folks, Republicans, Democrats, one administration, another--there is \na lot of blame. But it seems to me there are special obligations laid \nat the feet of those who in the last 8 years have decided to be \nwillfully blind and decided that self-regulation was more important \nthan having people do their jobs who were supposed to be regulating. \nAnd the result was the creation of a house of cards or a Ponzi scheme \nsort of thing that has caused dramatic damage to this country.\n\n  Now, it is a mess, but I think this country can get out of it. I \nthink it would be hard for anybody in this Chamber to decide to get up \nand go to work if they did not have an abiding hope about the future of \nthis country. And I do. But that hope is joined, it seems to me, by \nrequirements to find out what happened, take action based on what \nhappened, and make sure it never happens again. That is not rocket \nscience; that is what we are obligated to do.\n  This is, as I said, a great country with a wonderful history of \novercoming the odds. We have people who came to this country from \ndifferent parts of the planet searching for opportunity. Most of us \ncome from immigrants who came from one part of the planet or another, \none part of this globe, and came to this country because they believed \nthis is the place where opportunity existed.\n  There was a man named Stanley Newberg who died, and there was a tiny \nlittle piece written in the New York Times about him some years ago. It \nwas a piece that intrigued me, so I looked into it to find out what was \nthis about, Stanley Newberg. It said, in this one-paragraph piece, \nsomething that I discovered more about. A man came to this country with \nhis parents to flee the persecution by the Nazis of the Jews, and they \ncame here and landed in this country, with nothing, in New York City. \nHis dad had a job peddling fish on the Lower East Side of New York, and \nStanley Newberg trailed along, this little tyke with his dad every day \npeddling fish. Then he went to school, and his parents struggled \nbecause they had nothing, and he did well in school. They struggled to \nget him some loans and try to help him get to college. He went to \ncollege, graduated from college, and went to work for an aluminum \ncompany. He did very well with the company and rose up to management in \nthe company and then purchased the company.\n  Later, he died. When they opened his will, Stanley Newberg, in his \nwill, left $5.7 million to the United States of America. In his will, \nhe said: For the privilege of living in that great country. Is that not \nremarkable? Here is a man who came here with nothing, was enormously \nsuccessful, then at the end of his life left his inheritance to the \nUnited States of America. I am not suggesting everyone do that. I am \nsuggesting it inspires me when people--in this case, coming here as a \nboy with nothing--understand the magic of what this country of ours \noffers in terms of opportunity and freedom. And I think, with all of \nthe hand-wringing that exists in our country about these very serious \ntroubles we face, I am absolutely convinced, if we work together, with \na new President, a new Government, if we call the American people to be \npart of something bigger than themselves, to say this is a moment to \ntry to put this country back on track and build better opportunity and \ngreater opportunity for all Americans, I have great hope then for this \ncountry.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 22, \nthe public lands omnibus bill. This legislation contains several \nimportant provisions for the State of Florida that will protect its \nnatural treasures and expand understanding of our rich history. These \nbills are bipartisan, and I am proud to have worked with my colleague \nSenator Bill Nelson in support of the Everglades provisions and the \ncommission for the 450th anniversary of St. Augustine's founding. \nCongressman John Mica has introduced a companion version of this bill \nin the House of Representatives and I wanted to recognize his efforts \nas well. In addition, I thank the hard work of Senator Jeff Bingaman, \nthe chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and ranking \nmember, Senator Murkowski, and their staff, for including these bills \nin S. 22 and bringing it to expected floor passage.\n  The public lands package contains an authorization for the St. \nAugustine 450th Commemoration Commission, which is critical in \nassisting the National Park Service, the State of Florida, as well as \nall local stakeholders in organizing the historic celebration of the \ncity's founding. St. Augustine's old and complex history mirrors much \nof the American experience. It was the birthplace of Christianity in \nthe New World and it was truly the first blending-pot of cultures that \nincluded peoples of Spanish, English, French, Native American, and \nAfrican descent. Many do not know that St. Augustine is the location of \nthe first parish mass in the United States and it was the location of \nthe first free black settlement in North America. Nearly a century \nbefore the founding of Jamestown, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon \nlanded off the coast of St. Augustine looking for the fabled Fountain \nof Youth but instead founded a colony known as La Florida. He \ndiscovered very favorable currents that would later be known as the \nGulf Stream, which would serve as trade routes for European explorers \nto discover other parts of the New World.\n  Because of St. Augustine's location along strategic trade routes, \nSpain constructed the Castillo de San Marcos in 1672 to protect the \ncapital of La Florida from French and British interests. The Castillo \nde San Marcos is\n\n[[Page S332]]\n\nbuilt on the ruins of the original fort that was burned to the ground \nby British sailor and explorer Sir Francis Drake. The fort still stands \ntoday and has had six different flags fly above its ramparts. It is the \noldest surviving European fortification in the United States.\n  The St. Augustine Commemoration Commission is necessary to help \norganize the tremendous amount of historical and cultural events that \nwill take place in the first coast area. The commission will encompass \na broad array of members from Federal, State, local, and academic \nbackgrounds to ensure that it has a diverse make-up of professionals to \nassist the city of St. Augustine in celebrating its founding. The \nintent of the St. Augustine commission bill is to assist the NPS and \nlocal stakeholders in building upon the experiences of the Jamestown \ncelebration in 2007. In addition, the commission would provide the \nnecessary framework to navigate the significant logistical challenges \nfacing the city of St. Augustine, the State of Florida, and the \nNational Park Service.\n  Restoration of the Everglades, especially Everglades National Park, \nwill be enhanced by enactment of the public lands bills package, S. 22. \nOne such provision included is section 7107, which would expand the \nboundaries of Everglades National Park by nearly 600 acres and help \nprotect a critical part of Florida's ecological heritage. I am proud to \nhave cosponsored this legislation with my colleague Bill Nelson, and it \nis supported by a broad group. of stakeholders including the Monroe \nCounty government in the Florida Keys, the Nature Conservancy, and the \nNational Park Service. The passage of this bill would protect coastal \nwetlands and habitat for a myriad of endangered species including the \nAmerican crocodile, the West Indian manatee, the wood stork, the \nroseate spoonbill, and other migrating birds.\n  The citizens of Florida have long treasured the Everglades, and the \naddition of this property within the park's boundaries will help \npreserve the unique beauty that makes the keys such a special place. \nThe addition of the Tarpon Basin property will not place new management \nor administrative burdens on our park's staff, but instead would \nenhance and preserve a part of Old Florida for years to come.\n  Another provision included in S. 22, which Senator Nelson and I \nsupport would facilitate an important land exchange to allow the \nNational Park Service to acquire the last significant private inholding \nin the Everglades and clear the way to finally implement the federally \napproved Modified Waters Delivery Project or ``Mod Waters.'' Mod Waters \nwill help restore natural water flows into Everglades National Park, \nand although authorized nearly 20 years ago in 1989, it has experienced \nsubstantial delays.\n  The land trade provided for in the pending, measure enables the Park \nService to acquire Florida Power and Light's, FPL, 7-mile long, utility \ncorridor that now bisects the expanded Everglades National Park. This \ncorridor runs north-south through the heart of the East Everglades and \nShark River Slough, which provides the primary water flows into the \npark. Under the exchange, FPL would give this 320 acre inholding to the \npark and would receive roughly 260 acres on the eastern boundary of the \npark adjacent to the existing L 31 canal and levee. FPL would also \nreceive a vegetative management easement to help control nonnative \nexotic plants. Public acquisition of the FPL inholding would eliminate \nthe last significant private inholding delaying Mod Waters.\n\n  No funds will be needed for this inholding acquisition and appraisals \nindicate that the park receives more value than FPL. Since so much \npreliminary work has been put into identifying the precise lands and \ninterests involved in the exchange, the Park Service should be able to \npromptly complete the appraisal approval process. Expeditious review is \ncritical to facilitate Mod Waters and ensure that the exchange is \nexecuted so taxpayers are spared the multimillion-dollar costs of \npurchasing the FPL corridor.\n  Substantial work has already been completed and all evaluations \nindicate that relocating the utility corridor away from the Everglades \nNational Park will provide a wide array of environmental benefits to \nthe park. The exchange and relocation ensures that there will be no \nelectric transmission lines constructed on the existing private right-\nof-way. In addition, moving the utility corridor to the periphery of \nthe park to developed property will lessen impacts on resources, \nendangered and threatened species, and other park-related values. The \nbill also provides the NPS with the authority to relocate the \nEverglades Park boundary to ensure that the lands conveyed to FPL are \noutside of the park. The intent is that the relocated utility corridor \nnot be within Everglades Park.\n  Since an environmental assessment needs to focus only on those \nfactors arising from the land exchange itself, it is expected that the \nPark Service will move quickly to complete the assessment. Any effects \nthat may arise from future proposed development of the relocated \ncorridor would be subject to full environmental review at that time by \nappropriate Federal and State agencies. Because of these protections \nand oversight, there should be no undue regulatory delay in the \ncompletion of this important land exchange, which could further delay \nMod Waters. Accordingly, the NPS should act in a timely manner to \nrender a suitability finding for lands adjacent to the park used for \ntransmission to meet the power needs of south Florida.\n  I again thank Chairman Bingaman and Senator Murkowski for including \nthese bills in S. 22. I also want to thank our outgoing ranking member, \nPete Domenici, for his hard work in helping move these bills through \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee last year. We have a chance \nat the beginning of a new Congress to show the American people that \nWashington is not all about politics and gridlock. I urge my colleagues \nto vote for S. 22 to help facilitate the completion of Mod Waters and \nenhance the protection of Florida's fragile ecosystem.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, restoration of America's \nEverglades is one of my top priorities in the Senate. Everglades \nNational Park stands to be enhanced by enactment of the public lands \nbill package, S. 22.\n  Section 7107 contains a measure--similar to a bill introduced by \nSenator Mel Martinez and me, to facilitate an important land exchange \nwhich will allow the National Park Service to acquire the last \nsignificant private inholding in the East Everglades and clear the way \nto finally implement the congressionally approved Modified Waters \nDelivery project or ``Mod Waters.'' Mod Waters will help restore \nnatural water flows into Everglades Park. This project provides a \ncritical foundation for many future restoration projects and although \nit was authorized in 1989, has been delayed for a variety of reasons \nincluding the need to acquire private lands that will be returned to a \nnatural state by increased water flows.\n  The Park Service has worked painstakingly since 1989 to acquire over \n100,000 acres in the East Everglades at a cost of more than $104 \nmillion to clear the way for Mod Waters. Over 8000 individual parcels \nof land have been purchased and added to Everglades National Park. The \nland trade provided for in the pending measure will enable the park to \nacquire Florida Power and Light's--FPL--7-mile long, 330-foot wide \ninholding that now bisects the expanded park. This corridor of private \nlands runs north-south through the heart of the East Everglades and \nShark River Slough, which provides the primary water flows into the \npark--the area where more natural water flows will be restored by Mod \nWaters. Under the exchange, FPL would surrender this 320-acre inholding \nto the park and receive approximately 260 acres on the eastern \nperiphery of the park immediately adjacent to the existing L 31 canal \nand levee as well as a vegetative management easement to help control \nnonnative exotic plants among others. Public acquisition of the FPL \ninholding would eliminate the last significant private inholding \ndelaying Mod Waters. In return, FPL would receive lands that would be \noutside the park, providing it with the opportunity to develop such \nlands into a viable utility corridor, if approved. This is a win-win \nfor the people of south Florida who depend upon both a healthy \nenvironment and the availability of power.\n  As I stated earlier, Mod Waters is the foundation for the broader \nComprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, CERP, approved by Congress \nin the\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\nWater Resources Development Act of 2000. The congressionally mandated \nSeptember 2008 National Academy of Sciences report on Everglades \nrestoration called progress on Mod Waters ``dismal.'' The report \nemphasized that Mod Waters is critical to restoration, especially for \nEverglades Park, and urged the Federal Government to take action to \nmove the project along. This exchange does precisely that.\n  No funds will be needed for this inholding acquisition. Since so much \nwork has already been done to identify the precise lands and interests \nin land to be exchanged and these lands have been subject to \nprofessional appraisals, we expect the park to be able to promptly \ncomplete the necessary administrative requirements to complete the \nexchange. Time is of the essence in order to facilitate Mod Waters and \nensure that the exchange is executed so taxpayers are spared the multi-\nmillion dollar costs of purchasing the FPL corridor.\n  Prior to executing the land trade, the Park Service will prepare the \nappropriate National Environmental Policy Act document to fully \nunderstand the environmental impacts, if any. It is my hope that this \nexchange will provide a wide array of environmental benefits to the \npark. The exchange ensures that there will be no electric transmission \nlines constructed on the existing private right-of-way. The bill also \nprovides the Service with the authority to relocate the Everglades Park \nboundary to ensure that the lands conveyed to FPL are outside of the \npark. It is intended that the utility corridor, if developed, not be \nwithin Everglades Park. Because many of the agreements have been worked \nout in advance between FPL and the park, I expect that the Park Service \nwill move expeditiously to complete the land exchange authorized by \nthis legislation.\n  In a similar vein, the Park Service must also make a determination \nthat the lands and interests along the L 31 canal and levee on the edge \nof the park are ``suitable'' for exchange and conveyance to FPL. This \n``suitability'' is already widely acknowledged and recognized by both \nthe agency and the Congress as these peripheral lands are not in the \nheart of the park and not critical for Mod Waters and water flow \nrestoration. Accordingly, I expect the Park Service to act in a timely \nmanner to render the suitability finding.\n  I received a letter from Florida Department of Environmental \nProtection Secretary, Mike Sole, expressing his support for the land \ntransfer. The exchange is also supported by the Department of the \nInterior and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  I expect the Park Service and FPL to move promptly to complete the \nexchange. Again, the need for action on Mod Waters means that time is \nof the essence.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Murkowski for \ntheir efforts to incorporate this important measure in the S. 22 \npackage. We must move expeditiously to compete Mod Waters and \ncompletion of this land exchange will help us achieve these objectives \nwhile ensuring that the taxpayers are spared the cost of purchasing a \nvery expensive park inholding from FPL.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to call the attention of the Senate \nto the 80th anniversary of the League of United Latin American \nCitizens, LULAC. As a pioneer of the Latino civil rights movement, \nLULAC has long fought to better the economic condition, educational \nattainment, political influence, housing, health and civil rights of \nAmericans of Latino descent.\n  Eighty years ago, three organizations in south Texas united to combat \nthe rampant discrimination faced by Mexican Americans. After decades of \ndisenfranchisement, the Latino community in south Texas created a \nmovement for equality that has contributed greatly to enhancing the \nlivelihood of Latinos throughout the United States. LULAC's successes \nand achievements are many--ranging from the desegregation of schools \nthroughout the American Southwest to improving access to jobs and \ngovernment programs.\n  Today, as America's oldest national Latino organization, LULAC boasts \ncontinued service to America's Latino population through more than 48 \nemployment training centers, 16 regional centers, and employs its great \nknowledge of the needs of the Latino community by advising private, \nnonprofit, and public institutions. Moreover, its unique charter \nstructure allows this organization to disseminate important information \nand provide worthwhile services via more than 600 councils throughout \nthe United States and Puerto Rico. The need for LULAC's services has \nnot subsided through the years and a new generation of Latinos calls \nupon the institutional strength that this organization can provide. The \nchallenges we face as a nation can only be resolved by the inclusion of \nall American communities and I value the sage voice of LULAC on the \nstrategies to empower Latino communities.\n  The organization's early efforts for political and social inclusion \ncreated a strong base which LULAC and other organizations now utilize \nto improve the quality of life for all American Latinos. I congratulate \nand commend the League of United Latin American Citizens for their long \nrecord of service to the Latino community and wish them continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/13/senate-section/article/S333-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S333-S334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO BOURBON HEIGHTS NURSING HOME\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, today I wish to send my congratulations to \nthe San Diego Chargers for the remarkable way that they turned around \ntheir 2008 season in the National Football League.\n  During difficult economic times, as they face hardships and \nuncertainty, millions of sports fans across America turn to their \nhometown teams for solace and inspiration.\n  Few teams this year faced as many hardships as the Chargers, and few \nteams in any year have overcome adversity with such inspiring tenacity.\n  Hampered by injuries to star running back LaDainian Tomlinson and \nother key players and suffering through a series of heartbreaking \nlosses, the Chargers began the 2008 season with just four wins in their \nfirst 12 games. With 3 weeks to go in the regular season, they trailed \nthe division-leading Denver Broncos by three games. Though their fans \nremained loyal and the team remained confident, few outside observers \ngave them any chance reaching the NFL playoffs.\n  Over the next 5 weeks, though, the Chargers made an amazing run. \nBeginning on December 4th, three consecutive San Diego victories and \ntwo Denver losses left the Chargers just one game back entering a \nDecember 28 showdown with the Broncos.\n  In the decisive game, the Chargers staged an awe-inspiring offensive \ndisplay to crush the Broncos 52-21 and win the AFC Western Division \nchampionship. They became the first team in NFL history to have been 4-\n8 and make the playoffs and the first team ever to win their division \nafter being three games behind the leaders with three games to play.\n  Six days later, on January 3, the Chargers faced a terrific \nIndianapolis Colts team in the playoffs. In perhaps the greatest NFL \ngame ever played in San Diego, the Chargers beat the Colts in overtime, \n23-17.\n  Every playoff tournament ends sadly for every team but one. Last \nSunday, on a snowy day in Pittsburgh, the mighty Steelers ended the \nChargers season.\n  But nothing can dim the luster of the Chargers' late-season run. \nTheir dramatic turnaround is an inspiration to sports fans everywhere.\n  Mr. President, I grew up in Brooklyn, in the shadow of Ebbets Field, \nwhere baseball fans endured years of frustration with the annual cry of \n``Wait Till Next Year.'' When I was in high school, our dream finally \ncame true, and ``next year'' became this year.\n  With a talented young team that has triumphed over adversity, the San \nDiego Chargers can look forward to next year with pride and confidence. \nI salute the Charger players, coaches, staff, and ownership along with \ntheir loyal fans--for a great 2008 season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/13/senate-section/article/S334-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S334-S335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WHITE MOUNTAIN LAND MANAGEMENT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about the \nWhite Mountain National Forest and the U.S. Forest Service's efforts to \nmanage these lands for the benefit of all Granite Staters. In \nparticular, I wanted to extend my appreciation and support for the \nagency's commitment to implementing its 2005 management plan for the \nforest, including the Mill Brook timber harvesting proposal.\n  It goes without saying that the White Mountain National Forest is a \nspecial place for all New Hampshire residents. Drawing millions of \nvisitors each year, these lands have long appealed to those who enjoy \nthe outdoors, while also providing natural resources that support \ncommunities across the State. Through balanced, multiple-use management \npolicies, I remain confident that the White Mountain National Forest \nwill remain one of the crown jewels of the National Forest System for \ngenerations to come.\n  As such, I was pleased when, in 2005, the U.S. Forest Service \nreleased its new management plan for the White Mountain National \nForest. Striking a delicate compromise among stakeholders, it was \noverwhelmingly supported in New Hampshire and established a consensus-\nbased blueprint for how this natural resource will be managed. I \napplauded all of the hard work and public outreach that the Forest \nService put into this plan and was pleased to coauthor legislation that \nimplemented its wilderness recommendations. Signed into law in December \n2006, the New England Wilderness Act designated nearly 35,000 acres of \nnew wilderness in the Forest and strengthened our nation's commitment \nto land conservation.\n  The 2005 management plan also included timber harvesting, which is \ncritical for both regional economic activity and wildlife diversity \npurposes. The timber industry is one of the largest manufacturing \nindustries in New Hampshire, supporting well paying jobs and local \ncommunities, especially in the north country. Carefully managed timber \nharvesting can also play an important role in maintaining habitats that \nare critical for certain types of wildlife.\n  Fully consistent with the 2005 plan and its timber harvesting \nguidelines, the Forest Service has proposed logging projects which have \nbeen subject to environmental review, are limited in scope, and have \nthe support of well respected groups across the spectrum such as the \nSociety for Protection of New Hampshire Forests, Appalachian Mountain \nClub, the National Audubon Society, the New Hampshire Timberland \nOwners, and the North Country Council. Two of these proposals, the \nBatchelder Brook and Than Brook Resource Management Projects, have been \nunsuccessfully challenged by certain environmental groups such as the \nSierra Club that do not represent the view of most Granite Staters. \nEven though they seemed fine with the 2005 management plan when it was \nreleased, these groups now want to undo it via lawsuits and other \nchallenges that use up taxpayer resources and stymie economic activity \nin New Hampshire. Fortunately, the courts have so far ruled in favor of \nthe Forest Service and have allowed these two timber harvesting \nprojects to proceed. With each ruling against these challenges, it has \nbeen my hope, as well as the hope of many others in our State, that all \nparties would now act in good faith and respect the 2005 management \nplan's timber harvesting guidelines.\n  Unfortunately, this has not been the case, and it is why I am once \nmore speaking on the Senate floor about the White Mountain National \nForest. Once again, we now have the Sierra Club and its allies trying \nto tie up yet another important timber harvesting proposal, the Mill \nBrook project. This project, which consists of around 1,000 acres, is \nwholly consistent with the plan's timber harvesting guidelines. It is \nalso supported by a large number of well respected environmental groups \nand the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. But this is apparently \nnot enough. Recycling some of the same legal arguments that have proven \nunsuccessful in the past, the Sierra Club and its friends are trying to \nthwart the good intentions and popular support of the 2005 plan, \nchoosing the path of antagonism over the spirit of compromise.\n  Now of course, I recognize that it is within these groups' rights to \nfile an administrative appeal and try to hold things up. And I also \nrecognize that such tactics may appeal to their partisan supporters. \nThat being said, I also feel that these groups' actions are meant to \nundermine the longstanding consensus approach that New Hampshire has \ntaken to environmental protection and the management of the\n\n[[Page S335]]\n\nWhite Mountain National Forest specifically. During these challenging \ntimes, I also find it hard to understand why some groups are trying to \nthwart the Mill Brook proposal when their previous attempts to block \nsimilar projects have not succeeded, especially when timber harvesting \nin this area will provide an economic boost for the Granite State.\n  As I have said in the past, the White Mountain National Forest can \nand should be accessible to a wide variety of uses, including timber \nharvesting. While I certainly agree that the Forest Service must follow \nthe law and carry out certain environmental reviews, I also believe \nthat this administrative appeal runs counter to New Hampshire's \ninterests. I therefore hope that this appeal process is resolved as \nsoon as possible and that we can all support the Forest Service's \nmanagement of the White Mountain National Forest, including the Mill \nBrook project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/13/senate-section/article/S335-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S335-S336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Honorable Mike Crapo: My name is Brian Gross and my wife \n     Kelly and I have lived in Idaho since January as I graduated \n     from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and received a job \n     at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. We settled into \n     a comfortable fifteen hundred square foot town home and own \n     two cars that we both drive to work every day. Our extremely \n     short commute of 4 miles and 3 miles respectively requires \n     that we spend around $160 per month on gasoline. Though both \n     cars achieve no less than 20 miles per gallon in the city and \n     upwards of 32 miles per gallon on the highway, we would use \n     more than our entire month's budget for gasoline if we made a \n     trip to visit our relatives in North Dakota 800 miles away, \n     making a trip for the holidays a rather expensive venture.\n       One would think after seeing the Hubbert curve peak near \n     the earlier part of this decade, you would want to begin the \n     move towards other sources of fuel for our vehicles. If the \n     OPEC embargo of 1973 was not enough, what will it take before \n     we make the shift? The wonderful businessmen of Toyota and \n     Honda appreciated the coming situation and conveniently \n     developed a car that would contribute greatly in allowing the \n     former to surpass all of the big three companies in sales of \n     automobiles for the first time ever in April 2007. Even \n     though GM and Ford have turned around with several hybrid and \n     electric car projects, that still leaves the transportation \n     industry vying for even more expensive diesel fuel. In my \n     opinion, the first step for Congress would be to drastically \n     subsidize the expansion of domestic biodiesel production. I \n     mention only biodiesel, because of the issue with corn based \n     ethanol cutting into our food supply. To counter that issue, \n     why don't we revitalize methanol, which can be produced from \n     garbage, as a fuel? Ford produced several vehicles subsequent \n     to the oil embargo which ran on methanol, so the concept is \n     proven, we just need to reestablish the fuel production \n     industry.\n       As for electricity production, I as a nuclear engineer \n     strenuously support the expansion of nuclear power. The \n     loudening drum beat for action against anthropogenic climate \n     change, though I am not a advocate of the theory, has drawn \n     support for nuclear and public opinion is shifting in its \n     favor. Assuming that you are an avid supporter of the INL and \n     the nuclear industry, I would like to address my frustration \n     with Senator Harry Reid's ignorance and stubbornness of the \n     Yucca mountain repository. I hope you are asserting the fact \n     to him and his supporters that it is a repository, not a dump \n     as they keep calling it. I'm sure you've used the example of \n     the French as the right thing to do considering 80% of their \n     electricity is generated by nuclear, their waste is \n     reprocessed, and most importantly, they are energy \n     independent.\n       Lastly, I would like to thank you for addressing the issue \n     of energy with the people of Idaho. I hope you will carry our \n     message to the Senate with great fervor and it will not fall \n     upon deaf ears.\n     Brian J. Gross, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Our family is affected very little. You see, Senator Crapo, \n     a year ago I was anticipating something like this and bought \n     a 35mpg Kia Spectra, with which my wife and commute to our \n     jobs 60 miles round-trip every day.\n       About a year ago, I noticed how the value of the dollar was \n     on a steady decline due to Bush Administration policies \n     (Chinese debt to fund the war, flooding the globe with USDs, \n     unregulated futures commodities) and expected that since the \n     value of a barrel of oil was based on the USD, and the value \n     of the USD was on the rapid decline, I had better do \n     something fast. So I bought the best value in a high MPG \n     automobile that I could find, a Korean car. I would have \n     bought an American car, but again, I was looking for value, \n     and no American manufacturers could offer the same value as \n     South Korean made Kia. A shame.\n       So, to answer your question--It has not affected us that \n     much at all. We were prepared because we could see the future \n     based on our analysis of Republican policies.\n     Bruce Bacon.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: Thank you for wanting to know what the \n     people think. Energy prices really haven't changed my life at \n     all. I produce almost all the power and hot water I need with \n     solar panels and have a solar charging electric car.\n       Producing more oil in the U.S. will solve nothing as any \n     new supply will be bought by China and India. We need to \n     change fuel sources. Electricity will be the future fuel \n     source and it must be generated in Idaho by hydro/geothermal/\n     wind/solar. Renewables are: Free fuel forever.\n       Nuclear will only make us more dependant on imports. We \n     import 58 percent of our oil which is not a good thing. We \n     import over 92 percent of the uranium used to fuel nuclear \n     power plants. So, we should be talking about getting off our \n     dependence of imported nuclear fuel with the goal of shutting \n     down our nuclear power plants when the renewable generation \n     is in place.\n     John Weber, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I'm not going to bore you with sad tales of my life today. \n     I want all you folks in DC to tell the enviros they're \n     killing a country whose life and economy are based on oil. If \n     they want a perfect world in one national park from coast to \n     coast, find another country to do it in.\n       Next, I want you to take crude oil off the commodities \n     markets. All that is is people making all the money they \n     possibly can and not having a care about what they are doing \n     to people worldwide.\n       Is this asking too much of people elected to represent us \n     instead of listening to a minority that makes a lot of noise. \n     And if you're making money off of crude on the commodities \n     market, then I guess you'll get rid of this E-mail.\n     Mike Arnold.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am lucky enough to work only 10 miles from my home. My \n     husband got a job at the same place as I, so now we can \n     carpool to work, saving on fuel. However, he is in the \n     process of getting hired on with the police force. We have an \n     SUV that we are in over our heads on in payments, as many \n     Americans are. We also have a dodge diesel that gets 18.0 \n     miles to the gallon. We leased this vehicle and have 2 more \n     years left to go. The only reason we did this was because \n     gasoline was $3.00/gallon and diesel was $1.99/gallon. Then, \n     prices soared. We are no longer allowed to go camping, \n     hunting, riding our ATVs, or even go fishing. It costs too \n     much.\n       Not only are we feeling confined to our home, but \n     businesses are suffering too. We are willing to pay a \n     campground fee to have fun, but we cannot even afford to \n     leave. We take our children to daycare, go to work, pick our \n     children up from daycare, and go home. On Sunday, we go to \n     church and come home. We do not have the luxury of going to \n     the store for fun anymore with the spare change we have. Our \n     stimulus check went into the bank to pay for future fuel \n     costs. By the way, it's gone now.\n       I fully support the means of finding alternate energy not \n     only for fuel, but for electrical power as well.\n     Stephanie L. Rovig, Middleton.\n                                  ____\n\n       I was around for the first ``energy crisis'' in 1973. A few \n     years later, Americans were again reminded that our oil comes \n     from ``over there,'' is a finite resource, and should be \n     conserved. But we did not listen. So here we are, thirty-five \n     years later, with another opportunity to change our driving \n     habits and our energy consumption. Switching to biofuels and \n     electricity is not going to help much: the production of both \n     consumes huge quantities of fossil fuels. Americans must \n     conserve energy. We must learn to think differently about our \n     energy consumption. We are like the dieter who loses fifty \n     pounds, looks great, feels great, and then slowly gains all \n     the weight back because he had not changed the way he thinks \n     about food. Americans get into ``feel good'' mode. We walk \n     conservation, talk conservation, and sometimes even drive \n     conservatively. But when the newness of higher gas prices \n     wears off, we go right back to overconsumption.\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\n       The government isn't going to help out long-term if they go \n     after the gas and oil companies. Okay, maybe their profits \n     seem a bit high in light of what everybody else is going \n     through, but ultimately, conservation will affect the market \n     and they'll have to turn down the prices. Government can \n     subsidize mass transit and price it so that it's the economic \n     choice. Government can reward conservation. Incentives for \n     auto manufacturers to produce energy conscious vehicles will \n     inspire research and could result in some little guy creating \n     the next great automotive company, one whose main focus is \n     energy conservation. We can change the ethos that drives our \n     American reliance on petrochemicals. We must change the \n     ethos, for the good of our planet and the social structures \n     that it supports.\n       That is my story. Thanks for asking, Senator Crapo.\n     Miriam I. Lyngholm, Moscow.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your proactive email on a critical issue. I \n     am usually the one emailing you (along with Larry Craig, and \n     Bill Sali) about whatever issue it is that I feel needs \n     attention . . . line the still porous Southern border!! My \n     husband and I have not done our usual weekly lunch out and \n     our pizza night. I find, if I am lacking something for a \n     recipe, I just do without it. Before the insanity of the \n     current pump prices, I would just hop in the car and head to \n     the store to get the missing item. That usually interpreted \n     itself to a minimum $20.00 purchase, because you always see \n     something to just ``pick up while I am there''. But, no more. \n     I find I incorporate as many errands in one trip as possible. \n     I am definitely driving less, eating out less, and shopping \n     less, even at the grocery.\n       Do I like this? Not one bit, especially when it is as \n     unnecessary as it is. We have resources in this country that \n     have not even been explored. Drill off the Atlantic. I have \n     lived on the Florida Gulf coast. I know what a spill does, \n     but the technology and safe guards are far superior to what \n     they used to be! Move the limit out a bit, then explore. How \n     about the shale available in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado? I \n     do not advocate destroying beautiful places at all. There are \n     ways to return the earth to its previous state. We don't \n     ``scalp'' the forest anymore with clear cutting. We have \n     learned forest management. The same can be true of retrieving \n     the oil from shale. Why then, does it take 2 years just to \n     get the air permit to start up in those states? We won a \n     world war in just twice that time. Surely, we can push paper \n     faster in this crisis. Our economy is being crippled . . . \n     one family at a time.\n       I hope you will vote to start exploring/drilling at a \n     sensible distance off our shores . . . but START! The other \n     issue is the free reign of the futures/commodity speculators \n     and their part in all of these inflated prices. This has not \n     happened before on this type of scale. Wasn't there some \n     regulation in place that was done away with in the late \n     1990s that opened the way for this pillaging that is \n     happening today? I implore you to take measures to stop \n     these people who are inflating these prices and lining \n     their pockets at the pain of others.\n       Thank you for writing and for your vigilance on the border \n     (even though nothing is happening), and the gas price issues.\n     Virginia Carter, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Should be an easy one for your office to track. Follow a \n     bbl of oil from AK, MT, WY, ND, SD, PA, TX or CA from the \n     wellhead to the service station. You may not be able to \n     publish what you come up with. . .\n     Rodger Colgan.\n                                  ____\n\n       I read with sadness your email on the poor plight of us \n     Amercians being consumed by rising Energy prices. Your aim at \n     getting more exploration for energy reserves misses the \n     entire problem.\n       The problem is not that Gas prices, have gone up. Nor have \n     housing prices or food prices increased.\n       You are looking at the symptom of a much bigger problem. \n     What has changed is that the value of the dollar has \n     decreased. As pegged by the price of gold, silver and the \n     eruo the dollar is worth less than it was in 2000. At that \n     time gold was about $250 per ounce, the Euro was $.92 and \n     Silver was somewhere around $5.00. Today Gold is near $900, \n     Silver around $17 and the euro is around $1.55.\n       So Gas should be about $5.76. Given that the price of gold \n     has gone up over 3 times and so has silver.\n       The problem Senator is that the value of the Dollar or more \n     accurately that Federal Reserve Token that most Americans \n     refer to as the Dollar has declined.\n       It has declined because of the overprinting by the Federal \n     Reserve who at Congresses request asks them to print more so \n     they can borrow these fictitious dollars and pay back the \n     private bankers called the Federal Reserve at an amazing \n     profit.\n       When you measure gas prices and food prices against real \n     money as defined by our constitution, i.e. Gold and Silver, \n     gas in real terms is about a $1.60 in 2000 terms.\n       One could argue that the price of Gold has also gone up in \n     price but that is missing the point. Money as defined is a \n     store of labor. A dollar as defined by our constitution is \n     25.8 grains of gold. You cannot inflate or deflate gold or \n     silver. They are what they are. Sound. The Federal Reserve \n     Tokens most Americans refer to as dollars, on the other hand \n     is printed as fast or as slow as the government who borrows \n     it. The Federal Reserve then charges interest on something \n     that has been created out of thin air. What a business that \n     has got to be. That is why the founders established a sound \n     currency backed by gold. In 1913 Congress fell for a scheme \n     to take the people's money. In 1929 Roosevelt created a \n     banking holiday to convince the people that taking sound \n     money from them would save the country. The people obviously \n     confused by the recent events and nearly 20 years of \n     advertising by the Federal Reserve Banksters were convinced \n     that they should give up good money for worthless paper \n     currency.\n       Let me give you an analogy most Americans might understand. \n     Let us assume you are playing monopoly. We will give you a \n     special player's piece let us call it the pig. The pig is \n     playing like all the other players, however you, as the pig \n     get to the coveted piece of real estate called Boardwalk. On \n     realizing that you don't have enough money to buy Boardwalk \n     you simply take some from the bank (Federal Reserve) and buy \n     it. Now the other players (THE People of the U.S.) that you \n     are playing with do not see you do this. However, after many \n     more rolls of dice you seem to never run short of money. You \n     simply go to the Federal Reserve and grab some more monopoly \n     money. Now other players cannot seem to keep up. Their money \n     is worthless. IN fact you have so much you simply bid up the \n     price of anything you want to buy. This of course creates a \n     huge disadvantage but you don't care you are the Pig, er \n     government. Now the bank is asking for you to begin making \n     those huge interest payments so now rather than the other \n     players getting $200 when they pass go you pass a new rule \n     and the other players get a bill for $200. Doesn't seem \n     fair does it? Well that is what you and the other \n     congressmen have been doing for the last 90+ years.\n       So here we are today with Congress borrowing paper currency \n     or debt instruments that the Federal Reserve gets to charge \n     the people interest on. This Business by the banksters is \n     something for nothing Banking Scam.\n       Real Money, Gold and Silver, does not change over time. It \n     is sound, it is fair and when this country was founded some \n     230 years ago it changed an economy that was in the shambles \n     to one of stability.\n       Today what does change is how many dollars Congress borrows \n     to fund the occupation in Iraq, Afghanistan and the other 700 \n     bases we have around the world.\n       The only real solution to this is to go back to a Gold \n     Standard, and abolish the Federal Reserve, which is neither \n     Federal nor are there any reserves. This private banking \n     system, coupled with you and congresses overspending is what \n     has put our economy in a tailspin that is much like the \n     created disaster of 1929 and 1979.\n       Now the world no longer wants our debt and since we have no \n     real money to pay it back with. The solution is to get back \n     to a gold backed currency that the world can respect and \n     trust.\n       It is nice that you congressmen and women point fingers as \n     to the symptoms of the problem but you need to be pointing \n     the fingers at yourselves who have allowed the problem. You \n     have allowed President Bush and Dick Cheney, to run amuk with \n     a blank check book spending money on a war that was never \n     approved by the spineless Congress.\n       You can pass all the laws and resolutions you wish but they \n     are just window dressing. Until we get sound money and \n     Congress takes responsibility for allowing Dick Cheney to run \n     the white house then we will continue to see our wealth \n     erode.\n       My hope is that you pull all the troops home, shut down all \n     the bases and put this country on a sound money system by \n     eliminating the Federal Reserve. Until you stop printing and \n     spending Federal Reserve Tokens on guns and butter the dollar \n     will continue its free fall until the people's wealth has \n     been confiscated by the over printing of the currency.\n       May God bless you Congressman if you stand up to this \n     charade created so long ago. For our country to survive you \n     must take a stand.\n       If you don't take a stand, if no one stands up for the \n     values our founders instituted so long ago, then I fear that \n     our country will become just like other 3rd world countries \n     whose governments have stolen the people blind with fiat \n     currencies like what we have here in the United States.\n       Good Luck.\n     David DeHaas.\n                                  ____\n\n       Like you or any other politician in DC really cares about \n     the common folk who sent them there. You all could have set \n     forth changes to allow more exploration and development of \n     our own oil/gas in such areas as off the coasts and in ANWR \n     but you didn't. So I ask you again why bother acting like you \n     care, you don't pay for gas in your car or try to buy fuel to \n     run your farm or truck.\n     Albert Morrison, Ammon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/13/senate-section/article/S336-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S336-S337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-435.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to require energy \ncommodities to be traded only on regulated markets, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, over the past half year, as the \nprice of a barrel of oil has rocketed into the sky--all the way to $147 \na barrel and in 1 day the price escalating $25--there have been a \nnumber of Senators on this floor and in committee meetings and in \nprivate discussions saying: Why won't people wake up and realize it is \nnot the economic marketplace of supply and demand that is determining \nthe price of oil? Who wants us to believe that? The oil companies, of \ncourse. In fact, the price of oil has escalated not because there is a \ntightness on the world marketplace of demand for oil. Indeed, at the \nvery time of a 6-month period from the last quarter of last year until \nthe first quarter of 2008--that 6-month period when the demand for oil \nwas going down and the supply was going up, which would indicate the \nprice should be going down if supply is greater than demand--exactly \nthe reverse was true. The price kept rocketing to the Moon.\n  It defied the laws of supply and demand. Yet we had everybody running \nout saying, ``Oh, it is the tight world marketplace,'' and it was \ndifficult to get people to listen to a group of Senators who said it \nwas because the commodities futures exchanges had been deregulated and, \ntherefore, unregulated oil futures contracts speculation was running \nwild.\n  Then, once it got up to $147 a barrel, what happened? The liquidity \ncrisis hit, the economic crisis of confidence hit--not only in America \nbut across the world. A lot of this was precipitated by the faulty \nmortgages, the subprime mortgages we are now not paying off in the \nrevenue stream because people weren't paying their mortgages. Those \nmortgages had been bundled into securities and then bought and sold, \nand a lot of financial institutions, hedge funds, mutual funds and, \nindeed, big investments for pension funds started dumping those because \nthey needed cash, and they started dumping their positions on oil \nfutures commodities that they had purchased in this speculative frenzy \nthat ran the price up to $147 a barrel. What happened? The exact \nreverse. The price of oil starts coming down. So what should we do \nabout this? Well, we ought to do what a number of us have been saying: \nWe ought to go back and reregulate what we have jurisdiction over, \nwhich is the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.\n\n  Now, why was it deregulated? It was deregulated in the dead of night \nbefore Christmas in the year 2000, and it was deregulated at the behest \nof the Enron Corporation. And once they deregulated that commodities \nfutures trading market on energy, it allowed them to go out and \nspeculate on energy contracts. What was the first result? In the early \npart of this decade we saw it happen in California. We saw the \nelectricity contracts start a runup in speculative bidding, to which it \nwent up--the cost of electricity--by as high as 300 percent in \nCalifornia. Once that started to unravel, then we know what happened: \nEnron started to unravel with all the shenanigans that had gone on \nthere.\n  But here we are 7 and 8 years later, after the law was changed, and \nwe haven't been able to get it changed back because people come out \nhere and say: Oh, it is supply and demand in the world market for oil, \nand they come up with a simple slogan, as if that was going to handle \nthe price of oil when it was hitting $147 and translated into about $4-\ngallon-gasoline. Their simple little slogan was ``drill baby, drill,'' \nas if that were going to solve the problem of the price of gasoline and \nthe price of oil.\n  But now we hear--and people are starting to pay attention--we ought \nto reregulate this futures commodities trading. Now, what do we mean by \nregulate? I am talking about simple little things, such as you would \nhave to use the oil that you are bidding on, such as an airline does. \nIt locks in a future price for fuel by bidding on these future oil \ncontracts. An airline, in fact, does use oil. By taking away the \nregulation, they have removed that ability. Or to give another example \nof regulation: A Commodities Futures Trading Commission could say you \nhave to put a certain amount of money down if you are going to buy a \nfuture oil contract. Instead of getting it with nothing down, you have \nto put some skin in the game. But if you completely deregulate it, what \nyou leave it to is the speculator to go in and bid that price up and up \nand up.\n  Now, this is what we have been saying on the floor of this Senate for \nthe last 6 or 8 months, a number of us--Senator Dorgan, Senator \nCantwell, this Senator, and several other Senators--but it has been \nhard to get an audience that would listen. Well, no less a respected \ninstitution than CBS News ``60 Minutes'' last Sunday night broke it \nopen and put it about as clearly as I have ever heard in posing this \nquestion: Did speculation fuel oil price swings?\n  And what they concluded was that 6 months ago, when oil hit its \nalltime high of $147, and gas was up around $4 a gallon, it created a \nfrenzy that fed into irrational and false claims that the problem was \njust supply and demand and that the solution was to drill for more oil.\n  Well, it looks a lot different now. That frenzy that got mixed up in \nPresidential politics as well, with those simplified mantras of ``drill \nbaby, drill,'' fueled by a slick public relations campaign, that was \nfunded by deep-pocket oil companies. Yet those same oil companies \ntestified in the spring of 2008 that if supply and demand were the sole \ndriver of oil prices, that oil should cost no more than $55 a barrel. \nWe had executives of two of the big major oil companies say the normal \nlaws of supply and demand would say that oil ought to be in the range \nof $55 to $65 a barrel, and they testified, this Senator thinks, \ncorrectly.\n  So ask yourself: Could supply and demand justify the wild swings in \nprices? And in that one instance where oil jumped $25 in 1 day for a \nbarrel of oil, ask yourself: Could the new oil demands by China and \nIndia, that have needs for new oil products, could that have suddenly \ncaused that price to jump so much in a single day? And the answer, \nclearly, is: No. It was speculation that caused that bubble to grow. \nWall Street investors shifted billions of dollars out of the stock \nmarket and into the commodities futures market\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\nand ultimately into oil, and that is what was the biggest driver of \nrunning up the price of oil and gasoline.\n  What is even more powerful in demonstrating the influence of \nspeculators on oil prices is examining what happened to those prices \nafter we in the Senate, and down at the other end of the Capitol in the \nHouse, started threatening regulation again. Well, guess what happened. \nThe prices went down. When Wall Street experienced a financial meltdown \nwith the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the near collapse of AIG, \nprices fell even more as the Wall Street speculators got out of the oil \nfutures markets to the tune of $70 billion. The speculative bubble in \ncommodities, which was not only energy but agricultural commodities, \nall of a sudden bubble popped.\n  Demand for oil in the United States is down by 5 percent, but the \nprice of oil is down 75 percent. So we shouldn't be fooled by the drop \nin prices. Some financial analysts, fortunately, are not fooled by the \ndrop in prices. They are advising investors that low oil prices are a \ntemporary phenomenon and that oil prices will average above $75 a \nbarrel over the next 5 years.\n  Well, a number of us, months ago, filed a bill to stop the trading of \noil and other energy commodities on the unregulated exchanges, and what \nthe bill does is it turns the clock back to a change in law that was \npushed by the Enron Corporation, known as the Enron loophole, which \nopened the way for a flood of speculative money in these commodity \nmarkets. I am introducing that bill again today, and I seek our \ncolleagues' support.\n  We must be vigilant to ensure that Wall Street investors do not take \nadvantage of the lax regulation to reap profits by driving up the price \nof oil and making driving a lot more expensive for the rest of us. Let \nus remember that we saw what happened with another form of unregulated \nfinancial instruments. That was those insurance policies that had a \nfancy name, called credit default swaps. They were unregulated. Look \nwhat happened: The collapse of AIG that had to come in to the tune of \nupward of a $100 billion rescue from the Federal Government. I don't \nbelieve it is simple coincidence that the same legislation that let \nthose credit default swaps escape regulation also allowed energy \ntraders to conduct their business in the shadows. We need to bring that \nindustry out of the darkness and into the full light of day.\n  Mr. President, I wish to quote a couple lines from this Sunday's \ninterview on CBS News ``60 Minutes.'' A representative of the Petroleum \nMarketers Association is interviewed, a Mr. Gilligan, and he says:\n\n       Approximately 60 to 70 percent of the oil contracts in the \n     futures markets are now held by speculative entities, not by \n     the companies that need oil, not by the airlines, not by the \n     oil companies, but by investors that are looking to make \n     money from their speculative positions.\n\n  Now, that is a representative of the oil companies that said that. \nFurthermore, the investigative reporter, Steve Kroft, quotes a fellow \nnamed Michael Masters, and he states:\n\n       In a five-year period, Masters said the amount of money \n     institutional investors, hedge funds and the big Wall Street \n     banks had placed in the commodities markets went from $13 \n     billion to $300 billion. Last year, 27 barrels of crude were \n     being traded every day on the New York Mercantile Exchange \n     for every 1 barrel of oil that was actually being consumed in \n     the United States.\n\n  That is Mr. Kroft's analysis on ``60 Minutes,'' and he was referring \nto a former Wall Street trader named Michael Masters.\n  I wish to end by further quoting Mr. Kroft from 60 Minutes:\n\n       A recent report out of MIT analyzing world oil production \n     and consumption also concluded that the basic fundamentals of \n     supply and demand could not have been responsible for last \n     year's runup in oil prices.\n\n  Another quote from an interviewee: ``From quarter four of '07 until \nthe second quarter of '08''--that is a 6-month period--``the Energy \nInformation Administration said that supply went up, worldwide supply \nwent up, and worldwide demand went down . . . This was the period of \nthe spike'' in oil prices ``so you had the largest price increase in \nhistory during a time when actual demand was going down and actual \nsupply was going up during that same period. The only thing that makes \nsense that lifted the price was investor demand''--in other words, the \nspeculators making an artificial demand.\n  I think it is clear. That is why I am introducing this legislation. I \nlook forward with great optimism to the passage of this kind of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na ``60 Minutes'' transcript be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 221\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In a year's time, a commodity that was \n     theoretically priced according to supply and demand, doubled \n     from $69 a barrel to nearly $150. And then, in a period of \n     just three months, crashed along with the stock market. So \n     what happened? It's a complicated question, and there are \n     lots of theories. But many people believe it was a \n     speculative bubble, not unlike the one that caused the \n     housing crisis, and that it had more to do with traders and \n     speculators on Wall Street than with oil company executives \n     or sheiks in Saudi Arabia.\n       (Oil refinery; workers at refinery; stock market traders on \n     floor; New York Mercantile Exchange; trading screen; farmer \n     working field; corn; airplane; trading screen; oil refinery)\n       (Voiceover) To understand what happened to the price of \n     oil, you first have to understand the way it's traded. For \n     years it's been bought and sold on something called the \n     commodities futures market. Here at the New York Mercantile \n     Exchange, it's traded alongside cotton and coffee, copper and \n     steel by brokers who buy and sell contracts to deliver those \n     goods at a certain price at some date in the future. It was \n     created so that farmers could gauge what their unharvested \n     crops would be worth months in advance so that factories \n     could lock in the best price for raw materials, and airlines \n     could manage their fuel costs. But more than a year ago, that \n     market started to behave erratically. And when oil doubled to \n     more than $147 a barrel, no one was more suspicious than Dan \n     Gilligan.\n       Mr. Dan Gilligan: We have to make sure that the futures \n     market is an honest market.\n       (Dan Gilligan speaking; men listening to Gilligan; oil \n     tanker; Gilligan; crowd talking to Gilligan; stock market \n     traders)\n       Kroft: (Voiceover) As the president of the Petroleum \n     Marketers Association, he represents more than 8,000 retail \n     and wholesale suppliers, everyone from home heating oil \n     companies to gas station owners. When we talked to him last \n     summer, his members were getting blamed for gouging the \n     public,\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\n     even though their costs had also gone through the roof. He \n     told us the problem was in the commodities markets, which had \n     been invaded by a new breed of investor.\n       Mr. Gillian: Approximately 60 to 70 percent of the oil \n     contracts in the futures markets are now held by speculative \n     entities, not by companies that need oil, not by the \n     airlines, not by the oil companies, but by investors that are \n     looking to make money from the speculative positions.\n       Kroft: They don't actually take delivery of the oil?\n       Mr. Gilligan: No, no.\n       Kroft: All they do is----\n       Mr. Gilligan: All they do is buy the paper and hope that \n     they can sell it for more than they paid for it before they \n     have to take delivery.\n       Kroft: They're trying to make money on the market for oil?\n       Mr. Gilligan: Absolutely, on the volatility that exists in \n     the market. They make it going up and down.\n       (Sean Cota unhooking hose from truck; Cota filling tank; \n     calculator)\n       Kroft: (Voiceover) He says his members in the home heating \n     oil business, like Sean Cota of Bellows Falls, Vermont, were \n     the first to notice the effects a few years ago, when prices \n     seemed to disconnect from the basic fundamentals of supply \n     and demand. Cota says there was plenty of product at the \n     supply terminals, but the prices kept going up and up.\n       Mr. Sean Cota: We've had three price changes during the day \n     where we pick up products, actually don't know what we paid \n     for, and we'll go out and we'll sell that to the retail \n     customer, guessing at what the price was. The volatility is \n     being driven by the huge amounts of money and the huge \n     amounts of leverage that is going into these markets.\n       (Michael Masters at desk; computer screen)\n       Kroft: (Voiceover) About the same time hedge fund manager \n     Michael Masters reached the same conclusion. Masters' \n     expertise is in tracking the flow of investments into and out \n     of financial markets, and he noticed huge amounts of money \n     leaving stocks for commodities and oil futures, most of it \n     going into index funds, betting that the price of oil was \n     going to go up.\n       Who was buying this paper oil, pension fund?\n       Mr. Michael Masters: California pension fund, Harvard \n     endowment, lots of large institutional investors. And by the \n     way, other investors, hedge funds, Wall Street trading desk, \n     were following right behind them putting money, sovereign \n     wealth funds were putting money in the futures markets, as \n     well. So you had all these investors putting money in the \n     futures markets, and that was driving the price up.\n       (New York Stock Exchange; stock traders; oil refinery)\n       Kroft: (Voiceover) In a five-year period, Masters said the \n     amount of money institutional, investors, hedge funds and the \n     big Wall Street banks had placed in the commodities markets \n     went from $13 billion to 300 billion. Last year, 27 barrels \n     of crude were being traded every day on the New York \n     Mercantile Exchange for every one barrel of oil that was \n     actually being consumed in the United States.\n       Mr. Masters: We talked to the largest physical trader of \n     crude oil, and they told us that, compared to the size of the \n     investment inflows--and remember, this is the largest \n     physical crude oil trader in the United States--they said \n     that, ``We are basically a flea on an elephant,'' that that's \n     how big these flows were.\n       (Senate hearings; Lawrence Eagles)\n       Kroft: (Voiceover) Yet when Congress began holding hearings \n     last summer and asked Wall Street banker Lawrence Eagles of \n     JPMorgan what role excessive speculation played in rising oil \n     prices, the answer was little to none.\n       Mr. Lawrence Eagles: We believe that high energy prices are \n     fundamentally a result of supply and demand.\n       (JPMorgan building; e-mail; oil refinery; oil tank; oil \n     register)\n       Kroft: (Voiceover) As it turns out, not even JPMorgan's \n     chief global investment officer agreed with him.

If anyone had any \n     doubts, they were dispelled a few days after that hearing, \n     when the price of oil jumped $25 in a single day.\n       September 22nd.\n       Mr. Michael Greenberger: September 22nd.\n       (Michael Greenberger; CFTC building; oil pipelines)\n       Kroft: (Voiceover) Michael Greenberger, a former director \n     of trading for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the \n     federal agency that oversees oil futures, says there were no \n     supply disruptions that could have justified such a big \n     increase.\n       Mr. Greenberger: Did China and India suddenly have gigantic \n     needs for new oil products in a single day? No. Everybody \n     agrees supply-demand could not drive the price up $25, which \n     was a record increase in the price of oil. The price of oil \n     went from somewhere in the 60s to $147 in a--less than a \n     year. And we were being told on that runup, it's supply-\n     demand, supply-demand, supply-demand.\n       (Oil refinery; Masters; woman talking; Masters)\n       Kroft: (Voiceover) A recent report out of MIT analyzing \n     world oil production and consumption also concluded that the \n     basic fundamentals of supply and demand could not have been \n     responsible for last year's runup in oil prices. And Michael \n     Masters says the US Department of Energy's own statistics \n     showed that if the markets had been working properly the \n     price of oil should have been going down, not up.\n       Mr. Masters: From quarter four of '07 until the second \n     quarter of '08, the EIA, the Energy Information \n     Administration said that supply went up, worldwide supply \n     went up, and worldwide demand went down. So you have supply \n     going up and demand going down, which generally means that \n     price is going down.\n       Kroft: And this was the period of the spike?\n       Mr. Masters: This was the period of the spike. So you had \n     the largest price increase in history during a time when \n     actual demand was going down and actual supply was going up \n     during the same period. However, the only thing that makes \n     sense that lifted the price was investor demand.\n       (Oil refinery; buildings)\n       Kroft: (Voiceover) Masters believes the investor demand for \n     commodities and oil futures in particular, was created on \n     Wall Street by hedge funds and the big Wall Street investment \n     banks like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and \n     JPMorgan, who made billions investing hundreds of billions of \n     dollars of their clients' money.\n       Mr. Masters: The investment banks facilitated it. You know, \n     they found folks to write papers espousing the benefits of \n     investing in commodities. And then they promoted commodities \n     as a, quote-unquote, ``asset class.'' Like, you could invest \n     in commodities just like you could in stocks or bonds or \n     anything else, like they were suitable for long-term \n     investment.\n       (Gilligan)\n       Kroft: (Voiceover) Dan Gilligan of the Petroleum Marketers \n     Association agreed.\n       Are you saying that companies like Goldman Sachs and Morgan \n     Stanley and Barclays have as much to do with the price of oil \n     going up as Exxon or Shell?\n       Mr. Gilligan: Oh, absolutely. Yes. I tease people sometimes \n     that, you know, people say, ``Well, who's the largest oil \n     company in American?'' And they'll always say ``Well, \n     ExxonMobil or Chevron or BP.'' But I'll say, ``no, Morgan \n     Stanley.''\n       (Morgan Stanley building; flow chart of Morgan Stanley \n     ownerships)\n       Kroft: (Voiceover) Morgan Stanley isn't an oil company in \n     the traditional sense of the word.

And the reason I can't say is \n     because nobody knows. Our federal regulators don't have \n     access to the data.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe national limitation on qualified energy conservation bonds and to \nclarify that certain programs constitute a qualified conservation \npurpose, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, over the past few days I have introduced \na series of bills that are part of my E4 Initiative, dubbed E4 because \nof its focus on economy, employment, education, and energy. Today I am \nintroducing two bills that are part of this effort: the Community \nRevitalization Energy Conservation, CREC, Act of 2009 and the Energy \nand Technology Advancement, ETA, Act of 2009.\n  The newest among my E4 bills is the Community Revitalization Energy \nConservation, CREC, Act of 2009. This bill will increase the amount of \nfunding available to State and local governments for the rehabilitation \nand revitalization of the fledgling green economy, and also expand the \ntypes of eligible projects to cover energy efficiency improvements to \nprivately owned buildings. While our country is facing its greatest \neconomic challenge since the Great Depression, we have a tremendous \nopportunity to create jobs critical to addressing the energy challenges \nwe face. The CREC Act amends the recently authorized Qualified Energy \nConservation Bond, QECB, program to increase funding for important \npublic-private partnerships to significantly invest in energy \nefficiency and conservation, a key national priority. It also offers \nStates and local governments the opportunity to create jobs and \nstimulate their local economies.\n  First, my bill will more than quadruple the amount of bonds that can \nbe issued under the Qualified Energy Conservation Bond program--\nincreasing the program from $800 million to $3.6 billion. This will \nprovide the opportunity for private investors to partner with State and \nlocal governments to fund energy investments through State and locally \nissued tax credit bonds. As we give private investors the opportunity \nto participate in the green economy through Qualified Energy \nConservation Bonds, we signal to the market that the Federal Government \nwill continue to affirm the importance of investment in energy \nefficiency and conservation, as well as the development of new energy \ntechnologies. Helping these new energy technologies thrive is not only \na promising way to develop the next generation of energy technology to \nreduce our energy consumption, it will also help to spur job creation \nas State and local governments embark on capital improvements.\n  Increasing the size of the program will support funding for eligible \nprojects including energy efficiency improvements of publicly owned \nbuildings; rural development of electricity from renewable sources; \nresearch facilities or grants for renewable technologies such as \nadvanced automobile battery technology and nonfossil fuels; mass \ncommuting facilities that reduce energy consumption; or financing \nqualified energy production projects such as wind, biomass, geothermal, \nlandfill gas, and solar.\n  Secondly, my bill expands the types of eligible programs to ones that \nreduce energy consumption in privately owned buildings. It would allow \nStates and local governments to help homeowners and businesses make \nimprovements such as heating-fuel saving measures; electricity-saving \nmeasures; on-site renewable energy generating devices; or water-saving \nmeasures that reduce the energy use of the owner, renter or water \nprovider. Gains in efficiency savings between 20-30 percent are easily \nachievable through improving lighting, insulation, HVAC equipment and \ncontrols for these items. These measures are often one-time and low \nmaintenance or maintenance free once they have been installed. In terms \nof costs, implementing efficiency measures only costs about 3 cents per \nkWh of energy saved while implementing wind and solar projects can cost \nat least two to three times more.\n  Importantly, my bill will increase the success of these energy \nefficiency and conservation programs by ensuring the Qualified Energy \nConservation Bond program can be used to promote novel payment \nstructures in order to reduce the prohibitive upfront costs that \nhomeowners and businesses must pay for energy efficiency and \nconservation upgrades. By eliminating expensive up-front costs for \nhomeowners and businesses, we can eliminate one of the main obstacles \nto making significant energy efficiency gains. Furthermore, we can \nvirtually eliminate what homeowners and businesses have to pay for the \nefficiency and conservation upgrades by not increasing their out-of-\npocket expenses. For example, States and local governments can work \nwith electric and water utilities to bill individuals or businesses \nmonthly for the cost of the efficiency improvements based on the \nsavings they receive. The payment for the efficiency improvements each \nmonth will be no more than the monthly energy-savings realized by the \nimprovements, thereby keeping their monthly payments the same as before \nthe energy improvements.\n  The Center on Wisconsin Strategy states that buildings account for 40 \npercent of total U.S. energy consumption, 70 percent of U.S. \nelectricity consumption, and 43 percent of U.S. carbon emissions, a \nlarger share than either transportation or industry. It is possible \nthat the U.S. could realize more than $200 billion in annual savings \nfrom improved building efficiency alone. However, one of the challenges \nassociated with implementing building efficiency measures is its \nprohibitive cost. Unfortunately, poor households devote a \ndisproportionate share of income to home energy costs, often upwards of \n10 percent, because they have less income and tend to live in less \nefficient buildings and use less efficient appliances. Through building \nretrofits we have the potential to generate about 10 person years of \nemployment in direct installation of efficiency measures and another 3-\n4 person years in the production of relevant materials for every $1 \nmillion spent on retrofits\n  Large cities and counties with populations over 100,000 would be \neligible for Wisconsin's share, $65.7 million, that my bill would allow \nfor. Eligible local governments in Wisconsin include: Milwaukee, \nMadison, Green Bay, and the counties of Milwaukee, Dane, Waukesha, \nBrown, Racine, Outagamie, Kenosha, Winnebago, Rock, Marathon, \nWashington, Sheboygan, La Crosse, and Walworth.\n  I commend the city of Milwaukee and the Center on Wisconsin \nStrategy--they have already begun to develop a\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\nprogram to address retrofitting residential buildings with energy \nefficiency measures through Me2--Milwaukee Energy Efficiency. COWS' \ninitial estimates suggest if you could retrofit nearly all of the \nexisting housing stock in Milwaukee, an initial investment of just \nunder $250 million could result in annual energy savings of over $80 \nmillion. Examples of other cities that are tackling the issue of energy \nefficiency in residential buildings include Berkeley, CA; Babylon, NY; \nand Brookhaven, NY.\n  All of these efforts to conserve energy require investments in time \nand money. By combining efforts on two of the challenges that we \ncurrently face--energy and employment--we can create great \nopportunities. Energy efficiency and conservation are in our national \ninterest for our long term economic well-being, for the health and \nsafety of our citizens and the world as we mitigate the effects of \nclimate change, and for our independence and security.\n  I have urged the Treasury Department to quickly issue regulations for \nthe Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds so the initial program can get \nup and running. Once regulations are finalized, States and local \ngovernments can begin applying to receive an allotment of the bonds to \npursue projects that may have been shelved in our struggling economy.\n  The second energy bill I am introducing as part of my E4 Initiative \nis the Energy and Technology Advancement Act. This bill will increase \npartnerships between the Federal Government and businesses to help spur \nthe commercialization of energy, forestry, and other technologies--in \nother words, to increase the ETA, or estimated time of arrival, for \nbringing new technologies to market.\n  Particularly in the area of energy, we must do more to make new \nenergy solutions, like next generation biofuels, a reality. My bill \nwill help make the Federal Government a better business partner for the \nmany businesses that are researching and developing innovative \ntechnology solutions our country needs. We are squandering the Federal \ninvestment of billions into research and development by not doing \nenough to prevent new technologies from sitting on the shelf or being \nshipped to another country. Helping these new energy technologies get \noff the ground is not only a promising way to develop the next \ngeneration of energy technology that will help break our addition to \noil, it will also help to spur job creation and enhance rural \ndevelopment.\n  One obstacle identified by the Forest Service's Wisconsin-based \nForest Products Lab which conducts forestry and energy technology \nresearch with businesses and others, is lack of Federal support for \nmoving technologies from the research and development phase to \ncommercialization. My bill will bridge this gap by authorizing the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, USDA, which includes the Forest Service, to \nwork with businesses and provide access to resources to assist with \ngetting technologies to market.\n  By encouraging the USDA to act as a ``business incubator,'' we can \nincrease the rate of success and reduce the length of time for bringing \ntechnologies to the market. By providing a bridge to move new \ntechnologies beyond the research and development phase to \ncommercialization, the Federal Government will accelerate the \ndevelopment of new technologies and create increased opportunities for \nsmall businesses, local and State government, and others.\n  All energy, forestry, and other technologies will benefit from my ETA \nAct because it will help new technologies come to the market. It does \nso by promoting the Federal Government as a better business incubator, \nencouraging the USDA to provide business support services, and \nauthorizing USDA employees and private-sector employees to work \ntogether in Federal or private experimental or product facilities. My \nbill will also increase cooperation between the Federal Government and \ninnovative businesses by encouraging the USDA to allow rental of \nFederal equipment and property for the development of new technology.\n  Lastly, a specific partnership encouraged by my Energy and Technology \nAdvancement Act will spur the commercialization of biofuels. My bill \nrequires the USDA to pursue a biorefinery pilot plant that will allow \nbusinesses to partner with the Federal Government to test various \nbiofuels technologies derived from a variety of feedstocks, including \nwoody and agriculture waste.\n  Certainly one of today's greatest challenges--energy--is also one of \ntomorrow's greatest opportunities. Today, the transportation sector \naccounts for 70% of our oil consumption. However, there are promising \nefforts to significantly lessen our dependence on oil by reducing fuel \nconsumption through increased efficiency and by aggressively pursuing \nrenewable fuels, or biofuels. The commercialization of biofuels will \nalso create job opportunities, support rural development and industries \nsuch as forestry, and develop the next generation of fuels that are \nsustainable and from diverse sources.\n  Given our current dire fiscal situation, it is more important then \never that we are careful stewards of taxpayer dollars. Not only are \nboth of these new bills fully offset, so as not to worsen our current \nFederal deficit; they actually provide over a billion dollars in \ndeficit reduction. That's yet another reason to pass them, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to do just that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr TESTER (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 226. A bill to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs \noutpatient clinic in Havre, Montana, as the Merrill Lundman Department \nof Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nBaucus to introduce legislation honoring a Montana veteran named \nMerrill Lundman.\n  Merrill was not a general officer. He did not become famous in \nbattle, or wealthy in his civilian life. After serving in the Army, he \ncame home to north-central Montana to work on the family farm and, \nlater, for 20 years for the BNSF railroad. Some people might say he was \njust an ordinary man who served his country in the Army for three \nyears, and then came home to work to live most of his days on the Hi-\nLine, a strip of U.S. Highway 2 in Montana that cuts across the prairie \nnear the northern border.\n  But because of Merrill Lundman, thousands of veterans in and around \nHavre, Montana, can expect to get their VA medical care a little bit \ncloser to home. You see, for the last several years of his life, \nMerrill devoted his time and his energy to pushing the VA to open a new \ncommunity based outpatient clinic in Havre. And today, his dream has \nbecome a reality.\n  I am sorry that Merrill Lundman is not with us today to celebrate \nthis day. He died just over one year ago, on December 22, 2007. Less \nthan a month later, the VA announced its intention to establish a \nclinic in Havre.\n  The data says that veterans who live in rural areas don't live as \nlong--or as well--as their urban peers. That's because it's harder to \nget to the VA facility that may be hundreds of miles away--especially \nthis time of year when snow and ice can make travel in Montana \ntreacherous. I don't know if Merrill knew this, but he sensed that his \nfellow veterans were getting a raw deal, and he didn't hesitate to tell \nthe VA and his congressional delegation.\n  The story of this clinic is a grassroots effort led by one man who \nstood up for his fellow band of brothers to make sure that they can get \nthe care that they have earned. And to honor that effort, Senator \nBaucus and I are proud to introduce this legislation, and I look \nforward to working with Chairman Akaka to move this bill quickly \nthrough the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 227. A bill to establish the Harriet Tubman National Historical \nPark in Auburn, New York, and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad \nNational Historical Park in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties, \nMaryland, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce The Harriet \nTubman National Historical Park and The Harriet Tubman Underground\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\nRailroad National Historical Park Act. I am joined by Mrs. Clinton, Ms. \nMikulski, and Mr. Schumer as original co-sponsors. We originally \nintroduced nearly identical legislation last summer, but the press of \nlegislative business did not allow for consideration of this important \nlegislation. This year we will work for its prompt consideration and \nenactment.\n  The woman, who is known to us as Harriet Tubman, was born Araminta \n``Minty'' Ross approximately 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland. She \nspent nearly 30 years of her life as a slave on Maryland's Eastern \nShore. As an adult she took the first name Harriet, and when she was 25 \nshe married John Tubman.\n  Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849. She did so in the dead \nof night, navigating the maze of tidal streams and wetlands that are a \nhallmark of Maryland's Eastern Shore. She did so alone, demonstrating \ncourage, strength and fortitude that became her hallmarks. Not \nsatisfied with attaining her own freedom, she returned repeatedly for \nmore than 10 years to the places of her enslavement in Dorchester and \nCaroline counties where, under the most adverse conditions, she led \naway many family members and other slaves to their freedom. Tubman \nbecame known as ``Moses'' by African-Americans and white abolitionists. \nShe was perhaps the most famous and most important conductor in the \nnetwork of resistance known as the Underground Railroad.\n  During the Civil War, Tubman served the Union forces as a spy, a \nscout and a nurse. She served in Virginia, Florida, and South Carolina. \nShe is credited with leading hundreds of slaves from those slave States \nto freedom during those years.\n  Following the Civil War, Tubman settled in Auburn, NY. There she was \nactive in the women's suffrage movement, and she also established the \none of the first incorporated homes for aged African-Americans. In 1903 \nshe bequeathed the home to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church \nin Auburn. Harriet Tubman died in Auburn in 1913 and she is buried \nthere in the Fort Hill Cemetery.\n  Slaves were forced to live in primitive buildings even though many \nwere skilled tradesmen who constructed the substantial homes of their \nowners. Not surprisingly, few of the structures associated with the \nearly years of Tubman's life still stand. The landscapes of the Eastern \nShore of Maryland, however, remain evocative of the time that Tubman \nlived there. Farm fields and forests dot the landscape, which is also \nnotable for its extensive network of tidal rivers and wetlands. In \nparticular, a number of properties including the homestead of Ben Ross, \nher father, Stewart's Canal, where he worked, the Brodess Farm, where \nshe worked as a slave, and others are within the boundaries of the \nBlackwater National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Similarly, Poplar Neck, the plantation from which she escaped to \nfreedom, is still largely intact in Caroline County. The properties in \nTalbot County, immediately across the Choptank River from the \nplantation, are today protected by various conservation easements. Were \nshe alive today, Tubman would recognize much of the landscape that she \nknew intimately as she secretly led black men, women and children to \ntheir freedom.\n\n  In New York, on the other hand, many of the buildings associated with \nTubman's life remain intact. Her personal home, as well as the Tubman \nHome for the Aged, the church and rectory of the Thompson Memorial AME \nZion Episcopal Church, and the Fort Hill Cemetery are all extant.\n  In 1999, the Congress approved legislation authorizing a Special \nResource Study to determine the appropriateness of establishing a unit \nof the National Park Service to honor Harriet Tubman. The Study has \ntaken an exceptionally long time to complete, in part because of the \nlack of remaining structures on Maryland's Eastern Shore. There has \nnever been any doubt that Tubman led an extraordinary life. Her \ncontributions to American history are surpassed by few. Determining the \nmost appropriate way to recognize that life and her contributions, \nhowever, as been more difficult. Eventually, the Park Service came to \nrealize that determined that a Park that would include two \ngeographically separate units would be appropriate. The New York unit \nwould include the tightly clustered Tubman buildings in Auburn. The \nMaryland portion would include large sections of landscapes that are \nevocative of Tubman's time and are historically relevant. The Harriet \nTubman National Historical Park and The Harriet Tubman Underground \nRailroad National Historical Park Act, S. 3383, was first introduced on \nJuly 31, 2008. The Special Resource Study will be finalized and \nreleased in the near future.\n  The legislation I am introducing today establishes two parks. The \nHarriet Tubman National Historical Park includes important historical \nstructures in Auburn, New York. They include Tubman's home, the Home \nfor the Aged that she established, the African Methodist Episcopal AME \nZion Church, and the Fort Hill Cemetery where she is buried.\n  The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park \nincludes historically important landscapes in Dorchester, Caroline, and \nTalbot counties, Maryland, that are evocative of the life of Harriet \nTubman. The Maryland properties include about 2,200 acres in Caroline \nCounty that comprise the Poplar Neck plantation that Tubman escaped \nfrom in 1849. The 725 acres of viewshed across the Choptank River in \nTalbot County would also be included in the Park. In Dorchester County, \nthe parcels would not be contiguous, but would include about 2,775 \nacres. All of them are included within the Blackwater National Wildlife \nRefuge boundaries or abut that resource land. The National Park Service \nwould not own any of these lands.\n  The bill authorizes $11 million in grants for the New York properties \nfor their preservation, rehabilitation, and restoration of those \nresources.\n  The bill authorizes an additional $11 million in grants for the \nMaryland section. Funds can be used for the construction of the State \nHarriet Tubman Park Visitors Center and/or for easements or acquisition \nof properties inside or adjacent to the Historical Park boundaries.\n  Finally, the bill also authorizes a new grants program. Under the \nprogram, the National Park Service would award competitive grants to \nhistorically Black colleges and universities, predominately Black \ninstitutions, and minority serving institutions for research into the \nlife of Harriet Tubman and the African-American experience during the \nyears that coincide with the life of Harriet Tubman. The legislation \nauthorizes $200,000 annually for this scholarship program.\n  Harriet Tubman was a true American patriot. She was someone for whom \nliberty and freedom were not just concepts. She lived those principles \nand shared that freedom with hundreds of others. In doing so, she has \nearned a nation's respect and honor. That is why I am so proud to \nintroduce this legislation, establishing the Harriet Tubman National \nHistorical Park and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National \nHistorical Park.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 227\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Harriet Tubman National \n     Historical Park and Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad \n     National Historical Park Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit States, at their option, to require certain individuals to \npresent satisfactory documentary evidence of proof of citizenship or \nnationality for purposes of eligibility for Medicaid, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President I rise today with my colleague Senator \nAkaka to introduce legislation today designed to make several very \nimportant changes to current law to ensure that U.S. citizens receive \nthe Medicaid to which they are entitled.\n  Since July 1, 2006, most U.S. citizens and nationals applying for or \nrenewing their Medicaid coverage face a new Federal requirement to \nprovide documentation of their citizenship status. Recent reports \nindicate that tens-of-thousands of U.S. citizens, and in particular \nchildren, inappropriately are being denied Medicaid benefits simply \nbecause they don't have access to newly required documentation. The \narticles below and report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \nhighlight this very serious problem. Hospitals, physicians, and \npharmacies may not be willing to treat these individuals until they \nhave a source of payment, but they cannot qualify for Medicaid until \nthey produce a birth certificate and ID.\n  This new Federal requirement was added to Medicaid by the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005, DRA, enacted February 8, 2006. The Tax Relief \nand Health Care Act of 2006, TRHCA, signed into law December 20, 2006, \nincluded some amendments to the DRA citizenship documentation \nrequirement, primarily to exempt certain groups. Prior to enactment of \nthe DRA, states were permitted to use their discretion in requiring \nsuch citizenship documentation.\n  Under Section 6036 of the DRA, citizens applying for or renewing \ntheir Medicaid coverage must provide ``satisfactory documentary \nevidence of citizenship or nationality.'' The DRA specifies documents \nthat are acceptable for this purpose and authorizes the HHS Secretary \nto designate additional acceptable documents. No Federal matching funds \nare available for services provided to individuals who declare they are \ncitizens or nationals unless the state obtains satisfactory evidence of \ntheir citizenship or determines that they are subject to a statutory \nexemption.\n  According to a CRS Report for Congress updated April 15, 2008, \n``Based on a recent survey by the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, 22 of 44 states report declines in enrollment due to the new \ncitizenship documentation requirement. Based on another survey by the \nKaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 13 states report a \nsignificant negative impact on enrollment and another 24 states report \na modest impact. Among seven states detailed in an earlier report from \nthe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, only Wisconsin has a data \nsystem that\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\ncan identify denials and terminations due to a lack of citizenship \ndocumentation, and it reports that about 19,000 people had their \nMedicaid eligibility denied or terminated for this reason between July \n31, 2006, and March 1, 2007.''\n  A second wave study conducted from September 2007-March 2008 by the \nDepartment of Health Policy at the George Washington University School \nof Public Health published October 2008, ``Another distressing finding \nis the impact the citizenship documentation requirements appear to be \nhaving on SCHIP. Many states, for important reasons, use joint \napplications for both Medicaid and separate SCHIP programs. The effect, \nhowever, is to apply the citizenship documentation requirements to both \nprograms, thereby delaying coverage for both groups of children.''\n  ``Even if most or all of the reported Medicaid enrollment declines \nare due to the citizenship documentation requirement, a key question is \nwhether the people who are being denied, terminated, or deterred from \napplying are U.S. citizens, rather than unauthorized aliens or other \nineligible noncitizens. Of the 22 states reporting enrollment declines \nto GAO, a majority (16 states) attribute them to Medicaid coverage \ndelays or losses for people who appear to be U.S. citizens.''\n  It is important to note that citizenship documentation requirements \ndo not affect Medicaid rules relating to immigrants--they apply to \nindividuals claiming to be citizens. Most new legal immigrants are \nexcluded from Medicaid during their first five years in the U.S. and \nundocumented immigrants remain eligible for Medicaid emergency services \nonly.\n  The legislation I am introducing would make several very important \nchanges to current law to ensure that U.S. citizens receive the \nMedicaid to which they are entitled.\n  First, the legislation would restore citizenship verification to a \nstate option. Specifically, states would be permitted to determine when \nand to what extent citizenship verification is required of U.S. \nCitizens. States would also be permitted to utilize the standards most \nappropriate to the their population as long as such standards were no \nmore stringent than those currently used by the Social Security \nAdministration and includes native American tribal documents when \nappropriate.\n  Second, the legislation would ensure that individuals are afforded a \nreasonable time period to provide citizenship documentation utilizing \nthe same reasonable time period standard that is available to legal \nimmigrants to provide satisfactory evidence of their immigration \nstatus.\n  Third, the legislation protects children who are U.S. citizens by \nvirtue of being born in the United States from being denied coverage \nafter birth because of citizenship verification requirements.\n  Fourth, the legislation also clarifies ambiguities in Federal law to \nensure that these citizen children, regardless of the immigration \nstatus of their parents, are treated like all other low-income children \nborn in the United States and are deemed eligible to receive Medicaid \nservices for one year.\n  Finally, the legislation also ensures that the thousands of citizen \nchildren and adults, who were erroneously denied Medicaid coverage, may \nreceive retroactive Medicaid eligibility for coverage they were \ninappropriately denied because of citizenship verification \nrequirements.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this critical \nlegislation, which protects low-income U.S. citizens from being \ninappropriately denied Medicaid coverage because of lack of \ndocumentation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Federal \n     health officials had considered giving states broad \n     discretion to accept affidavits in place of official \n     documents. But House Republicans complained, and the \n     administration backed off, allowing affidavits ``only in rare \n     circumstances.''\n       The requirements, which take effect July 1, carry out a law \n     signed by President Bush on Feb. 8.\n       They vividly illustrate how concern about illegal \n     immigration is affecting domestic social welfare policy. The \n     purpose of the law was to conserve federal money for \n     citizens, reducing the need for states to cut Medicaid \n     benefits or limit eligibility.\n       Gov. Rick Perry of Texas won enthusiastic applause at a \n     state Republican convention on Friday when he vowed to \n     increase border security and said, ``Texas will start \n     requiring every Medicaid applicant to verify that they are in \n     the country legally in order to receive benefits.''\n       But officials in some other states and advocates for the \n     poor said the new requirements could cause hardship for \n     children, older Americans and poor people born at home in \n     rural areas who never received birth certificates. Children \n     account for about half of Medicaid recipients. People 65 and \n     older account for about 10 percent.\n       Jennifer M. Ng'andu, a health policy specialist at the \n     National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic rights group, said, \n     ``The documentation requirements will cause confusion about \n     eligibility and will put up barriers to enrollment.''\n       In general, Medicaid is available only to United States \n     citizens and to certain ``qualified aliens.'' Before the new \n     standards, in many states, people who declared they were \n     citizens did not have to support the claim.\n       But in a letter being sent this week to state officials, \n     the Bush administration says, ``Self-attestation of \n     citizenship and identity is no longer an acceptable \n     practice.''\n       In the law, Congress listed examples of documents that \n     could be used to show citizenship, and it said the secretary \n     of health and human services could ``by regulation'' specify \n     other acceptable documents.\n       The main proponents of the new requirements were two \n     Republican House members from Georgia, Representatives \n     Charlie Norwood and Nathan Deal.\n       John E. Stone, a spokesman for Mr. Norwood, said Sunday: \n     ``Charlie provided feedback to the administration in the last \n     two weeks to make sure the regulations would not undermine \n     the intent of the law. Obviously you need some flexibility so \n     that a 92-year-old woman with Alzheimer's does not get kicked \n     off Medicaid. What's unacceptable is for people to claim \n     benefits or sign affidavits swearing they are citizens \n     without any verification.''\n       In an interview Sunday, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, \n     administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services, said, ``We want to provide an effective way to \n     document citizenship without placing excessive burdens on \n     states or beneficiaries.''\n       In the letter to state Medicaid directors, the \n     administration says, ``An applicant or recipient who fails to \n     cooperate with the state in presenting documentary evidence \n     of citizenship may be denied or terminated'' from the \n     program.\n       The requirements will be enforced when a person applies for \n     Medicaid or when eligibility is first recertified on or after \n     July 1. In general, applicants and recipients will have 45 \n     days to provide documents. People with disabilities will have \n     90 days.\n       States typically redetermine eligibility every 3 to 12 \n     months. ``Once citizenship has been proved, it need not be \n     documented again'' because it does not normally change, the \n     administration said.\n       But the guidelines include a significant ambiguity: ``An \n     individual who is already enrolled in Medicaid will remain \n     eligible if he or she showed a good-faith effort to present \n     satisfactory evidence of citizenship and identity, even if \n     this effort takes longer than 45 days.'' The administration \n     says that ``beneficiaries will not lose benefits as long as \n     they are undertaking a good-faith effort to provide \n     documentation.''\n       States have a strong incentive to enforce the requirements. \n     If they fail to do so, they can lose federal Medicaid money.\n       The guidelines say states should help people document \n     citizenship, especially if they are homeless, mentally \n     impaired or physically incapacitated and have no one to act \n     on their behalf.\n       The guidelines list four categories of documents that can \n     be used as evidence of citizenship, from the most reliable to \n     the least trustworthy. The best evidence, they say, is a \n     United States passport or a certificate of naturalization. \n     The next category includes state and local birth certificates \n     and State Department documents issued to children born abroad \n     to United States citizens.\n       The third category consists of nongovernment documents \n     showing place of birth. These include medical records from \n     doctors, hospitals and clinics; nursing home admission \n     papers; and records from life and health insurance companies.\n       The fourth category includes affidavits, which can be used \n     ``only in rare circumstances when the state is unable to \n     secure evidence of citizenship'' from other sources.\n       ``An affidavit must be supplied by at least two \n     individuals, one of whom is not related to the applicant or \n     recipient,'' the guidelines say. ``Each must attest to having \n     personal knowledge of the events establishing the applicant's \n     or recipient's claim of citizenship. The individuals making \n     the affidavit must be able to provide proof of their own \n     citizenship and identity.''\n       People signing affidavits may also be asked ``why \n     documentary evidence of citizenship does not exist or cannot \n     be readily obtained.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Birmingham News, Dec. 4, 2006]\n\n Medicaid Rules Put Pinch On Poor, Lack of Proof Needed for Plan Keeps \n                             Many From Help\n\n                           (By Kim Chandler)\n\n       The four children in her office needed immunizations. But \n     because their mother did not have their original birth \n     certificates, and couldn't buy a copy, the family could not \n     enroll in Medicaid, Dr. Marsha Raulerson said.\n       The children did not get their shots.\n       During September and October, 1,600 low-income people, many \n     of them children, were rejected by Alabama's Medicaid program \n     because of tougher federal rules. They require applicants to \n     show an original birth certificate or a copy purchased from \n     the state Health Department with a raised seal, plus a \n     driver's license or other proof of citizenship and identity \n     when signing up for Medicaid benefits.\n       Many more people eventually could lose benefits if they \n     can't produce the necessary documents.\n       The new rules took effect July 1 and are part of the 2005 \n     Deficit Reduction Act. Congress approved the law because of \n     concern that illegal immigrants were signing up for Medicaid \n     en masse. Instead of curbing widespread fraud, advocates \n     argue, the new rules deter poor U.S. citizens from getting \n     health coverage.\n       ``Under the best of circumstances, many people would be \n     surprised to have to produce documentation of their \n     citizenship,'' said Jim Carnes of Alabama Arise, an advocacy \n     group for the poor.\n       Alabama Medicaid Commissioner Carol Herrmann-Steckel said \n     the state is working hard to keep people on the Medicaid \n     rolls. Unlike some other states, Alabama is not kicking \n     current Medicaid recipients off the program if they do not \n     possess the necessary documents. Under a provision called \n     ``reasonable assurance,'' current Medicaid recipients are \n     allowed to temporarily re-enroll. Medicaid beneficiaries must \n     re-enroll every year.\n       ``We are doing everything we can to verify citizenship. We \n     want to be fair to the Alabamians who are on Medicaid,'' \n     Herrmann-Steckel said. However, federal government officials \n     have not said how long the ``reasonable assurance'' period \n     could last. The number of people who could lose Medicaid \n     benefits would be ``significant.'' Herrmann-Steckel said.\n       Medicaid is a joint federal-state health care program for \n     the poor and disabled, and it is a major provider of medical \n     care in Alabama. Medicaid pays for the health care of nearly \n     1 million Alabamians, about 20 percent of the state's \n     population, Herrmann-Steckel said.\n       Advocates fear many poor people can no longer enroll in \n     Medicaid because they cannot locate their birth certificate, \n     or afford to buy a copy, and do not have the required proof \n     of citizenship such as a photo ID.\n       The cost of obtaining a birth certificate is a challenge \n     for many low-income people, Carnes said, as is transportation \n     to present the documents. The state Department of Public \n     Health charges $12 to search for a birth certificate.\n       There is currently no way to tell if the 1,600 who were \n     denied coverage were illegal immigrants or U.S. citizens \n     without the proper documents. But anecdotal evidence from \n     Medicaid workers suggests some were just poor American \n     parents. Medicaid workers asked people who had been denied \n     coverage why they didn't have the proper paperwork.\n       ``By and large the reason was, `I can't afford to buy four \n     birth certificates,' '' said Lee Rawlinson, deputy Medicaid \n     commissioner for beneficiary services.\n       Herrmann-Steckel said the state is doing everything \n     possible to help Medicaid-eligible people obtain the \n     documents.\n       The Department of Public Health has agreed to begin faxing \n     Medicaid officials copies of birth certificates as a last \n     resort for applicants who can't obtain their own. The two \n     agencies will split the cost.\n       Transportation also is a problem for some families, Carnes \n     said. While people previously could renew their Medicaid \n     status by\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\n     mail, the new rules require a trip to see a Medicaid \n     eligibility worker in person.\n       ``There are all sorts of barriers, particularly for people \n     without transportation and who may not have had a documented \n     birth to begin with,'' Carnes said.\n       Raulerson said she cares for a family in Monroe County that \n     once had Medicaid benefits but, without a car, has not been \n     able to renew their coverage.\n       Medicaid officials say they don't know how many Alabamians \n     have lost their Medicaid benefits because they couldn't, or \n     didn't, visit an eligibility worker.\n       The Alabama Medicaid Agency is also working with other \n     state agencies, such as the Department of Mental Health and \n     Mental Retardation, to see if they've already verified a \n     person's citizenship, she said.\n       People who also receive Medicare, the health care program \n     for seniors, or Supplemental Security Income for a disability \n     were exempted from the requirements after state Medicaid \n     officials from across the country complained that would be \n     too burdensome.\n       Other states are struggling to comply as well.\n       California has yet to implement the new federal rules. \n     Vermont and other states are phasing in the regulations. \n     While the law was designed to cut down on Medicaid fraud by \n     illegal immigrants, Herrmann-Steckel said she does not \n     believe Alabama has a widespread problem of illegal aliens \n     receiving Medicaid.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              New Medicaid Rules Could Cost State Millions\n\n                            (By John Hanna)\n\n       The state could face millions of dollars in additional \n     costs because of federal rules requiring Medicaid recipients \n     to verify their citizenship, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius said \n     Wednesday.\n       Sebelius said she's worried the state will have to pick up \n     the full cost of caring for some poor, frail and elderly \n     Kansans who are living in nursing homes, instead of sharing \n     the cost with the federal government. Also, she said, she \n     will propose adding state employees to verify the citizenship \n     status of Medicaid recipients and applicants.\n       The governor told reporters she hopes Congress reviews the \n     issue and other attempts to prevent illegal immigrants from \n     obtaining social services or using driver's licenses as \n     identification.\n       ``There was no input from the states on how realistic these \n     were or what the cost was,'' Sebelius said during a brief \n     news conference following an unrelated meeting.\n       Under Medicaid requirements that took effect July 1, \n     recipients must provide either a passport or two other \n     documents, such as a birth certificate and a driver's \n     license, to verify citizenship.\n       While the measure is targeted at illegal immigrants, some \n     advocates for the needy have worried that citizens will \n     either lose or be denied services because they have trouble \n     finding the necessary documents.\n       State officials say the number of Kansans covered by \n     Medicaid dropped almost 7 percent since July 1, down to \n     253,000 from 271,000. They believe much of the decline can be \n     attributed to the new requirements.\n       Typically, every $1 the state spends on Medicaid is matched \n     by about $1.50 from the federal government. If someone loses \n     their coverage, then the state faces paying the entire bill \n     for their services, Sebelius said.\n       ``You're at 100 percent state dollars or push them out the \n     door,'' she said.\n       Also, Sebelius said, the state needs to ``ramp up'' its \n     staffing to handle the additional verification work. The \n     governor is working on the budget proposal she'll submit to \n     the 2007 Legislature, which convenes Jan. 8.\n       ``We're certainly going to put some of them in place,'' she \n     said. ``We're trying to make a careful analysis of how many \n     we need.''\n       She said that if the state refuses to comply with the law, \n     it could face the loss of all federal health care dollars.\n       ``We don't have a lot of latitude to say we're not going to \n     do this,'' she said. ``There are literally hundreds of \n     millions of dollars at stake.''\n       Meanwhile, Sebelius expressed concern about a federal law \n     on driver's licenses passed last year.\n       Starting in 2008, federal agencies won't treat a state's \n     licenses as valid ID unless a state requires license \n     applicants to document that they're living in the United \n     States legally. Lack of ID could prevent someone from \n     entering a federal building or boarding a plane.\n       Sebelius said the law will require local driver's licenses \n     offices to certify that someone has the proper documentation \n     and to store the information.\n       ``Exactly how that's going to happen, we're not quite \n     sure,'' Sebelius said. ``We don't basically have any of the \n     equipment that's required to do that in any of the rural \n     areas.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Thousands in Kansas Off Medicaid Following Citizenship Rules\n\n       Thousands of low-income Kansans have lost or been denied \n     state health care coverage because of new rules requiring \n     them to prove they are American citizens, state officials \n     say.\n       Since the federally mandated rules took effect July 1, the \n     number of Medicaid recipients in Kansas has decreased by \n     about 18,000, to 253,000. While officials can't determine \n     exactly how much of the 7 percent drop can be attributed to \n     the new rules, they believe much of it can.\n       ``The impact to the consumer has been severe,'' said John \n     Anzivino, a vice president for MAXIMUS, a Reston, Va., \n     company that helps administer the joint federal-state \n     Medicaid program in Kansas. ``From our perspective, this has \n     possibly been the most dramatic change and challenge to the \n     Medicaid program since its inception.''\n       The new rules were included in last year's federal deficit \n     reduction law and were designed to prevent illegal immigrants \n     from enrolling in the state programs providing health \n     coverage.\n       But consumer advocates said many vulnerable people who \n     legitimately were eligible for assistance would lose coverage \n     because they couldn't produce the necessary documentation.\n       ``We expect that many of these that have lost coverage will \n     regain coverage once they have gathered and provided the \n     necessary documentation,'' Marcia Nielsen, executive director \n     of the Kansas Health Policy Authority, told the Lawrence \n     Journal-World. ``They will, however, experience a gap in \n     coverage that could prove to be significant for some.''\n       Medicaid applicants can prove their citizenship by \n     providing a passport. Or they can provide other documents \n     that verify both their citizenship, such as a birth \n     certificate, and their identities, such as a driver's \n     license.\n       Anzivino said most people seeking benefits don't have a \n     passport and are left scrambling to find birth certificates \n     and other documents:\n       The number of calls each month to a Kansas Medicaid \n     clearinghouse has more than doubled to 49,000 from 23,000, \n     official said.\n       Meanwhile, Rep. Dennis Moore, a Democrat whose district is \n     centered on the state's portion of the Kansas City area, said \n     federal officials were aware of states' problems with the new \n     rules and probably would work on it when the new Congress \n     takes office in January.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/13/senate-section/article/S348-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S348-S349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 13--CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA FOOTBALL \n   TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2008 BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES (BCS) NATIONAL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Martinez) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                               S.

The motion is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                             Gaza Conflict\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the events that \nare in front of us and their significance. We are presently sharing in \nthe excitement that surrounds this Capitol and our country at the \nprospect that President Obama will be taking office and leading this \ncountry in a positive fashion.\n  There is a lot of work to do and a lot of concerns have been brought \nto our attention. We are reminded by President-elect Obama that people \nare losing their jobs, and we cannot stand still and let it happen. \nProspects are that maybe 500,000 new people a month will be out of \nwork. The economy is fragile and there is not the capital around to get \nbusinesses started or to reverse the course we are on. And health care \nis of great concern to people who are uninsured and struggling.\n  At the same time that we are concerned about these things now in our \nown country, we have international responsibilities that we cannot \nignore.\n  Even as excitement surrounds us here, inspired by the new President, \nwe have to look away from our shores and see what is happening in the \nMiddle East where there is fighting raging between Israel and Hamas. \nAnd even while we face domestic problems, we cannot step back from what \nis happening in the Middle East and the responsibility of America as \nthe leading Nation on our globe. Although I bring this up with some \ndegree of reluctance, we must discuss the situation that we face.\n  We know that governing is about choices. When we look at the Middle \nEast right now, the choice for Israel is whether Israel steps aside and \nignores the attacks on her people that come daily, without provocation.\n  We have all heard the opinion around the world about how awful the \nsituation in the Middle East is. It is awful. It is terrible. When I \nsee children hurt, when I see them killed, when I see families \ndistressed as their economy worsens, it is a terrible sight.\n  I was in the Gaza Strip some years ago, bringing good news and \nfinancial assistance to the people of the Gaza as they opened a new \nairport. It was during the time that Arafat was President. There was \nhope springing up all around that maybe they could get out of the \nmisery that existed in the Gaza Strip and develop an orderly society.\n  Israel is a democracy in an area of many nations that are less than \ndemocratic. When these economies flourish the wealth falls into a few \nhands, who build their buildings, take their resources, and buy bigger \nyachts and bigger airplanes for themselves and not for their countries. \nBut there was hope that maybe the Gaza Strip would become a place of \nopportunity for its people. That is why I was so pleased to be there \nand to bring the promise of aid upon which we had agreed.\n  There was no Hamas there at that time. Now, Hamas is there making \ndeterminations about its future and the future of the people of the \nGaza. Apparently the choice of Hamas is to continue the assault on \nIsrael and to not let discussions take place. I am one of those people \nwho support a two-state commitment there, knowing full well that Israel \nis a place that could share its knowledge and experience with the \npeople of Gaza. But Hamas refuses to do that. It is a terrorist \norganization.\n  I remember a trip I took with several colleagues when we went to Iraq \nand on the way we stopped in Jordan and Syria, and we spoke to the \nPresident of Syria and I asked him to try to curb the activities of \nHamas by securing the borders. I said: Why are you encouraging Hamas to \nfind refuge here, have their headquarters here along with Hezbollah? \nPresident Asad said: They are a social service organization.\n  Social service--Mr. President, that is no more a social service \norganization than the people who attacked us on 9/11; than the people \nwho attacked the British train system; than those who attack innocent \npeople in various countries and cities.\n  Terrorism is at our throat. We have to be wary. It has changed the \nway our society functions. Look at all the inspections you go through \nif you want to catch an airplane or go into public buildings--always \nwith an ID card. We know the results of terrorism. It is to destroy \ndemocratic society, take away the choices people have in their lives. \nIt says women have to conduct themselves in a certain way satisfactory \nand\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\nnot have rights to participate in financial opportunities for \nthemselves and their families.\n  And so we look at Hamas and have to ask: Does it really care about \nthe people of Gaza or is it simply dedicated to its terrorist ways? For \nthe answer we can review how Hamas conducts itself.\n  Once again, I, as a human being, as a person who cares about life and \nfamily, I am distressed to see the loss of life that is taking place in \nGaza and in Israel. People are injured and frightened to go out of \ntheir homes--and yet even their home can be a place where misery \nprevails.\n  But Hamas has attacked Israel, firing rockets, and even now, when it \nis perhaps possible to get a cease-fire, they insist on continuing \nrocket firing.\n  We have seen the opinions of countries around the world as they look \nat this situation. Instead of just criticizing Israel, why isn't it \nsaid that Hamas is a terrorist organization that wants to take away \npeople's rights, that wants to permit their innocent citizens to be \nused as decoys--in schools and mosques and other places--to try to hide \nthe militants who are firing rockets into Israel?\n  Hamas starts by saying they don't recognize the right of the State of \nIsrael to exist, but Israel has that right and shall defend that right. \nShe has built a society from the sands, a society that flourishes, not \njust on the economic side, but on the scientific and research side. \nThey have figured out how to grow crops in areas that were arid, and \nhow to develop the technology that Israel is known for.\n  The practice of medicine is another thing that Israel is known for. \nThere is a facility in Israel that I helped fund, in memory of my \nfather who died as a very young man--43 years old--from cancer. There \nis a scientist who lived in New Jersey and was a professor at our \nprincipal institution, Rutgers University.\n  And he asked if I would help fund a laboratory and a facility there \nthat did cancer research. I said yes. That was some time ago. I know \nthey have Arab students there and they have Arab professors there and \nthey all cooperate in helping people maintain good health. We have all \nseen stories in the paper about the young Arab child who came to \nIsrael, brought by her father, to have a heart transplant. In this way \nIsraeli science reaches out to people of all nations and all religions.\n  Israel has a right to exist, and a right to exist in peace, and would \nbe more than willing to bring in the countries surrounding Israel to \nparticipate in programs for peace as it has with medicine. But there \ncannot be real peace without security. Israel is taking appropriate \naction to ensure the security of its people, and to ask them to do less \nis unfair.\n  It is impossible to say to them that if we had rockets falling on \nBoston, we would not respond or if we had rockets falling on Newark, \nNJ, we would not respond.\n  I can tell you, as a resident of New Jersey where we have a 2-mile \nstrip that is said by the FBI to be the most dangerous 2-mile strip in \nthe country for a terrorist attack, we are constantly on the alert. We \nhave boats there, we have guards all over the place, and we make sure \nwe are ready to defend ourselves.\n  Not only is Israel defending itself, as we would, against deadly \naggression, it is also putting a stop to the psychological warfare that \nhas become a daily part of life for the people in southern Israel. \nInnocent civilians live with constant fear that a rocket might kill \nthem, their children, or destroy their home.\n  Israel, like the United States, is determined to protect and \nsafeguard its people. After 9/11, America sought to eliminate threats \nto our country from Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. Now Israel is seeking \nto eliminate threats from ongoing terrorist attacks.\n  We cannot kid ourselves about the strategy that Hamas used to gain \npower in Gaza. Hamas built up its image among the Palestinian people by \npainting itself as a social service provider. But if they really cared \nabout the Palestinian people, they would not use them as human shields, \nand they would not use the rooftops of homes to launch rocket attacks.\n  The events of the past few weeks illustrate to the world that \nterrorist groups cannot be permitted to go on menacing the free world \nwith terror attacks and there are no countries that are safe from this \nkind of assault.\n  Hamas has shown that it cares more about destruction than about \nimproving the lives of the people of Gaza. Hamas leaders have chosen to \nignore the fact that their people are suffering in poverty and instead \nhave focused exclusively on hurting Israel.\n  So we ask Hamas: Stand up; show that you do care about your people \nand stop attacking Israel's citizens.\n  There will be tense days ahead in Israel and Gaza, and I am deeply \nconcerned about the loss of innocent life, the pain of losing a family \nmember, and injuries that may last for a lifetime.\n  To put a stop to the loss of innocent life, Hamas must come to its \nsenses and pursue a cease-fire that is sustainable and durable.\n  Israel should be joined by nations around the world in pursuing a \ncease-fire because terror is ultimately possible in their own states \nand their own communities, whether it is in India, whether it is in \nFrance, whether it is in Spain, whether it is in the UK, or whether it \nis in America as we saw on 9/11.\n  There is only one way to bring real peace and real security to the \nMiddle East: stop the rockets and get the people to the bargaining \ntable.\n  Negotiations are being attempted with Egypt's active participation. \nWe have to encourage these negotiations.\n  And it has to be very clear to Hamas and other terrorist \norganizations that they are not going to win by killing people or by \ndiscouraging free thought and democratic values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/13/senate-section/article/S350-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S350-S351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROHIBITING THE SALE AND COUNTERFEITING OF PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL \n                                TICKETS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.
