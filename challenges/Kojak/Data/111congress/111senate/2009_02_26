Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:30 will be equally divided and controlled between the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. Kyl, and the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, \nor their designees.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, under the previous order, the Senate \nwill now move to the Kyl amendment, I believe, on retrocession, not to \nbe confused with retrogression, although there may be some similarity \nbetween the two.\n  I am looking at the Senator from Maryland, who will rise to the \ndefense in a moment.\n  As my colleagues know, last night the majority leader filed a cloture \nmotion on this bill, S. 160, the District of Columbia House Voting \nRights Act. We made some progress yesterday. There are a few amendments \nstill pending. Obviously, it is our hope that we will be able to \ncomplete the bill today and hopefully not have to go to the cloture \nvote. But that depends on our colleagues.\n  So I would yield on the pending Kyl amendment to the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 585\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank my friend from Connecticut for his leadership on \nthis issue. Let me tell my colleagues, I think this is a major human \nrights issue. I have the opportunity of representing this body as the \nchairman of the Helsinki Commission. The Helsinki Commission deals \ninternationally with issues of human rights. It is interesting that the \nUnited States has taken the leadership on protecting the rights of \nindividuals to vote and to be able to determine their own government. \nSo we have invested a lot of resources in the Helsinki Commission to \nprotect steps to monitor elections around Europe and central Asia and \nto fight for minority communities to have the right to vote and to have \nopen and honest voting.\n  Let me tell you, last year there was a resolution filed in our \nParliamentary Assembly of the CSCE to encourage America to give the \npeople of the District of Columbia the right to vote. The international \ncommunity understands that we are out of compliance with basic \ninternational norms on giving our citizens the right to participate in \ntheir parliament.\n  So I look at this bill first as a basic right, that every American \nshould be able to have their voice heard here in the Congress of the \nUnited States. I support this bill because it moves us in the right \ndirection. But I must tell you, I believe the people of the District \nshould have two Members of this body, two U.S. Senators, and a voting \nMember of Congress, and I know we tried to do that in the 1970s with a \nconstitutional amendment. I was proud at that time to be a State \nlegislator in Maryland as speaker of the Maryland House. We passed and \nratified that constitutional amendment because we thought it was the \nright thing for the District to have full representation in this body \nand to have a voting representative in the House of Representatives.\n  So this legislation, as I said, moves in the right direction. It \ngives the people of the District a voting Representative in the House \nof Representatives. That, we should do. And then it even goes further, \nrecognizing the political sensitivity of having another Congressman who \nmay represent one political party. Since the District registration is \nheavily Democratic, the compromise is to give another Representative to \nthe State of Utah because they are the closest to having been able to \nobtain another Representative and the registration in Utah is heavily \nRepublican. So it balances it from a political point of view. I \nunderstand that is how the system works here. I think this is a fair \ncompromise. What I do not understand is why we are getting all of these \nother amendments on this bill as an effort to try to kill the \nunderlying bill. Let's have an up-or-down vote on it.\n  The people of the District have been waiting a long time. I think it \nis the right thing for us to do to say: Let's give them a vote. Let's \nget rid of these amendments because these amendments are not aimed at \ntrying to solve the problem, they are aimed at trying to defeat the \nbill, which brings me to the amendment offered by Senator Kyl that is \ncurrently pending.\n  I find this amendment somewhat surprising. Let me tell you why. It \nwould cede the District back to the State of Maryland. It would change \nthe border of my State that I represent in this body. Now, I would have \nthought--maybe I am naive about this--that if a Senator was introducing \nan amendment which would change the border of a particular State, that \nhe would talk to the Senators from that State, he would talk to the \nGovernor from that State, he would try to work with the Representatives \nfrom that State because if this amendment were adopted, it would affect \nevery single person in Maryland. Our formulas for aid to our counties \nand Baltimore City are based upon population. If all of a sudden \nMaryland grows by a couple hundred thousand people, it affects the way \nour counties operate essential services. Yet there was no effort made \nby the author of this amendment to consult with the political \nleadership of my State.\n  I do not know how another Senator would feel if I introduced an \namendment--and I am glad to see Senator Kyl has returned to the floor. \nI don't know how Senator Kyl would feel if I introduced an amendment \nthat said, perhaps, Arizona's borders should change a little bit \nbecause it makes more sense to do it that way, and there is no need to \ntalk to the Senators from Arizona about it or the government of \nArizona, we are just going to do it. I do not think that is the right \nthing to do.\n  So I am somewhat puzzled. I must tell you, to me, it is a matter of \nan unfunded mandate on my State. It is a matter of what federalism is \nabout. It is a matter of States rights, and it is a matter of common \ndecency.\n  Now, I read the amendment coming over, and I am not sure how these \nlines were drawn, but I would have thought, if Maryland were to get the \nDistrict, we would at least get the Kennedy Center. But it looks as if \nthey took the Kennedy Center out, for reasons I cannot explain. I do \nnot know how these lines were drawn. So perhaps my friend will help me \nunderstand this better and understand whether the courtesies of the \nSenate mean you can put legislation in affecting the borders of one \nState or another without even having the courtesy to talk to the \nMembers of that State.\n  I can tell you that Maryland very much works very closely with the \nMayor of Washington and the people of the District. We have a wonderful \nregional governmental organization. We work cooperatively on providing \nservices to the people of this region. We have an excellent \nrelationship. We support giving the people of the District \nrepresentation in Congress because it is the right thing to do, and we \nwant them to have their own Representatives here. We think it is a \nwrong suggestion to now say: Oh, we can solve this problem by changing \nthe borders of the State of Maryland for that.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Kyl amendment and let us get on \nwith passing this very important bill for Americans who have been \ndenied a voice in the Congress of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if the Senator from Maryland has a moment, I \nwould be very happy to respond to some of the concerns he raised. They \nare all legitimate questions, I acknowledge up front. No State should \nhave territory foisted upon it. That is absolutely true. And the \nquestions raised here were good questions.\n  First of all, the amendment before us is an amendment that has \nfrequently been offered in the House of Representatives. It has been \nvetted over there for a long time. So this is not something new.\n  Secondly, it is absolutely clear from section 6 of the amendment that \nnothing happens with regard to retrocession unless the State of \nMaryland agrees.\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\nThe effectiveness provision reads as follows:\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the State of Maryland enacts \n     legislation accepting the retrocession described in section \n     1(a), the President shall issue a proclamation announcing \n     such acceptance.\n\n  Unless the State of Maryland affirmatively, through an act of the \npeople's representatives of that State, vote to do this, there is no \nretrocession to the State of Maryland.\n  That answers the question of States rights.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Of course.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Does he believe it is fair to say to the people of the \nDistrict of Columbia that their right to have a voice in the House of \nRepresentatives depends upon the will of the people of Maryland?\n  Mr. KYL. I say to my colleague, the first point he made was that the \nState of Maryland should have a say in this, and it should be a \ndefinitive say. If the State of Maryland doesn't want the residents of \nthe District of Columbia to be part of the State, that informs our \ndecision about what the people of the State of Maryland want. I \nwouldn't force that decision upon them any more than the Senator \nsuggests should be the case. The State of Maryland should have that \nsay. If the Senator is saying: I can tell you right now Marylanders \ndon't want these folks from the District as part of their State, we \nought to know that by a definitive process rather than assuming it to \nbe the case going into the debate. That would be my response.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will my colleague yield further?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I am wondering how my colleague would feel if legislation \nwas introduced here by a Senator not from Arizona saying: I understand \nwhat the people of Arizona want better than the Senator does. I want to \nintroduce a bill affecting land rights or property rights or anything \nin the State of Arizona, and I will make it subject to the vote of the \npeople of Arizona. It will change the border area a little bit, and I \nknow you don't want this, but I am going to do it anyway. I am curious \nhow the Senator would respond if such legislation was introduced and \nthe Senator who introduced it said: I am allowing your Governor to take \nit to the people. I know there will be a lot of pressure building up on \nthat. But it is not relevant to the Senators from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my colleague makes a good point. I will \nrespond in two ways. First, I appreciate the sentiment and would hope \nthat when western land issues are dealt with in this body, our eastern \ncolleagues would apply that same principle. Frequently, there is a \nsense that folks in the east know best about what we should be doing \nwith Federal lands in the west. I certainly respect that sentiment. \nObviously, in some respects, that is not as important as the \nfundamental political jurisdictional issue we are facing here. The \nquestion of retrocession is a fundamental issue, and it has to do with \na fundamental right the District of Columbia residents would have to \nparticipate in State government. I recognize there are some \ndifferences, but I offer that first response.\n  Second, I am not presupposing anything with the amendment. The \nquestion will always be before the Maryland electorate whether they \nwant to do this. I don't know whether the Maryland electorate wants to \ndo this. I presume there would be a debate. The result of that debate, \ndecided by the people of Maryland or their elected representatives, \nwould be dispositive on the question. Nobody is foisting anything on \nanyone. I would be the first to say: If the people of Maryland don't \nwant the residents of the District to be part of the State of Maryland, \nthen the Congress would have to be informed by that decision. I would \nthink it would be dispositive.\n  Could I respond to a couple other points first and then I will be \nhappy to engage in a further colloquy.\n  On the matter of the way the lines were drawn, the history of this is \nthat the so-called national areas, the areas where the Federal \nbuildings, various Government departments are located, the Mall, the \nmonuments and those sorts of things, would not be part of the \nretrocession. The bulk of the bill draws those lines. I can't tell my \ncolleague exactly what the philosophy was with respect to each of those \nareas. Any question about what should or should not be in, be it the \nKennedy Center or anything else, is a legitimate subject of discussion. \nIt could be the subject of amendment. This has been a matter that has \nbeen not frequently but not infrequently debated in the House of \nRepresentatives. So there is some history of the rationale behind the \nline drawing. But with respect to where any of these particular lines \nare drawn, obviously, the Senators from Maryland should be key in \nhelping us to decide where those lines would be. There is nothing \nlocked in stone here that could not be considered the subject of an \namendment.\n  Finally, with respect to the unfunded mandate part, I am not sure it \nwouldn't work the other way around. I cited a couple days ago the \nstatistics about the money that the Government provides for the \nDistrict of Columbia. Some of that money has to do with the running of \nthese Government departments, the construction of buildings, \nmaintenance of the buildings, and so on, but much of it does not. Much \nof it has to do with what the Constitution provides as to the general \nwelfare of the people within the District. I suspect that under any \nscenario, the money that has been provided to the District of Columbia \nwould still be far in excess of the money returned to any of the \nseveral States. And because of the unique nature of the District and \nthe history and traditions, much of that funding would naturally carry \nover to future years. There is no way the Federal Government is not \ngoing to fund all of the national areas that are retained in this \nlegislation.\n  As the District's Delegate Norton said in a press release recently, \nmuch of the money in the stimulus bill that is going to refurbish or \nconstruct office buildings that are Federal Government buildings \nprovides employment opportunities for the residents of the District. \nWhile we should obviously be sensitive to any issues of transfer, if \nthe State of Maryland were to accept the residents of the District of \nColumbia, it is a very legitimate point, and all of those things are \nappropriate for discussion.\n  On the matter of the unfunded mandate, it would probably work the \nother way around, that Maryland would receive a lot of money from the \nFederal Government. In any event, the Federal national areas that would \nbe receiving the amount of money that they naturally do would certainly \nhelp the residents who work here in what is now the District of \nColumbia.\n  There is nothing in this amendment that is intended to jam anything \ndown the throats of the people of Maryland. They have the final and \nultimate say of what is done. I wouldn't propose anything different \nfrom that.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me make a brief comment with regard to the mandate on \nMaryland. Maryland would be under tremendous pressure to change funding \nformulas consistent with what aid the District currently receives. It \nwould have a major impact on the ability of our State to carry out its \nfundamental aid formulas to local governments, considering how \nsignificant the District would be, the population, relative to the \nState of Maryland.\n  The second point is, I can tell you how the people of Maryland feel. \nThey believe the residents of the District of Columbia should have \ntheir voting representative in the House of Representatives. That is \nhow the members of our congressional delegation have acted. That is how \nSenators are acting. We know that is what the District wants. We agree \nwith that. I hope we can get an up-or-down vote on this bill and let's \nmove forward.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. KYL. If I may make one other point, we will have an up-or-down \nvote on this amendment at 10:30 and on the bill, of course. I want to \nconclude my comments to the Senator, because he, obviously, has a good \nsense of what the people of Maryland want. I concede that. Again, I \nconcede the premise of his point which is that the people of Maryland \nshould have a say before this is done. The reason for the amendment is \nsimply this: We believe it is unconstitutional for the Congress to \nsimply provide a congressional district without an amendment to the \nConstitution.\n\n[[Page S2510]]\n\nI personally think the residents of the District should be represented \nin the House. The only other way to do that, for those of us who \nbelieve it is unconstitutional to pass the legislation pending before \nus, and a court will in relatively short order make a determination on \nwhether that is true, and let's assume that the court says, you can't \ndo it, Congress, by simple legislation, then short of a constitutional \namendment, this is the only other way to achieve the objective. It is \npresented in good faith. It is presented as the only other logical \nalternative for the residents of the District of Columbia to have their \nown congressional district. Because of the number of people who live in \nthe District, something over 600,000, and because the representation \nfrom House congressional districts today is approximately a shade over \n600,000, the fact is that the residents of the District could have a \ndistrict of their own or essentially exactly as the District is \nconfigured today without presumably modifying the lines of other \nMaryland districts. Of course, that would be up to the State of \nMaryland in the way that it sets its congressional district lines.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Having served in the House and also going through \nredistricting, the courts are now requiring an exact number of \nequality. So it would be improbable that the lines would remain the \nsame.\n  Mr. KYL. I said that is why it would be ``almost.'' You might have to \ninclude a few residents of what are now Maryland within the District, \nand I acknowledge that to be the case. In any event, I accept the \nfundamental premise of the Senator. Our amendment addresses that \nspecifically. My hope would be that if the courts should declare that \nwe cannot by legislation do what this bill attempts, then the people of \nMaryland would strongly consider whether the next best alternative is \nto provide for the retrocession we have in this amendment as the next \nbest way to provide a vote for the residents of the District of \nColumbia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Maryland for a thoughtful discussion. I rise to oppose \namendment No. 585, offered by the Senator from Arizona. Unlike some of \nthe other amendments pending, this one goes to the heart of what the \nunderlying bill that came out of committee is all about, which is how \ndo we give voting rights in Congress to 600,000 Americans who happen to \nlive in our Nation's Capital who don't have such representation now. I \ndisagree with the method, but I appreciate the fact that this is not \ngermane in a parliamentary sense, but it is directly relevant to the \nunderlying injustice and inequity. But for the reasons that the Senator \nfrom Maryland made clear, this is not a practical solution to the \nproblem before us, the longstanding injustice.\n  It requires the consent of the people of Maryland, and all their \nleaders tell us that the people will not support it. So it may be a \nsolution on paper, but it is not going to be a solution and a fix to \nthe problem in fact. It is also full of complications that would ensue.\n  For instance, section 2 of the amendment would automatically transfer \nall pending legal actions in the District of Columbia to an \n``appropriate Maryland court.'' We can only imagine the legal and \npolitical tangle that could create given that Maryland and the District \nactually have distinct legal structures, rules, and precedents. Section \n3 of the amendment describes at some length the boundaries of a small \nbut still sizable national capital service area that would continue to \nbe controlled by Congress and which would consist of key Federal \nbuildings and monuments. There are complications there too. Who would \npolice and maintain those streets and otherwise administer this large \nswath of downtown Washington?\n  As has been said, it would require a constitutional amendment to \nrepeal amendment XXIII which granted the District of Columbia three \nelectoral votes in Presidential elections. If amendment XXIII were not \nrepealed, presumably the effect would be to grant a disproportionately \nlarge role in Presidential elections to a relatively small population \nthat would continue to reside in that national capital service area and \nthat would remain under congressional control. In fact, the amendment \nrecognizes this and, therefore, would not become effective until such a \nrepeal amendment to the Constitution is ratified.\n  As I have said, this is an alternative solution to the problem. I \nappreciate it in that it would, if it overcame the obstacles, actually \nbe a remedy, but it is not the right or realistic remedy to the \ninjustice of nonvoting representation in Congress for residents of the \nDistrict. The right and reasonable and realistic solution is the \nunderlying bill before us, S. 160. That is why I oppose the amendment \nand urge the passage of the bill.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me respond to two points my colleague \nmade, and they are both legitimate questions. The first is some of the \ntechnical problems. I am sure there are a lot of technical problems we \nhave not even thought about that would attend. This is a big change. \nWhether you adopt the underlying legislation or you go through a \nprocess such as retrocession, there will have to be a lot of \nadjustments and accommodations, to be sure.\n  But on questions such as, for example, policing the Mall and so on, \nthose things are already well understood and resolved. For example, I \nhave spoken recently with Capitol Police and asked them about the \noverlapping jurisdiction: Where, for example, does the Capitol Police \njurisdiction end and where does the DC Police jurisdiction begin, and \nso on? They have all these things worked out. I do not think there is \nany difficulty with those kinds of technical issues. But there will be, \nundoubtedly, others that will have to be addressed as well.\n  Secondly, my colleague is correct, in order to avoid the anomalous \nsituation where a few people who might be technically residents \ndowntown and not have other residence downtown--being in the Federal \nareas or national areas as described in this legislation--we would have \nto eliminate the twenty-third amendment to make sure those people would \nnot have three electoral votes for the Presidency. I cannot imagine \nthat if retrocession did occur the citizens of the country would not \nfollow through on that essentially technical issue and approve the \nrecession of the twenty-third amendment. But it is one of the things \nthat will have to be done. That is absolutely true.\n  Again, I will conclude by saying, for those of us who believe it \nwould be preferable for the residents of the District to have their own \nrepresentative in the House of Representatives and, in fact, to be able \nto vote for Senators, and have that representation as well, if they are \npart of a State--if, in fact, the underlying legislation is \nunconstitutional, as many of us believe it is--then this amendment \noffers a constructive way to achieve the same result, I would suggest, \nwith very little in the way of adjustment, but with some adjustment \nthat would have to occur--again, subject solely to the approval of the \npeople of the State of Maryland.\n  I say to our colleagues, this vote is scheduled for 10:30, so if \nthere are people who want to discuss other amendments or other matters, \nor to further debate this amendment, this would be a good time to do \nso.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona. He is \nabsolutely right. I have been informed that the senior Senator from \nDelaware is on his way to the floor to speak on this amendment. But I \necho what Senator Kyl has said, that we have some other pending \namendments. The floor is open until the vote at 10:30, and I urge our \ncolleagues to come and take advantage of that opening.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, yesterday morning, at about 8 o'clock, \ndown\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\nin, I think, S. 115, there was a prayer breakfast. Actually, that \nhappens about every week. And for many weeks in the last year or two, \nour Acting President pro tempore was one of two Members--one a Democrat \nand one a Republican--who brought people together for an hour of \nfellowship. They would have breakfast together and sing a hymn--or at \nleast try to sing a hymn--or a song of some kind, and they would share \ntheir story, if you will, their spiritual journey with one another.\n  I usually do not get to go to those; I am on a train coming down from \nWilmington, DE. But I have been a time or two, and I find it very \nuplifting. There is a smaller gathering that will occur today a little \nafter noon, right here off the Senate floor, and it will be a group \nconvened by our Chaplain, Barry Black, who is a retired Navy rear \nadmiral. He used to be Chief of Chaplains for the Navy and the Marine \nCorps.\n  What we have is a little bit like an adult Sunday school class. There \nare people of different faiths who show up. Sometimes we may have five \nor six or seven or eight or nine people there, Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  I always like to tell the story that happened about a couple years \nago, when we were having orientation for new Senators--something our \nActing President pro tempore has been a part of establishing--but we \nhad a last session of orientation for new Senators--I think it was \nabout 2004, right after the election--a last session where John Breaux, \na Democrat, was leaving and Don Nickles, a Republican, was leaving the \nSenate, and they both were talking to our new Senators and their \nspouses about bridging the partisan divide.\n  Don Nickles talked--he has a great sense of humor; so does John \nBreaux, as we know--and Senator Nickles was about to leave the Senate. \nHe was talking to the Democrats and Republicans who had just arrived, \nand their spouses, and he said: You all ought to think about going to \nthis Bible study group. It is uplifting. It is inspiring. It is \nrefreshing. You get to know your colleagues better. It does not take \nthat much time every week. He said: You ought to try to do it. Tom \nCarper and I go to that Bible study group. He is a Democrat and I am a \nRepublican.\n  He said: Week after week, month after month, you sit together, you \nread Scriptures together, you talk and share with one another your \nthoughts and problems and what you are facing in your life. You pray \nfor each other. He said: You know, after I do that, it is hard to walk \nout on the Senate floor and stab Tom Carper in the back. He said: It is \nnot impossible, but it is hard.\n  One of the other things that is hard is for us to actually figure out \nhow our faith should guide us in the decisions we make here. I am \nalways inspired by the depth of conviction of the floor manager, the \nchief sponsor of this bill, Senator Lieberman, and how his faith guides \nhim in the work we do here.\n  But Barry Black, our Chaplain, often challenges us in the Senate--\nDemocrats and Republicans--and not just there, but, later today, in our \nBible study class, and also at the Wednesday morning prayer breakfast, \nand throughout the week--he is always challenging us: How should we use \nour faith to help guide us in the decisions we make?\n  The other thing he is good at doing is reminding us, about every \nother week, of the two great Commandments in the New Testament. The \nfirst: Love Thy Lord Thy God with all thy heart, all thy soul, all thy \nmind. And the second one is: To love thy neighbor as thyself--which we \nalso call the Golden Rule: Treat others the way we want to be treated. \nChaplain Black likes to say the ``CliffsNotes'' of the New Testament is \nthe Golden Rule: Treat other people the way we want to be treated.\n  When I run into great leaders in my life, in this country and in \nother countries, a lot of times the good leaders are those who actually \ninternalize the Golden Rule, who do try to treat others the way they \nwant to be treated. I am pleased to say that the two Senators who are \nhere on the floor right now certainly embody that rule too.\n\n  How does that pertain to the legislation before us? Well, I think it \npertains to the legislation before us because there are about 600,000 \npeople who live in the District of Columbia. Some of them actually work \nhere with us, but they live here in the District of Columbia and they \npay taxes. They pay Federal taxes. They don't get to vote. They don't \nhave a vote here in the Senate. They don't have a Representative, if \nyou will, who can vote for them and for their interests and concerns in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Delaware has about 850,000 people, so we have a few more people than \nthe District of Columbia. There are some other States that have fewer \npeople than we do. There is actually probably a State or two that has \nfewer people living in it than does the District of Columbia. I won't \ncall out those States here this morning. They are pretty big in \ngeography but not so big in population. They have two Senators and at \nleast one U.S. Representative. Whether the issue is foreclosures, \nbudget, or stimulus package, they have somebody here to vote, to \nrepresent them, to speak on the floor and to offer legislation, amend \nlegislation, and to vote on legislation. We saw in the stimulus package \nhow critical one or two votes can be. The District of Columbia has \nnobody here and they have nobody voting for them in the House. They \nhave a delegate--a very good one--who can vote in committee, offer \nlegislation, offer amendments, and introduce bills, but can't actually \nvote when the time comes. There is something about that that seems \nunfair to me. It seems unfair to me. I think it certainly seems unfair \nto the sponsor of the bill, Senator Lieberman, and to a lot of people \nwho cosponsored the legislation, as have I.\n  None of us is suggesting that there ought to be two Senators \nrepresenting folks from the District of Columbia. In allowing the \ndelegate to become sort of a full-fledged U.S. Representative over in \nthe House, there is a trade that--we would expect that person to be a \nDemocrat, at least initially; maybe someday Republican--but the idea \nwould be to provide an additional Republican representative, in this \ncase from the State of Utah. That seat may become a Democratic seat. I \nwouldn't want to bet my paycheck on it, but it might. So we are trying \nto come up with an equitable, a fair, a reasonable compromise. Isn't \npolitics the art of compromise? This is a compromise.\n  There are some who have suggested that is unconstitutional. I am not \na constitutional expert. I know a lot of smart people have considered \nit. We will have an opportunity--if this legislation is passed and \nsigned by the President, there will be an opportunity for an expedited \nprocess and the Federal courts, the appropriate courts will determine \nwhether this measure, this statute actually is constitutionally sound. \nMy hope is it will be. A lot of forethought has gone into this issue \nalready.\n  In closing, let me say in the minute or so that is left on our side, \nI wish to thank Senator Lieberman for his steadfast leadership on this \nissue and for making it not just a bipartisan issue but a tripartisan \nissue, by making sure we have both Republicans and Democrats and \nIndependents such as himself and Bernie Sanders to weigh in and to \nsupport this legislation; not just to offer the bill but actually to \nstand up and call on the rest of us to do what we know in our hearts is \nfair and just, and to put ourselves in the shoes of the folks who live \nhere in Washington, DC and who work and pay their taxes and who deserve \na full-fledged vote, at least in the House of Representatives. We will \nwait another day to take up that battle here in the Senate.\n  That having been said, I yield back my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time for the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, seeing no one on the other side in the \nChamber, I ask unanimous consent to speak for no more than 5 minutes, \nprobably less.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I will yield if anyone on the other \nside comes in.\n  I thank my friend from Delaware for his very eloquent and thoughtful \nstatement. The pending amendment is on retrocession. As the Senator \nbegan his remarks about the Bible study and prayer groups, I thought he \nwas going to talk about redemption and not retrocession, but he got to \nthe point. I must say, if I may continue the argument the Senator from \nDelaware made\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\nvery eloquently in two ways, S. 160, the underlying bill, does \nprovide--please allow me some license here for a kind of political \nredemption--for the voters of the District of Columbia who up until \nthis time have been denied a voting representative in Congress. The \nwhole premise of our Government is that we govern with the consent of \nthe governed, but here we have 600,000 Americans who, through \nhistorical anomalies and maybe more recently partisan disagreements, \ndon't get to consent or object to anything we do to them or even for \nthem.\n  The second--and I thank my friend from Delaware for making this point \nabout the Golden Rule. I hope all of our colleagues in the Senate will \napply that fundamental ethical human principle to this vote and think \nabout how we would feel if we were the District's Delegate in the House \nof Representatives. Eleanor Holmes Norton is a gifted and wonderful \nperson. I have known her--I won't state the year because I don't want \nto compromise the privacy of her age; mine has already been compromised \nthis week. We were at law school together. She is an extraordinarily \ngifted person and a very diligent and passionate and aggressive \nadvocate for the people of the District of Columbia. Imagine how we \nwould feel if we were occupying the seat she occupies in the House of \nRepresentatives. She gets to debate issues. She gets to talk. But when \nthe roll is called, imagine how we would feel--my friend from Delaware \nand our dear friend from Arkansas who occupies the Chair at the moment, \nmyself--if there were a major item here in the Senate and we could \ndebate it, but then the roll is called and it is as if our mouths are \nstifled, muffled. We couldn't vote. That is what Delegate Norton goes \nthrough in the House of Representatives. If we think about it that way, \nin the terms the Senator from Delaware stated, to treat others as we \nwould like to be treated ourselves, it seems only fair, reasonable, \nhuman to give Delegate Norton and the 600,000 people she represents the \nright to vote on the floor.\n  So I thank my friend for taking the time to come over and speak as \neloquently and convincingly as he has.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 585.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Corker).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nCorker) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 30, nays 67, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 69 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--30\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--67\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johanns\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Corker\n     Kennedy\n       \n  The amendment (No. 585) was rejected.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I believe two of our colleagues wish \nto speak as in morning business at this time. After that, our intention \nis to pick up the amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina, \nMr. DeMint, on the fairness doctrine, and then Senator Durbin also will \nbe offering a matter on the fairness doctrine as well.\n  With that in mind, I yield the floor to one of the two Senators to my \nright, and they may joust as to who goes first.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut, \nwith whom I worked so closely last fall and at the end of January, for \nallowing us to go forward. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business, and my colleague, the Senator from Iowa, I believe, \nwishes to speak as in morning business after that, as indicated by the \nmanager of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond and Mr. Grassley are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside to call up the amendment No. 587.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding \nthat the Senator from Nevada wishes to call up the amendment and speak \nvery briefly--he mentioned to me 2 minutes. I believe I am in the line \nto speak and I wish to speak on this amendment.\n  Is that the agreement?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to call up my amendment, get it pending, and speak on it for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Is the subject of this amendment vouchers?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No problem.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 587\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 587.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reauthorize the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 for \n                           fiscal year 2010)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE DC SCHOOL CHOICE INCENTIVE \n                   ACT OF 2003.\n\n       (a) Reauthorization.--Section 313 of the DC School Choice \n     Incentive Act of 2003 (title III of division C of Public Law \n     108-199, 118 Stat. 134) is amended by striking ``fiscal year \n     2004 and such sums as may be necessary for each of the 4 \n     succeeding fiscal years'' and inserting ``fiscal year 2010''.\n       (b) Severability.--Notwithstanding section 7, if any \n     provision of this Act (other than this section), and \n     amendment made by this Act (other than by this section), or \n     the application of such provision or amendment to any person \n     or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, this section, \n     the amendment made by this section, and the application of \n     such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected \n     thereby.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I rise to offer a DC voucher program for \nlow-income children at or below 185 percent of the Federal Poverty \nLine. Children would be eligible to receive up to $7,500 to attend a \nprivate school in the District.\n  It has been said that education, especially K-12 education is a civil \nright. I\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\nbelieve it is. In Washington, DC, public schools are failing too many \nof our kids--especially our low-income kids. These children are trapped \nin schools that are failing.\n  About half the kids in Washington, DC, public schools do not \ngraduate, and this is not because of money. The District spends perhaps \nthe most in the country, on education. They spend almost $15,000 a year \nper student per year in public schools. That is almost three times the \namount we spend per student per year in Nevada. Yet the performance of \nthe public schools in the District is pathetic. There are very few \nMembers of Congress who would allow their kids to go to these failing \nschools.\n  The reason I am offering my amendment today, which would reauthorize, \nfor 1 year, a very valuable voucher program, is because the upcoming \nOmnibus appropriations bill basically guts the program. We need to make \nsure this program is in place in time for parents to plan for their \nchildren's education in the fall.\n  This is an important amendment. This is a civil rights amendment. We \nare talking about the right to a DC Representative voting here, we \nshould care enough about our children to give them the right to a good \neducation. That is what this amendment is about. Now, we are going to \ntry to work this out. We may not be offering this amendment if we can \nget an agreement from the majority leader for time on the floor \nsometime this spring to be able to debate a full bill. That is what I \nwould hope we could be able to do. If not, then we will hope for a vote \non this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, if I may very briefly respond to my \nfriend from Nevada, I appreciate the statement he has made. Personally, \nI agree with him on this DC scholarship program which I supported in \npast years. The authorization is running out.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, as my \nfriend knows, actually still possesses jurisdiction over matters \nrelated to the District of Columbia. So we would be the proper \ncommittee to consider an authorization bill.\n  As I have said to my friend, I do not know what I would support. I do \nnot know what the outcome of the committee would be. But I appreciate \nthe spirit in which he has presented this amendment. I agree with him \ntotally that we ought to be reauthorizing this program, and we will \nwork together to see, with the majority leader, whether we can get an \nagreement that there will be floor time with a time limit given to a \ndebate and an attempt to reauthorize the program when it expires, which \nI believe is in this fiscal year, meaning that it would affect the \nschool year that begins in September.\n  So I will pursue that with the leader and will continue our \nconversations. I thank him for offering the amendment.\n  I now yield the floor to our distinguished colleague from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 575\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the manager of the bill. I \nrise today to speak in strong opposition to amendment No. 575 offered \nby Senator Ensign. This amendment is not the instant amendment that he \njust spoke about; it is the amendment that essentially would repeal all \ncommonsense gun laws in the District of Columbia.\n  I believe the amendment is reckless. I believe it is irresponsible. I \nbelieve it will lead to more weapons and more violence on the streets \nof our Nation's Capital. It will endanger the citizens of the District, \nthe Government employees who work here, our elected officials, and \nthose who visit this great American Capitol. And, of course, if \nsuccessful, it will be the first new step in a march to remove all \ncommonsense gun regulations all over this land.\n  The Ensign amendment repeals gun laws promoting public safety, \nincluding DC laws that the U.S. Supreme Court indicated were \npermissible under the second amendment in the Heller decision. I \nstrongly disagree with the Supreme Court decision in Heller that the \nsecond amendment gives individuals a right to possess weapons for \nprivate purposes not related to State militias, and that the \nConstitution does not permit a general ban on handguns in the home. But \nthat is the law. It has been adjudicated. It has gone up to the highest \nCourt, and I am one who believes if we do not like the law, we should \ntry to make changes through the proper legal channels. However, it is \nimportant to note that Heller also stands for the proposition that \nreasonable, commonsense gun regulations are entirely permissible.\n  As the author of the original assault weapons ban that was enacted in \n1994, I know commonsense gun regulations do make our communities safer, \nwhile at the same time respecting the rights of sportsmen and others to \nkeep and bear arms.\n  Just yesterday, the Department of Justice announced the arrest of 52 \npeople in California, Minnesota, and Maryland. In addition to seizing \n12,000 kilograms of cocaine and more than 16,000 pounds of marijuana, \nthe DEA also seized 169 illegal firearms from members of the Sinoloa \nCartel.\n  Where did they get those guns? It would be interesting to find out \nbecause this cartel is one of several that law enforcement believes is \nresponsible for kidnappings and murders within the United States in \naddition to engaging in violent gun crimes.\n  In talking about the Sinoloa Cartel yesterday, Attorney General \nHolder noted that reinstituting the assault weapons ban would benefit \nthe United States, as well as help stop the flood of weapons being sent \nfrom the United States to Mexico for use by drug cartels to cause \nviolence on both sides of the border.\n  I am prepared to wage the assault weapons battle again and intend to \ndo so. I have been quiet about this because there are many pressing \nneeds of this Nation. But with the help of the President, the \nadministration, and the people of this great country, we do need to \nfight back against these kinds of amendments.\n  Justice Scalia wrote in the majority opinion on the Heller case that \na wide variety of gun laws are ``presumptively lawful,'' including the \nlaws ``forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places'' and \nregulations governing ``the conditions and qualifications of the \ncommercial sale of arms.''\n  I cannot think of any place more sensitive than the District of \nColumbia. Even bans on ``dangerous and unusual weapons'' are completely \nappropriate under the Heller decision. So it is interesting to me that \nyou have this decision, and then you have the Senate moving even to \nobliterate what is allowable under the decision.\n  Senator Ensign's amendment completely ignores Heller's language and \ntakes the approach that all guns for all people at all times is called \nfor by Heller. It is not.\n  We have all seen the tragic consequences of gun violence: the \nmassacre of students at Virginia Tech University in 2007, the murders \nat Columbine High School in Colorado, the North Hollywood shootout \nwhere bank robbers carrying automatic weapons and shooting armor-\npiercing bullets shot 10 Los Angeles Police Department SWAT officers \nand seven civilians before being stopped.\n  We have seen criminal street gangs able to buy weapons at gun shows \nand out of the back seats or the trunks of automobiles. We have seen \ntheir bullets kill hundreds, if not thousands of people across this \ngreat land--men, women, and children.\n\n  I remember one case in the San Francisco Bay area not long ago where \na youngster taking a piano lesson in a home had a bullet from a gang \nmember pierce the wall of the home, cut his spine, and today he is a \nparaplegic. It is unbelievable for me to think of the ease with which \npeople can buy weapons.\n  As Senator Schumer said, if this amendment becomes law, even if you \ncannot see, even if you cannot pass a sight test, you can have access \nto firearms. That is not what this Nation should encourage. Those \nincidents and the gun violence that occurs every day across this \ncountry show us that we should be doing more, not less, to keep guns \nout of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill and not give them \nunfettered access to firearms.\n  It is worth noting just how far this amendment goes in repealing DC \nlaw and just how unsafe it will make the streets of this Capitol. Here \nis what it\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\nwould do: It would repeal DC's ban on semiautomatic weapons, including \nassault weapons. If this amendment becomes law, military-style assault \nweapons with high-capacity magazines will be allowed to be stockpiled \nin homes and businesses in the District, even near Federal buildings \nsuch as the White House and the Capitol. Even the .50 caliber sniper \nrifle, with a range of over 1 mile, will be allowed in DC under this \namendment. This is a weapon capable of firing rounds that can penetrate \nconcrete and armor plating. And at least one model of the .50 caliber \nsniper rifle is easily concealed and transported. One gun manufacturer \ndescribes this model as a ``lightweight and tactical'' weapon and \ncapable of being collapsed and carried in ``a very small inconspicuous \npackage.''\n  Is this what we want to do? There is simply no good reason anyone \nneeds semiautomatic, military-style assault weapons in an urban \ncommunity. It is unfathomable to me that the same high-powered sniper \nrifle used by our Armed Forces will be permitted in the Nation's \nCapital. Yet this is exactly what the amendment would allow if passed \nby the Senate.\n  Next, the amendment would repeal existing Federal anti-gun \ntrafficking laws. For years, Federal law has banned gun dealers from \nselling handguns directly to out-of-State buyers who are not licensed \nfirearms dealers. This has helped substantially in the fight against \nillegal interstate gun trafficking, and it has prevented criminals from \ntraveling to other States to buy guns.\n  Senator Ensign's amendment repeals this longstanding Federal law and \nallows DC residents to cross State lines to buy handguns in neighboring \nStates. Illegal gun traffickers will be able to easily obtain large \nquantities of firearms outside of DC and then distribute those guns to \ncriminals in DC and in surrounding States.\n  And no one should be so naive as to say that this amendment will not \ndo this. It will. The amendment repeals DC law restricting the ability \nof dangerous and unqualified people to obtain guns. The amendment also \nrepeals many of the gun regulations that the Supreme Court said were \ncompletely appropriate after Heller.\n  So all of those who will vote for this amendment should not do so \nthinking they are just complying with the Heller decision. This is part \nof a march forward by gun lobby interests in this country to begin to \nremove all commonsense regulations, and no one should think it is \nanything else.\n  This would repeal the DC prohibition on persons under the age of 21 \nfrom possessing firearms, and it repeals all age limits for the \npossession of long guns, including assault weapons.\n  Do we really want that? I think of the story of an 11-year-old who \nhad a reduced barrel shotgun and just recently killed somebody with it. \nIs this what we want to see all over this country, the ability of \nvirtually anyone to obtain a firearm regardless of their age? I don't \nthink so.\n  The amendment even repeals the DC law prohibiting gun possession by \npeople who have poor vision. I heard Senator Schumer speak about this \nyesterday afternoon. Unbelievably, under this amendment, the District \nwould be barred from having any vision requirement for gun use, even if \nsomeone is blind. Is this the kind of public policy we want to make for \nour Nation? Is this how co-opted this body is to the National Rifle \nAssociation and others? I hope not.\n  One of the reasons we have 6-year terms is to allow us to make \ndifficult decisions. There is no higher charge than protecting our \npublic safety. We should protect individuals. The way we protect \nindividuals is by enacting public policy that is prudent, reasonable, \nand subject to common sense. This amendment does none of the above.\n  I ask my colleagues to think carefully about this amendment, because \nif it succeeds, trust me, the march for similar legislation will be on. \nI introduced the assault weapons legislation. I survived. I had an \nelection in 1994, just after I had introduced it. I survived. The \npeople of my State want commonsense gun control. They don't want local \njurisdictions stripped of any ability to enact prudent regulation.\n  The Presiding Officer is in the chair. The husband of one of her \ncolleagues, going home on the Long Island train, was shot and killed by \nsomeone who never should have had a weapon. How many of these incidents \ndo we have to have? How many businesses employing people who are \nmentally ill have to suffer when they have a grudge against an \nemployee, and kill 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 people? How many schools do we \nhave to have where aggrieved students go out and acquire the most \npowerful weapons and come into cafeterias, libraries, or classrooms and \nmow down students? A vote for this amendment, any way we look at it, \nmakes this easier to happen.\n  I believe passionately about this. I will never forget, many years \nago, before I was mayor, walking into the robbery of a corner grocery \nstore. When people die of gunshot wounds, it is not the way it is on \ntelevision or in the movies. I saw brain matter all over the walls. I \nsaw the husband, a proprietor, the wife, a proprietor. This individual \nwho came in even shot the dog. People are capable of terrible \ncriminality. We should not encourage that criminality by making their \naccess to weapons so very easy.\n  As I say, this is the first step in a march to see that there is no \nability to enact prudent gun regulation throughout the United States.\n  I ask every colleague, before they vote for this, to think about the \npeople they represent and whether society is going to be safer because \nof their vote. How deep have we sunk in catering to these interests? \nFor shame.\n  The amendment before the Senate repeals all firearm registration \nrequirements in the District, making it even more difficult for law \nenforcement to trace guns used in crimes and track down the registered \nowner. The amendment repeals all existing safe-storage laws and \nprohibits the District from enacting any additional safe-storage laws. \nAfter the Heller decision, the District passed emergency legislation to \nallow guns to be unlocked for self-defense, but requiring that they \notherwise be kept locked to keep guns out of the hands of children and \ncriminals. We all ought to want that. The Ensign amendment repeals even \nthis modest limitation and prevents the District of Columbia City \nCouncil from enacting any law that discourages--whatever that means--\ngun ownership or requiring the safe storage of firearms. How can we, in \nthe Capital of the United States where we have had so many tragic \nevents, possibly do this? This is simply ridiculous and goes well \nbeyond the Supreme Court's ruling in Heller.\n  Think about what this means. Consider that every major gun \nmanufacturer recommends that guns be kept unloaded, locked, and kept in \na safe place. Under this amendment, the District could not enact any \nlegislation requiring that guns be stored in a safe place, even in \nhomes with children. How can anyone believe this broad-brush amendment \nis the right thing to do? How can any of us believe it provides \nprotection for the people we represent?\n  Let me make one other point. The American people clearly do not agree \nwith this amendment. Last fall, when a virtually identical bill was \nbeing considered in the House of Representatives, a national poll found \nthat 69 percent of Americans opposed Congress passing a law to \neliminate the District's gun laws--69 percent. That is about as good as \nwe get on any controversial issue. Additionally, 60 percent of \nAmericans believe Washington will become less safe if Congress takes \nthis step. Is this what we want? Do we want the Capital of the United \nStates to become less safe? I don't think so. Today, if this amendment \npasses in the Senate, it will be directly against the wishes of the \nAmerican people. It will not pass because it is good public policy--it \nwill only be passed to placate the National Rifle Association. I say \nfor shame.\n  As a former mayor who saw firsthand what happens when guns fall into \nthe hands of criminals, juveniles, and the mentally ill, I believe this \namendment places the families of the District of Columbia in great \njeopardy. The amendment puts innocent lives at stake. It is an affront \nto the public safety of the District. It is an affront to local home \nrule. This isn't just a bad amendment; it is a very dangerous one. I \nvery strongly urge Senators to join me in opposing it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I appreciate the debate on several \nkey\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\namendments. I also want to recognize my colleague from California and \nher strong support--indeed, key position--on the voucher program, the \nDC scholarship program that she has been one of the primary architects \nof and wants to get measurables on it. It is in the subcommittee on \nappropriations on which I serve, and she has been a key person on that. \nIt is my hope we can work that out, whether it is going to be at a \nlater time for reauthorization or if we can pass it here today. It is a \nkey program, and I want to recognize what my colleague has done on that \nhistorically. That is what I come to the floor to talk about, as well \nas a couple of other things that are coming up but particularly the DC \nscholarship program. It is an amendment. We have it appropriated in the \nappropriations bill, but it is required for reauthorization. It needs \nto be reauthorized. My hope is that the majority leader will say, yes, \nwe will bring this up for reauthorization and give us floor time to do \nthat. I understand the manager of this bill has said he would bring it \nup in his committee and do a markup in committee.\n  I have worked for this program for some period of time. I have worked \nwith the students and parents in this program. They love it. They \nappreciate the chance to succeed in a failed school system. The DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program has received applications from over \n7,000 low-income students, has served over 2,600 of these children. We \nhave far more applicants than we do slots. When these students entered \nthe program, they had average math and reading test scores in the \nbottom third of all test takers. Recent evaluation by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education--this goes back to last year--affirms academic \ngains among scholarship students less than 2 years after receiving a \nscholarship. Last year, after less than 1 year in the program, two \nsubgroups of students, representing 83 percent of participating \nstudents, showed positive results in math, and both years showed \noverwhelming parental satisfaction. Parents like it. Students are doing \nbetter. It is working.\n\n  I certainly wish to salute Mayor Fenty and DC school chancellor \nMichelle Rhee for making education reform and support for this program \nsomething important in the District. They made this a high priority.\n  Certainly, we have to get the schools functioning in the District of \nColumbia. This is a piece of it that is working for 1,700 students. We \nneed it reauthorized to be able to continue to move it forward. It \nwould be heartless for us not to do it.\n  I recognize a number of people have a problem with it on this bill. I \nunderstand that. If there is a chance we can get an agreement that the \nreauthorization would take place later, that would be a wise route to \ngo, and then follow through regular order. But this one is working and \nis working well. It is being well received by parents and students. It \nhas an odd sort of support base where it has both left and right. It \nhas a lot of people in a low-income situation supporting it. It is one \nof those pieces of legislation that have a broad base of support \nideologically and practically. People want to see it moving forward and \nhave it succeed as an overall program. I am very hopeful this Congress \ncan do that.\n  Two other quick points. One is coming up on the fairness doctrine \nthat will be considered. The fairness doctrine, to educate my \ncolleagues--I am sure everybody is familiar with it--was promulgated by \nthe FCC in 1949 to ensure that contrasting viewpoints would be \npresented on radio and television.\n  In 1985, the FCC began the process of repealing the doctrine after \nconcluding that it actually resulted in broadcasters limiting coverage \nof controversial issues of public importance.\n  Now we are hearing from some voices saying this doctrine should be \nput back in place. I urge colleagues to not do that. This isn't the way \nfor us to get a good discussion going in the public marketplace. \nIndeed, the results in the past, and I believe today, would be that the \ndoctrine would actually result in less, not more, broadcasting of \nimportant issues to the public. Airing controversial issues would \nsubject broadcasters to regulatory burdens and potentially severe \nliabilities. They simply would say: We will not put anything on.\n  Just think about the changing landscape in broadcast radio and \ntelevision that has taken place since 1949. These numbers are \nstartling. In 1949, there were 51 television stations in the country \nand 2,500 radio stations. Maybe a lot of people wish we would go back \nto that era of less media, but we will not. In 1958, there were 1,200 \ntelevision stations and 9,800 radio stations. Today, there are 1,800 \ntelevision stations and 14,000 radio stations. There is simply no \nscarcity to justify content mandates such as the fairness doctrine that \nwould be a regulatory nightmare for radio and television stations. \nPlus, we have all the new media, social networking, and individual \ncitizen access to information on the Internet that does not warrant \nthis being put back into place.\n  Finally, to comment on the second amendment rights, the Supreme \nCourt, in a historic ruling, has found that second amendment rights \napply to the individual, and that applies to individuals across the \ncountry, that applies to individuals in the District of Columbia. I \nthink those should be continued and guaranteed and supported by this \nbody as well. I think it would be appropriate for us to support that \nand support that in this legislation.\n  Madam President, in conclusion, I would like to have printed in the \nRecord two editorials in agreement from two publications that \nfrequently do not agree. One is from the Wall Street Journal and the \nother is from the Washington Post. Both are in support of the DC \nvoucher program, saying it works--it works for kids, it works for \nparents--and is something that should be continued. I have never had \nprinted in the Record before editorials from those two publications at \nthe same time agreeing on the same topic, particularly in education. I \nthink what it says is that this one is working and should be continued.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the editorials be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 25, 2009]\n\n                         Obama's School Choice\n\n       President Obama made education a big part of his speech \n     Tuesday night, complete with a stirring call for reform. So \n     we'll be curious to see how he handles the dismaying attempt \n     by Democrats in Congress to crush education choice for 1,700 \n     poor kids in the District of Columbia.\n       The omnibus spending bill now moving through the house \n     includes language designed to kill the Opportunity \n     Scholarship Program offering vouchers for poor students to \n     opt out of rotten public schools. The legislation says no \n     federal funds can be used on the program beyond 2010 unless \n     Congress and the D.C. City Council reauthorize it. Given that \n     Democrats control both bodies--and that their union backers \n     hate school choice--this amounts to a death sentence.\n       Republicans passed the program in 2004, with help from \n     Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, and it has been \n     extremely popular. Families receive up to $7,500 a year to \n     attend the school of their choice. That's a real bargain, \n     given that D.C. public schools spend $14,400 per pupil on \n     average, among the most in the country.\n       To qualify, a student's household income must be at or \n     below 185% of the poverty level. Some 99% of the participants \n     are minority, and the average annual income is $23,000 for a \n     family of four. A 2008 Department of Education evaluation \n     found that participants had higher reading scores than their \n     peers who didn't receive a scholarship, and there are four \n     applicants for each voucher.\n       Vouchers also currently exist in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, \n     Ohio, Louisiana, Utah and Wisconsin. And school choice \n     continues to proliferate elsewhere in the form of tax credits \n     and charter schools. The District's is the only federally \n     funded initiative, however, and local officials from former \n     Mayor Anthony Williams to current Mayor Adrian Fenty and \n     Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee support its continuation. As \n     Ms. Rhee put it in a December 2007 interview with the \n     Journal, ``I would never, as long as I am in this role, do \n     anything to limit another parent's ability to make a choice \n     for their child. Ever.''\n       Ms. Rhee is working to reform all D.C. public schools, \n     which in 2007 ranked last in math and second-to-last in \n     reading among all U.S. urban school systems on the federal \n     National Assessment of Educational Progress. Without the \n     vouchers, more than 80% of the 1,700 kids would have to \n     attend public schools that haven't made ``adequate yearly \n     progress'' under No Child Left Behind. Remember all of those \n     Members of Congress standing and applauding on Tuesday as Mr. \n     Obama called for every American child to get some education \n     beyond high school? These are the same Members who protect \n     and defend a D.C. system in which about half of all students \n     fail even to graduate from high school.\n\n[[Page S2516]]\n\n       On Tuesday, Mr. Obama spoke of the ``historic investment in \n     education'' in the stimulus bill, which included a \n     staggering, few-strings-attached $140 billion to the \n     Department of Education over two years. But he also noted \n     that ``our schools don't just need more resources; they need \n     more reform,'' and he expressed support for charter schools \n     and other policies that ``open doors of opportunity for our \n     children.''\n       If he means what he says, Mr. Obama won't let his fellow \n     Democrats consign 1,700 more poor kids to failing schools \n     he'd never dream of letting his own daughters attend.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 25, 2009]\n\n                           Voucher Subterfuge\n\n       Congressional Democrats want to mandate that the District's \n     unique school voucher program be reauthorized before more \n     federal money can be allocated for it. It is a seemingly \n     innocuous requirement. In truth it is an ill-disguised bid to \n     kill a program that gives some poor parents a choice \n     regarding where their children go to school. Many of the \n     Democrats have never liked vouchers, and it seems they won't \n     let fairness or the interests of low-income, minority \n     children stand in the way of their politics. But it also \n     seems they're too ashamed--and with good reason--to admit to \n     what they're doing.\n       At issue is a provision in the 2009 omnibus spending bill \n     making its way through Congress. The $410 billion package \n     provides funds for the 2009-10 school year to the D.C. \n     Opportunity Scholarship Program, a pioneering effort that \n     awards scholarships of up to $7,500 a year for low-income \n     students to attend private schools. But language inserted by \n     Democrats into the bill stipulates that any future \n     appropriations will require the reauthorization of the \n     program by Congress and approval from the D.C. Council.\n       We have no problem with Congress taking a careful look at \n     this initiative and weighing its benefits. After all, it was \n     approved in 2004 as a pilot program, subject to study. In \n     fact, this is the rare experimental program that has been \n     carefully designed to produce comparative results. But the \n     proposed Democratic provision would short-circuit this study. \n     Results are not due until June, and an additional year of \n     testing is planned. Operators of the program need to accept \n     applications this fall for the 2010-11 school year, and \n     reauthorizations are complicated, time-consuming affairs. \n     Indeed, staff members on various House and Senate committees \n     scoffed yesterday when we asked about the chances of getting \n     such a program reauthorized in less than a year. Legislation \n     seeking reauthorization has not even been introduced.\n       If the Democratic leadership is so worried about process, \n     it might want to review a recent report from the \n     Congressional Budget Office listing the hundreds of millions \n     of dollars that have been appropriated to programs whose \n     authorizations have expired. Many of these programs get far \n     more than the $14 million allocated to the Opportunity \n     Scholarships. House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) \n     was right to call out the Democrats for this back-door \n     attempt to kill the voucher program. The attention should \n     embarrass congressional Democrats into doing the right thing. \n     If not, city leaders, including D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty \n     (D), need to let President Obama know that some 1,800 poor \n     children are likely to have their educations disrupted.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now debate concurrently the Durbin amendment No. 591 and the \nDeMint amendment No. 573; that no amendments be in order to either \namendment prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; with the time \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Durbin and DeMint or \ntheir designees; that at 2 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the Durbin amendment No. 591, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the DeMint amendment No. 573; that prior to the second \nvote, there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form, and the second vote be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Madam President.\n  This has been a good debate, not just about DC voting rights but \nconstitutional rights in our country, and if we are going to go by our \nown opinions and good intentions or are we going to follow the \nConstitution. Clearly, a lot of us wish to give fair representation to \neveryone who lives in the District of Columbia. But our oath of office \nis not to our good intentions, it is to protect and defend the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  The Constitution is very clear that Congressmen and Senators are \nallocated only to States. The District of Columbia was set up as a \nneutral entity, certainly where people will live and work associated \nwith the business of the Federal Government, but there is nothing in \nthe Constitution that would give a Congressman or Senators to this \nFederal District of Columbia. So we are talking about a constitutional \nissue.\n  We have had other constitutional issues, such as the Bill of Rights \nguarantee to bear arms, and there will be an amendment to that effect \nwith the bill. I wish to bring up another constitutional issue, which \nis the right of free speech and the freedom of the press.\n  A number of Members of Congress have been talking about the annoyance \nof having radio talk show hosts talk about what we are doing here. I do \nnot blame the other side for being annoyed when a radio talk show host \nactually describes what is in a bill, since we have gotten in the habit \nof not actually reading them ourselves. When we have radio talk show \nhosts all around the country going through page by page, contradicting \nwhat is actually being said here, I can understand that people wish to \nmuzzle those radio talk show hosts. That could be the opinion of some \nof those in Congress today, but it happens to go against the \nConstitution when we try to decide what people can say and what they \nbelieve.\n  There is actually a doctrine that was mentioned by the Senator from \nKansas\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\ncalled the fairness doctrine that is one of those political doublespeak \ntitles that is radio censorship that actually tries to control what \nradio talk show hosts could say. That doctrine was dispensed with by \nReagan, and since then we have thousands of radio talk shows with wide \nvarieties of opinion. But many are starting to talk about bringing back \nthis radio censorship idea to try to force radio stations to present \nalternative opinions every time a radio talk show host presents an \nopinion of their own.\n  What this would do is create a dysfunctional situation where no radio \nstation could afford to have a talk show host express an opinion of any \nkind if they had to go out and find someone to express the opposite \nopinion and in the meantime face lawsuit after lawsuit from the ACLU \nand others. Because whose opinion is going to determine what is fair, \nwhat is balanced, what is diverse? But the whole implication here is \nthat the Federal Government and the Federal Communications Commission \nare somehow going to decide for us what is fair and what is balanced \nand what is diverse.\n  The amendment I am offering today, which we call the Broadcaster \nFreedom Act, would prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from \nreestablishing any part of what is called the ``fairness doctrine'' \ninto their regulatory structure today.\n  Plain and simple, most people here have said they do not want it to \ncome back. President Obama said last week he is against the fairness \ndoctrine. So who could oppose us making it a law that some bureaucrat \nover at the Federal Communications Commission could not write into \nregulations all or parts of this censorship of radio talk shows across \nthe country?\n  It is a pretty simple amendment, but I have a feeling it is getting \nready to sound lot more complicated when the other side starts \npresenting what is in it. We have found in this body that the facts, \nthe truths, sometimes do not make a lot of difference. But anyone who \nvotes against my amendment, the Broadcaster Freedom Act, is voting \nagainst the Constitution. They are voting against the freedom of the \npress. They are voting against the freedom of speech in this country.\n  The one hope we have to turn this Government around, to stop this \nspending, and the intervention in all areas of our life, is a free \npress that can tell people the truth about what is going on. More and \nmore, we have the radio talk show hosts and the bloggers and some cable \nnews that every day are telling Americans more about what we are doing, \nand Americans are getting more informed, they are getting more engaged \nand increasingly more outraged about what we are doing.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment and to vote against \nthis side by side that is being presented by the Democratic majority. \nWhat we are seeing in this side by side is the real intention of the \nDemocratic majority as far as dealing with this fairness doctrine. They \nare going to propose that we as a Congress direct the Federal \nCommunications Commission--that we are going to say: ``shall take \nactions to encourage and promote diversity in communication media \nownership.''\n  Now, they are not just saying radio here. This is ``communication.'' \nThis includes the Web, the Internet, the blogs, blogisphere, \ntelevision, newspapers. This language would direct the Federal \nCommunications Commission to take action to enforce diversity in \ncommunication. This is Soviet-style language that you are going to get \nsome rosy picture of in a minute. But it is so open and so vague that \nabout every communication outlet in this country is going to be faced \nwith accusations that their ownership is not diverse.\n  What does ``diverse'' mean? Does it mean ``white and black''? What \nthey are after is what they believe, what their opinions are. If this \nwere applied to our offices here in the Senate, we could not say \nanything, I could not express my opinion today without being obligated \nby law to go find somebody to say something completely opposite of what \nI am saying. This is not freedom. Anyone who votes for this alternative \nis voting to repress the freedom of speech in this country, the freedom \nof media.\n  The second part of what they have after ``promote diversity in \ncommunication media''--all media; only the lawyers and the bureaucrats \nare going to tell us what that means--is ``to ensure that broadcast \nstation licenses are used in the public interest.'' That is already a \nlaw, and that is good, and television and radio stations that use the \npublic airwaves all over the country are held accountable by current \nlaw to do things in the public interest, and many of them are very good \nat that, and it is very helpful in our communities.\n  But I will ask my colleagues not to let this distraction confuse them \nabout the real intention. If we pass the broadcaster freedom amendment \ntoday, we are going to close the front door to taking away the freedom \nof speech in this country. But this alternative opens the backdoor to \nwhat the Democratic majority is after; that is, to muzzle this \nannoyance of people on the radio who are telling the truth about what \nis going on in this Congress.\n  If they can go out and threaten a station that they are not diverse \nin their ownership, and some judge or some bureaucrat is going to \ndecide whether they are diverse--and who knows what that means--we are \ngoing to create such risk and such liability and such intimidation that \nthis will not even look like America in a few years.\n  This is dangerous material that is being offered on the other side. I \nwill encourage my colleagues to remember our oath of office. It has \nnothing to do with enforcing our opinions or some judge's opinion on \nsome radio station out there that is trying to give its opinion to the \nAmerican people. We are dangerously close to the enslavement of \nsocialism in this country with the expansion of Government on every \nfront.\n  This is intolerable. Do not let the pretty language you are getting \nready to hear confuse you because this is against everything we swear \nan oath to in this Congress. I encourage my colleagues to vote against \nthe Durbin amendment, vote for the Broadcaster Freedom Act, and I would \nappreciate their support.\n  Thank you, Madam President, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 591\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am beginning to believe the Senator \nfrom South Carolina opposes my amendment. He has called it \nunconstitutional, Communist, socialistic, enslavement, and he is just \ngetting started. So I wish to explain what the debate is all about.\n  It is a fundamental question, and it is one I have reflected on. The \nfairness doctrine is the idea that broadcasters should cover issues \nimportant to local viewers and should cover these issues fairly; in \nother words, allow for different viewpoints to be heard and allow those \nideas to be presented in a way that is balanced or, as one of the \nnetworks say, fair and balanced.\n\n  The fairness doctrine isn't a new idea; it is one that has been \naround in some shape or form since the 1920s, and it was formally \nadopted by the Federal Communications Commission as a standard in \n1949--60 years ago. Back then, though, the world was a lot different. \nTelevision was in its infancy. It was just starting. In the 1950s, of \ncourse, there emerged three major television networks--NBC, ABC, and \nCBS. Congress and the FCC had a legitimate concern that these three \nnetworks and their local stations could abuse their power, because when \nyou broadcast to radio and television consumers, you are not using \nsomething you own, you are using the public airways. We own it. All of \nus collectively as Americans own it. We license those who use it and \nsay: You are allowed to broadcast your television signal or your radio \nsignal and you have to do it under certain rules and regulations. \nListening to the Senator from South Carolina, he is basically saying: \nGovernment, step aside. If a private entity wants to get involved in \nbroadcasting, that is an exercise of free speech.\n  Well, historically, the courts have not agreed with my friend from \nSouth Carolina. They have said that you can impose reasonable \nobligations on those who have licenses to use the airwaves. They don't \nown the airwaves; the public owns the airwaves, and there is a public \ninterest in reaching certain goals in those airwaves. One of those\n\n[[Page S2518]]\n\npublic interests was expressed and defined for many years as the \nfairness doctrine. The fairness doctrine basically said Americans are \nentitled to hear both sides of the story so there is balance and \nfairness in the news and in the expressions of ideas on these radio and \nTV stations. The fairness doctrine was clearly I think American, not \nCommunist; constitutional--no one struck it as unconstitutional during \nthe period of time it was in effect--and I don't know about the \nenslavement of socialism; I will have to reflect on that for a minute. \nBut the fact is, it was the law of the land. The mightiest broadcast \nstations, radio and TV stations that could have gone to court, I say to \nmy friend from South Carolina, and challenge that idea as \nunconstitutional were not successful in doing so. It is hard to imagine \nwe would restrict their broadcasting and they wouldn't challenge it if \nit was unconstitutional. Well, that is a fact. Facts sometimes are hard \nto deal with in debates such as this, but that was the reality.\n  That was then and this is now. The world has changed. The world of \nbroadcasting has changed. We still have the major networks--ABC, NBC, \nand CBS--but we also have CNN, FOX News, MSNBC, and hundreds of other \nchannels on cable TV. We have public broadcasting. We have more than \n14,000 AM and FM radio stations, hundreds of satellite radio stations, \nand we have the Internet. It is clear that technology has changed \ndramatically since 1949 and the institution of the fairness doctrine. \nThere are more ways now than ever to hear a variety of perspectives on \na number of issues.\n  So when the fairness doctrine was repealed in 1987, many of us \nobjected. The basic argument: Americans have the right to hear both \nsides of the story; television and radio stations should still hold \nthemselves to that standard. Let the American people decide. Don't let \none major network jam through a political viewpoint over the public \nairwaves that the American people, frankly, have to take or leave. I \nthought that was the right position then in 1987, but I will tell my \ncolleagues the world has changed.\n  President Obama has said while on the campaign trail and in the White \nHouse that he doesn't support reinstating the fairness doctrine, and \nneither do I. You will find no mention of the fairness doctrine on the \nWhite House Web site; you will find no effort to reinstitute the \nfairness doctrine in my amendment. Because, quite honestly, now it \nisn't a question of NBC giving me one point of view and I have to take \nit or leave it. We all know what happens when you go home with the \nremote control; you have more choices than you know what to do with. \nThat gives a variety of opinions an opportunity to be expressed on \ntelevision--the same thing is true on radio--for Americans to hear a \ndifferent point of view. If they want to switch from Rachel Maddow to \nBill O'Reilly, they will hear a much different view of the world. It is \nthere. It reflects the reality of technology and media today.\n  So I think it is interesting that the Senator from South Carolina \nstill bangs away at this notion that some people on the floor want to \nreinstate the fairness doctrine. I don't. There may be others who do. \nMy amendment has nothing to do with that.\n  The amendment Senator DeMint has written was not carefully written. I \ndon't know if he understands some of the language he included. I call \nhis attention to a paragraph in his amendment, paragraph 2 of section \n303A. It seems like a very general statement that shouldn't cause any \ntrouble, but I am afraid it does, because after he goes after \neliminating the fairness doctrine, he also includes any similar \nrequirement that broadcasters meet program and quotas or guidelines for \nissues of public importance. Now, that is a problem. I don't know if he \nunderstands it is a problem, but it is. This amendment does more than \nban the FCC from doing something it wasn't going to do anyway. \nIncidentally, nobody is talking about reinstating the fairness \ndoctrine. This is the ``bloody shirt.'' That term is a political term \nthat came about after the Civil War when people would come to the floor \nand try to inflame passions, and they said: You are waving the bloody \nshirt of the war; stop that. Let's have a rational conversation.\n  Well, the rightwing broadcasters on their side, conservative \nbroadcasters, have been waving this bloody shirt of the fairness \ndoctrine for months. They love this. They have set up this kind of \nfalse choice that you are going to take away the right of free speech \nand they are trying to impose the fairness doctrine. It hasn't \nhappened, it isn't going to happen, and I am not trying to make it \nhappen.\n  The DeMint amendment also contains a provision which I read to my \ncolleagues that seriously cripples the FCC's ability to ensure \nresponsible broadcasting. Remember: Public airwaves that the radio and \nTV station owners apply for a license from the Government to use to \nmake money. The public airwaves truly are the property of the American \npeople. We say to broadcasters that in return for a license to use \nthose airwaves, your Government is going to ask that you use them in \nthe public interest. Now, what does it mean to say we use the airwaves \nin the public interest? According to Senator DeMint, it is the \nenslavement of socialism. Well, here are the 14 major elements listed \nby the FCC when it comes to defining the public interest: Opportunity \nfor local self-expression, development and use of local talent, \nprograms for children, religious programs, educational programs, public \naffairs programs, editorialization by licensees, political broadcasts, \nagricultural programs, news programs, weather and market services, \nsports programs, service to minority groups, and entertainment \nprogramming.\n  Senator DeMint's amendment--that second paragraph I read which has \nnot been carefully written--goes way beyond stopping the fairness \ndoctrine; it undermines the FCC's ability to make sure broadcasters \nmeet these public interest obligations. So what. What if the public \ninterest requirement disappeared tomorrow? What difference would it \nmake? Let me tell my colleagues the difference it would make. There \nwould be no requirement that your local station provide local news and \nweather. There would be no requirement that your local television \nstation provide children with programming that is free from sex and \nviolence. There would be no requirement to make sure advertising to \nchildren is subject to appropriate limitations and no requirement to \nprovide a minimum amount of educational programming on each channel. \nDoes that have anything to do with the fairness doctrine? It doesn't. \nWhat Senator DeMint is doing is undermining broadcasting in the public \ninterest.\n  If a station decided to run a religious program, they would be doing \nit in the public interest. Senator DeMint removes that definition of \npublic interest. In fact, he says--let's go back to the exact language \nof his amendment. He says, ``any similar requirement that broadcasters \nmeet programming quotas or guidelines for issues of public \nimportance.'' So his language goes too far.\n\n  What we have tried to do is to make sure we don't limit the FCC's \nability to protect the most vulnerable and impressionable viewers and \nlisteners in America--our kids and our grandkids. The DeMint amendment \ntakes away that requirement of licensees, radio and TV licensees, to \nprotect children from sex and violence. They might do it anyway, they \nmight not, but there would be no license requirement under the DeMint \nlanguage.\n  I still believe broadcasters who use public airwaves should use them \nin a fair and reasonable way in the public interest, and I believe the \nFCC should be able to enforce this. If the DeMint amendment is passed \nand if it became law, if you wanted to enforce the fact that on \nSaturday morning, when a lot of kids are watching television, the local \ntelevision station is running a gory movie or one that is on the edge \nwhen it comes to sexual content, it would be hard, if not impossible, \nto do it. I am sure that is not the Senator's intent, but that \nparagraph was very poorly written, and that is why I change it.\n  Now, there is also the suggestion by the Senator from South Carolina \nthat if we encourage diversity of media ownership, somehow that is \ncommunistic. From my point of view, it is not. Diversity of ownership \nopens the public airwaves to a variety of different owners. I am not \nsaying here--and no one is suggesting--that the law for the Federal \nCommunications Commission says you can give this license to a \nRepublican and this one to a Democrat or\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\nthis one to a liberal and this one to a conservative. When I talk about \ndiversity of media ownership, it relates primarily to gender and race \nand other characteristics of that nature. We don't mandate it, even \nthough you would think we did when you hear Senator DeMint read from my \namendment. What we say is the Commission shall take actions to \nencourage and promote diversity in communications media ownership. I \ndon't think that is a mandate to give licenses to any one group; it \njust says ``take actions to promote and encourage,'' something that is \nalready in the law.\n  I might say to the Senator, section 307B of the Communications Act--\nand I hope you will have your staff look at it--requires that the FCC \nensure that license ownership be spread among diverse communities. It \nis there already. It is there already. This enslavement of socialism, \nin the words of the Senator from South Carolina, is already there. I \ndon't think this is socialistic, communistic or unconstitutional. It is \nin the law. So to say we are going to promote what the law already says \nis hardly a denial of basic constitutional freedoms. Second, the \nCommunications Act requires the FCC to eliminate market entry barriers \nfor small businesses to increase the diversity of media voices. That is \nsection 257, which I hope your staff will look at too.\n  To argue that what I am putting in here is a dramatic change in the \nlaw or is going to somehow muzzle Rush Limbaugh is not the case. What \nwe are suggesting is, it is best that we follow the guidelines already \nin the law to promote and encourage diversity in media ownership. Even \nwith cable, satellite, and Internet, broadcast TV and radio, there are \nstill important ways we learn about what is going on in our communities \nand in our country.\n  The Senator from South Carolina went on to say this amendment would \naffect the Internet and blogs. I have to remind the Senator they are \nnot licensed. They don't have FCC licenses. They are not affected by \nthis debate. You can start a blog tomorrow, I can, too, and I don't \nhave to go to the FCC for approval. They certainly cannot monitor that \nblog to determine whether it is in the public interest. That is not the \nlaw. The Senator is on this rampage and, yet, when you look at the \nfacts, they do not apply to the Internet or blogs.\n  We should be concerned, however, that the policies of the last decade \nhave led to bigger and more consolidated media outlets controlling more \nof the stations and more of the content. As a result of these policies \ntoday, women and minorities are less likely to own media stations, even \nthough the existing law says that is a goal when it comes to licensure. \nNationwide, women own just 5 percent of all broadcast TV stations. \nRacial or ethnic minorities own just 3.3 percent. In Chicago, the city \nI am proud to represent--diverse and vibrant with many significant \nminority communities--there is only one commercial TV station owned by \na racial or ethnic minority. The numbers are almost as dismal in radio. \nNationwide, women own just 6 percent of broadcast stations; minorities, \n7.7 percent. In Chicago, only four radio stations are owned by \nminorities. That is about 5 percent of the radio stations in Chicago, \nless than the national average.\n  The content of the media should reflect the diversity of America. \nThese statistics show this is not currently the case. The law says that \nshould be our goal. The existing law says that should be our goal. I \nrestate the existing law, and the Senator from South Carolina calls it \ncommunism. I don't think it is. I think it is still a worthy goal so \nthat there is diversity in ownership, diversity in stations. I am \nacknowledging the obvious.\n  I am acknowledging the obvious: We are no longer in the world of \nthree television networks; we are in a world where we have many \ndifferent choices. I ask that we reaffirm diversity and media ownership \nso there will be choices. I hope the Senator from South Carolina cannot \nargue that we should not have choices, that we cannot turn the dial to \nour favorite stations, or punch the remote control to reach those \nstations. I think that as long as America has those choices, it serves \nthe original goal of letting us hear different sides of the story and \ndoesn't reimpose the fairness doctrine, which none of us are asking \nfor.\n  We need to make the media more accessible to all voices in America. \nIsn't that what we are all about in this country? Don't we basically \nsay we trust the people of this country to hear both sides of the story \nand make up their own minds? We sure do. We give them a right to vote. \nI guess that is the most instructive delegation of authority you can \ngive to a person: you get to pick your leadership based on your \nopinion.\n  All I am asking is that we encourage diversity of media ownership so \nthere are more options, more opinions being shared, and Americans can \nchoose the ones they want. I will repeat so my friend from South \nCarolina understands clearly, I do not favor the reinstatement of the \nfairness doctrine. The world has changed. The world of media and \ntechnology has changed. I believe Americans are entitled to hear \ndifferent points of view, and that is why I restate the existing law--\nand I have given citations for both sections of the Communications \nAct--which is that we need to have more diversity in media ownership in \nAmerica. I have not proposed taking away a license from anybody or \ngiving one to anybody. Setting this as a goal is as American as apple \npie and has nothing to do with communism or Marxism.\n  I say to the Senator I was careful in writing this amendment, so I \nincluded a section very similar to his section (2) but narrowing it to \nthe issue of fairness. I say--and this is so short that I will read \nparts:\n\n       The Commission shall take actions to encourage and promote \n     diversity in communication ownership and ensure that \n     broadcast station licenses are used in the public interest.\n\n  That is so there is diversity in ownership and we protect kids from \nsex and violence. If the Senator thinks that is communism, I disagree \nwith him.\n  Then I say:\n\n       Nothing in section 303A--\n\n  Which is what we are talking about in this amendment--\n\n     shall be construed to limit the authority of the commission \n     regarding matters unrelated to a requirement that \n     broadcasters present or ascertain opposing viewpoints on \n     issues of public importance.\n\n  I protect what I think was the intent of his amendment to prohibit \nthe reinstitution of the fairness doctrine, which nobody has suggested, \nbut to make it clear that is as far as we go. We are not eliminating \nthe requirement of broadcasting in the public interest for obvious \nreasons: We want to protect kids; we want to protect families; we want \nto keep sex and violence away from kids; and make sure there is local \nnews and weather so people can turn on the TV stations and learn about \nit.\n  All of these things, from my point of view, are constructive, and I \nhope we all agree. The Senator from South Carolina has said that old \nDurbin will argue for the fairness doctrine. Let's correct the record. \nI am not doing that. The fairness doctrine, in 2009, doesn't make \nsense. It might have made sense in 1948. We should not reinstitute \nthat, but let's not give up on fairness. Let's make sure American \nviewers of television and listeners of radio have choices. Making those \nchoices can form an opinion that leads to their expression of points of \nview and their votes. There is nothing wrong with that.\n  For the people who want to take a license and use the airwaves, there \nare basic rules. We don't want you to put gory movies and sex on \ntelevision during early morning hours on a Saturday when kids are \nwatching. We want you to be careful in your content so you don't do \nsomething that is abusive of your use of our public airwaves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I always enjoy a good debate with the \nSenator from Illinois. He is certainly good at what he does and, in \nthis case, that is confusing facts. The good news for us and all \nAmericans is, this afternoon, on radio talk shows all across the \ncountry, they can find out what is in both of these amendments and what \nit really means. They are not going to hear it here today. There have \nbeen a lot of distortions but interesting admissions.\n  Certainly, the Senator from Illinois made it very clear that he \nshould be a part of determining what is fair and balanced and how we \nshould determine\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\nwhat is both sides. He mentioned there are 14,000 radio stations. What \nhe does with his amendment is he orders ``shall take action to \nencourage and promote diversity and communication media ownership.'' He \nwants our FCC to monitor 14,000 radio stations to decide if their \nownership is diverse. He said it doesn't apply to the Internet, but we \ndo regulate the Internet. We regulate everything in America, folks--\neverything that a Federal dollar touches.\n  Believe me, this language is not just about radio stations; it is \nabout doing the impossible, and that is to centrally manage the \nownership of radio and other communications in this country. It goes \nback to his original opinion that, yes, he believes there should be \nfair and balanced perspective presented in the media. But what he \nbelieves--and what many on his side believe--is that fairness should be \ndetermined by those of us in Government rather than the listeners and \nviewers who tune into that radio or the TV station or go to that Web \nsite.\n  It is not for us to determine what is fair and balanced. His \ndistortion about my amendment and what it does is exactly wrong. We do \nnot address or change in any way the requirements of radio stations to \nact in the public interest. The nonsense about children's programming \nand indecency has nothing to do with this. It is another section in the \nlaw. I don't affect that in any way.\n  What this is about is, saying to your face, America, that they are \nnot for reinstating the censorship of radio, while at the same time \nintroducing an amendment that would allow us to go in and make our \njudgment, our opinion, about what is diverse ownership of a radio \nstation.\n  Let me read again what this provision in my amendment addresses. He \nsays it takes away the public interest clause. It has nothing to do \nwith that. But it prohibits this backdoor approach to getting back to \nthe principles of the fairness doctrine by saying broadcasters do not \nhave to meet programming quotas and guidelines. In other words, we \ncan't decide how many opinions they have to offer and what the \nguidelines for those opinions are. It is not for us to say. They have \nto fulfill their public interest obligations. We don't change that. But \nthis clause would keep the good Senator from Illinois and those on his \nside who want to censor radio from allowing the FCC to go in and set \nsome kind of quotas on how often, how they need to state their \nopinions, and the guidelines for that. It creates a license for us to \ngo in and determine what opinions, how many opinions, and basically it \nis the fairness doctrine through the back door.\n  I will restate that this Broadcasters Freedom Act protects the \nconstitutional rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. It \ndoes nothing to dislodge or change the requirement that public \nstations--radio or whatever communications--meet the current law \nrequirements to act in the public good. But it does keep us, as a \ngovernment, from setting quotas and guidelines of what opinions can be \nexpressed and how often they can be expressed.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. On that last point, am I correct in reaching the \nconclusion--and that second clause is prohibiting any similar \nrequirement that broadcasters meet programming quotas or guidelines for \nissues of public importance--that you do not intend to affect or \ndislodge in any way existing FCC laws or guidelines with regard to, for \ninstance, decency standards, language, or sexually loaded content, or \nviolent content that currently prevails?\n  Mr. DeMINT. The Senator is right. We have legal opinions on that, and \nit doesn't overrule any existing commission regulations. We asked the \nbroadcasters' legal counsel, and this is intended to narrow this \nfairness doctrine backdoor approach of controlling what people say by \nestablishing quotas and guidelines about how that is done. I thank the \nSenator for that question.\n  We have probably talked enough about this subject. I reserve the \nremainder of my time. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 587\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, today I speak as a Member of the \nSenate, but also as a former chairman and now ranking member of the \nOversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the \nDistrict of Columbia Subcommittee. I have had a relationship with the \nDistrict for quite some period of time and have been very interested in \nthe District and also in the District's reaching out in terms of \nproviding a quality education for the boys and girls who live in the \nDistrict, understanding that this is the Nation's Capital and it should \nbe the shining city on a hill where people can come from all over \nAmerica and see the very best we have in our country in terms of \neducational opportunities and, I also feel, the opportunity of people \nto have the right to vote.\n  As a result of my concerns about the ways to rectify the lack of \nvoting representation for the District, I have approached this bill \nwith the belief that citizens who pay taxes and serve in the military \nshould have House representation so long as such representation \nconforms to the Constitution.\n  Although a constitutional amendment would provide the clearest \nconstitutional means to ensure District residents are provided House \nrepresentation, after studying the legal arguments, I have concluded \nthat there are sufficient indicia and precedent that the Constitution's \nDistrict clause grants Congress the constitutional authority to give \nthe District a House Member. As for any argument that the bill is \nunconstitutional, I need only to say that I believe any ambiguity and \ndisagreement will be resolved quickly by the courts.\n  After weighing the constitutional arguments and equities, I have \ndecided to support this legislation--in fact, I am a cosponsor of this \nlegislation--on one condition: We must also continue to give the \nfamilies of the District a vote on how their children are educated.\n  Accordingly, I am proud to join Senator Ensign in offering an \namendment to reauthorize the District of Columbia Scholarship Program \nfor an additional year. Perhaps one may wonder why am I so concerned \nabout this issue. It is because of the fact that when I was Governor of \nOhio, we started a scholarship program in Ohio for children who were \nnot members of the public schools. That experiment has worked to the \nbenefit of thousands of children, particularly in the Cleveland \ndistrict, who have gone through the system and are now in college. I \nmeet with them, and they tell me: Were it not for the Cleveland \nScholarship Program where I had a choice to go to another school, I \ndon't believe I would be in college today and be as successful as I \nhave been.\n  When I instituted that program, it was said it was unconstitutional. \nI am pleased to say that several years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court said \nthat providing scholarships to nonpublic school systems fit in with the \nConstitution of our country.\n  When we had an opportunity to help the District, we provided $14 \nmillion for public schools, $14 million for charters, and $14 million \nfor the scholarship program. It is a critical component of a three-\nsector education strategy to provide a quality education to every child \nin the District, regardless of income or neighborhood.\n  The program provides up to $7,500 per student per year to fund \ntuition, fees, and transportation expenses for K-12 for low-income DC \nfamilies.\n  To qualify, students must live in the District and have a household \nincome of no more than 185 percent of the Federal poverty level. In \n2008, that was\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\nabout $39,000 per family of four. In fact, the average income for \nfamilies using scholarships in 2008 was just over $24,000.\n  Since its inception, the program has served over 2,600 students. They \nhave about 7,500 who would like to get in the program, but they do not \nhave a place for them. Entering students had average math and reading \ntest scores in the bottom third.\n  A recent evaluation of the Department of Education reaffirms academic \ngains among participants less than 2 years after receiving a \nscholarship. They are benefiting from it. We need more time to see how \nit works out. I wish to underscore that I think this is part of this \nwhole package we put together.\n  Many Members of this body are unaware of the fact that today the \npeople who live in the District can go to any public college in the \nUnited States and we provide up to $10,000 for out-of-State tuition. \nThey are not aware of the fact that Don Graham over at the Washington \nPost got the business community together and set up the Washington \nscholarship program, the CAP program, and $2,500 is available for \nyoungsters. Or that the Gates Foundation thinks so much of what is \nhappening in the District that they provided another $120 million to \nkeep kids in school in the two worst dropout districts in the District \nof Columbia.\n  There are some wonderful things happening in the District, and yet--\nand yet--there are some people here, because of special interest \ngroups, who want to do away with the scholarship program. They want to \ndeny these children an opportunity to have this educational \nopportunity, this smorgasbord we have available to them.\n  What this amendment does is it extends for 1 year that program as we \nlook at it and see how it goes through its metamorphosis.\n  I have to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and \nthis side of the aisle, if you want to do something that is disastrous \nto the kids in the District in terms of public relations and the \ninterest of all these people in the District, go ahead and make it \nimpossible for this program to keep going.\n  Think about this: the Gates Foundation, the College Assistance \nProgram--great things are happening in the District today. What a \nterrible message it would send to the rest of the country and those who \ncare about education in the District if we were denied this \nopportunity, this experiment to continue in the District.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two editorials, \none on January 26 titled ``School Vouchers, District parents know why \nthe program should continue.'' The demand for it is tremendous. They \nwant it. And a recent editorial, ``Hoping no one notices, congressional \nDemocrats step between 1,800 DC children and a good education.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 26, 2009]\n\nSchool Vouchers--District Parents Know Why the Program Should Continue.\n\n       Early surveys of D.C. parents of children receiving federal \n     school vouchers showed many of them liked the program because \n     they believed their children were in safe schools. Over time, \n     a new study shows, their satisfaction has deepened to include \n     an appreciation for small class sizes, rich curricula and \n     positive change in their sons and daughters. Above all, what \n     parents most value is the freedom to choose where their \n     children go to school.\n       Here, for example, is what one parent told University of \n     Arkansas researchers studying the District's Opportunity \n     Scholarship Program: ``I know for a fact they would never \n     have received this kind of education at a public school. . . \n     . I listen to them when they talk, and what they are saying, \n     and they articulate better than I do, and I know it's because \n     of the school, and I like that about them, and I'm proud of \n     them.'' Overall, researchers found that choice boosts \n     parents' involvement in their children's education.\n       Whether they continue to have such a choice could be \n     determined soon. The program that provides scholarships of up \n     to $7,500 per year for low-income students to attend private \n     schools is funded only through the 2009-10 school year. \n     Unusually restrictive language being drafted for the omnibus \n     budget bill would forbid any new funding unless Congress \n     reauthorizes the program and the District passes legislation \n     in agreement. Yet results of the Education Department's \n     scientific study of the program are not expected until June.\n       We hope that, despite his stated reservations about \n     vouchers, President Obama includes money in his upcoming \n     budget to safeguard the interests of children in this \n     important local program and to preserve an unusually rigorous \n     research study. Mr. Obama and his education secretary, Arne \n     Duncan, say they eschew ideology in favor of what serves the \n     interests of children. Here's a chance to help 1,716 of them.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 25, 2009]\n\nVoucher Subterfuge--Hoping No One Notices, Congressional Democrats Step \n            Between 1,800 D.C. Children and a Good Education\n\n       Congressional Democrats want to mandate that the District's \n     unique school voucher program be reauthorized before more \n     federal money can be allocated for it. It is a seemingly \n     innocuous requirement. In truth it is an ill-disguised bid to \n     kill a program that gives some poor parents a choice \n     regarding where their children go to school. Many of the \n     Democrats have never liked vouchers, and it seems they won't \n     let fairness or the interests of low-income, minority \n     children stand in the way of their politics. But it also \n     seems they're too ashamed--and with good reason--to admit to \n     what they're doing.\n       At issue is a provision in the 2009 omnibus spending bill \n     making its way through Congress. The $410 billion package \n     provides funds for the 2009-10 school year to the D.C. \n     Opportunity Scholarship Program, a pioneering effort that \n     awards scholarships of up to $7,500 a year for low-income \n     students to attend private schools. But language inserted by \n     Democrats into the bill stipulates that any future \n     appropriations will require the reauthorization of the \n     program by Congress and approval from the D.C. Council.\n       We have no problem with Congress taking a careful look at \n     this initiative and weighing its benefits. After all, it was \n     approved in 2004 as a pilot program, subject to study. In \n     fact, this is the rare experimental program that has been \n     carefully designed to produce comparative results. But the \n     proposed Democratic provision would short-circuit this study. \n     Results are not due until June, and an additional year of \n     testing is planned. Operators of the program need to accept \n     applications this fall for the 2010-11 school year, and \n     reauthorizations are complicated, time-consuming affairs. \n     Indeed, staff members on various House and Senate committees \n     scoffed yesterday when we asked about the chances of getting \n     such a program reauthorized in less than a year. Legislation \n     seeking reauthorization has not even been introduced.\n       If the Democratic leadership is so worried about process, \n     it might want to review a recent report from the \n     Congressional Budget Office listing the hundreds of millions \n     of dollars that have been appropriated to programs whose \n     authorizations have expired. Many of these programs get far \n     more than the $14 million allocated to the Opportunity \n     Scholarships. House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) \n     was right to call out the Democrats for this back-door \n     attempt to kill the voucher program. The attention should \n     embarrass congressional Democrats into doing the right thing. \n     If not, city leaders, including D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty \n     (D), need to let President Obama know that some 1,800 poor \n     children are likely to have their educations disrupted.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, do you know why? It is because of the \nNational Education Association. They do not want it to happen. They \nfought it in my State. The Ohio school boards fought it. I will never \nforget going up for an endorsement in 2004 when I ran last time. When I \nran in 1998, I got support from the Ohio Education Society. They said: \nNo Governor has done more for education than George Voinovich. So I \ncame to Washington. They kind of forgave me for the scholarship program \nin Cleveland. They kind of let that go.\n  Madam President, 2004 came along, and I went through the whole \nendorsement procedure. I did everything. After it was over, many people \ncame up to me and said: George, you absolutely did a fabulous job with \nyour presentation, what you are trying to do with education on the \nnational level and you are concerned about it. But we got the word from \nWashington that you are not going to be endorsed because you have \nbroken the rule in supporting scholarships, supporting an opportunity \nfor kids to have another opportunity to go to school and try something \nnew.\n  I want to say this. In this country of ours, we cannot survive with \nhalf the kids in our urban districts dropping out of school. I am glad \nthe President spoke about it in his State of the Union. I am glad the \nPresident talked about charter schools. But the real question is, Is he \ngoing to stand up and are the Democrats on the other side of the aisle \nand some Republicans going to stand up to the National Education \nAssociation, the National School Boards Association and some of these \ngroups that want to keep things as they are?\n  I am going to tell you something, Madam President. We will never make\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\nit. I want everybody to understand that I am for this bill, voting \nrights, but I am not going to support this bill unless I am convinced \nwe are going to have an opportunity to debate this issue in the Senate \nand keep this program going for the boys and girls who are benefiting \nfrom it, the same kind of program that benefited so many thousands of \npeople in the State of Ohio.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Ohio. He \nspeaks with such admirable passion about the needs of children who \nobviously are not his. He has a record on this issue. He knows, as I \ndo, though, that some groups may disapprove, oppose this DC low-income \nstudent scholarship program. One group that doesn't oppose it--in fact, \nenthusiastically supports it--is the parents of low-income children in \nthe District who have oversubscribed by multiples for this program \nevery year.\n  We are going to have conversations during this discussion. I support \nthis program, as my friend from Ohio knows. Hopefully, we can get to a \npoint where we can have an agreement that will get some floor time for \nthis discussion. As I said earlier, since the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has tucked within it jurisdiction over \nmatters related to the District of Columbia, we would, I believe, be \nthe authorizing committee.\n  I am certainly committed to holding a hearing on the reauthorization \nbill. The Senator from Ohio rightly wants to guarantee by one means or \nanother that there will be floor debate on this issue in a timely way; \nthat is, so that we can consider it in plenty of time for the DC school \nsystem to act.\n  Most of all, I tell him I admire the strength of his position because \nit is a position that cares for children. It is not against anything. \nIt is for a good education for all our children. I thank him. I admire \nhim.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Buy America\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we are in the worst recession since the \nGreat Depression. We have been in a recession in my State longer than \nthe official 13 months that economists have noted. With the economic \nrecovery package signed into law last week, we took a major step toward \ngetting our economy on the path for success and toward rebuilding and \nstrengthening the Nation's middle class. The economic recovery package \nmeans billions of dollars to help shore up State budgets and help \nStates pay for essential programs such as Medicaid and unemployment \ninsurance. The economic recovery package means money for job-creating \nefforts from shovel-ready projects to long-term investment in new \ntechnology.\n  In this economic crisis, we have seen demand for manufactured goods \nslow to a crawl. Coupled with the unavailability of credit, many \nmanufacturers have ceased or idled operations. American manufacturing \nshed 800,000 jobs last year, nearly one-third of all job losses. Last \nweek many people probably missed the bad news on manufacturing released \nby the Federal Reserve. The Fed reported that output in manufacturing \nfell 2.5 percent in January. That means manufacturing lost 207,000 jobs \nin January alone. That is on top of manufacturing falling nearly 3 \npercent in December. This puts manufacturing's decline over the last 3 \nmonths at a shocking 26.7 percent.\n  That is why this recovery package is so important. The recovery \npackage has two key objectives: stimulate the economy and create jobs. \nThe Government is investing billions of tax dollars in infrastructure, \nin safety net programs and alternative energy development. It is common \nsense to ensure that Federal funds for this recovery are used to buy \nAmerican products and to help promote manufacturing and job creation.\n  Studies across the board say more jobs are created when we have \nstrong domestic sourcing requirements. One recent study estimates 33 \npercent more manufacturing jobs will be created with ``Buy America''. \nWhen we utilize domestically manufactured goods, the more jobs we will \ncreate and the greater the stimulus will be to our economy, an economy \nthat has been the engine of growth for the world. The American people \nclearly have spoken out that they want this ``Buy America'' provision. \n``Buy America'' is common sense. The majority of Americans know that. \nSome 84 percent favored strong ``Buy America'' provisions in the \nstimulus.\n  Last week in Cleveland I visited ArcelorMittal Steel, a steel \nmanufacturer that employs lots of people but is a foreign-owned \ncompany. I met with the plant manager and his staff. I met with union \nworkers, including some who were recently laid off. This company, \nsimilar to all steel companies, is down 45 percent of its capacity. \nThey are forced to lay off workers because the demand for steel has \ndeclined--steel for autos, steel for household appliances, steel for \ninfrastructure projects. We talked about ``Buy America'' provisions and \nhow that can help the plant get up and running again. It is important \nto note that ArcelorMittal is an international company. Its \nheadquarters is not located in the United States. Yet that company \nbelieves ``Buy America'' provisions make sense, a foreign-based company \nthat supports ``Buy America'' provisions in the recovery package. There\n\n[[Page S2523]]\n\nare more foreign-based companies with American factories such as \nArcelorMittal that can benefit from the stimulus. I hope ``Buy \nAmerica,'' if properly implemented and properly enforced, will help \nmanufacturers such as ArcelorMittal and even attract new foreign \ninvestment in the United States. We need to make sure these provisions \nare properly implemented. We need to make sure that when a State or \nlocal government requests a waiver on ``Buy America'' provisions, the \nagency makes the request known. We need transparency so that, at the \nvery least, the taxpayers know if dollars are going to domestic or \nforeign manufacturers.\n  There are good reasons on occasion to have waivers. Sometimes \ndomestic steel or iron or cement might be too costly for a project to \nmake sense. Sometimes the right product in the right quantity may not \nbe available at the right time. Waivers are fine if implemented \ncorrectly, fairly, and with transparency. But that has not always been \nthe case. Since 2001, the Federal Highway Administration has granted 54 \n``Buy America'' waivers. The Federal Transit Administration has granted \nmore than 40 waivers. Most were granted based on the product not being \navailable in the United States. When the waiver request is not known by \nanyone except the Federal agency that receives it, how do we know the \nproducts are not made in America? Waivers can be fine but not if they \nare granted without transparency. We have a responsibility to the \ntaxpayer to ensure that these dollars are creating American jobs.\n  Americans, whether they are in Denver or Columbus, have supported \n``Buy America'' in large numbers. We know that, when the President \nspoke down the hall in the House about this stimulus package and about \nour efforts. We also know, if we are going to ask Americans to reach \ninto their pockets and spend tens of millions of dollars on \ninfrastructure projects, as Americans have said they would, we also \nneed to know this will create the jobs we promised.\n  The American people want three things: Accountability, which we give \nin this package; they want to know that this infrastructure is done by \nAmerican workers; and they want to know their tax dollars are used to \nbuy materials made in America for these projects that American workers \nare building.\n  We have a responsibility to give American manufacturers the \nopportunity to bid on the steel and iron and cement and the concrete \nthat will be in demand for these massive investments. ``Buy America'' \nis significant because it helps ensure we have a diverse and strong \nmanufacturing base.\n  Textbook trade theory says that making companies more and more \nspecialized in one sector is an unquestionable good, but that is not \nalways true. We have seen countries such as Great Britain \noverspecialize in finance while neglecting manufacturing. Some might \nsay that has happened here. The people screaming bloody murder about \n``Buy America'' are the same people who oversold the benefits of free \ntrade. These are entrenched interests, companies that, for instance, \noutsource their manufacturing, move their manufacturing plants abroad. \nThey import products back into the United States, and they use cheap \nlabor. That is so much of the story. In opposing ``Buy America,'' \ncompanies would say: We want to be able to sell our products overseas. \nThat is not the real story. The real story is these companies want to \noutsource their production to China, use very inexpensive labor, take \nadvantage of no worker safety rules in China, take advantage of very \nweak environmental rules in China, make those products there and then \nimport them back into the United States, outsource the jobs to China, \nmake the products there, and bring the products back to the United \nStates. We know what that does to American employment. We also know \nwhat it does for food safety, toy safety, vitamins, all the things we \nhave seen, contaminants in the food and toys. We cannot afford this any \nlonger. We cannot be a healthy economy without strong manufacturing. A \nhealthy economy is a balanced one, not overly dependent on one sector.\n  Let me be clear. ``Buy America'' is not about slowing international \ntrade. The editorial boards and pundits may scream trade war when the \nCongress considers how it will spend taxpayer dollars, but there is no \ndanger of a trade war. There is no danger of protectionism. We are a \ncountry with the most open markets in the world. We are a country with \nan $800 billion trade deficit, $2 billion a day going out of the \ncountry rather than money coming into the country. How can we be called \nprotectionist when we have that policy?\n  The United States will continue to have the most open market in the \nworld, and we should. The United States is a signatory to the World \nTrade Organization and other trade deals that actually limit policies \nthat countries can use on things such as ``Buy America'' or on climate \nchange or on food and product safety. That, in itself, is a subject \nmatter for further debate.\n  This is about using tax dollars in the best way to create jobs in \nIllinois, Colorado, and in Ohio. Now that the provisions are in the \nbill, Congress will work with the Obama administration in implementing \nthem with transparency and accountability. It is the right thing to do. \nIt will put Americans back to work. Americans demand that their tax \ndollars be spent on American workers using American products to build \nthis infrastructure to make a better economy.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the fairness doctrine was repealed by \nthe FCC over 20 years ago. I do not support its reinstatement because I \ndon't like the idea of the government micromanaging speech. I also have \nserious questions about whether it would be constitutional to reinstate \nthe fairness doctrine, given the wide variety of media outlets \navailable for the expression of different points of view. That is why I \nvoted for the amendment offered by Senator DeMint banning the fairness \ndoctrine.\n  Unfortunately, that amendment was drafted so broadly that it could \nhave also restricted the FCC from encouraging localism and ensuring \nthat broadcasters are living up to their public interest \nresponsibilities. These are responsibilities that broadcasters agree to \nwhen they are provided a segment of spectrum--a valuable piece of \npublic property--and they should not be undone. I supported the Durbin \namendment to clarify that public interest obligations remain, while \nensuring that the fairness doctrine does not return.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My vote on the DeMint amendment, No. 573, should not be \nconstrued as a vote in favor of restoring the fairness doctrine. I do \nnot favor restoring the fairness doctrine.\n  However, the DeMint amendment went much further than legislating on \nthe fairness doctrine. His amendment would have prohibited the FCC from \nestablishing any program guidelines at all no matter how reasonable. \nFor example, his amendment would have prohibited the FCC from \nestablishing guidelines for children's programs or guidelines to \nprohibit violent programming during a family viewing hour in the \nevening. These are just two examples that the DeMint amendment would \nhave prohibited.\n  To be clear, I support the provision in the DeMint amendment that \nwould have precluded the restoration of the fairness doctrine. My view \nis that the fairness doctrine is not appropriate for today's market. I \ndo support the creation of reasonable public interest standards that \nattach to a broadcast license dealing with localism issues and \ncommunity responsibility. But, I could not vote for such a broad \namendment that would have stripped from FCC reasonable and appropriate \nregulation of the type described above.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 591\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding the vote is scheduled for 2 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that it be moved until 2 minutes \nafter 2 and I be allowed to speak and there be response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before us is a debate on the fairness \ndoctrine. Sixty years ago, the Federal Communications Commission said \nradio and TV stations had to tell Americans both sides of the story. In \nthose days, television was just starting. In the 1950s,\n\n[[Page S2524]]\n\nthree networks emerged and the fairness doctrine applied for \ndecades. Then, in 1987, the FCC canceled the fairness doctrine, and \nthere has been a debate ever since whether we should return to it.\n\n  Well, if you want to argue whether Americans should hear both sides \nof every story to make up their minds, I think it is a pretty basic \nconcept. But while we were debating whether to return to the fairness \ndoctrine, media and technology changed dramatically. It is no longer \nthree networks, it is 200 channels, cable channels, and all sorts of \nopportunities for information.\n  So the fairness doctrine in its day was the right thing for the right \nreason. Today it is not. Senator DeMint wants to eliminate it--make \nsure no one brings it back. No one is planning on bringing it back. \nThere is no problem with that. But he included some language in his \namendment that goes too far. It takes away the authority of the Federal \nCommunications Commission to basically determine that radio and TV \nstations use their Federal licenses in the public interest. What does \nthat mean?\n  It means the FCC can tell a television station it cannot put on a \nviolent movie early on Saturday morning when kids are tuning in to \ncartoons. It cannot put on something with sexual tones to it at a time \nwhen children and family are watching. There are limitations because it \nis using America's airwaves to make money. Use them responsibly in the \npublic interest. I think it was inadvertent, but, in fact, he removed \nthat. He removed that authority of the FCC.\n  My amendment says two things. It is the first amendment we will vote \non. First, the existing statutory requirement for diversity in media \nownership is going to be encouraged so we have more and more different \npeople applying for licenses for radio and TV stations. There is \nnothing wrong with that, as I see it. It is already in the law. \nSecondly, do not take away the FCC's power to say to public licensees \nof television and radio: Operate in the public interest. Make sure you \nhave local news and weather. Make sure you do not have sexual content \nand violence on children's shows--basic things that are common sense.\n  I do not think the Senator from South Carolina wanted to change that. \nHe did inadvertently. My amendment cleans it up. If the Durbin \namendment is adopted, I encourage people to support both the Durbin \namendment and the DeMint amendment. If my amendment is not adopted, I \nhope they will reconsider their support for Senator DeMint's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to proceed for a few moments \non leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in recent months, a number of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have expressed support for \nreinstating the so-called fairness doctrine. But let's be honest. The \nfairness doctrine was anything but fair. It amounted to Government \ncontrol over political speech, and in the end it actually resulted in \nless, not more, political discourse over the airwaves because \nbroadcasters did not want to deal with all of its redtape. That is \nprecisely why the Federal Communications Commission repealed it back in \n1987, and why we must keep it from being reinstated now.\n  The reality behind this so-called fairness doctrine is that some of \nmy friends on the other side do not like what they are hearing on the \nradio these days. So instead of addressing the criticisms head on, they \nwant to silence them.\n  Americans will not stand for that, and we will not let it happen. \nGovernment is not the speech police, and I will not support--and I am \nconfident the American people do not support--efforts to restrict free \nspeech.\n  The Founding Fathers enshrined the right to free speech in the very \nfirst amendment to the Constitution because they knew it was \nfundamental--that it was the one right without which the others would \nlose their force. They also knew future generations would have to \ncontinue to defend that right from those who viewed it as an obstacle \nto their goals.\n  We should adopt the DeMint amendment to kill the so-called fairness \ndoctrine once and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n591 offered by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 573\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, before a vote in relation to amendment No. 573 offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, if I could have my colleagues' attention \nfor just a moment, I think this should be an easy vote for all of us. \nPresident Obama has expressed his opposition to the fairness doctrine. \nSenator Durbin has expressed his opposition to the fairness doctrine. \nThis amendment, the Broadcasters Freedom Act, prohibits the Federal \nCommunications Commission from implementing all or part of the fairness \ndoctrine, which has been repealed.\n  I wish to clear up one misunderstanding that has been stated on the \nother side. This amendment does not affect the public interest \nrequirements of broadcast radio. It does not change children's \nprogramming or opposition to indecency. What it does is, it prohibits \nquotas and guidelines on programming, which is another way to prohibit \nthe implementation of the fairness doctrine.\n  While the fairness doctrine is a direct and obvious method to burden \nand chill broadcaster speech, there are also several indirect ways that \nare not as well-known, but no less available to proponents of limiting \nthe freedom of our national media.\n  Last year's FCC Localism Notice of Proposed Rulemaking--MB Docket No. \n04-233, released January 24, 2008, ``Localism Notice''--contained a \nnumber of ``tentative conclusions'' that, if adopted, would result in \ngreater regulation of broadcaster speech.\n  First, the FCC proposed to reintroduce license renewal processing \n``guidelines'' that would measure specific categories of speech aired \nby broadcasters.\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\nThe guidelines would pressure broadcasters to air Commission-specified \namounts of programming in Commission-defined program categories. \nAlthough the Localism Notice does not specify which categories \nbroadcasters would be measured by, political programming, public \naffairs programming, and local news are mentioned as possible types of \nprogramming to be regulated. Broadcasters that do not meet the \nthresholds to the Commission's satisfaction would risk losing their \nlicense to broadcast.\n  While ostensibly the renewal processing guidelines are meant to \nincrease the total amount of local programming, the adjective ``local'' \nis ill-defined in this proceeding. It could be expanded to include an \nalmost limitless array of speech and could shift with the political \nwinds.\n  My amendment, DeMint No. 573, would not eliminate the FCC's power to \ndevelop license renewal processing guidelines completely, but only its \nauthority to develop processing guidelines that mimic its past \nauthority under the fairness doctrine, hence the language which limits \nit to quotas or guidelines for issues of public importance.\n  The second way in which the Commission has proposed to indirectly \nregulate broadcaster speech is by return of ascertainment requirements, \nwhich would mandate that every broadcaster develop and meet with an \n``advisory board'' made up of community groups and local officials that \nwould ``inform the stations' programming decisions.'' This proposal \nwould make broadcasters very vulnerable to pressure or even harassment \nby groups that do not approve of their programming.\n  A similar ascertainment requirement was eliminated in the early 1980s \nafter the Commission determined that the rule did more to create \nbureaucratic burdens than it did to improve broadcasting.\n  Like the processing guidelines, the ascertainment requirement could \nbecome a factor for broadcasters at license renewal. Groups that feel a \nlocal broadcaster did not listen to their suggestions through the \nadvisory board--suggestions to, for example, air more programming that \naddresses whatever social or political issue is of concern to these \ngroups--could challenge the broadcasters' license and argue that the \nbroadcaster ignored the ``needs and interests'' of their local \ncommunity. Talk radio would be particularly vulnerable to this type of \nharassment, as would religious broadcasters.\n  Again, my amendment, DeMint No. 573, would not eliminate the \nCommission's authority to mandate ascertainment completely, but only \nits authority to mandate that broadcasters seek out opposing viewpoints \non ``issues of public importance.''\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield back the time on our side.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that \nhas been agreed to on both sides. It is as follows: I ask unanimous \nconsent that amendments Nos. 579 and 587 be withdrawn and that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of the Ensign amendment No. 575, the \nsecond-degree amendment No. 576 be withdrawn; that there then be 30 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Ensign amendment, \nwith no amendment in order to the amendment prior to a vote, with the \ntime equally divided and controlled between Senators Ensign and \nFeinstein or their designees; and further, that Senator Feinstein's 15 \nminutes begin at 3:30 p.m.; that at 3:45 p.m., the Senate proceed to \nvote in relation to amendment No. 575; that upon disposition of \namendment No. 575, no further amendments be in order; that the \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, \nbe read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the \nbill; that passage of the bill be subject to a 60-vote threshold; that \nif the bill achieves that threshold, then the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; provided further that the cloture motion be \nwithdrawn, with this addendum: that 2 minutes of Senator Ensign's time \nbe reserved to occur at 3:45 p.m., with the vote occurring with respect \nto Ensign amendment No. 575 following Senator Ensign's 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 579 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I had filed an amendment and have pending \nat the desk amendment No. 579, which is a concealed carry amendment. I \ntalked about it yesterday on the floor of the Senate. I would like to \nhave had a vote on it and certainly believe it is something the Senate \nought to consider. It is worth voting on.\n  My State of South Dakota is one of many States around the country \nthat has concealed carry laws. What my amendment simply would have done \nis allowed those who have concealed carry permits in a particular State \nto have reciprocity with other States that have concealed carry laws, \nrespectful of the laws of those other States, but it would have allowed \npeople of this country under the second amendment to exercise the \nindividual right to carry firearms insofar as they are adhering and \nfollowing the laws of the State not only in which they reside but the \nState in which they would be carrying that firearm. That is something \nfor which I think there is a lot of support.\n  I introduced a bill in the Senate. It has 19 cosponsors. As I said, I \noffered the amendment to this particular piece of legislation. My \nunderstanding is the other side does not want to vote on it. What I \nhave tried to ascertain is whether the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, would be willing to \nhold a hearing. He informs me he will do that. I will have a hearing on \nthe bill itself.\n  With that understanding, Mr. President, my intention is to withdraw \namendment No. 579 and hope that we will have an opportunity to consider \nit at some point at a future date.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from South Dakota. I \njust want to say as a manager of the bill, I was present at the \nconversation with Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and Senator Thune. The conversation was exactly as reported.\n  Senator Leahy could not be here because he had other pressing \nbusiness,\n\n[[Page S2526]]\n\nbut he asked me to represent to our colleagues that the Judiciary \nCommittee will hold a hearing on the amendment offered by Senator Thune \nand now withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the last amendment is going to be debated \nsoon. Senator Ensign is here to begin that debate.\n  Both Senator McConnell and I would like to make some brief remarks.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kyl and Mr. McConnell are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 575\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to take a little bit of time to \nrefute some of the inaccuracies about my amendment dealing with the \nrepeal of the gun ban in the District of Columbia. This really is about \nrestoring second amendment rights to residents who live here in the \nDistrict of Columbia. We have a constitutional right and duty to deal \nwith matters dealing with the District of Columbia.\n\n  Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the laws that had been passed \nby the city council in the District of Columbia were in fact \nunconstitutional because the District of Columbia did not recognize \nthere was a constitutional right to the individual--not just a militia \nbut to the individual--to keep and bear arms. Since then, the District \nof Columbia has attempted to subvert what the Supreme Court said by \nputting very burdensome types of laws to make it more and more \ndifficult for District residents to own a gun in order to protect \nthemselves in their own homes.\n  It is interesting. If you go back to what the Founders talked about, \nas far as the second amendment, look at James Madison. He wrote in \nFederalist No. 46:\n\n       . . . the advantage of being armed, which the Americans \n     possess over the people of almost every other nation . . . \n     forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more \n     insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form \n     can admit of.\n\n  Washington, DC, has blatantly violated this right for more than 30 \nyears, and it has led to catastrophic results. This chart reflects the \nmurder rates in Washington, DC, relative to 48 other of the largest \ncities, excluding Chicago, from the top 50 list. And this is all \nweighted by population. You can see here, and especially as we go \nforward, when other crime rates in the country were actually going down \nand murder rates in the country were going down, as Washington, DC, was \nenacting more and more gun ban laws and stricter gun ban laws, the \nmurder rate in Washington, DC, continued to rise.\n  It has been characterized that this bill would allow a 10-year-old to \ncarry shotguns in the streets of Washington, DC. That is completely \nridiculous. That is a scare tactic. Our amendment basically ensures the \nindividual's second amendment right. It removes the tremendous barriers \nand burdens on law-abiding citizens to be able to have the protection \nthey want, to protect themselves in their own homes.\n  Right now, we know that if a criminal in Washington, DC, wants to get \na gun, they will get a gun. We are making it difficult for the people \nwho actually abide by the law to get a gun. We want law-abiding \ncitizens to have the arms, not just the criminals. That is what this \namendment is really all about.\n  You are probably going to hear some people say that Washington, DC, \nis just trying, within the Supreme Court decision, to enact laws that \nwill put reasonable restrictions on guns. I would say that is not the \ncase, and the reason it is not the case is they are actually trying to \nmake technical changes in the law which they think will restrict \npeople's rights to keep and bear arms. It is going against the intent \nof what the Supreme Court has enacted.\n  People across the United States have recognized for a long time how \nimportant it is for individuals to be able to keep and bear arms.\n  Around the world, we often hear asked: Well, why does Great Britain \nhave a lower murder rate than the United States? Well, first of all, \nthere are a lot of cultural differences between the United States and \nGreat Britain. But also, since Great Britain enacted some of its \nstrictest gun control laws, murder rates have actually gone up in \nLondon.\n  In case after case where you look to find out whether gun control \nlaws actually are effective in reducing crime, the statistics are \npretty overwhelming against it. Criminals will get the guns. They get \nthem on the black market or they go someplace, but they get their guns. \nThe question is, Are law-abiding citizens going to be able to protect \nthemselves in their own homes?\n  That is what this amendment is attempting to do, to say to citizens \nwho live in the District of Columbia: We are going to protect your \nsecond amendment rights. The laws the District of Columbia has enacted \nto own a gun are stricter than what we require in Nevada to get a \nconcealed weapons permit.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is high time this body give the citizens \nwho live in the District of Columbia that second amendment right to \nkeep and bear arms in order to protect themselves in their own homes, \nso I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I will save a couple of minutes right before the vote \nto be able to conclude my remarks, but how much time remains on my \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise now for the second time in strong \nopposition to Senator Ensign's amendment. This is a dangerous amendment \nthat goes far beyond anything the Supreme Court contemplated in the \nHeller decision. If you have been committed to a mental institution, if \nyou can't pass a vision test, this forces the District of Columbia to \nstill allow you to have a gun. That doesn't make any sense.\n  Americans basically believe in the Heller decision, which says there \nis a right to bear arms in the Constitution. But Americans have the \ngood sense to know that no amendment is absolute. We put limitations on \nthe first amendment--libel laws, pornography; you can't falsely scream \n``fire'' in a crowded theater. We put limits on every other amendment. \nWhy is it that some in the gun lobby say there should be no limitation \non the second amendment? They support limitations on the first \namendment. I am sure most of them feel antipornography laws are \njustified.\n  Just as those on the left, I believe, are wrong to say the first \namendment should be broad, the fourth amendment should be broad, the \nfifth amendment should be broad, but the second amendment should be \nseen through the pinhole of only militias, those on the other side are \nequally wrong when they do the converse and say the first amendment \nshould be narrow, the fourth amendment should be narrow, the fifth \namendment should be narrow, but the second amendment should have almost \nno limitation.\n  Isn't it reasonable to say that someone who has been in a mental \ninstitution shouldn't automatically get a gun? Isn't it reasonable to \nsay that if someone fails a vision test, they should not automatically \nget a gun? Of course it is. But because we get into sort of a macho \ngame here of, hey, we are going to show there should be no limitations \non the second amendment, we end up hearing about fundamentally absurd \npropositions that those who fail vision tests should be allowed a gun. \nIt defies common sense to say that someone who is voluntarily committed \nto a mental institution should be allowed to get a gun. In fact, \nlimitations on access to guns by the mentally ill was one of the few \nthings Justice Scalia, a strong second amendment supporter, \nspecifically said would be okay after Heller.\n  Let me just say to my colleagues, we are only a few years after \nVirginia Tech and the pain and tragedy for the parents who anguish \nevery day for their lost sons and daughters. They came to us and \nlobbied us and said: Please just pass minimal laws to prevent those who \nare mentally ill from getting a gun. Now we are saying that in the \nDistrict of Columbia that will be OK.\n\n[[Page S2527]]\n\n  As for the vision, there cannot be a more reasonable restriction than \nthe requirement that someone see before they are allowed on the streets \nwith a gun. We wouldn't want that in our communities where we live. Why \nwould we impose it on the District of Columbia? The District of \nColumbia has the highest per capita homicide rate in the United States. \nI understand, if you are from, say, Wyoming--there are broad, open \nspaces, very low crime rate--that the rules on guns should be different \nthan the rules in Washington, DC and New York City. I understand that. \nI accept it, as someone who has been an advocate of gun control.\n  But why are we imposing those laws that may work in Wyoming on the \npeople of the District of Columbia? Firearms cause more needless damage \nin Washington, DC than anywhere else. The Heller decision made it clear \nthat Washington, DC could impose reasonable restrictions on the right \nto bear arms and that was perfectly consonant with the Constitution. \nEvery Justice of the Supreme Court, including those who are the most \nconservative, such as Justice Scalia, such as Justice Thomas, believe \nthere can be some limitation imposed. Because the NRA does not, too \nmany in this country, and in this Chamber, jump when they say so.\n  It is wrong. It makes people's lives less safe. It is unfortunate. I \nhope this body will have the courage to reject the Ensign amendment \nwhile still affirming the right to bear arms as certified in the Heller \ncase.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to support final passage of S. 160, \nthe District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act.\n  I have spoken and written many times about my conclusion that the \nConstitution allows Congress to provide a House seat for the people of \nthe District of Columbia.\n  And I have said for more than 30 years that Americans living in the \nDistrict should have all the rights of citizenship, including voting \nrights.\n  The bill would also give an additional seat temporarily to the State \nnext qualifying for one under the 2000 census.\n  I believe the bill before us is a constitutional and balanced way to \nachieve these important goals.\n  Article I, section 2, states that the House shall be composed of \nMembers elected by the ``People of the several States.''\n  The District did not yet exist when those words were drafted.\n  The observation that this provision does not itself provide a House \nseat for the people of the District begs rather than answers the \nconstitutional question.\n  That question is whether the House Composition Clause prohibits \nCongress from providing for the people of the District what the \nConstitution provides for the people of the States.\n  The Constitution uses the word ``States'' in various provisions.\n  Opponents of this bill have argued that some of those cannot include \nthe District.\n  Once again, that observation begs rather than answers the \nconstitutional question.\n  For more than two centuries, the Supreme Court has held that other \nprovisions framed in terms of ``States'' can indeed apply to the \nDistrict.\n  Or, even more relevant to the bill before us today, the Supreme Court \nhas ruled that Congress can legislatively do for the District what the \nConstitution does for States.\n  I believe the House Composition Clause falls in this category.\n  The Supreme Court has held, for example, that Congress could apply to \nthe District the direct taxes that the original Constitution \napportioned among the several States.\n  Opponents of the bill before us have not even attempted to explain \nwhy the phrase ``the several States'' can apply to the District, which \nis obviously not a State, but the phrase ``the People of the several \nStates'' cannot apply to the District, which obviously has population.\n  The Supreme Court has held that Congress can extend to the District \nFederal court jurisdiction over lawsuits by citizens of different \nStates.\n  The great Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in 1805 that while the \nConstitution does itself extend such diversity jurisdiction to the \nDistrict, ``this is a subject for legislative . . . consideration.''\n  He added that the contrary conclusion, which I take to be the \nposition of those opposing the bill before us today, would be simply \nextraordinary.\n  Those opponents have not even attempted to explain why extending \ndiversity jurisdiction to the District is a subject for legislative \nconsideration but extending House representation to the people of the \nDistrict is not.\n  The Supreme Court has held that Congress can extend to the District \nthe restrictions the fourteenth amendment imposes upon the States.\n  Once again, the Court suggested that Congress's plenary authority \nover the District would be a sufficient basis for such legislation.\n  Opponents of S. 160 have cited the decision in Adams v. Clinton for \nthe proposition that the Constitution does not provide a right to \ncongressional representation for the District.\n  I agree.\n  That decision did not say, however, that Congress was precluded from \ndoing so.\n  In fact, the court said the opposite.\n  The court in Adams said that while it lacked authority to grant such \nrepresentation in the name of the Constitution, the plaintiffs could \n``plead their case in other venues,'' including ``the political \nprocess.''\n  That is precisely what the bill before us represents and opponents of \nS. 160 have not even attempted to explain otherwise.\n  Let me repeat, the constitutional question is not whether the \nConstitution itself grants House representation to the people of the \nDistrict. It does not.\n  The constitutional question is whether Congress may, under its \nexplicit and plenary authority over the District, legislatively provide \nfor the people of the District what the Constitution provides for the \npeople of the States.\n  Those who say that the word ``States'' necessarily excludes the \nDistrict must at least try to show that the many judicial precedents \nsaying otherwise either were wrongly decided or are somehow irrelevant \nto this bill. They have not even attempted to do either.\n  I believe that the foundational principle of representation and \nsuffrage, the legislative actions by America's Founders, two centuries \nof judicial precedent, and Congress's explicit legislative authority \nover the District in all cases whatsoever combine to allow Congress to \nenact the bill before us today.\n  One of my predecessors as a Senator from Utah, George Sutherland, was \nlater appointed to the Supreme Court.\n  He wrote for the Court in 1933 what I believe is relevant to this \ndebate today:\n\n       The District [of Columbia] was made up of portions of two \n     states of the original states of the Union, and was not taken \n     out of the Union by the cession. Prior thereto its \n     inhabitants were entitled to all the rights, guarantees, and \n     immunities of the Constitution. . . . We think it is not \n     reasonable to assume that the cession stripped them of those \n     rights.\n\n  More than 30 years ago, I made the same argument on this floor and \nlater argued that one way to achieve this goal was by giving the people \nof the District representation in the House.\n  The defeat of the retrocession amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona showed that the underlying bill is the only legislative vehicle \nfor providing this representation.\n  I voted for that amendment as a vote on the idea of retrocession, \nwhich I find has some general merit.\n  Even with my vote, however, the Senate resoundingly defeated it.\n  So I urge the Senate to pass this bill.\n  It constitutionally gives one House seat to the people of the \nDistrict.\n  It fairly gives another seat to the State qualifying for one under \nthe last census.\n  It explicitly and implicitly disclaims Senate representation for the \nDistrict.\n  It provides for expedited judicial review.\n  In short, I believe this is a sound and fair way to strengthen our \nsystem of self-government so that Americans can exercise the most \nprecious right available in a free country, the right to participate in \nelecting those who govern us.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this bill, and \ncongratulate the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Utah for \ntheir tireless efforts. Senator Lieberman and Senator Hatch have\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\nput forward innovative, bipartisan legislation that will strengthen our \ndemocracy. I also want to recognize the contribution of the majority \nleader, who, by championing this issue, renews and fulfills our \ncountry's commitment to equality, democracy, and justice.\n  When I watch my colleagues on the floor today, I see the spirit of \nPaul Douglas, Hubert Humphrey, and Everett Dirksen. This legislation is \npart of the struggle to fulfill the promise of America that led to the \nlandmark civil rights bills of 1957, 1964, and 1965. Today, we follow \nin the footsteps of some of our greatest predecessors. We are here to \nright a historic wrong, to enfranchise hundreds of thousands of our \nfellow Americans by giving them a vote in Congress.\n  The struggle to give Washington, DC, a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives has already been historic. I was disappointed that the \nSenate was the graveyard for this bill in 2007. By using a filibuster \nto prevent the bill from even reaching the floor at that time, \nopponents of this bill recalled history, too--an unfortunate history we \nshould not revisit. I am sure that I do not need to remind anyone here \nthat for decades the Senate was an implacable bulwark that no civil \nrights bill could breach. Unfortunately, when this great institution \nwas faced a year and a half ago with a new kind of voting rights bill, \nit did not rise to the challenge.\n  Now we have a chance to correct this breach of American principles \nand pass the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009. And \nso now is the time to remedy the injustice being done to Americans \nresiding in the District of Columbia, and stop this violation of their \nfundamental rights. Now is the time to take action on this legislation \nand to finally give the disenfranchised District at least a partial say \nin the decisions of the Congress, to make the ``People's House'' a body \nthat truly represents all of the people of this Nation.\n  In 1964, the Supreme Court stated that ``[n]o right is more precious \nin a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those \nwho make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live.'' It is \ntime for Congress to live up to those words. At a time when Americans \nwhose families wait for them at home in the District are fighting for \nour country overseas, it is a cruel and bitter irony that their own \ncountry denies them the right to representation in the House.\n  With all of the difficult issues and momentous decisions facing this \nCongress, the people of DC deserve a voice in it, now more than ever. \nAs of February 14, 29 DC residents have been killed or wounded in Iraq \nor Afghanistan, wars that their elected representative had no say in \ncommencing or funding. Approximately 1,500 homes are in foreclosure or \npre-foreclosure, unemployment has gone up over 3 percent in the last \nyear, to 8.8 percent. Just like all other Americans, the residents of \nthe District want to participate in the crucial and difficult debates \nthis Congress is having over foreign and economic policy. They want to \nset a new course for this country. Their voices should count just as \nmuch as their fellow citizens'.\n  Opponents of this bill have asserted that it is unconstitutional. I \nchaired a Judiciary Committee hearing in May 2007 to examine whether \nthe Constitution, perhaps the greatest testament to democracy and \nfreedom in human history, prevents the elected legislature of the \npeople of this country from granting the most basic right of \ncitizenship to the people of the District of Columbia. The hearing \nconfirmed that while this is not an easy question of constitutional \ninterpretation, there are strong arguments for the bill's \nconstitutionality. Our conclusions were strengthened by the finding of \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that \nCongress's authority to legislatively extend House representation is \nsupported by two centuries of judicial precedent.\n  In light of the historic wrong that this bill will correct, the case \nfor its constitutionality is certainly strong enough to justify \nenacting it and letting the Supreme Court make the final decision. The \nConstitution grants Congress the power of ``exclusive legislation, in \nall cases whatsoever,'' over the District; I believe that we can use \nthat authority to ensure that this Government's just powers are derived \nfrom the consent of the governed. Moreover, the basic sweep of the \nConstitution, its very essence, is to protect the fundamental rights of \nthe citizens of this country, including the right to be represented in \nCongress.\n  The other fundamental document of our founding, the Declaration of \nIndependence, laid out a list of grievances against the King of Great \nBritain, including the following:\n\n       He has refused to pass other Laws for the Accommodation of \n     large Districts of People, unless those People would \n     relinquish the Right of Representation in the Legislature, a \n     Right inestimable to them, and formidable to Tyrants only.\n\n  That inestimable right has been denied to the residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia for far too long.\n  We in Congress have a duty to fulfill the promise of democracy for DC \nresidents. Those who rely on constitutional arguments to oppose this \nbill should ask themselves what the Framers would think today, if they \nwere faced with the question of whether their handiwork should be used \nto prevent Congress from granting over a half million people the most \nbasic right in a democracy--the right of representation in the \nlegislature. It is simply inconceivable to me that those great and \nbrave patriots would be comfortable with such a blatant injustice.\n  I hope that we finally have the votes to right this historic wrong. I \nurge my colleagues to support the District of Columbia House Voting \nRights Act of 2009, and grant the most basic of democratic rights to \nthe people of the District.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a Washington Times \narticle by George Smith on February 13, 2009; testimony by John P. \nElwood, Deputy Assistant Attorney General before the Subcommittee on \nthe Constitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights, Senate Committee \non the Judiciary on May 23, 2007; and a Statement of Administration \nPolicy from September 18, 2007, be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 13, 2009]\n\n                       Not on Constitution Avenue\n\n                          (By George C. Smith)\n\n       As the Obama administration commences its reign of one-\n     party government, attention has understandably focused on the \n     president's economic stimulus program and his new approach to \n     the foreign terrorist threat.\n       But preoccupation with these topics should not divert \n     attention from what may be the most ominous, and radical, \n     collaboration between the new president and the Democratic-\n     controlled Congress: the enactment of blatantly \n     unconstitutional legislation to bypass the constitutional \n     amendment process and give the District of Columbia a seat in \n     the House of Representatives in a crass triumph of raw \n     political power over the rule of law.\n       With relentless clarity, in provision after provision, the \n     Constitution specifies that representation in both Houses of \n     Congress is limited to the states--and the District of \n     Columbia is not a state. The very first sentence of the \n     Constitution says, ``All legislative powers herein granted \n     shall be vested in a Congress of the United States''--not a \n     Congress of the United Entities, Districts, Territories or \n     Enclaves. The second sentence then specifies that the House \n     of Representatives is to be composed of members ``chosen by \n     the people of the several States.'' All told, no fewer than \n     11 constitutional provisions make it clear that congressional \n     representation is linked inextricably to statehood.\n       If there were any plausible doubt that congressional \n     representation was intentionally limited to the states when \n     the Constitution was drafted in 1787, it would have been \n     conclusively removed when the 39th Congress reiterated that \n     ``Representatives shall be apportioned among the several \n     States'' when it revisited the question of congressional \n     apportionment in drafting the 14th Amendment in 1866. (In \n     1866 as well as in 1787, there was no ambiguity and no \n     mistake in the express linkage of congressional \n     representation to statehood.)\n       This does not mean, however, that the District of Columbia \n     cannot obtain congressional representation. It only means it \n     must do so by means of a constitutional amendment, as plainly \n     provided in Article V of the Constitution.\n       For more than 200 years, this understanding of the \n     Constitution (intelligible to any literate 12-year-old who \n     reads its text) was accepted even by ardent advocates of D.C. \n     representation. On repeated occasions in the 1960s and 197os, \n     for example, the Democratic-controlled House Judiciary \n     Committee ruefully acknowledged that a constitutional \n     amendment was ``essential'' if D.C. were to receive such \n     representation. They expressly recognized that the \n     Constitution did not allow Congress to grant D.C. \n     representation by simple legislation, and\n\n[[Page S2529]]\n\n     proceeded to propose the constitutional amendment that was \n     necessary. The amendment failed to achieve ratification, but \n     the rule of law was honored.\n       The constitutional text limiting congressional \n     representation to the states has not changed during the past \n     several years. Nor have judicial interpretations of that \n     text, which have consistently acknowledged that limitation. \n     What has changed, however, is the willingness of D.C. \n     representation advocates to run roughshod over the \n     Constitution because they now have the raw political power to \n     pass a statute awarding the District a seat in the House by \n     main force.\n       As a fig leaf to cover up their brute power play, they \n     invoke the risible theory that a constitutional provision \n     authorizing Congress to exercise legislative jurisdiction \n     over federal enclaves--including the District, but also \n     including military reservations, park lands and similar \n     enclaves--enables Congress to override express constitutional \n     requirements, including the limitation of congressional \n     representation to states, as long as they are doing so on \n     behalf of the District. Oddly, this interpretation of the \n     Enclave Clause somehow escaped the grasp of the Framers, the \n     courts, and Congress for more than two centuries.\n       Apart from the fact that the Supreme Court has flatly held \n     that Congress' power under the Enclave Clause is indeed \n     limited by other constitutional requirements, the absurdity \n     of the theory is demonstrated by considering its logical \n     consequences. It would enable Congress to undercut the entire \n     structure of state-based congressional representation--in the \n     Senate as well as in the House--by extending representation \n     to an unlimited variety of enclaves and territories by simply \n     passing statutes reflecting evanescent political majorities. \n     A more radical subversion of constitutional government would \n     be difficult to imagine.\n       During the 110th Congress, it was only President Bush's \n     veto threat, and a razor-thin sufficiency of Republican \n     Senate votes to sustain a filibuster, that prevented \n     enactment of the D.C. House seat legislation--what liberal \n     legal scholar Jonathan Turley referred to as the most \n     ``premeditated'' unconstitutional act in decades. But with \n     Barack Obama's election and solid Democrat majorities in both \n     Houses, there is no longer a finger in the dike. D.C. \n     Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton has asserted that Mr. Obama \n     has committed to signing such legislation.\n       Significantly, the Justice Department carefully and \n     forcefully opined and testified during the last Congress that \n     the D.C. House legislation is patently unconstitutional. \n     Given the current president's apparent commitment to sign the \n     bill, however, it is difficult to envisage the new political \n     appointees of the Obama Justice Department raising any \n     constitutional objections to this grotesque power play. \n     Interestingly, however, former Clinton-era Solicitor General \n     Walter Dellinger recently observed that the persons named by \n     the president-elect to advise him on such constitutional \n     issues at the Justice Department ``bring a stature to the job \n     that will allow them to say no to the president when no is \n     the correct answer.'' ``No'' obviously remains the correct \n     answer to the question of whether the president should sign \n     D.C. House seat legislation that repudiates the \n     Constitution's text, more than 200 years of unwavering \n     historical practice and repeated pronouncements of the \n     federal judiciary. But only the delusional would expect that \n     the new president's men and women at Justice would stand with \n     the Constitution against the menacing force of raw political \n     power.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          CONSTITUTIONALITY OF D.C. VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007\n\n       S. 1257, a bill to grant the District of Columbia \n     representation in the House of Representatives as well as to \n     provide an additional House seat for Utah, violates the \n     Constitution's provisions governing the composition and \n     election of the United States Congress.\n\n Testimony Before the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, \n         and Property Rights, Senate Committee on the Judiciary\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Department's \n     views on S. 1257, a bill to grant the District of Columbia \n     representation in the House of Representatives as well as to \n     provide an additional House seat for Utah. For the same \n     reasons stated in the Statement of Administration Policy on \n     the House version of this legislation, the Administration \n     concludes that S. 1257 violates the Constitution's provisions \n     governing the composition and election of the United States \n     Congress. Accordingly, if S. 1257 were presented to the \n     President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \n     the bill. I will confine my testimony to the constitutional \n     issues posed by the legislation.\n       The Department's constitutional position on the legislation \n     is straightforward and is dictated by the unambiguous text of \n     the Constitution as understood and applied for over 200 \n     years. Article I, section 2 of the Constitution provides:\n       ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members \n     chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, \n     and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications \n     requisite for Electors of the most numerous branch of the \n     State Legislature.''\n       This language, together with the language of eleven other \n     explicit constitutional provisions, including the Twenty-\n     Third Amendment ratified in 1961,\\1\\ ``makes clear just how \n     deeply Congressional representation is tied to the structure \n     of statehood.'' \\2\\ The District of Columbia is not a State. \n     In the absence of a constitutional amendment, therefore, the \n     explicit provisions of the Constitution do not permit \n     Congress to grant congressional representation to the \n     District through legislation.\n       Shortly after the Constitution was ratified, the District \n     of Columbia was established as the Seat of Government of the \n     United States in accordance with Article I, Sec. 8, cl. 17 of \n     the Constitution. The Framers deliberately placed the capital \n     in a federal enclave that was not itself a State to ensure \n     that the federal Government had the ability to protect itself \n     from potentially hostile state forces. The Framers also gave \n     Congress ``exclusive'' authority to enact legislation for the \n     internal governance of the enclave to be chosen as the Seat \n     of Government--the same authority Congress wields over the \n     many other federal enclaves ceded by the States.\n       Beginning even before the District of Columbia was \n     established as the Seat of Government, and continuing to \n     today, there have been determined efforts to obtain \n     congressional representation for the District. Apart from the \n     various unsuccessful attempts to secure such representation \n     through litigation, such efforts have consistently recognized \n     that, because the District is not a State, a constitutional \n     amendment is necessary for it to obtain congressional \n     representation. S. 1257 represents a departure from that \n     settled constitutional and historical understanding, which \n     has long been recognized and accepted by even ardent \n     proponents of District representation.\n       One of the earliest attempts to secure congressional \n     representation for the Seat of Government was made by no less \n     a constitutional authority than Alexander Hamilton at the \n     pivotal New York ratifying convention. Recognizing that the \n     proposed Constitution did not provide congressional \n     representation for those who would reside in the Seat of \n     Government, Hamilton offered an amendment to the Enclave \n     Clause that would have provided:\n       ``That When the Number of Persons in the District of \n     Territory to be laid out for the Seat of the Government of \n     the United States, shall according to the Rule for the \n     Apportionment of Representatives and Direct Taxes Amount to \n     [left blank] such District shall cease to be parcel of the \n     State granting the Same, and Provision shall be made by \n     Congress for their having a District Representation in that \n     Body.'' \\3\\\n       Hamilton's proposed amendment was rejected. Other \n     historical materials further confirm the contemporary \n     understanding that the Constitution did not contemplate \n     congressional representation for the District and that a \n     constitutional amendment would be necessary to make such \n     provision.\\4\\ These historical facts refute the contention by \n     proponents of S. 1257 that the Framers simply did not \n     consider the lack of congressional representation and, if \n     they had considered it, that they would have provided such \n     representation. In fact, Framers and ratifiers did consider \n     the question and rejected a proposal for such representation.\n       In more recent years, major efforts to provide \n     congressional representation for the District were pursued in \n     Congress in the 1960s and 1970s, but on each occasion \n     Congress expressly recognized that obtaining such \n     representation would require either Statehood or a \n     constitutional amendment. For example, when the House \n     Judiciary Committee favorably recommended a constitutional \n     amendment for District representation in 1967, it stated as \n     follows:\n       ``If the citizens of the District are to have voting \n     representation in the Congress, a constitutional amendment is \n     essential; statutory action alone will not suffice. This is \n     the case because provisions for elections of Senators and \n     Representatives in the Constitution are stated in terms of \n     the States, and the District of Columbia is not a State.'' \n     \\5\\\n       Congress again considered the District representation issue \n     in 1975, and the House Judiciary Committee again expressly \n     acknowledged that, ``[i]f the citizens of the District are to \n     have voting representation in Congress, a constitutional \n     amendment is essential; statutory action will not suffice.'' \n     \\6\\\n       Of course, the courts have not directly reviewed the \n     constitutionality of a statute purporting to grant the \n     District representation because, for the reasons so \n     forcefully reiterated by the House Judiciary Committee, \n     Congress has not previously considered such legislation \n     constitutionally permissible. But numerous federal courts \n     have emphatically concluded that the existing Constitution \n     does not permit the provision of congressional representation \n     for the District. In Adams v. Clinton, a three-judge court \n     stated, in a decision affirmed by the Supreme Court, that \n     ``the Constitution does not contemplate that the District may \n     serve as a state for purposes of the apportionment of \n     congressional representation'' and stressed that Article I \n     ``makes clear just how deeply Congressional representation is \n     tied to the structure of statehood.'' 90 F. Supp. 2d 35, 46-\n     47 (D.D.C.), aff'd, 531 U.S. 941 (2000); see generally S. Ry. \n     Co. v. Seaboard Allied Milling Corp., 442 U.S. 444, 462 \n     (1979) (stating that summary affirmance is a precedential \n     ruling on the merits). In Banner v. United States, 428 F.3d \n     303 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (per curiam), a panel of the D.C. \n     Circuit that included Chief Justice John Roberts flatly \n     concluded: ``[t]he\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\n     Constitution denies District residents voting representation \n     in Congress. . . . Congress is the District's Government, see \n     U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 17, and the fact that \n     District residents do not have congressional representation \n     does not alter that constitutional reality.'' Id. at 309.\\7\\ \n     The court added: ``[i]t is beyond question that the \n     Constitution grants Congress exclusive authority to govern \n     the District, but does not provide for District \n     representation in Congress.'' Id. at 312. And in explaining \n     why the Constitution does not permit the District's delegate \n     in Congress to have the voting power of a Representative in \n     Michel v. Anderson, 817 F. Supp. 126 (D.D.C. 1993), the court \n     stressed that the legislative power ``is constitutionally \n     limited to `Members chosen . . . by the People of the several \n     States.' U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. [2], cl. 1.'' Id. at 140.\n       The numerous explicit provisions of the constitutional \n     text; the consistent construction of those provisions \n     throughout the course of American history by courts, \n     Congress, and the Executive; \\8\\ and the historical evidence \n     of the Framers' and ratifiers' intent in adopting the \n     Constitution conclusively demonstrate that the Constitution \n     does not permit the granting of congressional representation \n     to the District by simple legislation.\n       We are aware of, and not persuaded by, the recent and novel \n     claim that this legislation should be viewed as a \n     constitutional exercise of Congress's authority under the \n     Enclave Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 17, to \n     ``exercise exclusive legislation'' over the Seat of \n     Government and other federal enclaves. That theory is \n     insupportable. First, it is incompatible with the plain \n     language of the many provisions of the Constitution that, \n     unlike the Enclave Clause, are directly and specifically \n     concerned with the composition, election, and very nature of \n     the House of Representatives and the Congress. Those \n     provisions were the very linchpin of the Constitution, \n     because it was only by reconciling the conflicting wishes of \n     the large and small States as to representation in Congress \n     that the Great Compromise that enabled the Constitution's \n     ratification was made possible. Consequently, every word of \n     Article I's provisions concerning the composition and \n     election of the House and the Senate--and particularly the \n     words repeatedly linking congressional representation to \n     ``each State'' or ``the People of the several States''--was \n     carefully chosen. In contrast, the Enclave Clause has nothing \n     to do with the composition, qualifications, or election of \n     Members of Congress. Its provision for ``exclusive \n     legislation'' concerns legislation respecting the internal \n     operation of ``such District'' and other enclaves. The \n     Enclave Clause gives Congress extensive legislative authority \n     ``over such District,'' but that authority plainly does not \n     extend to legislation affecting the entire Nation. S. 1257 \n     would alter the very nature of the House of Representatives. \n     By no reasonable construction can the narrowly focused \n     provisions of the Enclave Clause be construed to give \n     Congress such sweeping authority.\n       Second, whatever power Congress has under the Enclave \n     Clause is limited by the other provisions of the \n     Constitution. As stated by the Supreme Court in Binns v. \n     United States, 194\n       U.S. 486 (1904), the Enclave Clause gives Congress plenary \n     power over the District ``save as controlled by the \n     provisions of the Constitution.'' Id. at 491. As the Supreme \n     Court has further explained, the Clause gives Congress \n     legislative authority over the District and other enclaves \n     ``in all cases where legislation is possible.'' \\9\\ The \n     composition, election, and qualifications of Members of the \n     House are expressly and specifically governed by other \n     provisions of the Constitution that tie congressional \n     representation to Statehood. The Enclave Clause gives \n     Congress no authority to deviate from those core \n     constitutional provisions.\n       Third, the notion that the Enclave Clause authorized \n     legislation establishing congressional representation for the \n     Seat of Government is contrary to the contemporary \n     understanding of the Framers and the consistent historical \n     practice of Congress. As I mentioned earlier, the amendment \n     unsuccessfully offered by Alexander Hamilton at the New York \n     ratifying convention to authorize such representation when \n     the Seat of Government's population reached a certain level \n     persuasively demonstrates that the Framers did not read the \n     Enclave Clause to authorize or contemplate such \n     representation. Other contemporaneous historical evidence \n     reinforces that understanding. See supra n. 4. Moreover, \n     Congress's consistent recognition in practice that \n     constitutional amendments were necessary not only to provide \n     congressional representation for the District, but also to \n     grant it electoral votes for President and Vice President \n     under the 23rd Amendment, belies the notion that the Enclave \n     Clause has all along authorized the achievement of such \n     measures through simple legislation. Given the enthusiastic \n     support for such measures by their congressional proponents, \n     it is simply implausible that Congress would not previously \n     have discovered and utilized that authority as a means of \n     avoiding the enormous difficulties of constitutional \n     amendment.\n       Fourth, the proponents' interpretation of the Enclave \n     Clause proves far too much; the consequences that would \n     necessarily flow from acceptance of that theory demonstrate \n     its implausibility. As the Supreme Court has recognized, \n     ``[t]he power of Congress over the federal enclaves that come \n     within the scope of Art. I, 8, cl. 17, is obviously the same \n     as the power of Congress over the District of Columbia.'' \n     \\10\\ It follows that if Congress has constitutional authority \n     to provide congressional representation for the District \n     under the Enclave Clause, it has the same authority for the \n     other numerous federal enclaves (such as various military \n     bases and assorted federal lands ceded by the States). But \n     that is not all. The Supreme Court has also recognized that \n     Congress's authority to legislate respecting the U.S. \n     territories under the Territories Clause, U.S. Const. art. \n     IV, 3, cl. 2, is equivalent to its ``exclusive legislation'' \n     authority under the Enclave Clause. See, e.g., Binns, 194 \n     U.S. at 488. If the general language of the Enclave Clause \n     provides authority to depart from the congressional \n     representational provisions of Article I, it is not apparent \n     why similar authority does not reside in the Territories \n     Clause, which would enable Congress to enact legislation \n     authorizing congressional representation for Puerto Rico, the \n     Virgin Islands, and other territories. These unavoidable \n     corollaries of the theory underlying S. 1257 demonstrate its \n     invalidity. Given the great care with which the Framers \n     provided for State-based congressional representation in the \n     Composition Clause and related provisions, it is implausible \n     to suggest that they would have simultaneously provided for \n     the subversion of those very provisions by giving Congress \n     carte blanche to create an indefinite number of additional \n     seats under the Enclave Clause.\n       Finally, we note that the bill's proponents conspicuously \n     fail to address another logical consequence that flows from \n     the Enclave Clause theory: If Congress may grant the District \n     representation in the House by virtue of its purportedly \n     expansive authority to legislate to further the District's \n     general welfare, it follows logically that it could use the \n     same authority to grant the District (and other enclaves and \n     territories) two Senators as well.\n       At bottom, the theory that underlies S. 1257 rests on the \n     premise that the Framers drafted a Constitution that left the \n     door open for the creation of an indefinite number of \n     congressional seats that would have fatally undermined the \n     carefully crafted representation provisions that were the \n     linchpin of the Constitution. Such a premise is contradicted \n     by the historical and constitutional record.\n       The clear and carefully phrased provisions for State-based \n     congressional representation constitute the very bedrock of \n     our Constitution. Those provisions have stood the test of \n     time in providing a strong and stable basis for the \n     preservation of constitutional democracy and the rule of law. \n     If enacted, S. 1257 would undermine the integrity of those \n     critical provisions and open the door to further deviations \n     from the successful framework that is our constitutional \n     heritage. If the District is to be accorded congressional \n     representation without Statehood, it must be accomplished \n     through a process that is consistent with our constitutional \n     scheme, such as amendment as provided by Article V of the \n     Constitution.\n                                                   John P.

The \n     bill violates the Constitution's provisions governing the \n     composition and election of the United States Congress. \n     Accordingly, if S. 1257 were presented to the President, his \n     senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n       The Constitution limits representation in the House to \n     Representatives of States. Article I, Section 2 provides: \n     ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members \n     chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, \n     and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications \n     requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the \n     State legislature.'' The Constitution also contains 11 other \n     provisions expressly linking congressional representation to \n     Statehood.\n       The District of Columbia is not a State. Accordingly, \n     congressional representation for the District of Columbia \n     would require a constitutional amendment. Advocates of \n     congressional representation for the District have long \n     acknowledged this. As the House Judiciary Committee stated in \n     recommending passage of such a constitutional amendment in \n     1975:\n       ``If the citizens of the District are to have voting \n     representation in the Congress, a constitutional amendment is \n     essential; statutory action alone will not suffice. This is \n     the case because provisions for elections of Senators and \n     Representatives in the Constitution are stated in terms of \n     the States, and the District of Columbia is not a State.''\n       Courts have reached the same conclusion. In 2000, for \n     example, a three-judge panel concluded ``that the \n     Constitution does not contemplate that the District may serve \n     as a state for purposes of the apportionment of congressional \n     representatives.'' Adams v. Clinton, 90 F. Supp. 2d 35, 46-47 \n     (D.D.C. 2000). The Supreme Court affirmed that decision. \n     Furthermore, Congress's own Research Service found that, \n     without a constitutional amendment, it is ``likely that the \n     Congress does not have authority to grant voting \n     representation in the House of Representatives to the \n     District of Columbia.''\n       Claims that S. 1257 should be viewed as an exercise of \n     Congress's ``exclusive'' legislative authority over the \n     District of Columbia as the seat of the Federal government \n     are not persuasive. Congress's exercise of legislative \n     authority over the District of Columbia is qualified by other \n     provisions of the Constitution, including the Article I \n     requirement that representation in the House of \n     Representatives is limited to the ``several States.'' \n     Congress cannot vary that constitutional requirement under \n     the guise of the ``exclusive legislation'' clause, a clause \n     that provides the same legislative authority over Federal \n     enclaves like military bases as it does over the District.\n       For all the foregoing reasons, enacting S. 1257's extension \n     of congressional representation to the District would be \n     unconstitutional. It would also call into question (by \n     subjecting to constitutional challenge in the courts) the \n     validity of all legislation passed by the reconstituted House \n     of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the testimony by \nProfessor Jonathan Turley before the House Judiciary Committee \nSeptember 14, 2006, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   District of Columbia Voting Rights\n\n\n      Statement of Jonathan Turley, Committee on House Judiciary, \n                      Subcommittee on Constitution\n\n       It is an honor to be asked to testify on the important \n     question of the representational status of the District of \n     Columbia in Congress. Due to the short period for the \n     preparation of written testimony and a family emergency, the \n     committee staff has permitted me to submit this summary of \n     the testimony that I will offer on September 14, 2006. A full \n     written statement is being completed and will be available at \n     the hearing.\n     General Comments\n       There should be general agreement that the current non-\n     voting status of the District is fundamentally at odds with \n     the principles and traditions of our constitutional system. \n     As Justice Black stated in Wesberry v. Sanders: ``No right is \n     more precious in a free country than that of having a voice \n     in the election of those who make the laws under which, as \n     good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even the most \n     basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.''\n       Yet, unlike many issues before Congress, there has always \n     been a disagreement about the means rather than the ends of \n     full representation for the District residents. Regrettably, \n     I believe that H.R. 5388 is the wrong means. Despite the best \n     of motivations, the bill is fundamentally flawed on a \n     constitutional level and would only serve to needlessly delay \n     true reform for District residents. Indeed, there would be an \n     inevitable and likely successful legal challenge to a bill. \n     Even if successful, this bill would ultimately achieve only \n     partial representational status. Frankly, giving the District \n     only a vote in the House is the equivalent of allowing Rosa \n     Parks to move halfway to the front of the bus in the name of \n     progress. District residents deserve full representation and, \n     while this bill would not offer such reform, there are \n     alternatives, including a three-phased proposal that I have \n     advocated in the past.\n     The Original Purpose and Diminishing Necessity of the Federal \n         Enclave\n       The creation of the federal enclave was the direct result \n     of the failure of state officials to protect Congress during \n     a period of unrest. On January 1, 1783, Congress was meeting \n     in Philadelphia when they were surprised by a mob of \n     Revolutionary War veterans demanding their long-overdue back \n     pay. It was a period of great discontentment with Congress \n     and the public of Pennsylvania was more likely to help the \n     mob than to help suppress it. Indeed, when Congress called on \n     state officials to call out the militia, they refused. \n     Congress was forced to flee, first to Princeton, N.J., then \n     to Annapolis and ultimately to New York City.\n       When the framers gathered again in Philadelphia in the \n     summer of 1787 to draft a new constitution, the flight from \n     that city five years before was still prominent in their \n     minds. Madison and others called for the creation of a \n     federal enclave or district as the seat of the federal \n     government--independent of any state and protected by federal \n     authority. Only then, Madison noted could they avoid ``public \n     authority [being] insulted and its proceedings . . . \n     interrupted, with impunity.''\n       In addition to the desire to be free of the transient \n     support of an individual state, the framers advanced a number \n     of other reasons for creating this special enclave. There was \n     a fear that a state (and its representatives in Congress) \n     would have too much influence over Congress, by creating ``a \n     dependence of the members of the general government.'' There \n     was also a fear that the symbolic honor given to one state \n     would create in ``the national councils an imputation of awe \n     and influence, equally dishonorable to the Government and \n     dissatisfactory to the other members of the confederacy.'' \n     There was also a view that the host state would benefit too \n     much from ``[t]he gradual accumulation of public improvements \n     at the stationary residence of the Government.\n       The District, therefore, was created for the specific \n     purpose of being a non-State without direct representatives \n     in Congress. The security and operations of the federal \n     enclave would remain the collective responsibilities of the \n     entire Congress--of all of the various states. While I \n     believe that this purpose is abundantly clear, I do not \n     believe that most of these concerns have continued relevance \n     for legislators. Since the Constitutional Convention, courts \n     have recognized that federal, not state, jurisdiction \n     governs federal lands. Moreover, the federal government \n     now has a large security force and is not dependent on the \n     states for security. Finally, the position of the federal \n     government vis-a-vis the states has flipped with the \n     federal government now the dominant party in this \n     relationship. The real motivating purposes of the creation \n     of the federal enclave, therefore, no longer exist. What \n     remains is the symbolic question of whether the seat of \n     the federal government should be on neutral ground. It is \n     a question that should not be dismissed as insignificant. \n     To the contrary, I personally believe that the seat of the \n     federal government should remain completely federal \n     territory as an important symbol of the equality of all \n     states in the governance of the nation. The actual seat of \n     government, however, is a tiny fraction of the existing \n     federal district.\n     The Unconstitutionality of H.R. 5388\n       I believe that the Dinh/Starr analysis is fundamentally \n     flawed and that H.R. 5388 would violate the clear language \n     and meaning of Article I. To evaluate the constitutionality \n     of the legislation, it is useful to follow a classic \n     constitutional interpretation that begins with the text, \n     explores the original meaning of the language, and then \n     considers the implications of the rivaling interpretations \n     for the constitutional system. I believe that this analysis \n     clearly shows that the creation of a vote in the House of \n     Representatives for the District would do great violence to \n     our constitutional traditions and process. To succeed, it \n     would require the abandonment of traditional interpretative \n     doctrines and would allow for future manipulation of one of \n     the most essential and stabilizing components of the \n     Madisonian democracy: the voting rules for the legislative \n     branch.\n     1. Textual Analysis\n       Any constitutional analysis necessarily begins with the \n     text of the relevant provision or provisions. In this case, \n     there are two central provisions. The most important textual \n     statement relevant to this debate is found in Article I, \n     Section 2 that states unambiguously that the House of \n     Representatives shall be composed of members chosen ``by the \n     people of the several states.'' As with the Seventeenth \n     Amendment election of the composition of the Senate, the text \n     clearly limits the House to the membership of representatives \n     of the several states. The second provision is the District \n     Clause found in Article I, Section 8 which gives Congress the \n     power to ``exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases \n     whatsoever, over such District.''\n       On its face, the reference to ``the people of the several \n     states'' is a clear restriction of the voting membership to \n     actual states. This is evidenced in a long line of cases that \n     exclude District residents from benefits or\n\n[[Page S2532]]\n\n     rights given to citizens of states under the Constitution.\n       It has been argued by both Dinh and Starr that the textual \n     clarity in referring to states is immaterial because other \n     provisions with such references have been interpreted as \n     nevertheless encompassing District residents. This argument \n     is illusory in my view. The major cases extending the meaning \n     of states to the District involve an irreconcilable conflict \n     between a literal interpretation of the term ``state'' and \n     the expressed inherent rights of all American citizens under \n     the equal protection clause and other provisions. District \n     citizens remain U.S. citizens, even though they are not state \n     citizens. The creation of the federal district removed one \n     right of citizens--voting in Congress--in exchange for the \n     status conferred by resident in the Capitol City. It was \n     never intended to turn residents into noncitizens with no \n     constitutional rights.\n       The upshot of these opinions is that a literal \n     interpretation of the word ``states'' would produce facially \n     illogical and unintended consequences. Since residents remain \n     U.S. citizens, they must continue to enjoy those protections \n     accorded to citizens. Otherwise, they could all be enslaved \n     or impaled at the whim of Congress.\n     2. Original and Historical Meaning\n       Despite some suggestions to the contrary, the absence of a \n     vote in Congress was clearly understood as a defining element \n     of a federal district. During ratification, various leaders \n     objected to the disenfranchisement of the citizens in the \n     district and even suggested amendments that would have \n     addressed the problem. One such amendment was offered by \n     Alexander Hamilton, who wanted the District residents to be \n     able to secure representation in Congress once they grew to a \n     reasonable size. Neither this nor other such amendments \n     offered in states like North Carolina and Pennsylvania were \n     adopted.\n       Whatever ambiguity existed over continuing authority of \n     Maryland or Virginia, the disenfranchisement of citizens from \n     votes in Congress was clearly understood. Indeed, not long \n     after the cessation, a retrocession movement began. Members \n     questioned the need to ``keep the people in this degraded \n     situation'' and objected to the subjection of American \n     citizens to ``laws not made with their own consent.'' At the \n     time of the ratification, leaders knew and openly discussed \n     the non-voting status of the District in the clearest and \n     strongest possible language.\n       This debate in 1804 leaves no question as to the \n     early understanding of the status of the District as a \n     non-state without representational status. Much of this \n     debate followed the same lines of argument that we hear \n     today. While acknowledging that ``citizens may not possess \n     full political rights,'' leaders like John Bacon of \n     Massachusetts noted that they had special status and \n     influence as residents of the Capitol City. Yet, \n     retrocession bills were introduced within a few years of \n     the actual cessation--again prominently citing the lack of \n     any congressional representation as a motivating factor. \n     Indeed, the retrocession of Virginia highlights the \n     original understanding of the status of the District. \n     Virginians contrasted their situation with those residents \n     of Washington. Washingtonians, however, were viewed as \n     compensated for their loss of political representation. As \n     a committee noted in 1835, ``[o]ur situation is \n     essentially different, and far worse, than that of our \n     neighbors on the northern side of the Potomac. They are \n     citizens of the Metropolis, of a great, and noble \n     Republic, and wherever they go, there clusters about them \n     all those glorious associations, connected with the \n     progress and fame of their country. They are in some \n     measure compensated in the loss of their political \n     rights.''\n       Much is made of the ten-year period during which District \n     residents voted with their original states--before the \n     federal government formally took over control of the \n     District. This, however, was simply a transition period \n     before the District became the federal enclave.\n     3. Policy Implications\n       There are considerable risks and problems with this \n     approach to securing a vote in Congress for the District. \n     First, by adopting a liberal interpretation of the meaning of \n     states in Article I, the Congress would be undermining the \n     very bedrock of our constitutional system. The membership and \n     division of Congress was carefully defined by the Framers. \n     The legislative branch is the engine of the Madisonian \n     democracy. It is in these two houses that disparate factional \n     disputes are converted into majoritarian compromises--the \n     defining principle of the Madisonian system. By allowing \n     majorities to manipulate the membership rolls would add a \n     dangerous instability and uncertainty to the system.\n       Second, if successful, this legislation would allow any \n     majority in Congress to manipulate the voting membership of \n     the House. This is not the only federal enclave and there is \n     great potential for abuse and mischief in the exercise of \n     such authority. Third, while the issue of Senate \n     representation is left largely untouched in the Dinh/Starr \n     analysis, there is no obvious principle that would prevent a \n     majority from expanding its ranks with two new Senate seats \n     for the District. Two Senators and a member of the House \n     would be a considerable level of representation for a non-\n     state with a small population. Yet, this analysis would \n     suggest that such a change could take place without a \n     constitutional amendment.\n       Finally, H.R. 5388 would only serve to delay true \n     representational status for district residents. On a \n     practical level, this bill would likely extinguish efforts at \n     full representation in both houses. During the pendency of \n     the litigation, it is highly unlikely that additional \n     measures would be considered--delaying reforms by many years. \n     Ultimately, if the legislation is struck down, it would leave \n     the campaign for full representation in shambles.\n     The Problematic Basis for Awarding an At-Large Seat to Utah\n       The proposal of awarding an at-large seat to Utah is an \n     admittedly novel question that would raise issues of first \n     impression for the courts. However, I am highly skeptical of \n     the legality of this approach, particularly under the ``one-\n     man, one-vote'' doctrine established in Wesberry v. Sanders, \n     376 U.S. 1 (1964). This is a question that leads to some \n     fairly metaphysical notions of overlapping representation and \n     citizens with 1.4 representational status. On one level, the \n     addition of an at-large seat would seem to benefit all Utah \n     citizens equally since they would vote for two members. Given \n     the deference to Congress under the ``necessary and proper'' \n     clause, an obvious argument could be made that it does not \n     contravene the ``one man, one vote'' standard.\n       However, there are various reasons why a federal court \n     would be on good ground to strike down this portion of H.R. \n     5388. First, while the Supreme Court has not clearly \n     addressed the interstate implications of ``one man, one \n     vote,'' this bill would likely force it to do so. Awarding \n     two representatives to each resident of Utah creates an \n     obvious imbalance vis-a-vis other states. House members are \n     expected to be advocates for this insular constituency. Here, \n     residents of one state could look to two representatives to \n     do their bidding while other citizens would limited to one. \n     Given racial and cultural demographic differences between \n     Utah and other states, this could be challenged as diluting \n     the power of minority groups in Congress.\n       Second, while interstate groups challenge the increased \n     representation for Utah citizens, the at-large seat could \n     also be challenged by some intrastate groups as diluting \n     their specific voting power. If Utah simply added an \n     additional congressional district, the ratio of citizens to \n     members would be reduced. The additional member would \n     represent a defined group of people who have unique \n     geographical and potentially racial or political \n     characteristics. However, by making the seat at large, \n     these citizens would now have to share two members with a \n     much larger and more diffuse group--particularly in the \n     constituency of the at-large member. It is likely that the \n     member who is elected at large would be different from one \n     who would have to run in a particular district such as a \n     more liberal or diverse section of the Salt Lake City \n     population.\n       Third, this approach would be used by a future majority of \n     Congress to manipulate voting in Congress and to reduce \n     representation for insular groups. Rather than creating a new \n     district that may lean toward one party or have increased \n     representation of one racial or religious group, Congress \n     could use at-large seats under the theory of this \n     legislation. Moreover, Congress could create new forms of \n     represented districts for overseas Americans or for federal \n     enclaves. The result would be to place Congress on a slippery \n     slope where transient majorities tweak representational \n     divisions for their own advantage.\n       Finally, while it would be difficult to predict how this \n     plan would fare under a legal challenge, it is certain to be \n     challenged. This creates the likelihood of Congress having at \n     least one member (or two members if you count the District \n     representative) who would continue to vote under a \n     considerable cloud of questioned legitimacy. In close votes, \n     this could produce great uncertainty as to the finality or \n     legitimacy of federal legislation. This is entirely \n     unnecessary. If a new representative is required, it is \n     better to establish a fourth district not just a fourth at-\n     large representative for legal and policy reasons.\n     A Modified Retrocession Proposal\n       One hundred and sixty years ago, Congress retroceded land \n     back to Virginia under its Article I authority. Retrocession \n     has always been the most direct way of securing a resumption \n     of voting rights for District residents. Most of the District \n     can be simply returned from whence it came: state of \n     Maryland. The greatest barrier to retrocession has always \n     been more symbolic rather than legal. Replacing Washington, \n     DC with Washington, MD is a conceptual leap that many are \n     simply not willing to make. However, it is the most logical \n     resolution of this problem.\n       For a number of years, I have advocated the reduction of \n     the District of Columbia to the small area that runs from the \n     Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. The only residents in this \n     space would be the First Family. The remainder of the current \n     District would then be retroceded to Maryland. However, I \n     have also proposed a three-phase process for retrocession. In \n     the first phase, a political transfer would occur immediately \n     with the District securing a house seat as a Maryland \n     district and residents voting in Maryland statewide \n     elections. In the second phase, incorporation of public \n     services from education to prisons to law enforcement would \n     occur. In the third phase, any tax and revenue incorporation \n     would occur.\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\n       These phases would occur over many years with only the \n     first phase occurring immediately upon retrocession. Indeed, \n     I recommend the creation of a three-commissioner body like \n     the one that worked with George Washington in the \n     establishment of the original federal district. These \n     commissioners would recommend and oversee the incorporation \n     process. Moreover, Maryland can agree to continue to treat \n     the District as a special tax or governing zone until \n     incorporation is completed. Indeed, Maryland may chose to \n     allow the District to continue in a special status due to \n     this unique position. The fact is that any incorporation is \n     made easier, not more difficult, by the District's historic \n     independence. Like most cities, it would continue to have its \n     own law enforcement and local governing authority. However, \n     it would also benefit from incorporation into Maryland \n     educational system and other statewide programs related to \n     prisons and other public needs.\n       In my view, this approach would be unassailable on a legal \n     level and highly efficient on a practical level. I realize \n     that there remains a fixation with the special status of the \n     city, but much of this status would remain. While the city \n     would not technically be the seat of government, it would \n     obviously remain for all practical purposes our Capitol City.\n       Regardless of what proposal is adopted, I strongly \n     encourage you not to move forward with H.R. 5388. It is an \n     approach that achieves less representation than is deserved \n     for the District by means that asserts more power than is \n     held by the Congress. It is certainly time to right this \n     historical wrong, but, in our constitutional system, it is \n     often more important how we do something than what we do. \n     This is the wrong means to a worthy end. However, it is not \n     the only means and I encourage the members to direct these \n     considerable energies toward a more lasting and complete \n     resolution of the status of the District of Columbia in \n     Congress.\n\n                                              Jonathan Turley,\n\n                                                Shapiro Professor,\n                          George Washington University Law School.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend to my fellow Senators the \nApril 3, 1987 U.S. Justice Department Office of Legal Policy Report to \nthe Attorney General entitled ``The Question of Statehood for the \nDistrict of Columbia.'' I ask unanimous consent that the Executive \nSummary and section titled ``Proposals for Giving Representation in \nCongress to the District of Columbia, Voting Member in the House of \nRepresentatives'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       Efforts to admit the District of Columbia to the Union as a \n     state should be vigorously opposed. Granting the national \n     capital statehood through statutory means raises numerous \n     troubling constitutional questions. After careful \n     consideration of these issues, we have concluded that an \n     amendment to the Constitution would be required before the \n     District of Columbia may be admitted to the Union as a state. \n     Statehood for the Nation's capital is inconsistent with the \n     language of the Constitution, as well as the intent of its \n     Framers, and would work a basic change in the federal system \n     as it has existed for the past two hundred years. Under our \n     Constitution, power was divided between the states and the \n     federal government in the hope, as Madison wrote, that \n     ``[t]he different governments will control each other,'' thus \n     securing self-government, individual liberty, and the rights \n     of minorities. In order to serve its function in the federal \n     structure a state must be independent of the federal \n     government. However, the District of Columbia is not \n     independent; it is a political and economic dependency of the \n     national government.\n       At the same time, it is essential that the federal \n     government maintain its independence of the states. If the \n     District of Columbia were now admitted to statehood, it would \n     not be one state among many. Because it is the national \n     capital, the District would be primus inter pares, first \n     among equals. The ``State of Columbia . . . could come \n     perilously close to being the state whose sole business is to \n     govern, to control all the other states. It would be the \n     imperial state; it would be `Rome on the Potomac.''' It was \n     this very dilemma that prompted the Founders to establish the \n     federal capital in a district located outside of the borders \n     of any one of the states, under the exclusive jurisdiction of \n     Congress. Their reasons for creating the District are still \n     valid and militate against granting it statehood.\n       Many have recognized the fundamental flaws in plans to \n     grant the District of Columbia statehood. For instance, while \n     testifying in support of the proposed 1978 District \n     amendment, which would have treated the District of Columbia \n     ``as if it were a State'' for purposes of national elections, \n     Senator Edward Kennedy dismissed what he called ``the \n     statehood fallacy,'' and stated that, ``[t]he District is \n     neither a city nor a State. In fact, statehood may well be an \n     impossible alternative, given the practical and \n     constitutional questions involved in changing the historical \n     status of the Nation's Capital.'' A pamphlet entitled \n     ``Democracy Denied'' circulated in support of the 1978 \n     amendment, and fully endorsed by District Delegate Walter E. \n     Fauntroy, plainly acknowledged that granting statehood to the \n     District of Columbia ``would defeat the purpose of having a \n     federal city, i.e., the creation of a district over which the \n     Congress would have exclusive control.'' That pamphlet also \n     recognized that statehood ``presents a troublesome problem \n     with the 23rd Amendment if the federal district were to be \n     wiped out by legislation.'' Indeed, Delegate Fauntroy has \n     opposed statehood for the District in the past, correctly \n     pointing out that ``this would be in direct defiance of the \n     prescriptions of the Founding Fathers.'' As former Senator \n     Mathias of Maryland stated, ``[i]t is not a State . . . it \n     should not be a State.''\n       These points are well taken. The factors that mitigated \n     against statehood for the District of Columbia in 1978 have \n     not changed. The rejection of the District voting rights \n     constitutional amendment by the states does not make \n     statehood any more desirable, or any less constitutionally \n     suspect, today than it was a decade ago. Granting statehood \n     to the District of Columbia would defeat the purpose of \n     having a federal city, would be in direct defiance of the \n     intent of the Founders, and would require an amendment to the \n     Constitution.\n\n\n  I. Need for an Amendment to the Constitution Before the District of \n            Columbia May Be Admitted to the Union as a State\n\n       Even if statehood for the District of Columbia represented \n     sound policy, we do not believe that it can be accomplished \n     merely by a statute admitting the District to the Union. The \n     Constitution contemplates a federal district as the seat of \n     the general government, and would have to be amended. The \n     Department of Justice has long taken this position. In 1978, \n     Assistant Attorney General John M. Hannon concluded on behalf \n     of the Carter Administration that, ``it was the intent of the \n     Framers that the actual seat of the Federal Government, as \n     opposed to its other installations, be outside any State and \n     independent of the cooperation and consent of the State \n     authorities . . . . If these reasons have lost validity, the \n     appropriate response would be to provide statehood for the \n     District by constitutional amendment rather than to ignore \n     the Framers' intentions.''\n       The retention of federal authority over a truncated, \n     federal service area would not answer this constitutional \n     objection. The language of the Constitution grants Congress \n     exclusive authority over the district that became the seat of \n     government, not merely over the seat of the government. The \n     district that became the seat of government is the District \n     of Columbia. It does not appear that Congress may, consistent \n     with the language of the Constitution, abandon its exclusive \n     authority over any part of the District.\n       Further, the Twenty-third Amendment requires that ``[t]he \n     District constituting the seat of Government of the United \n     States'' appoint electors to participate in the Electoral \n     College. The amendment was proposed, drafted and ratified \n     with reference to the District of Columbia. When the states \n     adopted this amendment, they confirmed the understanding that \n     the District is a unique juridical entity with permanent \n     status under the Constitution. Another amendment would be \n     necessary to remake this entity.\n       Finally, we believe that Congress' ability to admit the \n     District of Columbia into the Union as a new state would \n     depend upon the consent of the legislature of the original \n     ceding state. Article IV, section 3 of the Constitution \n     provides that: ``no new State shall be formed or erected \n     within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be \n     formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of \n     States, without the Consent of the legislatures of the States \n     concerned as well as of the Congress.'' Accordingly, the \n     consent of Maryland would be necessary before the District of \n     Columbia could be admitted to the Union. Should Maryland \n     refuse to consent, the area that is now the District of \n     Columbia could not be made a state without amendment of \n     Article IV, section 3.\n       Thus, before the District of Columbia may be admitted to \n     the Union as a state, the Constitution would have to be \n     amended. Such an amendment, however, would be unwise.\n\n\n II. The Sound Historical Reasons for a Federal District Still Operate \n                                 Today\n\n       In the Founders' view, a federal enclave where Congress \n     could exercise complete authority, insulating itself from \n     insult and securing its deliberations from interruption, was \n     an ``indispensible necessity.'' They settled upon the device \n     of a federal district as the means by which the federal \n     government might remain independent of the influence of any \n     single state, to avoid, in the words of Virginia's George \n     Mason, ``a provincial tincture to ye Natl. deliberations.''\n       The passing years have, if anything, increased the need for \n     ultimate congressional control of the federal city. The \n     District is an integral part of the operations of the \n     nation's government, which depends upon a much more complex \n     array of services, utilities, transportation facilities, and \n     communication networks than it did at the Founding. If the \n     District were to become a state, its financial problems, \n     labor troubles, and other concerns would still affect the \n     federal government's operations. Congress, however, would be \n     deprived of a direct, controlling voice in the resolution of \n     such problems. In a very real sense, the federal government \n     would be dependent upon the State of Columbia for its day to \n     day existence.\n\n[[Page S2534]]\n\n       The retention of congressional authority over a much \n     reduced federal enclave would not solve this problem. The \n     Founder's contemplated more than a cluster of buildings, \n     however grand, and their surrounding parks and gardens as the \n     national capital. The creation of a new ``federal town'' was \n     intended, in large part so that Congress could independently \n     control the basic services necessary to the operation of the \n     federal government. As former Senator Birch Bayh pointed out \n     in 1978, ``when our Founding Fathers established this as a \n     capital city . . . they did not just establish a place that \n     should be the Federal city and say this is where the Federal \n     buildings are. But they envisioned this as a viable city, a \n     capital city with people who work, have businesses, and have \n     transportation lines, and homes. The essential establishment \n     of the Nation's Capital was not an establishment of the \n     Nation's Federal buildings but the Nation's city.''\n       Further, there remain virtually insurmountable practical \n     problems with District statehood. The operations of the \n     federal government sprawl over the District. As a result, the \n     new ``state'' would be honeycombed with federal \n     installations, its territory fragmented by competing \n     jurisdictions. As Assistant Attorney General Patricia Wald \n     asked while testifying on behalf of the Carter \n     Administration, regarding the proposed 1978 District \n     amendment, ``[w]ould the remaining non-Federal. area \n     constitute in any real sense a geographically homogeneous \n     entity that justifies statehood?'' It was for these very \n     reasons that former Mayor Washington expressed doubts about \n     statehood for the District. In 1975 he commented that the \n     city of Washington is ``so physically, and economically and \n     socially bound together that I would have problems with \n     statehood in terms of exacting from it some enclaves, or \n     little enclaves all around the city. Ultimately, it seems \n     to me, that would erode the very fabric of the city \n     itself, and the viability of the city.''\n       Finally, in a very real sense the District belongs not only \n     to those who reside within its borders, but to the Nation as \n     a whole. In opposing statehood for the District in 1978, \n     Senator Bayh, an otherwise ardent proponent of direct \n     District participation in congressional elections, eloquently \n     summed up the objection: ``I guess as a Senator from Indiana \n     I hate to see us taking the Nation's Capital from [5,000,000] \n     Hoosiers. It is part ours. I do not see why the District \n     should be a State because it is, indeed, the Nation's \n     Capital.''\n\n\n    III. The District of Columbia is Not Independent of the Federal \n                               Government\n\n     A. Dependence on the Federal Establishment\n       The states of the American Union are more than merely \n     geographic entities: Each is what has been termed ``a proper \n     Madisonian society''--a society composed of a ``diversity of \n     interests and financial independence.'' It is this diversity \n     which guards the liberty of the individual and the rights of \n     minorities. As Madison wrote, ``the security for civil rights \n     . . . consists in the multiplicity of interests . . . The \n     degree of security . . . will depend on the number of \n     interests . . . and this may be presumed to depend on the \n     extent of country and number of people comprehended under the \n     same government.''\n       The District of Columbia lacks this essential political \n     requisite for statehood. It has only one significant \n     ``industry,'' government. As a result, the District has one \n     monolithic interest group, those who work for, provide \n     services to, or otherwise deal with, the federal government. \n     The national government was, historically, the city's only \n     reason for being. Close to two-thirds of the District's \n     workforce is employed either directly or indirectly in the \n     business of the federal government. Indeed, in 1982 the \n     District government maintained that, in the Washington \n     Metropolitan area, for every federal worker laid off as a \n     result of government reductions in force, one person would be \n     thrown out of work in the private sector.\n       The implications of this monolithic interest are far \n     reaching. For instance, the Supreme Court, in Garcia v. San \n     Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528 (1985), \n     has recently decided that the delicate balance between \n     federal and state power is to be guarded primarily by the \n     intrinsic role the states play in the structure of the \n     national government and the political process. The \n     congressional delegation from the District of Columbia, \n     however, would have little interest in preserving the balance \n     between federal and state authority entrusted to it by \n     Garcia. The continued centralization of power in the hands of \n     the national government would, in fact, be to the direct \n     benefit of ``Columbia'' and its residents. Hence; the system \n     of competing sovereignties-designed to preserve our \n     fundamental liberties would be compromised.\n     B. Economic Dependence\n       In addition to political independence and diversity, a \n     state must have ``sufficient population and resources to \n     support a state government and to provide its share of the \n     cost of the Federal Government.'' The District of Columbia \n     simply lacks the resources both to support a state government \n     and to provide its fair share of the cost of the federal \n     government. The District is a federal dependency. Annually, \n     in addition to all other federal aid programs, it receives a \n     direct payment from the federal treasury of a half billion \n     dollars; some $522 million was budgeted for the District in \n     Fiscal 1987, $445 million to be paid directly to the \n     District's local government. All in all, District residents \n     outstrip the residents of the states in per capita federal \n     aid by a wide margin. For instance, in 1983 the District \n     received $2,177 per capita in federal aid, some five and one-\n     half times the national average of $384.\n       Not surprisingly, Washington Mayor Marion Barry has plainly \n     stated that the District would still ``require the support of \n     the Federal Government'' if statehood were granted. The \n     continuation of federal support is ordinarily justified \n     because of the percentage of federal land in the District of \n     Columbia that cannot be taxed by the local government. \n     However, the federal government owns a greater percentage of \n     the land area of 10 states, each of which bears the full \n     burdens of statehood without the sort of massive federal \n     support annually received by the District of Columbia. If the \n     District aspires to statehood, it must be prepared to stand \n     as an equal with the other states in its fiscal affairs.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The District of Columbia should not be granted statehood. \n     In our considered opinion, an amendment to the Constitution \n     would be needed before the District could be admitted as a \n     state, and in any case, the reasons that led the Founder's to \n     establish the national capital in a district outside the \n     borders of any state are still valid. The District's special \n     status is an integral part of our system of federalism, which \n     itself was a compromise between pure democracy and the need \n     to secure individual liberties and minority rights. The \n     residents of the District enjoy all of the rights of other \n     citizens, save the right to vote in congressional elections. \n     They exchanged this right, as Mr. Justice Story wrote, for \n     the benefits of living in the ``metropolis of a great and \n     noble republic.'' Instead, ``their rights [are] under the \n     immediate protection of the representatives of the whole \n     Union.'' This was the price of the national capital, and \n     District residents have enjoyed the fruits of this bargain \n     for almost two centuries.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\nIII. Proposals for Giving Representation in Congress to the District of \n                                Columbia\n\n       The numerous schemes proposed over the last two hundred \n     years to give the residents of the federal district some sort \n     of direct voting representation in Congress may be distilled \n     into five basic proposals: (1) legislation to allow the \n     District a voting member in the House of Representatives \n     alone; (2) retrocession of the District of Columbia to \n     Maryland, retaining a truncated federal district; (3) \n     allowing District residents to vote as residents of Maryland \n     in national elections; (4) an amendment to the Constitution \n     to give the District full representation in both House and \n     Senate as if it were a state; and (5) full statehood. None of \n     these proposals offers a sound policy solution, and several \n     appear to be fatally flawed when exposed to constitutional \n     scrutiny.\n     A. Voting Member in the House of Representatives\n       From time to time it has'' been suggested that the District \n     be granted, by simple legislation, a voting member in the \n     House of Representatives. This proposal, however, runs into \n     significant constitutional difficulties.\n       Those sections of the Constitution which define the \n     political structure of the federal government speak uniformly \n     in terms of the states and their citizens. Article I, section \n     2 provides that, ``[t]he House of Representatives shall be \n     composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of \n     the several States . . . . No person shall be a \n     Representative . . . who shall not, when elected, be an \n     Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.'' \n     Article I, section 3 provides that, ``[t]he Senate of the \n     United States shall be composed of two Senators from each \n     State . . . . No Person shall be a Senator. . . . who shall \n     not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which \n     he shall be chosen.'' With respect to the election of the \n     President, Article II, section 1 provides that, ``[e]ach \n     State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature \n     thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole \n     Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may \n     be entitled in the Congress.'' The Seventeenth Amendment \n     directs that ``[t]he Senate of the United States shall be \n     composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the \n     people thereof.'' In short, ``[d]irect representation in the \n     Congress by a voting member has never been a right of United \n     States citizenship. Instead, the right to be so represented \n     has been a right of the citizens of the States.''\n       The word ``state'' as used in Article I may not be \n     interpreted to include the District of Columbia, even though \n     as a ``distinct political society'' it might qualify under a \n     more general definition of that term. Consistent with the \n     intent of the Framers, such arguments were properly dismissed \n     long ago by Chief Justice Marshall in Hepburn v. Ellzey. In \n     that case, plaintiffs, residents of the District, claimed \n     that they were citizens of a state for purposes of diversity \n     jurisdiction in the federal courts. The Court rejected this \n     position. Marshall reasoned that Congress had adopted the \n     definition of ``state'' as found in the Constitution in the \n     act providing for diversity jurisdiction, and that the \n     capital could not be considered such a ``state''. Citing \n     Article I, sections 2 and 3, and Article II, section 1, he \n     concluded that ``the members of the American confederacy \n     only are the states contemplated.'' ``These clauses show \n     that the word state is used in the constitution as \n     designating a member of\n\n[[Page S2535]]\n\n     the union, and excludes from the term the significance \n     attached to it by writers on the law of nations.'' \n     Congress, to be sure, has often treated the District of \n     Columbia as a state for purposes of statutory benefit \n     programs. It is customarily included in the major federal \n     grant programs by the well-worn phrase ``for purposes of \n     this legislation, the term `State' shall include the \n     District of Columbia.'' The courts, also, have \n     occasionally interpreted the word ``state'' to include the \n     District of Columbia. However, the District has never been \n     automatically included under the term ``state'' even in \n     federal statutes. In District of Columbia v. Carter, the \n     Supreme Court held that it was not a ``State or \n     Territory'' under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, which creates a \n     federal cause of action for civil rights violations under \n     color of state law. Under the test articulated by Justice \n     Brennan in that case, ``[w]hether the District of Columbia \n     constitutes a ``State or Territory'' within the meaning of \n     any particular statutory or constitutional provision \n     depends upon the character and aim of the specific \n     provision involved.'' In any event, allowing the District \n     to participate on an equal footing with the states in \n     federal statutory programs is different in kind from \n     reading the language of the Constitution itself in such a \n     way as to allow alteration of the very composition of the \n     Congress by legislative fiat.\n       The Constitutional mandate is clear. Only United States \n     citizens who are also citizens of a state are entitled to \n     elect members of Congress. This is hardly a novel \n     proposition. There are many different levels of rights \n     recognized in our system. Aliens, for instance, enjoy certain \n     basic rights, including the benefit of the Equal Protection \n     Clause but are not citizens of the United States and have no \n     vote. The residents of United States possessions overseas \n     also enjoy the protection of the Constitution, but may not \n     vote in federal elections. Many of them are United States \n     citizens--the residents of Puerto Rico and Guam, for \n     instance, fit this category. Like the residents of the \n     District of Columbia, American citizens who are not also \n     citizens of a state do not participate in congressional \n     elections, and they never have enjoyed such participation. \n     The residents of the District of Columbia may not participate \n     directly in congressional elections without becoming citizens \n     of a state, or without an amendment to the Constitution.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I had the honor of \nraising my right hand and reciting a solemn oath required by the \nConstitution itself. According to that oath, the first and last duty of \na U.S. Senator is to support and defend the U.S. Constitution. By \nopposing the legislation before us, I believe I am doing both.\n  The Constitution is short because its authors wanted to be clear, and \non the issue of congressional representation they could not have been \nmore so. According to Article I, Section II, only States elect Members \nof Congress. And, according to the same article, the seat of the \nFederal Government is not to be considered a State. So the question \nbefore us is not whether the Framers meant for the seat of Government \nto have representation in Congress. They clearly did not. Rather, the \nquestion before us is why they didn't want the seat of Government to \nhave representation. And, as a follow-up: What recourse did they leave \nthose who might want to revise what they had written.\n  In answer to the first question, the Framers opposed statehood for a \nnumber of good reasons. First, they didn't want the Federal Government \nto be beholden to a single State, a situation that would of course \nunfairly benefit the residents of that State, either materially or \nthrough added prestige, at the expense of all the other States. Second, \nthey wanted the Federal Government to have the freedom to relocate if \nthe need arose.\n  This was not an easy issue for the Framers. But the plain text of the \nConstitution leaves no doubt as to how they came down on the question: \nIn the end, they decided the interests of the whole were best served by \ncarving out a Federal district that stood apart from the States. This \nway Federal officials would be able to protect the interests of the \nwhole and give the Federal Government the freedom it would need to \noperate with complete independence and freedom of movement.\n  Clearly, not everyone is satisfied with the result. But there should \nbe no doubt about what the words of the Constitution says--not just on \nthe day it was ratified, but throughout our history.\n  The 23rd amendment, for instance, gave Washington, DC the same number \nof electoral votes that it would receive as ``if it were a state.'' \nWhat this means, of course, is that at the time this amendment was \nratified in 1961, no one was under the illusion that DC was a State--or \nthat it should be treated as one, short of a constitutional amendment.\n  Clearly, the Framers recognized the deficiencies of the final \nproduct. In creating a Federal district, they knew permanent residents \nof that district would lack representation in Congress. And this is why \nthey left us a remedy within the Constitution itself. If and when the \n``People of the United States'' wished to revise the U.S. Constitution, \nthey could do so by amending it, just as they did in 1961.\n  The process of amendment is clearly outlined in article V, and it has \nserved the American people well for more than two centuries. Over the \nyears, we have amended our founding document 27 times. From eradicating \nslavery, to securing the right to vote for women, to putting a limit on \nthe years a President can serve in office, the people of the United \nStates have used the amendment process as the way to secure or expand \nrights.\n  So the surest way to honor the aspirations of DC residents is to \npursue a remedy which respects the Constitution. One way is through a \nconstitutional amendment that uses the same language as the bill before \nus. Another would be to allow the residents of the District to vote as \nif they were residents of a bordering State, or even to declare them \nresidents of a bordering State.\n  As the Senate's greatest student and fiercest living guardian of the \nConstitution, the senior Senator from West Virginia, said just last \nyear on the Senate floor:\n\n       If we wish to grant representatives of the citizens of the \n     District of Columbia full voting rights, ``let us do so, once \n     again, the proper way, by passing a resolution to amend the \n     Constitution consistent with its own terms.''\n\n  The bottom line is this: Any proposal to secure the right to vote \nmust honor the Constitution, which Lincoln called the ``only safeguard \nof our liberties.'' Anything less would violate the oath we have sworn \nto uphold, and would guarantee a challenge in the courts that would \nonly further prolong this debate.\n  The better way is the surer way--and that's the constitutional way.\n  I will oppose this proposal. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in a few moments the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, is scheduled to be here to speak on the \nEnsign amendment and I will yield to her to vote at 3:45. But I say we \nare coming to a pivotal moment in a march that has gone on for years \nand years now. In some sense it goes back more than two centuries \nwhen--for reasons that are hard for historians let alone Senators to \nfathom, the District was established as a National Capital, separated \nfrom the State to which it had been attached before--an omission was \nmade that was grave and inconsistent with the founding principles of \nthis country. The residents of this National Capital of the greatest \ndemocracy of the world were left without a Representative here in \nCongress who could vote. In a government premised on the consent of the \ngoverned, the 600,000 residents of the District today do not have a \nvoting Representative here in Congress.\n  If you step back, it is actually unbelievable. No one has argued that \nthis is somehow a just result. The fact is that it is patently unjust \nand un-American, in the sense of a violation of the best principles of \nthis country, of freedom, of democracy, of the Republic based on the \nvotes of the people. So the argument against the proposal that has come \nout of the committee that I am privileged to chair, that enjoys \nbipartisan support, is nonetheless that this is not quite the right way \nto do it.\n  I understand those who have argued against our proposal have said \nthat the Constitution does not allow us to do it quite this way; that \nit requires a constitutional amendment. The effect of this I think is \nto say to the residents of the District: Wait a little while longer. It \nhas only been a couple of hundred years that you have been denied a \nvoting Representative.\n  That is not fair. In fact, the preponderance of constitutional \nopinion is that the so-called District clause occupies the field and \ngives us the opportunity to right this historic wrong. Over and over \nagain, notwithstanding the clause my colleagues rely on which says that \nthe House shall be composed of Members chosen by the people of the\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\nseveral States--they emphasize States--yet in decision after decision \nthe Supreme Court of the United States has said that the District \nshould be considered as a State or else its citizens will be denied \nequal protection; due process as a State for purposes of the interstate \ncommerce clause; as I stated, for the purposes of diversity of \njurisdiction, the opportunity for people to gain access to Federal \ncourts for the right of trial by jury. So the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States has made very clear that the District, even when the \nConstitution refers to States, should be considered as a State. There \nmay be a constitutional argument on the other side; I do not think it \nis a compelling argument. But if you accept the injustice of the status \nquo for the residents of the District, an unacceptable injustice that \nis an embarrassment to this great democracy of ours, then even if you \nthink what S. 160 does is not constitutional, vote to end the injustice \nbecause the proposal, S. 160 itself, provides for expedited appeal to \nthe court to determine the constitutionality.\n\n  After all, there is always debate. No one knowingly votes for \nsomething they think is unconstitutional. Yet there are so many times \nwhen we have to acknowledge, as powerful as this great deliberative \nbody is, we are not the ultimate arbiter of constitutionality. That \nprivilege, that power, was given by the Constitution to the judicial \nbranch of our Government.\n  So I hope, my friends, as we draw close to the hour of decision, that \nmy colleagues, whatever their conclusion about the constitutionality \nis, will vote to end the injustice imposed on residents of the \nDistrict. I have always believed America is many things, but in this \nsense, is a journey. It is a journey historically to realize the \nextraordinary revolutionary principles adopted in our Declaration of \nIndependence and Constitution that have been followed by so many other \ncountries since the great statement in the Declaration of Independence, \nthose self-evident truths, that all of us are created equal; we are \nendowed by our creator with these inalienable rights to life and \nliberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n  The Constitution enshrines a system of representative government, a \ngreat republic, government by the consent of the governed. But we must \nacknowledge that at the outset of our history, as lofty as the \nprinciples were embraced and expressed in the Deceleration and the \nConstitution, they were not fully realized at the outset of our \nhistory. People of color, African Americans, were not only denied the \nrights of citizenship but were only counted three-fifths the equal of \nWhites. Women did not have the right to vote. Many men did not have the \nright to vote because the vote in most States was limited to those who \nowned land.\n  So over our history, we have been on this extraordinary journey to \nrealize, generation after generation, the ideals stated by our \nFounders. Of course, in many cases it took too long, but here we are in \na country where voting, at least, has been extended fully to most \npeople in our country--the right to vote, the right to have voting \nrepresentation in Congress. Yet there is this growth remaining; 600,000 \nof our fellow Americans get taxed, get called to war, get regulated and \nsupervised and everything else, and yet have no say here with a vote by \na Representative in the House of Representatives. That is what this \nbill would do.\n  It is not a small step, it is a significant, historic step forward on \nthe journey to realize the best principles of this great Republic. When \nthe time comes, I hope and believe our colleagues in both parties will \nfinally right this wrong and extend voting representation in the House \nto residents of the District.\n  I am pleased to see the Senator from California on the Senate floor, \nand I would yield to her at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. I \nrise today to speak in strong opposition to amendment No. 575 offered \nby Senator Ensign.\n  I believe the amendment is reckless. I believe it is irresponsible. I \nbelieve it will lead to more weapons and more violence on the streets \nof our Nation's Capital. It will endanger the citizens of the District, \nthe Government employees who work here, our elected officials, and \nthose who visit this great American Capitol. And, of course, if \nsuccessful, it will be the first new step in a march to remove all \ncommonsense gun regulations all over this land.\n  The Ensign amendment repeals gun laws promoting public safety, \nincluding DC laws that the U.S. Supreme Court indicated were \npermissible under the second amendment in the Heller decision. I \nstrongly disagree with the Supreme Court decision in Heller that the \nsecond amendment gives individuals a right to possess weapons for \nprivate purposes not related to State militias, and that the \nConstitution does not permit a general ban on handguns in the home. But \nthat is the law. It has been adjudicated. It has gone up to the highest \nCourt, and I am one who believes if we do not like the law, we should \ntry to make changes through the proper legal channels.\n  However, it is important to note that Heller also stands for the \nproposition that reasonable, commonsense gun regulations are entirely \npermissible. As the author of the original assault weapons ban that was \nenacted in 1994, I know commonsense gun regulations do make our \ncommunities safer, while at the same time respecting the rights of \nsportsmen and others to keep and bear arms.\n  Justice Scalia wrote in the majority opinion on the Heller case that \na wide variety of gun laws are ``presumptively lawful,'' including the \nlaws ``forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places'' and \nregulations governing ``the conditions and qualifications of the \ncommercial sale of arms.''\n  I cannot think of any place more sensitive than the District of \nColumbia. Even bans on ``dangerous and unusual weapons'' are completely \nappropriate under the Heller decision. So it is interesting to me that \nyou have this decision, and then you have the Senate moving even to \nobliterate what is allowable under the decision.\n  Senator Ensign's amendment completely ignores Heller's language and \ntakes the approach that all guns for all people at all times is called \nfor by Heller. It is not.\n  We have all seen the tragic consequences of gun violence: the \nmassacre of students at Virginia Tech University in 2007, the murders \nat Columbine High School in Colorado, the North Hollywood shootout \nwhere bank robbers carrying automatic weapons and shooting armor-\npiercing bullets shot 10 Los Angeles Police Department SWAT officers \nand seven civilians before being stopped.\n  We have seen criminal street gangs able to buy weapons at gun shows \nand out of the back seats or the trunks of automobiles. We have seen \ntheir bullets kill hundreds, if not thousands of people across this \ngreat land, men, women, and children.\n  As Senator Schumer said, if this amendment becomes law, even if you \ncannot see, even if you cannot pass a sight test, you can have access \nto firearms. That is not what this Nation should encourage. Those \nincidents and the gun violence that occurs every day across this \ncountry show us that we should be doing more, not less, to keep guns \nout of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill and not give them \nunfettered access to firearms.\n  It is worth noting just how far this amendment goes in repealing DC \nlaw and just how unsafe it will make the streets of this capital. Here \nis what it would do: It would repeal DC's ban on semiautomatic weapons, \nincluding assault weapons.\n  If this amendment becomes law, military-style assault weapons with \nhigh-capacity magazines will be allowed to be stockpiled in homes and \nbusinesses in the District, even near Federal buildings such as the \nWhite House and the Capitol. Even the .50 caliber sniper rifle, with a \nrange of over 1 mile, will be allowed in DC under this amendment. This \nis a weapon capable of firing rounds that can penetrate concrete and \narmor plating. And at least one model of the .50 caliber sniper rifle \nis easily concealed and transported. One gun manufacturer describes \nthis model as a ``lightweight and tactical'' weapon and capable of \nbeing collapsed and carried in ``a very small inconspicuous package.''\n  Is this what we want to do? There is simply no good reason anyone \nneeds semiautomatic, military-style assault weapons in an urban \ncommunity. It is\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\nunfathomable to me that the same high-powered sniper rifle used by our \nArmed Forces will be permitted in the Nation's Capitol. Yet this is \nexactly what the amendment would allow if passed by the Senate.\n  Next, the amendment would repeal existing Federal antigun trafficking \nlaws. For years, Federal law has banned gun dealers from selling \nhandguns directly to out-of-State buyers who are not licensed firearms \ndealers. This has helped substantially in the fight against illegal \ninterstate gun trafficking, and it has prevented criminals from \ntraveling to other States to buy guns.\n  Senator Ensign's amendment repeals this longstanding Federal law and \nallows DC residents to cross State lines to buy handguns in neighboring \nStates. Illegal gun traffickers will be able to easily obtain large \nquantities of firearms outside of DC and then distribute those guns to \ncriminals in DC and in surrounding States.\n  And no one should be so naive as to say that this amendment will not \ndo this. It will. The amendment repeals DC law restricting the ability \nof dangerous and unqualified people to obtain guns. The amendment also \nrepeals many of the gun regulations that the Supreme Court said were \ncompletely appropriate after Heller.\n  So all of those who will vote for this amendment should not do so \nthinking they are just complying with the Heller decision. This is part \nof a march forward by gun lobby interests in this country to begin to \nremove all commonsense regulations, and no one should think it is \nanything else.\n  This would repeal the DC prohibition on persons under the age of 21 \nfrom possessing firearms, and it repeals all age limits for the \npossession of long guns, including assault weapons.\n  Do we really want that? I think of the story of an 11-year-old who \nhad a reduced barreled shotgun and just recently killed somebody with \nit. Is this what we want to see all over this country, the ability of \nvirtually anyone to obtain a firearm regardless of their age? I don't \nthink so.\n  The amendment even repeals the DC law prohibiting gun possession by \npeople who have poor vision. I heard Senator Schumer speak about this \nyesterday afternoon. Unbelievably, under this amendment, the District \nwould be barred from having any vision requirement for gun use, even if \nsomeone is blind. Is this the kind of public policy we want to make for \nour Nation? Is this how co-opted this body is to the National Rifle \nAssociation and others? I hope not.\n  The amendment before the Senate repeals all firearm registration \nrequirements in the District, making it even more difficult for law \nenforcement to trace guns used in crimes and track down the registered \nowner. The amendment repeals all existing safe-storage laws and \nprohibits the District from enacting any additional safe-storage laws.\n  After the Heller decision, the District passed emergency legislation \nto allow guns to be unlocked for self-defense, but requiring that they \notherwise be kept locked to keep guns out of the hands of children and \ncriminals. We all ought to want that.\n  The Ensign amendment repeals even this modest limitation and prevents \nthe District of Columbia City Council from enacting any law that \ndiscourages, whatever that means, gun ownership or requiring the safe \nstorage of firearms. How can we, in the Capitol of the United States \nwhere we have had so many tragic events, possibly do this? This is \nsimply ridiculous and goes well beyond the Supreme Court's ruling in \nHeller.\n  Think about what this means. Consider that every major gun \nmanufacturer recommends that guns be kept unloaded, locked, and kept in \na safe place. Under this amendment, the District could not enact any \nlegislation requiring that guns be stored in a safe place, even in \nhomes with children. How can anyone believe this broad- brush amendment \nis the right thing to do? How can any of us believe it provides \nprotection for the people we represent?\n  Let me make one other point. The American people clearly do not agree \nwith this amendment. Last fall, when a virtually identical bill was \nbeing considered in the House of Representatives, a national poll found \nthat 69 percent of Americans opposed Congress passing a law to \neliminate the District's gun laws, 69 percent. That is about as good as \nwe get on any controversial issue. Additionally, 60 percent of \nAmericans believe Washington will become less safe if Congress takes \nthis step.\n  Is this what we want? Do we want the Capitol of the United States to \nbecome less safe? I don't think so. Today, if this amendment passes in \nthe Senate, it will be directly against the wishes of the American \npeople. It will not pass because it is good public policy, it will only \nbe passed to placate the National Rifle Association. I say for shame.\n  As a former mayor who saw firsthand what happens when guns fall into \nthe hands of criminals, juveniles, and the mentally ill, I believe this \namendment places the families of the District of Columbia in great \njeopardy. The amendment puts innocent lives at stake. It is an affront \nto the public safety of the District. It is an affront to local home \nrule. This isn't just a bad amendment; it is a very dangerous one. I \nvery strongly urge Senators to join me in opposing it.\n  Mr. President, when this bill was tried in the House a year ago, a \npoll was done nationally in which 69 percent of the people were against \nit. I have to believe a dominant majority would still be against it. I \nurge a no vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to clear up a couple of \nmisstatements made by the other side. First, they said that somebody \nwho is mentally ill could get a gun under this provision. That is not \nthe case. We basically take the Federal definition which does not allow \npeople who are mentally ill to get guns because reasonable background \nchecks can be required and should be required so that somebody who is \nmentally ill won't get a gun. We don't want to see a Virginia Tech type \nof a situation happen again. This amendment does not allow it.\n  The bottom line is, the District of Columbia has the highest murder \nrate. It has had the highest murder rate, and that rate has gone up as \nthe District has enacted stricter and stricter gun control laws. As the \nSenator from California said, we want to protect citizens. Shouldn't we \ndo what other places have done and allow law-abiding citizens to \nactually own guns? That is what the amendment provides. It says: Let's \nprotect the second amendment rights for law-abiding District of \nColumbia residents so they can protect themselves against intruders \ncoming into their homes.\n  Criminals are going to get their guns. We know that. Criminals get \ntheir guns in DC and around the country. They do it through the black \nmarket. In DC, they can go right across the border and get a gun pretty \neasily. We want to make sure that law-abiding citizens are able to get \nguns and to protect themselves. That is the basis for this amendment, \nto say: Let's uphold the Supreme Court. Let's make sure we protect the \nsecond amendment rights of citizens in the District of Columbia. We are \nexercising our constitutional duty both with oversight over the \nDistrict of Columbia and by protecting the second amendment rights of \nour citizens.\n  I urge a yea vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Senator Reid wishes to speak for 2 \nminutes before the vote. Therefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. 575.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \ncommence upon completion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had a good debate on this bill. It \nhas gone on all week. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nfor a very productive, intelligent conversation. The Senate today is \nmoving to right a century's-old wrong. It is inexcusable and \nindefensible that nearly 600,000 people who live in the District of \nColumbia don't enjoy a voice in Congress as do other American citizens. \nWe are the only democracy in the world that denies citizens of its \ncapital--our capital, Washington, DC--the right to vote in a national \nlegislature in any way. Residents of Washington, DC pay taxes. They sit \non juries. They serve bravely in the armed services. Yet they are \nprovided only a delegate in Congress who is not permitted to vote. This \ninjustice has stood for far too long. Shadow representation is shadow \ncitizenship and is offensive to our democracy.\n  I hope the bill will pass today. It is a bill that is fair, \nbipartisan, and long overdue. If we can send American soldiers to fight \nfor democracy around the world and ensure citizens of other nations \nthat they have a right to vote, the least we can do is give the same \nopportunity to fellow Americans in the shadow of this great Capitol. We \nwill shortly vote on a bill that honors the residents of the District \nwho responsibly meet every single expectation of American citizenship \nbut are denied one of the most basic civil rights in return.\n  I commend Chairman Lieberman, who has taken leadership on this issue \nfor no reason or agenda other than he believes it is right to do this.\n  I urge all Senators to vote for this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have had \nconversations today with the Republican leader. We both understand the \nurgency of trying to get this done. We are going to try to have as many \namendments as time will allow. People should be here ready to move on \nthis bill as soon as we are able to get to it. I have already heard \nfrom a couple of Senators who have amendments ready to go. What we will \ntry to do is alternate sides on amendments and hopefully finish it on \nThursday. Next Friday is supposed to be a nonvoting day.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n     provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n     shall not be infringed.\n       (2) As the Congress and the Supreme Court of the United \n     States have recognized, the Second Amendment to the United \n     States Constitution protects the rights of individuals, \n     including those who are not members of a militia or engaged \n     in military service or training, to keep and bear arms.\n       (3) The law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia \n     are deprived by local laws of handguns, rifles, and shotguns \n     that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons throughout the \n     United States for sporting use and for lawful defense of \n     their persons, homes, businesses, and families.\n       (4) The District of Columbia has the highest per capita \n     murder rate in the Nation, which may be attributed in part to \n     local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-abiding \n     persons who would otherwise be able to defend themselves and \n     their loved ones in their own homes and businesses.\n       (5) The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by the \n     Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, and the Brady \n     Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, provide \n     comprehensive Federal regulations applicable in the District \n     of Columbia as elsewhere. In addition, existing District of \n     Columbia criminal laws punish possession and illegal use of \n     firearms by violent criminals and felons. Consequently, there \n     is no need for local laws which only affect and disarm law-\n     abiding citizens.\n       (6) Officials of the District of Columbia have indicated \n     their intention to continue to unduly restrict lawful firearm \n     possession and use by citizens of the District.\n       (7) Legislation is required to correct the District of \n     Columbia's law in order to restore the fundamental rights of \n     its citizens under the Second Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and thereby enhance public safety.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to thank my colleagues \nfor voting to pass the historic District of Columbia House Voting \nRights Act of 2009 and giving the citizens who live in the capital of \nthe free world the right to exercise that most basic of freedoms--the \nright to choose who governs them.\n  Passage of this act is another step on our long march to make our \ndemocracy ever more inclusive.\n  Thomas Jefferson once wrote:\n\n       It is by their votes the people exercise their sovereignty.\n\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\n\n  But when Jefferson wrote those words only a small pool of white \nlandowners got to choose who governed them.\n  Since then, through acts of state legislatures, the Congress and the \ncourts the right to vote has been extended to men over 21--regardless \nof property ownership--to newly freed black men who, along with their \nfamilies, had previously counted as just three fifths of a person, and \nthen to women and to 18 year olds.\n  And after extending those rights we further decided that each of \nthese votes should count equally--``one man, one vote,'' and that no \none legally entitled to vote could be denied the franchise by a poll \ntax or voting test.\n  The men and women of the District--a city of nearly 600,000--fight in \nour wars and pay Federal taxes; yet, they have no say on issues of war \nand peace or how their money is spent.\n  Perhaps the ultimate slight of denying the right to vote to District \nresidents was that if an American were to move abroad, their right to \nvote in their home State was guaranteed, regardless of how long they \nremained out of the country. The only way they could lose that right \nwas if they were to either renounce their citizenship or return to the \nUnited States and live in Washington, DC.\n  Today we fixed this situation and we can all be proud of our work.\n  I want to thank Senator Reid for bringing this to the floor and thank \nhis outstanding floor staff--as well as other Democratic and Republican \nSenate staffers--for their hard work.\n  And finally, I would like to take a moment to thank Michael \nAlexander, Kevin Landy, Holly Idelson Deborah Parkinson, Leslie \nPhillips, Scott Campbell, David Rosenbaum and the rest of the staff of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee staff for \ntheir hard work in bringing this bill successfully to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I am proud to share this historic moment with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/26/senate-section/article/S2542-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2542-S2545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CAPTIVE PRIMATE SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

I will preface it first by saying to my friend, \nSenator Lieberman, that in his State there was a horrific attack.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In my hometown.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. It was an attack by a nonhuman primate--a chimpanzee \nin this case--that was a household pet, against a woman. Without going \ninto the terrible details, I think the whole country was shocked at \nwhat occurred there.\n  Many of us have been saying for a long time that we need to fix this \nproblem. In 1978, importing nonhuman primates to the U.S. for pet trade \nwas banned by the CDC in regulations. But now you can still trade these \nprimates in the pet trade and sell them for use as pets. We say it is \ntime to end that.\n  I know Senator Coburn is going to object to our moving this bill \nwhich was passed by the House quickly and in a bipartisan way with just \na handful of ``no'' votes. Can't we come together on this? The fact is, \nour bill says we are going to ban pet trading of these nonhuman \nprimates, and we are going to get this done one way or another. We will \nnot get it done today because Senator Coburn will object for his \nreasons. I believe it is important to state that our bill--and this is \na Boxer-Vitter bill--has no impact on trade or transportation of \nanimals for zoos or scientific research facilities or other federally \nlicensed and regulated entities. All we are saying is that it is \ndangerous to keep as a pet a nonhuman primate. We saw this in \nConnecticut, but that was not the only time. There have been many \nexamples. When we get this done, we will list those. We have been \ntrying to get this passed for a long time. Senator Coburn objected. We \nwill get around it at some point in time.\n  Primates can harbor many infectious diseases that can readily jump \nfrom species to humans. As a result, the CDC, back in 1975, said: No, \nno importation of those nonhuman primates unless it is for medical \nreasons or a zoo or to a Federal body that is going to oversee it. \nListen to how many people have been injured. More than 150 people. How \nabout children? Do you care about children? Forty children were injured \nby these nonhuman primates between 1995 and 2009. Nineteen States, \nincluding my own, have prohibited these animals as pets. Fourteen \nStates restrict or partially ban their use as pets because many of \nthese animals move in interstate commerce.\n  Federal legislation is needed. You would think this is a no-brainer--\nyou would think. Who supports this legislation? Well, the House of \nRepresentatives just passed it overwhelmingly on suspension of the \nrules. It wasn't even a problem over there. The Humane Society of the \nUnited States supports it. The American Veterinary Medical Association \nsupports it. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums supports it. The \nJane Goodall Institute supports it. The Wildlife Conservation Society \nsupports it. That is a very small portion. I cannot believe I actually \nhad to come out here today.\n  With all due respect to my friend, he will have his reasons, but, \nhonestly, I hoped that once in a while we could work together on a bill \nthat is so obvious in its need.\n  We know these nonhuman primates have not been bred and domesticated \nover thousands of years like dogs or cats. It is a whole different \nworld there. That is why the veterinarians support us. Nobody loves \npets more than the Humane Society. Nobody loves pets more, but they \nknow what can happen. A woman got her face ripped off.\n  So I am not going to go into the details of the attack at this time, \nbut if I have to I will to get the votes of colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 80, the Captive Primate Safety Act, which was \nreceived from the House; and, further, that the bill be read the third \ntime and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Oklahoma \nis recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, and I do, I ask unanimous \nconsent to be recognized for 5 minutes to make comments regarding what \nhas just been said.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have 5 \nminutes following my friend from Oklahoma, and then I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Sanders have 15 minutes on his subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to proceeding to the \nmeasure.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, on February 16, 2009, a pet non-human \nprimate, NHP, attacked Ms. Nash, a friend of the pet's owner--almost \nkilling her. My thoughts and prayers are with Ms. Nash and I am sure I \njoin all of my colleagues in wishing her a speedy and full recovery.\n  This unfortunate event has rushed consideration of the Captive \nPrimate Safety Act, H.R. 80. H.R. 80 would make it illegal to import, \nexport, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase non-human \nprimates, such as monkeys and apes, by amending the over 100-year old \nLacey Act to include ``any nonhuman primate.''\n  H.R. 80 does not affect laboratory animals, zoos, and some \nveterinarian cases.\n  This bill does not address a national priority and should not be \nconsidered by Congress.\n  Last Congress, I held the similar Senate version of the Captive \nPrimate Safety Act, S. 1498, because of concerns with its fiscal impact \nand because I did not believe it was appropriate for the Federal \nGovernment to be regulating pets.\n  Today the Senate is trying to pass the similar House version that \nstill seeks to increase Federal regulation of pets in a fiscally \nirresponsible manner without amendments or debate.\n  Supporters of this bill hope that somehow creating a new Federal law \nto prohibit transporting pet primates across State lines, on top of the \nFederal laws and regulations that already make it illegal to import \nthem and the dozens of State laws that outlaw owning non-human primates \nas pets, and\n\n[[Page S2543]]\n\ngiving the Fish and Wildlife Service $5 million to hire extra ``law \nenforcement'' staff to pursue chimps will make Americans safer.\n  Supporters of this measure are using the tragedy that occurred this \nmonth to ram this bill through Congress with no debate. This attack \noccurred in Connecticut, where a State law already existed that \noutlawed the possession of NHP's weighing more than 50 pounds without a \npermit. The NHP weighed 200 pounds and should have not been allowed \nunder state law to live with its owner as a pet, but passing the \nCaptive Primate Safety Act last year would not have prevented this \ntragedy and is not a national priority.\n  The bill authorizes $5 million in fiscal year 2010 to hire additional \nUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service law enforcement personnel to \nenforce the new monkey provisions and CBO says the bill will cost \ntaxpayers $17 million over 5 years. To enact such legislation without \nany offsets and therefore simply add to our national debt is extremely \nimprudent at this time in our nation.\n  There still have been no hearings and therefore no official statement \nor testimony available from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as to \nwhether or not this law is necessary and/or enforceable within the \nagency's current resources.\n  There is even a more basic question of whether or not a Federal \nwildlife agency should be regulating interstate pet transportation at \nall.\n  This law may be duplicative, unnecessary, and ineffective.\n  This matter of pet ownership may be more appropriately and \neffectively handled by local and State governments and agencies.\n  The UC does not allow an opportunity to amend this bill to address \ncost concerns.\n  This Bill spends money we don't have on something that is \nunnecessary.\n  CBO estimated last Congress that both the House and the Senate \nversions of the Captive Safety Act and last Congress's Senate bill, \nwould cost $17 million over 5 years. H.R. 80 is almost identical to \nlast Congress's House bill.\n  According to CBO, the cost of hiring four additional U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service, FWS, employees to conduct inspections and \ninvestigations and storing, transporting and boarding confiscated NHP's \ntotals $17 million over 5 years.\n  The costs may in fact be even higher. According to one chimp \nsanctuary the annual cost to house two chimpanzees can exceed $35,000 a \nyear. According to the Humane Society of the United States and various \nMembers of Congress, there are an estimated 15,000 non-human primates \nin private hands. If the FWS were to try and confiscate and then house \nall 15,000 chimps, that could add up to a total cost of $262.5 million \na year for the federal taxpayers, or $1.3 billion over 5 years.\n  The unanimous consent agreement would not allow anyone to offer \namendments to offset the cost of this bill or perhaps cut back on other \nareas within the Fish and Wildlife's jurisdiction to pay for these new \nresponsibilities.\n  Fourteen Monkey bites a year do not justify annual appropriations of \n$4 Million.\n  While the Humane Society of the United States said in a February 2009 \npress release that the Captive Primates Safety Act is an ``urgently \nneeded public safety and animal welfare measure,'' other Americans may \nfeel differently about prioritizing this issue above more pressing \nnational issues.\n  The group justifies prioritizing H.R. 80 with American taxpayer \nresources because of recent captive primate incidents. An analysis of \nits list of ``recent incidents involving captive primates'' finds:\n  In 2008, 11 monkeys were reported as being involved in biting 14 \npeople. One of the monkeys was in a university laboratory and another \nwas in a wildlife sanctuary. Both of these types of monkeys are \nexempted and therefore would not be affected by the Captive Primates \nSafety Act.\n  In 2008, there were 39 non-human primates involved in 21 incidents, \nbut 28 of the 39 monkeys involved in the reported incidents were not \nnoted as having harmed humans.\n  Similarly, last Congress, the Humane Society and the Senate EPW \ncommittee justified the creation of a new Federal law by citing 132 \nreported incidents of human injury from captive or escaped captive \nprimates over a 10-year period--which still averages out to only 13 a \nyear.\n  In contrast, 4.7 million Americans are bitten by dogs each year, \naccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  Taking both the Humane Society and the CBO score together, the bill \nbefore us today, essentially calls for the Federal Government to spend \nthe equivalent of over $444,000 per year to take nine biting monkeys \nout of their private owners' hands. Using another measurement, the FWS \nwould spend the equivalent of over $285,000 per bite--$4 million \ndivided by 14 people who were bitten by monkeys in 2008--if this bill \npassed.\n  Yet even these cost estimates may be understated because it is \npossible that none of the nine offending monkeys will ever cross State \nlines. In that case, unless State or local laws and officials caused \ntheir removal, these pets would remain with their owners.\n  While not seeking to diminish the physical or psychological effects \nof any monkey bites or attacks, taxpayers have a right to question if \nsuch a small number of incidents justify the large cost to the Federal \nGovernment of taking on additional animal control responsibilities.\n  In contrast, though some of the 4.7 million Americans bitten by dogs \neach year die as a result of these bites, Congress is not adding \ninterstate dog transport to the lists of Federal wildlife \nresponsibilities and prohibitions. If preventing human injuries caused \nby pets was a national priority, why aren't Senators and special \ninterest groups pushing to outlaw the private ownership of dogs?\n  Passing the Captive Safety Act last Congress would not have prevented \nthe recent attack.\n  Tragically, a 200-pound, 15-year-old chimpanzee named Travis--who was \nraised by the same owners since he was an infant--brutally attacked one \nof his owner's friends, Charla Nash, outside his house in Stamford, CT, \nin February 2009. The chimp, for still unknown reasons, attacked Ms. \nNash, severely damaging her face and hands, according to news reports. \nShe is in critical but stable condition. Travis died after being \nstabbed by his owner and being shot by a police officer after he \ncharged the officer.\n  Following the recent chimp attack, the Humane Society has argued that \nif I had not held last year's bill, S. 1498, Ms. Nash would not have \nbeen attacked. This statement, however, is incorrect, because this bill \nwould have only have removed Travis from his owner if the NHP crossed \nState lines.\n  Additionally, since 2004 under Connecticut State law it has been \nillegal to own an NHP weighing more than 50 pounds if the animal is not \nregistered. Yet, State officials did not even require Travis--a 200 \npound NHP--to be registered, even though he was well known. It appears \nTravis lived in Stamford, CT, for most of his life. His attack took \nplace in front of his home. With the possible exception of an \nappearance on the Maury Povich show, which may or may not have been \nfilmed in the New York City studio, nothing indicates that Travis was \ncrossing state lines on a regular basis, nor did his unprovoked attack \nhave any interstate aspect to it. The fact that he might have been born \nin another State 15 years ago, would not have affected Travis's private \nownership 2 weeks ago if this bill had been signed into law last year.\n  What if Travis or his siblings grew up in the same State where they \nwere born? The bill does nothing to address this situation; they have \nto cross State lines to fall under Federal jurisdiction. Why is a chimp \nnative to and living in Missouri ok, but one moving to Connecticut, for \nexample should suddenly become the business of the Federal Government? \nIt is very unlikely that Travis' trip 15 years ago across a few State \nlines led to his attack in February. This is yet another reason why \nthis bill is a misplaced priority and misguided effort.\n  If people are saying all chimps are dangerous and are against private \nownership of nonhuman primates, why doesn't this bill simply make it a \nFederal crime to own them and take away the estimated 15,000 animals in \nprivate hands? Instead, to justify questionable Federal involvement, \nCongress is using the interstate commerce clause even\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\nthough this approach is both inappropriate and ineffective.\n  In a recent Boston Herald article April Truitt, director of the \nPrimate Rescue Center in Kentucky, had the following to say regarding \nH.R. 80:\n\n       ``It's better than nothing, which is what approximately 30 \n     states have right now,'' she said. But if the bill becomes \n     law, it will affect few dealers in exotic animals.\n       ``Dealers are not one bit concerned about this,'' Truitt \n     said. ``They know that they still can continue to do what \n     they were doing. Most dealers are USDA licensed, and the USDA \n     licensing has been and is used by private owners rampantly to \n     circumvent state and local legislation.''\n\n  Others, such as Sian Evans, the director of the DuMond Conservancy \nfor Primates and Tropical Forests, contend that in general, NHPs do not \ncarry disease and should not be considered a threat to the safety of \nothers.\n  While the recent attack is tragic, this bill is not an appropriate or \nresponsible use of taxpayer funds and Congressional resources.\n  Federal law already exists banning non-human primate imports.\n  It has also already been illegal for the past 30 years to import non-\nhuman primates, such as monkeys, for pets. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention: ``Since 1975, the Federal Quarantine \nRegulations, (42CFR71.53), have restricted the importation of NHP . . . \nImportation of NHP for use as pets is not permitted under any \ncircumstances.''\n  The Humane Society of the United States previously acknowledged, \n``Most states regulate keeping primates as pets, and the trend is for \nstates to prohibit the practice altogether.'' Yet the group also \nclaims, ``federal legislation is needed to complement state laws'' \nbecause ``many of these animals move in interstate commerce.''\n  In conclusion, Congress recently justified swift passage of a massive \nspending bill that increases the national debt by more than $1 trillion \nto more than $10 billion in the midst of a struggling national economy. \nIn January, the national unemployment rate was 7.6 percent--the highest \nit has been in more than 15 years. In December, national home prices \nplunged at the fastest pace on record, leading to predictions of 6 \nmillion foreclosures over the next four years. Consumer confidence \nlevels have dropped to a new low of 25 in February from 37.4 a month \nearlier as people worry about losing their jobs, earning less, and \ndeteriorating prospects.\n  Yet the Humane Society and certain Members of Congress are seeking to \nmake this pet regulation bill a national priority and are pushing to \nhave it enacted quickly. How is potentially preventing a few monkey \nbites a bigger national priority than trying to address the weakening \neconomy and collapsing consumer and business environment?\n  These ``little'' bills add up and once privately owned monkeys are \nadded to the Department of Interior's jurisdiction, they will likely be \nthere forever, not just for the 5 years authorized in this bill.\n  This bill would not have stopped the attack on Ms. Nash. My objection \ndoes not question the seriousness of her attack but lies in moving an \ninappropriate, ineffective, and irresponsible bill in the midst of a \ntime of real need in our country for strong leadership. Congress cannot \nafford to continue to misprioritize scarce resources and must focus on \ntruly national priorities--not on monkey bites and inappropriate \nspecial-interest legislation.\n  Madam President, not once have I had a call from my colleague asking: \nWill you work with me on this issue? Will you protect people as a \nresult of this issue? Will you help us pass this? What it has been is: \nTake it or leave it.\n  I note for the record that 90 Members in the House voted against the \nbill. It was not a smattering few. A fourth of the House did not agree \nwith this legislation.\n  I have never been asked: Would you care if we eliminated the \nownership of these pets? I don't have any problem with that, but I have \nnever been asked that. That has never been offered.\n  The question in the case that brings this back up is Connecticut has \na law and the law says you can hold and register a nonhuman primate if \nit weighs under 50 pounds. What happened in Connecticut is they \nviolated their own law. They had a restriction on it.\n  I am not opposed to commonsense eliminating the risk from nonhuman \nprimates, but I have never been approached in how I would work with \nthat to try to accomplish what the Senator from California would like \nto accomplish and still meet the needs of individual Americans and \ntheir civil liberties.\n  The second point I note, if we are going to do this, look, there were \n4.6 million dog bites last year that caused hundreds of thousands of \nserious injuries. Are we going to stop the interstate transport of dogs \nthat caused thousands and thousands more injuries, some even deaths, to \nindividuals? Nobody is proposing that.\n  What I ask my colleague is reach out. I would gladly work with \nSenator Boxer in a way so we eliminate any future ownership of these \ntypes of animals in a way that does not violate those who presently \nhave them and encourages the States to enforce their laws that they \nhave today and enforce them in the future.\n  We can start at a time certain tomorrow and say: You can't have new \nownership of any nonhuman primate. That stops all interstate commerce. \nThat stops it completely. But our problem is we have about 30 States \nthat have regulations in regard to this issue.\n  The incident that happened in Connecticut is very unfortunate, I \nagree. But what happened was you had the law broken. So instead of \nenforcing a law that is on the books, we are going to create another \nnew law, and it is not going to accomplish the very purpose. We are \nstill going to have nonhuman primate bites if we do not have some way \nto ultimately end this type of pet selection.\n  I reach out to my colleague. I am sorry I had to object. I will \ngladly work with her in the future to come to some accommodation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, while my friend was speaking, I went \nback to my staff because this is not the first time we have had a \nproblem on it. We had it in the big Coburn package of bills, and I \nremember my friend at that time made it the centerpiece of his \nobjection. My staff has talked with his staff over and over again. The \nRepublican staff on my committee, from where this bill came, has talked \nto the Senator over and over again.\n  I am happy to sit down with my friend. Maybe we can work this out. \nBut here is the point. My friend says that what happened to this woman \nis unfortunate. No, what happened to this woman is a tragedy.\n  We do not go in and take away pets from anybody, if you read this \nbill. If you have a pet, you have a pet as long as you are living \nwithin the laws of your State. We ban the interstate trade because that \nis how this thing is moving forward. People get these pets, and they \nsell them across State lines. That is how we ban a lot of bad in this \ncountry. It is the way we have done it for a long time.\n  I just want to say to my friend, I didn't know this rose to the level \nwhere he and I should speak. I am delighted to sit down and talk with \nhim. But the fact is, our staffs have been working with his staff for a \nvery long time on this issue. Senator Vitter's staff and Senator \nInhofe's staff have been working with the Senator's staff to try to get \na breakthrough.\n  I hope the two of us can sit down, and maybe without our staffs--\nmaybe the problem is our staffs. I have a great staff. I am sure \nSenator Coburn does too. But maybe there is something that got in the \nway of their being able to resolve it. But I think he and I should sit \ndown, and I will try to see if I can move this again, maybe with some \nkind of way we can fix it that doesn't give the Senator heartburn.\n  Honest to God, I say to my friend, we have made sure nobody is going \nto be invaded by a police force and lose their pet. That is not in \nhere. Only if you try to move it across State lines, you wouldn't be \nallowed to sell your pet so that pet can injure somebody. Nobody is \ntaking away anybody's pets. Nobody is stopping the zoos from getting \nthese pets. Nobody is stopping research facilities from getting these \npets. That is why we have such strong support for this legislation.\n  I am not a person who says my way or the highway, believe me. I have \nbeen here too long. I have gotten too many\n\n[[Page S2545]]\n\nbills passed. I will sit down with my friend. He is right that 90-some \npeople on the other side voted no, but 300-some people voted aye. So we \nmust have done something right here when we got over 300 votes in a \nbody that has a hard time getting bipartisanship.\n  I say what we did right is we have a balanced bill. We allow these \npets to be used for that which helps humanity, but we will, in effect, \nstop the interstate trade, the profitable pet trade which is leading us \ninto a situation where we have seen so many injuries of children--40 \nchildren, about 100 adults injured between 1995 and 2009.\n  I am encouraged that my friend wants to work with me. I am going to \ngo right over there as soon as I finish these remarks and figure out a \nway we can work on this issue because we do not want to wake up another \nday and read about somebody having an injury that is so horrific and \nhorrible that they will never have a normal life when it is in our \npower to do what is right here and move forward.\n  I will not renew my request, but I will another day at a date, \nhopefully, when I have the support of my friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sanders are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.''\n  Mr. SANDERS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize an \norganization that serves on the frontline of our Nation's most \nimportant international and humanitarian efforts--the U.S. Peace Corps. \nThis week, the Peace Corps celebrates its 48th anniversary, and this is \nNational Peace Corps Week.\n  Since the early 1960s, more than 195,000 Peace Corps volunteers have \nfostered positive relationships between the United States and nations \nacross the globe through its grassroots efforts.\n  At present, 7,500 or more Peace Corps volunteers are active in over \n75 countries around the world. These volunteers are exposed to a \ndiverse array of cultures and languages during their time abroad. \nApproximately 22 percent of the Peace Corps volunteers are currently \nworking in 16 predominantly Muslim countries. It is in these countries, \nin particular, where I believe the efforts of the volunteers are \npositively shaping and improving the much beleaguered and much \nmisunderstood image of America within the Muslim world.\n  But there is still much work to be done. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting an expansion of the Peace Corps and all of our \nNation's smart power assets.\n  Smart power initiatives build upon our successful defense efforts and \nadd economic and educational efforts, diplomatic efforts, including \neducational exchanges, free trade, public diplomacy, fostering private \nsector investments, agricultural development, humanitarian assistance, \nand English language teaching, just to name a few.\n  All of these smart power initiatives contribute not only to a better \nlife for so many in need, but they also help create conditions for a \nmore stable and peaceful world.\n  America and the developing world will benefit together from a greater \ninvestment in these initiatives and in particular in a revitalized and \nenlarged Peace Corps.\n  Over the past few years, the Peace Corps has received numerous \ninquiries about entering or reentering the countries where volunteers \nonce served. I made similar inquiries, particularly with respect to \nfriendly Muslim countries in Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia. \nEngaging moderate mainstream countries such as Indonesia with our \nNation's smart power initiatives will enhance the conditions for \nlasting peace and stability.\n  Or as I like to say, putting more sandals and sneakers on the ground \nwill prevent us from having to put more boots and bayonets on the \nground in the future.\n  The work undertaken by Peace Corps volunteers serves as a fine \nexample of the United States reaching out to foreign neighbors to \nfoster a greater understanding and dialog. The willingness of Peace \nCorps volunteers to engage people at the local, community level is \nexactly how we ought to be providing effective and sustainable \ndevelopment assistance.\n  We need to get back out among the very people we are trying to help, \nwhich is why I also believe we need more USAID Foreign Service officers \nas well. Providing practical, hands-on assistance that is based on \nlistening to the needs of the local population is a recipe for \nsustainable and lasting development. I believe that by having these \nkinds of contacts, we can do a great deal to improve the conditions of \nthe countries themselves as well as the people in them. The stronger, \nmore stable these countries are, the better our relations are in the \nworld and the more we foster world peace.\n  We offer our hardy congratulations to all members, current and past, \nassociated with the Peace Corps on its 48th anniversary. We thank you \nfor improving the lives of so many and for helping America be a good \nneighbor to those in need. Your country is grateful for your service. \nYour country is grateful for the good will and the seeds of peace you \nhave sown or are sowing. Your country is grateful for your \ncontributions to the safety and long-term security of our Nation. Your \nefforts and the efforts of other volunteers are needed now more than \never. I will continue to work in supporting your important missions and \nexpanding your ranks.\n  I can't stress enough the importance of our Smart Power initiatives \nand the importance of investing in efforts such as the Peace Corps. I \nam very glad to see the Obama administration, particularly Secretary of \nState Clinton, our former colleague, giving these initiatives an \nimportant public boost.

On Tuesday night, in a joint address, our new President, with \nhis usual eloquence, sketched out his fiscal policy goals.\n  First off, as ranking Republican on the Finance Committee--and I am a \nsenior Budget Committee member--I wish to point out that Republicans \nwere happy to hear the President make deficit reduction a very high \npriority. If I heard correctly, the loudest bipartisan applause, in \nterms of responses to the President's policy proposals, greeted that \npolicy point. We Republicans want deficit reduction on our future \nfiscal path. As we come out of the recession--hopefully sooner rather \nthan later--we need to get the deficit down.\n  While we Republicans agree with the President on that goal, we \ndisagree on the degree to which the Democratic leadership has \ndramatically expanded the deficit and added to the debt. A couple of \nweeks ago, Republicans and Democrats disagreed on what is referred to \nas a stimulus bill. In both bodies, only three Republican Members \nsupported that conference report. We parted ways on the stimulus bill \nfor many reasons. Most on our side disagreed that we should put $1 \ntrillion of\n\n[[Page S2546]]\n\ntaxpayers' money into an effort to grow the economy by priming the \nGovernment pump. We also would have shut off that spending spree once \nthe recovery occurred, as opposed to half of the spending money in that \nbill being spent in years beyond 2010--supposedly the end of the \nstimulus effort to the economy.\n  But what disturbed most of us on this side was the hidden fiscal \nburden built into the bill--in other words, that period of time of \nspending beyond 2010. Although advocated as a $787 billion bill, the \nreal cost--the real cost--is much higher. Unfortunately, many in the \nmedia accepted the $787 billion score on its face. By contrast, most in \nthe media looked much deeper when the bipartisan tax relief bill of \n2001 to 2006 was scored. Of course, I remember that because during that \nperiod of time, or most of it, I was chairman of the Finance Committee \nand involved in that tax relief. So they looked very deeply into what \nwe did in tax relief, and in a bipartisan way, but they seem not to be \nas concerned about the impact on the deficit of that $787 billion score \nthat is in the stimulus bill. So I would encourage the punditry and \nother opinion makers to apply the same tough fiscal standards to the \nhidden spending in the stimulus bill as they applied to the tax relief \npackages in an earlier part of this decade.\n  Soon, I am going to have some charts that will demonstrate this \ndifference between tax issues versus the spending issues of the \nstimulus bill.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, if popular \nnew programs in the stimulus bill are made permanent, the cost will be \n$3.3 trillion. I have a chart here that lays out what the Congressional \nBudget Office says the total cost of the bill is--this column right \nhere. Let's move from the left to the right of the chart. First, we \nhave the basic cost of the bill--$820 billion. If the making work pay \nrefundable tax credit is extended, there is $571 billion--the second \ncolumn here. If the new entitlement spending is made permanent, then \nthe cost of the bill more than doubles; that is, there is almost $1 \ntrillion in new hidden entitlement spending right here--the third \ncolumn. Over here in the fourth column, if the appropriations increases \nare baked in the cake, then there is $276 billion in new nondefense \ndiscretionary appropriations in the bill. That is the fourth column. \nAnd finally, CBO tells us that the interest cost on the overt new \nspending and the hidden new spending totals $744 billion. Total it all \nup, and you come out right here at $3.3 trillion. You don't come out at \n$787 billion; it is $3.3 trillion. And these are Congressional Budget \nOffice figures. They are not from some conservative think tank. They \nare not from Senate Republican sources. CBO estimated this hidden \nspending.\n  There is one way, and only one way, for stimulus bill supporters to \ndispute what I have said. The Democratic leadership in the House and \nSenate could pledge to keep temporary spending temporary--basically, \nthe money spent in 2009 and 2010 is the end of it. If the Democratic \nleaders pledge to support leaving the bill as written and would not \npush to extend the new entitlements and new appropriations spending, \nthen we could go back to the figure many in the press are reporting on \nthe cost of the bill. If the Democratic leadership makes a pledge to \nkeep temporary spending really temporary--in other words, for the 2 \nyears of jump-starting the economy--we on this side would agree that \nthe bill does not cost this $3.3 trillion. Otherwise, as Members of the \nloyal opposition--with emphasis on ``loyal''--it is our duty to let the \ntaxpayers know the true cost of the stimulus bill.\n  Unfortunately, stuffing all of that understated new spending into the \nstimulus bill will make it harder for Democrats as well as Republicans \nto reach the bipartisan goal of fiscal discipline, and I have another \nchart which shows how hard it will be.\n  This chart shows the trendline from President Clinton's era through \nGeorge W. Bush's era and for the current fiscal year of the deficit as \na percentage of gross national product. As this chart shows, President \nClinton's era saw deficits decline in the early years. Once Republicans \nwon control of the Congress and entered the scene, making fiscal \ndiscipline a priority, the deficits turned into surpluses during those \nyears. In the George W. Bush era, deficits occurred during the economic \ndownturn of 2000, with the tech bubble burst, the corporate scandals of \n2001, and, of course, the economic shock of the terrorist attacks of 9/\n11. So we have a downturn, or we have an increase in the deficit is the \neasiest way to say it.\n  Now, fortunately, during 2001 to 2003, we had bipartisan tax relief \nthat kicked in, the economy recovered, and deficits started to come \ndown during this period of time right here.\n  Now we find ourselves dealing with the housing and financial sector \nproblems. Those problems matured during the period of divided \ngovernment--the last Congress--for the years 2007 to 2008. During that \n2-year period, Democrats controlled Congress and, obviously, we had a \nRepublican President. The response of the Republican White House and \nDemocratic Congress was the Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, and \nother stimulus legislation. Those bipartisan actions led to the large \ndeficit here in 2009, and that was the deficit that awaited President \nObama. That is over $1 trillion.\n  Two nights ago--Tuesday night--President Obama pointed this fact out, \nand Democrats lustily cheered. I found the partisan cheering just a bit \nodd. I saw people leading that cheer vigorously clapping their hands. \nThis enthusiastic applause from the other side would make you think \nPresident Obama was somehow predicting we would have a Mets-Yankees \nSubway Series in 2009. But, no, the President wasn't making a sports \nprediction; President Obama was noting that he had inherited a record \ndeficit. Not many on our side find much to cheer about a record \ndeficit, and I doubt that many taxpayers find much to cheer in it \neither. That is why you didn't see much applause from the Republican \nside of the aisle Tuesday night as the President was speaking to us. \nBig deficits aren't anything to applaud about. I was scratching my head \non that one. Maybe the Democratic leadership forgot they were running \nthe show here the last Congress. Maybe they looked at some polling data \nand inferred from that polling data that voters didn't realize \nDemocrats ran the Congress in the last couple of years and were authors \nof the budgets for that period and last year's stimulus and the TARP \ndeal. Maybe they figured that the President was taking a sharp and \neffective political shot, but you must be careful because history says \notherwise. The TARP legislation was cut by Democratic congressional \nleaders, ably led by Chairman Barney Frank in the House and our able \nchairman from Connecticut, Chris Dodd in the Senate. In the key \nnegotiations on one fateful fall Saturday night, there was only one \nRepublican Senator in the room. There were at least four Democratic \nSenators in the room. I find it curious that Democrats lustily cheered \nwhen President Obama, Tuesday night, rightly pointed out that he \ninherited a $1.2 trillion deficit. There is no doubt he did inherit \nsuch a deficit. We on our side do not dispute that. But for the \ncongressional Democratic leadership to pretend that they did not play a \nkey role in creating the deficit, at least from the standpoint of 2 \nyears of their budgets as well as the TARP legislation and other \nstimulus things, is beyond being absurd. To be giddy about the record \ndeficits is almost Kafkaesque.\n\n  Yet that incorrect partisan assertion is, like this $787 billion \nfigure I am referring to, somehow accepted as fact by opinion makers \nand pundits. If we go to the last column of this chart, the one with \nthe red line, we see the real fiscal damage of the stimulus bill. In \nthe first few weeks of this Congress the inherited deficit, which was \nbad enough at 8.3 percent of GDP, was made much worse. It is now 13.5 \npercent of GDP. We have not had deficits that high since the World War \nII era.\n  If you go back over the debate in committee, on the floor and on the \nconference agreement, you will find that Republicans opposed the bill \nbecause, in general, we believed the bill failed National Economic \nCouncil Director Summers'--Dr. Summers of Harvard University--three \n``t'' tests: that it needed to be timely, it needed to be targeted, and \nit needed to be temporary. Those are words directly from, I think, a \nDecember 28 Post article that Dr. Summers wrote. It was failure in that \nthird ``t,'' the ``temporary''\n\n[[Page S2547]]\n\ntest, that was most troubling to those of us who voted against it. I \nhave laid out the degree of that failure in the comments today.\n  The response from many on the other side is that Republicans are in \nno position to criticize of because the deficits of the years 2001 \nthrough 2006. I put this chart back up here again. As I have shown, \nwhile briefly rising in 2004, the deficits consistently came down for \nbudgets produced and implemented in the period 2004, 2005, and 2006. \nMost often the critics from the other side make the widespread \nbipartisan tax relief of this era the culprit for our deficit. Let's \ntake a minute to put that characterization in context.\n  I have a chart that compares the revenue loss of the bipartisan tax \nrelief with the full effect of spending in the stimulus bill. On the \nleft side of this chart, over here, you will see all the tax relief \nenacted in various bills in the period 2001 through 2006. There were \nquite a few major tax relief bills in this period of time. They yielded \ntax relief for virtually every American taxpayer. We cut marginal tax \nrates, we doubled the child tax credit, we greatly expanded education \ntax incentives, we created the largest retirement savings incentives in \na generation and provided significant relief from the confiscatory \nreach of the death tax, and we protected tens of millions of families \nfrom the alternative minimum tax.\n  In this major tax relief program we made the Tax Code--now everybody \nis saying this is counterintuitive--but we made the Tax Code more \nprogressive in those pieces of legislation. But, as would be expected, \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation assigned significant revenue loss to \nthese packages. That is up here on this side of the chart where you see \nwhat the Joint Tax Committee says. It scores at $2.2 trillion. As I \nunderstand it, for some folks that figure raises their blood pressure. \nIt would raise mine too if I liked to hike taxes and keep taxes high. \nYou can understand it from the perspective of those critics--those \ntaxes represent $2.1 trillion that folks in this body and the other \nbody would rather spend. But we all know that tax relief did a lot of \ngood.\n  I have another chart about tax relief doing a lot of good. For a \nfamily of four at $50,000 a year of income, we have $2,300 more for \nthat family budget to operate under. For a single mom with two kids it \nmeans she keeps $1,100 for her to spend instead of 535 Members of \nCongress spending.\n  From what we heard on the campaign trail a few months ago, and we \nheard a couple of days ago here in the Capitol building, President \nObama agrees with most of this tax relief program. He said his first \nbudget will retain most of that tax relief that is in those various \nbills.\n  For purposes of this discussion, let's assume the merits--I want to \nassume the merits of the arguments of the critics of the bipartisan tax \nrelief program; that is, let's assume all of the $2.2 trillion was \npolicy that, despite what President Obama will propose, is policy these \ncritics disagree with. For a fiscal damage assessment, let's compare \nthe revenue loss of this widespread tax relief, leaving money of $1,100 \nin the pockets of a single mom or $2,200 in the pockets of a family of \nfour--let's assume the real cost. So, for fiscal damage assessments \nlet's compare the revenue loss of this widespread tax relief with the \nreal cost of the stimulus bill signed last week by the President.\n  I am going to go back to the chart that makes the comparison. So here \nit is. On the right side you will see that CBO estimates the 10-year \ncost of the bill if the temporary proposals are made permanent. Guess \nwhat, it is higher than it is over here. The total is $2.5 trillion. \nThis one stimulus bill costs about 10 percent more than the full effect \nof the tax relief bills passed between 2001 and 2006. For a lot of \nthose bipartisan tax relief bills, again, virtually every American \ntaxpayer benefits from these tax relief bills. On average, the American \ntaxpayer's tax bills would be 10 percent higher today if this \nbipartisan tax relief plan were not in effect. We heard a lot from the \ncritics of tax relief about fiscal discipline. Where are those same \npeople today? Why are they not applying the same standard to the one \npartisan spending bill that they applied to the widespread bipartisan \ntax relief bill?\n  It was good to hear my President, President Obama, raise the \nimportant goal of deficit reduction Tuesday night. He got applause from \nour side of the aisle. He was right that he inherited a serious budget \ndeficit. The Democratic leadership applauded that line because they \nfalsely claim that only Republicans bequeathed the deficit to President \nObama. The reality is that a Democratic Congress as well as a \nRepublican President bequeathed the deficit from bipartisan policies \nthey jointly developed. To those who claim Republicans have no right to \ndiscuss deficits, they need look no further than their own actions. \nThey need to take a look at the fiscal effects of the stimulus that was \ncrafted early in this new Congress and compare the costs in that bill \nwith all of the bipartisan tax relief that they criticize.\n  In other words, compare this here, what happened in 2 weeks, with \nwhat happened over a period of 5 or 6 years of deficit reduction. The \npartisan stimulus bill's costs exceed that of the bipartisan tax \nrelief.\n  As we examine President Obama's first budget, let's take a cue from \nhis speech Tuesday night. Let's make deficit reduction a priority and \nlet's do it in an intellectually honest fashion. A lot of fiscal damage \nwas done in the stimulus bill enacted a few days ago. That is not so of \nwhat was assigned to the years 2009 and 2010, but what was assigned way \nout into the future years, as if somehow the stimulus bill were a \nplatform for the subterfuge of getting things done in 2 weeks that \nought to have the very crafty look-see that goes on in the very \nsophisticated appropriation process between April and September, \nweighing one priority against another priority.\n  As we proceed, then, to write a budget in a couple of weeks, let's do \nit in an intellectually honest manner. Let's take off the political \nblinders and deal with the cold, hard fiscal facts. Let's be realistic \nabout expiring tax relief, its merits, its economic growth effect. That \nis shown by that one chart where the deficit went down an extreme \namount, even though we had cut taxes, which I know to most people \nsounds as though it can't happen. If you reduce tax rates, you have to \nreduce revenue. If you raise tax rates, you are going to bring more in. \nBut I think our history over the last 6 years shows that you can reduce \ntaxes and still reduce deficits.\n  Let's take off the political blinders and deal with cold, hard fiscal \nfacts. Let's be realistic about expiring tax relief, its merits, its \neconomic growth effect and its political popularity. Let's sharpen our \npencils, get out our yellow notepads and rev up our calculators as we \nconsider new nominally temporary spending or tax cuts. We owe it to the \nAmerican people who send us here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/26/senate-section/article/S2547-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2547-S2549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMEMORATING THE ROLE OF ENSLAVED AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CONSTRUCTION OF \n                              THE CAPITOL\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on an issue \nI have certainly followed for many years now in the Senate and one I am \nproud to have brought to some conclusion along the way, particularly \nlast evening.\n  Many people look at history and see that when the Capitol was first \nbuilt in the late 1700s to early 1800s, enslaved African Americans \nworked in all facets of its construction--carpentry, masonry, carting, \nrafting, roofing, plastering, glazing, painting, and sawing. But for \nalmost 200 years, the story of these slave laborers was not told and \nwas basically unknown, I would imagine to almost everyone who visited \nand worked in the Capitol every day.\n  In July of 2000, I sponsored a resolution to establish a special task \nforce to recommend an appropriate recognition for the slave laborers \nwho worked on the construction of this great building--the U.S. \nCapitol--our symbol of freedom in this country. My cosponsor on this \neffort was then Senator Spencer Abraham from Michigan, and so the \nresolution became known as the Abraham-Lincoln resolution back then.\n  The bicameral, bipartisan Slave Labor Task Force brought together \nhistorians and interested officials to work on this issue. One of those \nwas Curtis Sykes, an educator and native of North Little Rock, AR, and \nan original member of Arkansas' Black History Advisory Committee. Mr. \nSykes passed away before our work was complete, but he made so many \nimportant contributions to the task force before his\n\n[[Page S2548]]\n\npassing. He was then ably succeeded by Ms. Sarah Jean Davidson, founder \nand president of the Association for the Preservation of North Little \nRock, Arkansas African American History.\n  I am so very grateful to these two individuals who have offered their \ninsight and their expertise and their input to make sure that what we \ndid here was done in a very special way in great recognition.\n  In 2007, the task force presented the congressional leadership with \nrecommendations on how to best recognize the contribution of these \nenslaved workers. The recommendations were developed with the \ninvaluable assistance of a working group that included the historians \nand curators of the Senate, House, and Office of the Architect of the \nCapitol, representatives from the AOC Project Management Division, and \nrepresentatives from the Capitol Visitor Center.\n  Since then, we have been working so very hard to see that these \nrecommendations are all realized. We have developed a history of slave \nlaborers in the construction of the Capitol and put it online. We have \nensured that the story of these slave laborers was incorporated into \nthe CVC orientation video and Capitol tour guide training. We have seen \nthe publication of a book on Black Americans in Congress, and we have \nseen the reception area of the CVC named Emancipation Hall.\n  On Monday, I, along with my good friend and colleague Senator \nChambliss, introduced a resolution to bring another recommendation to \nfruition. This resolution, which was approved by the Senate last night, \nauthorizes a plaque to be placed in the Capitol, a plaque that \nidentifies a very special feature of the Capitol. The original exterior \nwall of the Capitol was constructed between 1793 and 1807. The stones \nfor that wall were mined by slave laborers in a sandstone quarry in \nAquia Creek in Stafford County, VA.\n  Quarrying stone was among the most difficult and backbreaking tasks \nin the building business. First, the land had to be cleared, then the \ntop of the stone chipped away to reach the parts that had not been \ndamaged by frost or vegetation. Then the stone would be further chipped \nto create a small cavity, just large enough for one man to work in. The \nmen would work in these small cavities to cut grooves and hammer in \niron wedges to split the stone to free it from the larger block. To \nmake matters worse, the quarries were located on an isolated, snake-\ninfested island that swarmed with mosquitoes in the blazing summer and \nfroze under snow in winter.\n  Much of the original Capitol no longer stands, due to the fires of \nwar and renovations to create more space. The original East exterior \nwall still exists, however, and is now part of the East Front Corridor. \nIt is one of the few places where that original slave-quarried \nsandstone is still in evidence. The plaque would be placed near that \nwall, and would bear an inscription identifying the wall as having been \nbuilt of sandstone quarried by enslaved African Americans who were an \nimportant part, a vital part of the labor force that built our great \nU.S. Capitol.\n  Thanks to my Slave Labor Task Force colleague Congressman John Lewis, \nthere will be a similar plaque on the House side of the East Front \nCorridor. These locations are important for another reason. They are on \nthe route that visitors take to the Senate and House galleries. Mr. \nSykes, as I mentioned earlier, the Arkansas historian with whom I \nworked, focused on the need to ensure that as many citizens as possible \nbe made aware of this contribution of enslaved African Americans in the \nbuilding of this great building, our Capitol. I wholeheartedly agree \nwith Mr. Sykes. To me, education is at the heart of this effort. It \nwould do no good to have a plaque that was hidden in a corner where no \none would see it. It would do no good if we told the story of enslaved \nAfrican Americans building the Capitol and no one heard it.\n  A critical part of recognizing the work of the slaves is to make \ntheir story visible and accessible, so that future generations know and \nunderstand the sacrifices that have been made for the many blessings \nthat we enjoy today, that those blessings that are capsulized in the \nvery building in which we all work, that the freedoms and the rights \nthat we enjoy, are capsulized in a building that had tremendous input \nfrom enslaved African Americans.\n  I was recently in the new CVC and I hope, for those Members who have \nnot been, they will go visit and certainly for those of our \nconstituents who visit this great Capitol of the Nation, that they get \na chance to visit the Visitors Center. I watched the faces of dozens of \nschoolchildren as their mouths opened up, dropped in awe at the sight \nof this vast and beautiful Emancipation Hall. Their eyes popped open \nwide as they looked through the skylight and saw this gorgeous view of \nthe dome of the Capitol that represents who they are and the great \nNation to which they belong.\n  They were so excited about being there, and that excitement opened \ntheir minds to the lessons that would be taught to them, there in that \nvisitors center--like the Statue of Freedom that was designed by an \nItalian and sent over here and yet could not be reconstructed until the \ningenuity and the dedicated focus of, yes, an enslaved African American \nby the name of Philip Reid could figure out how to unhook the model \nthat the Italians had sent us, cast it, and put it piece by piece back \ntogether. No one else could figure it out.\n  As you walk into Emancipation Hall and you see this huge statue, the \ncaste of the Statue of Freedom, what an unbelievable feeling it gives, \nnot just to schoolchildren, but to any American who walks in there. How \nimportant for them to know of the ingenuity, the hard work, the labor \nthat went into this incredible building.\n  Through this effort I wanted to make sure that everyone who visits \nthe Capitol leaves knowing the story of the people who helped to build \nit, a true symbol of freedom, at a time when they themselves were not \nfree.\n  I want to close, first, by saying again a very special thanks to my \nfriend and colleague Senator Chambliss from Georgia who has worked with \nus on this resolution--we were so excited and pleased to see it pass \nlast night--as well as the chairman of the Rules Committee, Senator \nSchumer, and the distinguished ranking member of the committee, Senator \nBennett, for also sponsoring the legislation with Senator Chambliss and \nmyself. They were all so good to work with on this resolution. I \nappreciate their efforts and emphasis on something I believe is very \nimportant, not just for the Capitol but for our entire Nation.\n  I also want to publicly thank and recognize my good friend and former \ncolleague Congressman John Lewis for his leadership on this project. He \nis an extraordinary human being. I have been grateful for the \nopportunity to work with him on this very important issue.\n  I never will forget, when I arrived in the House of Representatives \nas a young single woman in 1993, Congressman Lewis invited a small \ngroup of us freshmen--it was the largest freshman class since the \n1940s, I believe--anyway, he invited us to come view some of his \nfootage and film from days during the 1960s, and all of what he endured \nbefore that. It was amazing--the freedom ride, all of what he had \nexperienced. It was a tremendous opportunity for me to get to know him \nbetter. I am grateful, again, for his extraordinary leadership.\n  I hope everyone, as I said, will take the opportunity to go to the \nCVC if they have not already and take a look and hopefully burn in each \nof our hearts how important it is to remember every day when we come to \nthis unbelievable building what it stands for; hopefully relighting and \nrekindling our ability to unite, to work together for the great things \nthis wonderful Nation stands for. I appreciate so much everyone working \ntogether to make this possibility a reality. I am very excited.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention. I yield the floor to my \ngood friend and colleague from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of S. Res. 53 \nwhich commemorates the role of slaves in constructing the U.S. Capitol. \nWhat a great historical revelation and statement my colleague from \nArkansas has made. This is one of those moments when the Senate has an \nopportunity to shine, because we have a chance to look back at \nhistorical facts that may\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\nnot have been pretty, as we look back on it, but are a part of our \nhistory. I want to tell her how much I appreciate her leadership on \nthis--not just this particular resolution, but on this overall issue. \nShe has been a true champion. Her leadership in her caucus has meant an \nawful lot to a number of people, particularly those of us who come from \nthe South.\n  She mentioned my good friend John Lewis, my colleague, the dean of \nour delegation. What a great American John Lewis is. I have the \nopportunity every year at the Martin Luther King birthday celebration \nto take the podium with John Lewis at Ebenezer Baptist Church and to \nrecollect and reminisce about some of those times that may not have \nbeen pleasant but, again, they are part of our history. John Lewis \ncertainly lived that history and the great story of his contribution to \nAmerica--his having gone through what he went through--is why we all \nhave such admiration for him.\n  It is one of the great, sad ironies of American history that the very \nfoundation of this building in which we have debated essential \nquestions of liberty and even decided who was free and who was not, was \nlaid by those who wore shackles. We do not know that much about them. \nIn the scant records that were kept, only a few first names survive \nnext to those of their owners, and the sums paid for their backbreaking \nwork. But we do know this. They toiled in the hot Sun and the cold wind \nin the quarries of Virginia and Maryland to unearth the stone upon \nwhich rests this temple of liberty.\n  From 1793 to 1826, as many as 800 slaves at any one time painted, \nroofed, sawed, glazed, and perfected a building that represented a \nfreedom that was never to be theirs and, in an irony of ironies, as the \nCivil War tore this country asunder over the very issue of human \nliberty, a slave laborer named Philip Reid cast the Statue of Freedom \nthat now crowns this very building.\n  Uncredited and unsung, slaves carved and polished the three-story-\nhigh marble columns that grace Statuary Hall, a soaring backdrop where \nso many of us earlier this week debated and discussed the first \ncongressional speech of this Nation's first Black President. How far we \nhave come in this period of history in our country.\n  We can never pay these laborers their due but we can, even belatedly, \nrecognize their significant contributions.\n  This resolution authorizes a plaque to be placed near the original \nEast Front wall of the Capitol, one of the few places their handiwork \nis still visible, to acknowledge the role and contributions enslaved \nAfrican-American laborers played in the evolution of this building and, \nby extension, this democracy.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Arkansas and commend her once again \nfor her leadership. She and I have worked on so many issues in a strong \nand bipartisan way. Without her leadership we would not be here now.\n  I thank all my colleagues for their unanimous approval of this \nresolution.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nLincoln's legislation to recognize the role of enslaved African \nAmericans in the construction of the Capitol. Every day, America's \nlawmakers walk the marble halls of the U.S. Capitol, but we seldom \nreflect upon the struggles of those who constructed this esteemed \nbuilding. America was founded on the idea that all of its people should \nbe free, yet throughout our history, we have struggled against the \ninfluence of racism and ignorance. We cannot brush over the impact of \nslavery on the history of our Nation. By acknowledging the role of \nenslaved African Americans in the construction of the U.S. Capitol, we \nare one step closer to healing the racial wounds that remain in our \nsociety.\n  Throughout America, children's textbooks are filled with information \nabout the Founders of our Republic, but they mention little or nothing \nabout the enslaved African Americans who helped build the Capitol. Many \nfacts about the lives of these people are lost in history, but \ndocuments from the time help us put together a partial picture of what \ntheir lives were like. The enslaved African Americans who constructed \nthis building were rented by the Government from their owners. Between \n1795 and 1801, more than 380 payments were made to slave owners for the \nuse of their slaves in the construction of the Capitol. Slaves \nperformed a variety of tasks, including mining, stone and timber \nsawing, bricklaying, and carpentry. They mined the stone used in \nconstructing the section of the Capitol where this plaque will be \ndisplayed in the Aquia Creek sandstone quarry in Stafford County, VA, \nand the Montgomery County marble quarry in Maryland.\n  Our Nation has made tremendous progress since the days when a slave \nwas valued as three-fifths of a person, but though the days of slave \nauctions and forced servitude are behind us, our work is not finished. \nTo date, only six African Americans have served in the U.S. Senate. \nAmerica's first two African American Senators, Hiram Revels and Blanche \nBruce, served the State of Mississippi in the 1870s. It was not until \n1967, nearly a century later, that America's third African American \nSenator, Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, came to Washington. Carol \nMoseley Braun of Illinois made history in 1993 when she became the \nfirst and only African American woman to serve in the Senate. In 2005, \nBarack Obama, also of Illinois, became the fifth African American to \nserve in the Senate, followed by Roland Burris.\n  President Obama's inauguration this year stands as one of the \ngreatest achievements in the history of civil rights in this country. \nMany doubted that the United States would ever elect an African \nAmerican President, but I am certain that while President Obama is the \nfirst African American to win the Presidency, he will not be the last.\n  Recognizing the role of enslaved African Americans in the building of \nthe U.S. Capitol is important to coming to terms with our past and \novercoming the tragic history of slavery in our Nation. This plaque \nstands as a reminder of how far we have come since the days of slavery \nand how far we still need to go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/26/senate-section/article/S2549-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2549-S2550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MANNY ROSSMAN\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to say farewell \nto the head of my whip office staff, Manny Rossman.\n  By some standards, Manny has had a relatively brief career in \nCongress. But anyone who knows Manny knows that he has been an \nindispensable staff member from the very beginning.\n  Manny started his career on the Hill as an intern, like so many \nothers. He was lucky his internship was with then-Congressman Bill \nArcher, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Manny was not \nany ordinary intern, however. He quickly moved from opening mail and \nanswering phones to working on substantive legislative issues. Clearly, \nBill Archer saw the promise of this very special intern.\n  Following his internship, Manny went off to law school at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Manny was president of the Penn Law \nRepublicans and a member of the Federalist Society. He graduated in \n1999.\n  His time in law school was very successful, and he could have easily \nmade his way to Wall Street for a career there or elsewhere. But the \npull of public policy and public service brought him to Washington, DC. \nAfter he graduated from law school, Manny accepted a job with then-\nCongressman Phil Crane.\n  Congressman Crane was a senior member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, which gave Manny the opportunity to work on the leading tax \nand trade issues of the day. These issues are central to our economic \nhealth as a nation, and Manny made them a top priority. Manny quickly \nbecame a trusted adviser to Congressman Crane, working on such landmark \nissues as the law that repealed the FSC/ETI tax benefit and replaced it \nwith a deduction designed to encourage domestic manufacturing activity. \nHe also worked on enactment of trade promotion authority and multiple \nfree trade agreements.\n  After Phil Crane left the House, Manny made his way across Capitol \nHill to the Senate, where he became Senator Trent Lott's key staff \nperson on the Finance Committee. That is where I first met Manny and, \nmore importantly, where Manny met his future bride. At that time, \nJennifer Vesey was handling health care issues on the Finance Committee \nfor our then-colleague Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. Who knew \nthat the Deficit Reduction Act could be so romantic?\n\n[[Page S2550]]\n\n  While working on Finance Committee issues, Manny helped the Senate \nenact a landmark pension reform bill, the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, and the extension of the 15-percent tax rate for capital \ngains and dividends through the end of 2010. Following the devastation \nof Hurricane Katrina, Manny worked night and day to help Mississippi \nand the entire gulf coast region begin the long road to recovery \nthrough the establishment of the Gulf Opportunity Zone, or so-called GO \nZone.\n  Trent Lott was elected the Republican whip in late 2006, and to no \none's surprise, he asked Manny to become his whip office chief of \nstaff. Working with Trent Lott, Manny built a highly effective whip \norganization. At the same time, he developed countless relationships \nwith other Senate leadership offices, with House leadership offices, \nand with the administration that to this day facilitate the smooth \noperation of the entire legislative process.\n  When Trent Lott retired at the end of 2007 and I was elected whip by \nmy colleagues, I knew the key to an effortless transition was Manny \nRossman. I am grateful that Manny agreed to stay with the whip \noperation through my first year. I very much appreciate the advice and \nthe counsel he has given me during this time. I agree with Trent Lott \nthat there is something about ``the magic of Manny'' that makes him \nsuch an effective and delightful addition to our whip team.\n  We will all miss him very much. We thank him for his service to the \nSenate, to the Congress, and to the country, and we wish him farewell \nand Godspeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to echo the remarks of my good \nfriend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, about our friend Manny Rossman, who \nhas never worked directly for me, but I say to the Senator from \nArizona, he has such a great sense of teamwork that even though Manny \nwas working first for Senator Lott and then for Senator Kyl, you had \nthe feeling that the two offices were sort of a seamless web. The \ncredit for that, in addition to the principal, I think goes to Manny, \nwho had a great sense of the importance of cooperating, working \ntogether, making the leader's office and the whip's office really one. \nHis personality, his brilliance, his ability to interact with people is \nreally unsurpassed.\n  So I join my friend from Arizona and congratulate Manny for his great \nservice to America in the Senate. I know he will have a hugely \nsuccessful post-Senate career. We are going to miss him, but we wish \nhim well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/26/senate-section/article/S2550-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO FIRST LIEUTENANT JOHN V. SCANLAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues a letter I have written to a family in Kentucky that is \ngoing to have a very special ceremony. Tomorrow, February 27, in \nLouisville, KY, the family of 1LT John V. Scanlan will receive on his \nbehalf the Prisoner of War Medal.\n  Lieutenant Scanlan, of Louisville, served in the U.S. Army Air Corps \nin World War II and was lost in 1945 when he was shot down over Japan. \nNow, more than 60 years later, he will be honored for the full extent \nof his valiant service to this Nation.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me in sending our thoughts and prayers \nto the family of 1LT John V. Scanlan on their very important day. We \nmust let them know that their sacrifice will always be revered by our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, the letter reads as follows:\n\n       Dear Catherine Wiggins and members of the Scanlan family,\n       It is never too late to honor bravery and sacrifice. That's \n     why you have my respect and gratitude today as you accept the \n     Prisoner of War Medal for First Lieutenant John V. Scanlan.\n       On June 23, 1945, Lieutenant Scanlan climbed aboard his P-\n     51 Mustang aircraft and set out from Iwo Jima for what would \n     be his final mission. Only later would his family learn about \n     that mission's terrible end. I cannot imagine your family's \n     horror at learning what happened to a good and brave man at \n     the hands of the enemy.\n       And yet that was not the end of your family's service to \n     America. John's two brothers also wore their country's \n     uniform. One of them, Colonel Joseph William Scanlan of the \n     U.S. Air Force, was a career officer who raised his family \n     all over the world. And his daughter Catherine remembers the \n     trips to Arlington Cemetery on Veterans Day, when her father \n     would tell her about the Uncle Jack she never knew.\n       Those who receive the Prisoner of War Medal set an example \n     of courage and patriotism that inspires us all. Through \n     unspeakable conditions, they uphold their oath to defend \n     America with honor and dignity. You have always known of \n     Lieutenant Scanlan's heroism from stories passed down through \n     generations. With this ceremony, his fellow citizens will \n     know it too.\n       First Lieutenant John V. Scanlan flies a different mission \n     now. He served his country with pride, and has earned his \n     well-deserved peace. Our nation cannot be grateful enough for \n     his immense sacrifice. May God bless him, and may He continue \n     to bless your wonderful family.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mitch McConnell,\n     United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/26/senate-section/article/S2550-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2550-S2551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, yesterday marked the 139th anniversary of \nthe seating of Hiram Rhodes Revels, as a United States Senator from the \nState of Mississippi. He was the first African-American to serve as a \nU.S. Senator.\n  Senator Revels was born in Fayetteville, NC. His father was a Baptist \npreacher, his mother was of Scottish descent. He moved north to \ncomplete his education at Beech Grove Quaker Seminary in Liberty, IN. \nIn 1862, Hiram Revels recruited soldiers to serve in the Union Army and \nbecame Chaplain for a Black regiment in Mississippi.\n  Senator Revels began his political career after the war as an \nalderman in Natchez, MS. In 1869, he won a seat in the reconstructed \nMississippi State Senate. One of the primary tasks of the newly elected \nState senate was to fill U.S. Senate seats in preparation for the \nState's return to the Union. In 1870, the new Mississippi State \nLegislature elected Hiram Revels to fill a term due to expire in 1871.\n  During his service in the United States Senate he worked on education \nissues. Upon his return to Mississippi, he became the first president \nof Alcorn State University.\n  During Black History Month it is appropriate that Hiram Rhodes Revels \nbe remembered for his leadership and significant contributions to \nMississippi and our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Biographical history \nof Mr. Revels and a New York Times article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Revels, Hiram Rhodes, a Senator from Mississippi; born in \n     Fayetteville, Cumberland County, NC, on September 27, 1827; \n     attended Beech Grove Quaker Seminary in Liberty, Ind., Darke \n     County Seminary in Ohio, and Knox College, Galesburg, Ill.; \n     barber; ordained a minister in the African Methodist \n     Episcopal Church at Baltimore, Md., in 1845; carried on \n     religious work in Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, \n     Tennessee, and Missouri; accepted a pastorate in Baltimore, \n     Md., in 1860; at the outbreak of the Civil War assisted in \n     recruiting two regiments of African American troops in \n     Maryland; served in Vicksburg, Miss., as chaplain of a Negro \n     regiment, and organized African American churches in that \n     State; established a school for freedmen in St. Louis, Mo., \n     in 1863; after the war, served in churches in Kansas, \n     Kentucky and Louisiana before settling in Natchez, Miss., in \n     1866; elected alderman in 1868; member, Mississippi State \n     senate 1870; elected as a Republican to the United States \n     Senate; presented his credentials upon the readmission of \n     Mississippi to representation on February 23, 1870; took the \n     oath of office on February 25, 1870, after the Senate \n     resolved a challenge to his credentials, and served from \n     February 23, 1870 until March 3, 1871; first African American \n     Senator; secretary of State ad interim of Mississippi in \n     1873; president of Alcorn University (formerly Oakland \n     College), Rodney, Miss., 1871-1874, 1876-1882; moved to Holly \n     Springs, Marshall County, Miss., and continued his religious \n     work; editor, Southwestern Christian Advocate, official \n     newspaper of A.M.E. Church 1876-1882; in retirement after \n     1882, taught theology at Shaw University, Holly Springs, \n     Miss.; died from a paralytic stroke in Aberdeen, Miss., \n     January 16, 1901; interment in Hill Crest Cemetery, Holly \n     Springs, Miss.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 25, 1870]\n\n         The Colored Member Admitted to His Seat in the Senate\n\n       Washington, Feb. 25--. Mr. Revels, the colored Senator from \n     Mississippi, was sworn in and admitted to his seat this \n     afternoon at 4:40 o'clock. There was not an inch of standing \n     or sitting room in the galleries, so densely were they \n     packed; and to say that the interest was intense gives but a \n     faint idea of the feeling which prevailed throughout the \n     entire proceeding. Mr. Vickers, of Maryland, opened the \n     debate to-day, arguing against the admission, on the ground \n     that Revels had not been a citizen for nine years, and \n     therefore was not eligible. Mr. Wilson followed on the other \n     side, and was succeeded by Mr. Casserly, who took a new \n     departure and arraigned the entire reconstruction policy, \n     charging that all the Southern Senators were put in their \n     seats by the force of the bayonets of the regular army. This \n     aroused Mr. Drake to a white heat, and provoked him to utter \n     remarks and to make personal allusions to Mr. Casserly which \n     were certainly in bad taste, and in no way pertinent to the \n     subject before the body. Mr. Sumner made the closing speech \n     for the Republican side of the question. It was brief, pithy \n     and eloquent. Then came Mr. Stockton in deference of his \n     party. He was boisterous and commonplace, and his speech was \n     much better suited to the stump than to the Senate. He argued\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\n     in favor of his motion to refer the credentials to the \n     Judiciary Committee, which was promptly negatived by a party \n     vote. The question was then put on the admission, which was \n     passed by the same strict drawing of the party lines. Only \n     one thing remained, which was that the first colored Senator \n     elect should advance to the Speaker's desk and be sworn. The \n     Vice-President made the announcement to the galleries that \n     all demonstrations of approval or disapproval would be \n     promptly suppressed. There had been through the debate one or \n     two such demonstrations, once from the Republican side, when \n     Mr. Scott, in reply to Mr. Bayard, declared that he abandoned \n     the Democratic Party when it raised its hand in rebellion, \n     and again when Mr. Stockton prophesied that the Democracy \n     would soon control national affairs. In view of these facts, \n     Mr. Colfax's announcement was somewhat necessary. When the \n     Vice-President uttered the words, ``The Senator elect will \n     now advance and take the oath,'' a pin might have been heard \n     drop. But as Senator Wilson rose in his seat and stepped to \n     the lounge immediately behind his desk, where Mr. Revels was \n     sitting, to escort that gentleman to the Speaker's desk, the \n     galleries rose to their feet, that they might miss no word or \n     lose no glimpse of what was being enacted below. The ceremony \n     was short. Mr. Revels showed no embarrassment whatever, and \n     his demeanor was as dignified as could be expected under the \n     circumstances. The abuse which had been poured upon him and \n     on his race during the last two days might well have shaken \n     the nerves of any one. The vast throng in the galleries \n     showed no sign of feeling one way or the other, and left very \n     quietly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/26/senate-section/article/S2554-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LARRY H.

Miller.\n  On Friday, February 20, 2009, Larry H. Miller quietly passed away in \nhis home with his beloved wife and family by his side. At the age of \n64, by all estimates, Larry left this earth way too early. His body had \nbeen ravaged over the past year with various medical maladies resulting \nfrom complications of Type 2 Diabetes. Yet, even though his body was \nphysically depleted, his fighting spirit and pragmatic wisdom continued \nuntil his very last breath. I do not think anyone was really prepared \nto lose this mighty man.\n  Larry came from humble beginnings. His life story exemplified from \nstart to finish the true American dream. By all accounts his education \nand intelligence was not honed in a classroom, but in the workplace of \nour nation. Through odd jobs and a beginning career as an auto parts \nstock boy, he quickly graduated to owning his first car dealership with \na business deal struck in an afternoon visit with an old acquaintance.\n  Larry's business acumen was legendary. The risks he took were \nenormous and the decisions he made on a daily basis would stifle even \nthe most experienced business leader. However, because of the risks he \nwas willing to take and the business decisions he had the courage to \nmake, the impact he left in every corner of our State cannot be \noverstated.\n  From the days of his first car enterprise, his empire grew to include \nmany car dealerships, movie theaters, restaurants, television and radio \nstations, a first-class sports arena, a race track, sports memorabilia \nand apparel stores, a professional baseball team, and of course, our \ncherished Utah Jazz.\n  His professional life was punctuated by hard work, ingenuity, and \ngood old-fashioned common sense. He was a man who wore many hats, and \nwore them well. He was plain spoken, and very direct in sharing his \nthoughts and opinions. He did not live a life of flash, but one of more \nhumble trappings. I cannot think of Larry without picturing him at so \nmany events, no matter the importance, in his trademark casual pants \nand golf shirt. He was a man who lived by his own creed, and never let \nanyone else define him.\n  The relationships he developed, and consequently shared with Utah, \nhave brushed our community with great color. Karl Malone, John \nStockton, Jerry Sloan, Deron Williams, Thurl Bailey, Mark Eaton, and \nJeff Hornacek are only a few people Larry befriended, hired, and \nmentored who have provided many hours of great sports entertainment to \nfans across the country. I know that personalities from time to time \nwould clash, but at the end of the day Larry, and those who worked for \nor played for him, shared a mutual respect and love not often found in \nprofessional sports today.\n  Larry not only contributed mightily to Utah's business climate, he \nalso served in so many ways to improve the lives of people from all \nwalks of life. His sense of community, and love for our State, were \nfelt by all who came into contact with him. He did so many generous \nacts of service for his fellow man, quietly and behind the scenes, \nwhich most will never know occurred. He believed in people, and he \nloved helping many find the right path to follow.\n  Larry Miller will forever be remembered for his business empire and \nleadership skills, but perhaps his greatest contribution was in the \nwalls of his own home. He loved and cherished his wife of 48 years, \nGail, as well as his five children, 21 grandchildren, and one great-\ngrandchild. He tutored them in the ways of business, but more \nimportantly, in the love of family. As he began facing later years, \nLarry was quoted on many occasions stating his renewed desire to be the \nkind of husband, father, and grandfather he wanted to be. Within hours \nof Larry passing away, Gail and their children held a news conference \npraising the man they had known and loved. Their strength in his \npassing, I believe came from the love and care Larry had bestowed on \neach of them throughout his life.\n  Utah lost a great man, and I lost a treasured friend. Throughout the \nyears of my service in the United States Senate I would often look to \nLarry Miller for his wisdom and strength. He was a rare person to find \nin the political world, someone who worked for the good of our State \nand its people, instead of furthering his own ambitions. He wanted to \nbe remembered for his ``love of Utah.'' And anyone who crossed paths \nwith Larry can attest to his passion and love for our great State.\n  Perhaps Larry H. Miller's life can best be summarized in his own \nwords quoted in the Deseret News this week. He said, ``You know, I \ndon't want this to sound boastful, but I really have had an \nextraordinary life.'' Yes, Larry did live an extraordinary life and I \nhonor him for the contributions he made to Utah, its citizens, and most \nimportantly to his family. His influence will never be forgotten, and \nhis example will be followed by generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/26/senate-section/article/S2554-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2554-S2555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL EYE DONOR MONTH\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Eye Bank \nAssociation of America, the Georgia Eye Bank, and the recognition of \nMarch as National Eye Donor Month.\n  Eye banks today provide for more than 50,000 corneal grafts for \ntransplantation each year. In Georgia alone, citizens donated enough \nocular tissue to provide over 1,200 corneas to their fellow Georgians. \nThe generosity of these donors allows for better eye care and the gift \nof improved sight for those lucky enough to receive transplants.\n  The Eye Bank Association of America is the oldest transplant \nassociation in the United States and has restored sight to nearly 1 \nmillion individuals. The association was created in 1955 when 12 eye \nbanks formed with the American Academy of Ophthalmology and \nOtolaryngology. Since 1961, more than 600,000 corneal transplants have \nbeen performed, restoring the sight of men, women, and children ranging \nfrom 9 days to 107 years old. This year, I am proud to commend Dr. \nBruce Varnum, chair of the Eye Bank Association of America, from my \nhome State of Georgia, for his excellent service and commitment to \nadvancing eye transplantation and donation.\n  Corneal blindness can develop from a variety of diseases, injuries, \nor infections. These transplants have over a 90 percent success rate \nand give renewed hope for those in need of a new beginning.\n  Despite these encouraging numbers, many Americans are still left \nwaiting in the dark. I urge my colleagues and all Americans to consider \nbecoming eye donors to allow for the miracle of sight that so many of \nus take for granted. By working with the National Eye Banks Association \nand local eye\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\nbanks, we involve ourselves in the selfless and kindhearted spirit that \ndefines the American people. The role of eye donors is paramount in \nassisting those who have tragically lost the ability to see.\n  Mr. President, lawmakers have recognized March as National Eye Donor \nMonth since President Reagan proclaimed the first one in 1983 and I am \nhonored on behalf of the residents of Georgia and those throughout the \ncountry to recognize March as National Eye Donor Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/26/senate-section/article/S2555-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2555-S2556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My fiance and I bought a home in Caldwell in May and we \n     moved out of his parents' home. While living with his \n     parents, we paid rent and part of the bills. We knew, when we \n     moved, we would be fine. Unlike many people, we know how to \n     live within our means and stay below that mark in case of an \n     emergency--like the cost of gas increasing at such an \n     astronomical rate. His parents are a different story. They \n     are in the group that overextended themselves, got the big \n     house loan that any banker with common sense should have said \n     no to but gave them the loan anyway with an adjustable rate. \n     At the time, we knew if they gave up a couple of things (like \n     cable tv) they would make ends meet. That is far from the \n     truth now. In just a couple of months, gas has gone up and \n     affected every end of life. Food is now more expensive. Other \n     items like shampoo, cleaners, clothing, and medications have \n     increased too with no end in sight. Even if they gave up the \n     cable tv, drinking, smoking and anything extra, they can \n     barely make it now. Sometimes I feel guilty for moving out \n     and trying to create our own household and family. A child \n     should be able to move out, make it with a supposedly `living \n     wage job' (which is rare and far in-between in the state of \n     Idaho) and not have to either run back to the parents because \n     the economy has sunk to the black hole of doom or have the \n     parents move in with them because they are not capable of \n     supporting themselves in the same economy.\n       Congress needs to stop bickering and aggravating each other \n     and be adults--work together; otherwise those states they are \n     supposedly working for are going to crash and burn. I know it \n     is an election year and each party is trying to get their \n     person elected. I also know the economy goes into a dive \n     during said election year due to uncertainty about the next \n     president and possible outcome of policies and bills. I am \n     all for increasing domestic oil production if regulations are \n     put in affect to help `guide' the sales and thus restricting \n     gas and fuel from skyrocketing like it is. OPEC said it would \n     increase production yet oil futures increase on the stock \n     markets. This is getting out of hand and a small group of \n     people are profiting greatly while draining the hard earned \n     money from everyone. It will backfire and it will not be \n     pretty. Instead of fighting with the oil companies, tell them \n     fine, thanks for all the fish. Get new technology and \n     alternative fuel sources reved up. Stop the oil companies \n     from bullying smaller companies from developing new fuel \n     sources. Take the tax breaks from the oil companies and give \n     them to the companies who have proven examples of alternative \n     fuels and technology to work with said alternative fuels. \n     Give people who do not own one of those massive Hummers or \n     SUVs a tax break. Because those who bought the massive \n     Hummers and SUVs did not help the situation and they knew it. \n     I know it is unfair, but punishing those who used common \n     sense and chose the practical Ford Fusion over the Hummer \n     because they thought and realized that the Hummer was \n     overkill on the road is unfair too. I would say we need more \n     public transportation, but Idaho is not `public \n     transportation' friendly. What works in Seattle and Portland \n     would be a cosmic joke in this state. Our communities are \n     spread out to the point a public transportation system would \n     only work with the Star Trek shuttles or transporter. In \n     other words, it is not realistic. These are just my opinions \n     and a small drop of concern in a huge lake.\n     Krista.\n                                  ____\n\n       The price of gasoline is the cause of my debt going up. \n     With a family of 5, it is hard to cut back anymore than I \n     already have. My wife and I use our vehicles less than we \n     have in the past, but we still are finding it hard to make \n     ends meet due to the fact that when the price of gasoline \n     goes up so does the price of food, clothes, electricity, and \n     many other everyday necessities.\n       For a solution I cannot understand why the only car company \n     (that I know of) making a natural gas-fueled car is Honda \n     (Honda GX) and the only hydrogen car (that I know of) is made \n     by Honda (Honda FCX). I believe if there were easy access to \n     natural gas gas stations and easy access to hydrogen fuel \n     stations that the cost of the natural gas car and the \n     hydrogen car would be equal to the price that gasoline-\n     powered cars are. I keep hearing about how we need to start \n     drilling offshore for oil, but if we would use vehicles not \n     powered by gasoline, we would not need to do any offshore \n     drilling. I am sure there are inventors out there with ideas \n     for cars powered by something other than gasoline, besides \n     the natural gas and hydrogen, that are not being given the \n     opportunity to mass market their ideas. It looks to me like \n     we have chosen to be dependent on oil and that car companies \n     refuse to look for alternatives to gasoline powered cars. \n     Honda may be making the alternative fuel cars, but they are \n     not making the cars available to the masses, although Honda \n     does not build hydrogen or natural gas gas stations. Without \n     easy access to the fuel need for the hydrogen, natural gas, \n     and even the electric car then you are not truly giving the \n     consumer the opportunity to choose any car powered by \n     anything but gasoline.\n       Thanks for your time.\n     Jeff.\n                                  ____\n\n       I applaud your efforts to communicate with Idahoans in an \n     effort to gain an understanding of what we see on a daily \n     basis. Perhaps there are some politicians that still want to \n     feel the pulse of those who elect them. I am not an Idaho \n     resident, but spent most of my 30 years growing up and living \n     in the state. I now reside in Washington and more \n     specifically in the northern Puget Sound system.\n       When the increase in fuel prices became more than I could \n     justify I was faced with a decision to use our mass transit \n     system. I could not be more pleased with the level of service \n     offered. In comparison, many local areas in Southern Idaho do \n     not have a public transportation system that carries a \n     similar weight. With the increase in traffic in the treasure \n     valley one would think that a mass transit system would be a \n     logical solution. It benefits both economically and \n     environmentally make it a decision I believe is a must. What \n     future planning is in the works to create a suitable mass \n     transit system that would be utilized if any? I encourage the \n     use of a committee to explore more efforts for carpooling, \n     expanded bus systems, and light rail for a county connect \n     system. If you want to see a system that works, check out \n     Seattle, I believe we offer a very good solution for \n     transportation all around this region.\n       I encourage your continuing goal of thinking outside the \n     box for solutions to meeting the ever increasing energy \n     crisis facing Idaho. This should be a task all politicians \n     should be working together on.\n           Warm regards,\n     Nate, Marysville WA.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do appreciate the opportunity to ``sound off'' on the \n     energy issue. I am of the belief that Congress has been \n     delinquent in its responsibility to the United States \n     citizens. I agree that we need to work hard on sources of \n     energy that are less harmful to our environment; however, in \n     the short run, we need to provide for our needs.\n       I am not aware of any solution that will provide immediate \n     relief to the price of gasoline and diesel; however, it will \n     not get any better by talking about it for another 5 years. \n     If we had faced the problem 10 years ago, we would not have \n     the problem today.\n       We need to drill now and we need to do it everywhere there \n     are known deposits of oil. We need to be good stewards of the \n     land in the process (we do know how to do that) but we need \n     to provide for our own domestic needs.\n       Oil is a commodity, and like all commodities, the price \n     will fall as the supply increases. Whether it is Alaska, off \n     shore or the Rocky Mountain Shale oil, I believe we need to \n     pursue the development of these deposits, and the \n     construction of sufficient pipelines and refineries to \n     deliver the products to our citizens.\n       Thank you again for your request for input. I look forward \n     to seeing the Senate and House take positive long term steps \n     for the ``every day'' citizens of our nation.\n     Pete, Ontario, Oregon.\n                                  ____\n\n       Not too long ago (2\\1/2\\ years), I remember buying gasoline \n     for less than $2 a gallon. I drive a Honda Civic and also \n     have a Dodge Dakota that I use during the winter months when \n     four-wheel drive is needed to get up and down my mountain \n     road. I put the most miles on my Honda by far.\n       Buying gasoline at $4 a gallon has now become a major \n     monthly expense, requiring me to cut back spending in other \n     areas such as\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\n     eating out, vacations, purchasing household goods and home \n     improvements. While it is easy to blame the oil companies, I \n     do not feel that is fair. I believe a combination of \n     environmentalists, the media and [the] global warming myth \n     are more to blame. 31,000 scientists have gone on the record \n     to debunk the global warming myth yet it is still very much \n     alive in the media and being crammed into grade school \n     children's minds. The EPA has forced oil companies to produce \n     something like 19 different grades of unleaded gas. This is \n     ludicrous.\n       There is no significant manmade global warming. There has \n     not been any in the past, there is none now and there is no \n     reason to fear any in the future. The climate of Earth is \n     changing. It has always changed. But mankind's activities \n     have not overwhelmed or significantly modified the natural \n     forces. I believe there is a direct connection between global \n     warming and four dollar a gallon gas. Ethanol is not the \n     answer--it is just screwing up our food supply chain.\n     Anthony, Sandpoint.\n                                  ____\n\n       Energy costs have resulted in our doing without or not \n     going to some of the places we use to frequent. My wife and I \n     are on Social Security and therefore have a set income. We \n     are just not able to buy food and buy fuel for our vehicles. \n     We are hoping Congress will do the common sense thing and \n     ``drill here, drill now and pay less''. They simply must stop \n     catering to the environmentalists and do what is right for \n     America. As a senior member of the United States Senate, we \n     are asking you to not only do the things you say you are \n     going to do for the people of Idaho but be a leader and get \n     the Senate back to Conservatism.\n     Jerry and Teddi, Homedale.\n                                  ____\n\n       I was born and raised in Idaho and I live here still. It is \n     amazing how this state has changed in just the last 10 years.\n       The cost of fuel is insane. Raising the prices is not going \n     to replenish the world's natural resources. We need to \n     utilize the wind that blows nearly constantly through our \n     state, we need to open more ethanol plants in Idaho and ship \n     that fuel within Idaho. We need to give tax breaks to people \n     who add solar power to their homes/businesses. All government \n     buildings need to be solar powered.\n       The only way people are going to slow the destruction of \n     our planet is by changing to using hydro power, wind power, \n     solar power.\n       My family has resorted to sharing hot water to bathe and \n     not using the air conditioning unless absolutely necessary. \n     We have begun to ride bicycles to the grocery store to pick \n     up milk and bread because the fuel is too precious for a \n     small trip for the ever-necessary milk.\n       Idaho needs more 5 lane roads to get across the Treasure \n     Valley. Idaho needs better public transit. Idaho needs a \n     passenger train with stops from Caldwell, to Nampa, Kuna, \n     Star, Eagle, Meridian, Boise * * * and numerous stops in each \n     of those towns. Imagine with me for a moment * * * a train \n     system with branches and stops criss-crossing the Treasure \n     Valley, and then public buses with routes that cover the \n     areas that the train cannot go. You, Senator, could take the \n     train to a bus stop and catch a bus to the Statehouse! Just \n     think about the jobs that the buses would create, and the \n     trains * * * the traffic would be lighter on the interstate.\n       Treasure Valley also needs a belt route that take big \n     trucks out of the way. A route that starts south of Eiseman \n     Rd and travels west but stays south of Kuna and then heads \n     north to reconnect with I84 west of Caldwell. That would make \n     I84 through Ada and Canyon county safer to travel and again \n     reducing tons of congestion and traffic.\n       These are dreams that only you and your fellow elected \n     officials can make a reality! We voted for you so that you \n     will hear the voice of the people and do what we ask. You are \n     there working for the people that voted for you. Make a \n     difference. Make Idaho a self-sufficient, self-reliant state.\n     S.L.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am an independent small business owner. Since my profit \n     margins are tiny the high price of gas and diesel are causing \n     me to consider closing my business.\n       Drill here, drill now, build refineries now. Build nuclear \n     power plants now.\n     Val, Council.\n                                  ____\n\n       I think it is about time that Americans became aware of \n     their energy usage and excessive waste of a limited resource. \n     We should have been paying high fuel prices for many years \n     with a tax being used for research and support of alternative \n     technologies. Enhanced domestic production and expanded \n     refinery capacity is not the answer to a long term problem.\n     Bill, Hailey.\n                                  ____\n\n       Please do not vote in favor of lifting the offshore \n     drilling ban nor in favor of drilling in any wildlife refuge. \n     Supply is not the problem in this price run-up. New drilling \n     will only benefit those in a position to profit from the \n     further exclusive use of petroleum, not the average consumer.\n       We cannot undevelop wildlife areas, and it is impossible to \n     unspill oil. I grew up on the California coast, where \n     offshore drilling was underway. Certain beaches were \n     continually contaminated. We had to use, ironically, gasoline \n     to get the oil off our feet at the end of the day.\n       Again, please do not vote in favor of further drilling. \n     Please do encourage development of alternatives to petroleum. \n     Thank you.\n     Nancy, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       What I cannot understand is why our government is so blind \n     to how the price of fuel is affecting all of America. And \n     still the big oil companies are making huge profits, actually \n     obscene profits. I know their stockholders want to make a \n     profit--but at the expense of the entire economy?\n       Can you name one thing that you get that does not come by \n     truck? The airlines are dropping like flies. The average \n     driver can hardly afford to drive to work and essential \n     places, let alone extra driving.

Budgets \nare proposed that offer some new programs or eliminate an initiative, \nbut by and large continuity reigns.\n  Then there are the years that come along once in a generation, when \nwe look at where the country has been and recognize that we need a \nbreak from a troubled past, that the problems we face demand that we \nbegin charting a new path. This is one of those years.\n  We start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our \nlifetimes. Our economy is in a deep recession that threatens to be \ndeeper and longer than any since the Great Depression. More than three \nand a half million jobs were lost over the past 13 months, more jobs \nthan at any time since World War II. In addition, another 8.8 million \nAmericans who want and need full-time work have had to settle for part-\ntime jobs. Manufacturing employment has hit a 60-year low. Our capital \nmarkets are virtually frozen, making it difficult for businesses to \ngrow and for families to borrow money to afford a home, car, or college \neducation for their kids. Many families cannot pay their bills or their \nmortgage payments. Trillions of dollars of wealth have been wiped out, \nleaving many workers with little or nothing as they approach \nretirement. And millions of Americans are unsure about the future--if \ntheir job will be there tomorrow, if their children will be able to go \nto college, and if their grandchildren will be able to realize the full \npromise of America.\n  This crisis is neither the result of a normal turn of the business \ncycle nor an accident of history. We arrived at this point as a result \nof an era of profound irresponsibility that engulfed both private and \npublic institutions from some of our largest companies' executive \nsuites to the seats of power in Washington, D.C. For decades, too many \non Wall Street threw caution to the wind, chased profits with blind \noptimism and little regard for serious risks--and with even less regard \nfor the public good. Lenders made loans without concern for whether \nborrowers could repay them. Inadequately informed of the risks and \noverwhelmed by fine print, many borrowers took on debt they could not \nreally afford. And those in authority turned a blind eye to this risk-\ntaking; they forgot that markets work best when there is transparency \nand accountability and when the rules of the road are both fair and \nvigorously enforced. For years, a lack of transparency created a \nsituation in which serious economic dangers were visible to all too \nfew.\n  This irresponsibility precipitated the interlocking housing and \nfinancial crises that triggered this recession. But the roots of the \nproblems we face run deeper. Government has failed to fully confront \nthe deep, systemic problems that year after year have only become a \nlarger and larger drag on our economy. From the rising costs of health \ncare to the state of our schools, from the need to revolutionize how we \npower our economy to our crumbling infrastructure, policymakers in \nWashington\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\nhave chosen temporary fixes over lasting solutions.\n  The time has come to usher in a new era--a new era of responsibility \nin which we act not only to save and create new jobs, but also to lay a \nnew foundation of growth upon which we can renew the promise of \nAmerica.\n  This Budget is a first step in that journey. It lays out for the \nAmerican people the extent of the crisis we inherited, the steps we \nwill take to jumpstart our economy to create new jobs, and our plans to \ntransform our economy for the 21st Century to give our children and \ngrandchildren the fruits of many years of economic growth.\n  It is true that we cannot depend on government alone to create jobs \nor to generate long-term growth. Ours is a market economy, and the \nNation depends on the energy and initiative of private institutions and \nindividuals. But at this particular moment, government must lead the \nway in providing the short-term boost necessary to lift us from a \nrecession this severe and lay the foundation for future prosperity. \nThat's why immediately upon taking office, my Administration worked \nwith the Congress to pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. \nThis plan's provisions will put money in the pockets of the American \npeople, save or create at least three and a half million jobs, and help \nto revive our economy.\n  This moment is one of great paradox and promise: while there are \nmillions of Americans trying to find work, there is also so much work \nto be done. That's why the Recovery Act and our Budget will make long \noverdue investments in priorities--like clean energy, education, health \ncare, and a new infrastructure--that are necessary to keep us strong \nand competitive in the 21st Century.\n  To finally spark the creation of a clean energy economy, we will make \nthe investments in the next three years to double our Nation's \nrenewable energy capacity. We will modernize Federal buildings and \nimprove the energy efficiency of millions of American homes, saving \nconsumers and taxpayers billions on our energy bills. In the process, \nwe will put Americans to work in new jobs that pay well--jobs \ninstalling solar panels and wind turbines; constructing energy \nefficient buildings; manufacturing fuel efficient vehicles; and \ndeveloping the new energy technologies that will lead to even more jobs \nand more savings, putting us on the path toward energy independence for \nour Nation and a cleaner, safer planet in the process.\n  To improve the quality of our health care while lowering its cost, we \nwill make the immediate investments needed to computerize all of \nAmerica's medical records within five years while protecting the \nprivacy of patients. This is a necessary step to reducing waste, \neliminating red tape, and avoiding the need to repeat expensive medical \ntests. We also will fundamentally reform our health care system, \ndelivering quality care to more Americans while reducing costs for us \nall. This will make our businesses more competitive and ease a \nsignificant and growing burden middle-class families are bearing.\n  To give our children a fair shot to thrive in a global, information-\nage economy, we will equip thousands of schools, community colleges, \nand universities with 21st Century classrooms, labs, and libraries. \nWe'll provide new technology and new training for teachers so that \nstudents in Chicago and Boston can compete with kids in Beijing for the \nhigh-tech, high-wage jobs of the future. We will invest in innovation, \nand open the doors of college to millions of students. We will pursue \nnew reforms--lifting standards in our schools and recruiting, training, \nand rewarding a new generation of teachers. And in an era of \nskyrocketing college tuitions, we will make sure that the doors of \ncollege remain open to children from all walks of life.\n  To create a platform for our entrepreneurs and workers to build an \neconomy that can lead this future, we will begin to rebuild America for \nthe demands of the 21st Century. We will repair crumbling roads, \nbridges, and schools as well as expand broadband lines across America, \nso that a small business in a rural town can connect and compete with \nits counterparts anywhere in the world. And we will invest in the \nscience, research, and technology that will lead to new medical \nbreakthroughs, new discoveries, and entire new industries.\n  Regaining our economic strength also is critical to our national \nsecurity. It is a major source of our global leadership, and we must \nnot let it waver. That's why this Budget makes critical investments in \nrebuilding our military, securing our homeland, and expanding our \ndiplomatic efforts because to provide for the security of the United \nStates we need to use all elements of our power. Moreover, to honor the \nservice of those who have worn our military's uniform, we will make the \ninvestments necessary to take care of our veterans.\n  For these initiatives to lay a foundation for long-term economic \ngrowth, it's important that we not only change what Washington invests \nin, but how Washington does business. We must usher in a new era of \nresponsibility in which we empower citizens with the information they \nneed to hold their elected representatives accountable for the \ndecisions they make. We need to put tired ideologies aside, and ask not \nwhether our Government is too big or too small, or whether it is the \nproblem or the solution, but whether it is working for the American \npeople. Where it does not, we will stop spending taxpayer dollars; \nwhere it has proven to be effective, we will invest. This is the \napproach, for example, we have begun in allocating funds to education, \nhealth care, and national security. And as we continue the budgetary \nprocess, we will identify more cuts and reallocations for the full \nBudget presented this spring, and undertake efforts to reform how the \nprograms you fund are managed so that overruns are avoided, waste is \ncut, and you get the most effective and efficient Government possible.\n  In the little more than a month my Administration has had in office, \nwe have not had the time to fully execute all the budget reforms that \nare needed, and to which I am fully committed. Those will come in the \nmonths ahead, and next year's budget process will look much different.\n  But this Budget does begin the hard work of bringing new levels of \nhonesty and fairness to your Government. It looks ahead a full 10 \nyears, making good-faith estimates about what costs we would incur; and \nit accounts for items that under the old rules could have been left \nout, making it appear that we had billions more to spend than we really \ndo. The Budget also begins to restore a basic sense of fairness to the \ntax code, eliminating incentives for companies that ship jobs overseas \nand giving a generous package of tax cuts to 95 percent of working \nfamilies.\n  Finally, while we have inherited record budget deficits and needed to \npass a massive recovery and reinvestment plan to try to jump-start our \neconomy out of recession, we cannot lose sight of the long-run \nchallenges that our country faces and that threaten our economic \nhealth--specifically, the trillions of dollars of debt that we \ninherited, the rising costs of health care, and the growing obligations \nof Social Security. Therefore, while our Budget will run deficits, we \nmust begin the process of making the tough choices necessary to restore \nfiscal discipline, cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term \nin office, and put our Nation on sound fiscal footing.\n  Some may look at what faces our Nation and believe that America's \ngreatest days are behind it. They are wrong.\n  Our problems are rooted in past mistakes, not our capacity for future \ngreatness. We should never forget that our workers are more innovative \nand industrious than any on earth. Our universities are still the envy \nof the world. We are still home to the most brilliant minds, the most \ncreative entrepreneurs, and the most advanced technology and innovation \nthat history has ever known. And we are still the Nation that has \novercome great fears and improbable odds. It will take time, but we can \nbring change to America. We can rebuild that lost trust and confidence. \nWe can restore opportunity and prosperity. And we can bring about a new \nsense of responsibility among Americans from every walk of life and \nfrom every corner of the country.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \n                                    The White House, February 26, 2009.\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/26/senate-section/article/S2558-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 2(a) of the National Cultural Center Act (20 U.S.C. 76h(a)), \namended by Public Law 107-117, and the order of the House of January 6, \n2009, the Speaker appoints the following members of the House of \nRepresentatives to the Board of Trustees of the John F.

A bill to reauthorize the Select Agent Program by amending \nthe Public Health Service Act and the Agriculture Bioterrorism \nProtection Act of 2002 and to improve oversight of high containment \nlaboratories; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 485, the \nSelect Agent Program and Biosafety Improvement Act of 2009. Today, I \nreintroduced this important legislation with my friend Senator Ted \nKennedy. We first introduced this bill in June 2008. I thank my \ncolleague from Massachusetts for his partnership. I enjoyed working \nclosely with him in the 109th Congress on the Pandemic and All-Hazards \nPreparedness Act, which was signed into law in December 2006. He \ncontinues to be one of the great leaders in the United States Senate, \nand I look forward to continuing to work with him to ensure our laws \nprotect the American people from health threats of all kinds.\n  This bill will enhance our nation's biosecurity and improve the \nbiosafety of our most secure laboratories. We must do everything we can \nto make sure that biological agents and toxins that could present a \nserious threat to public health are kept safe and secure in containment \nlaboratories and out of the hands of terrorists.\n  In December 2008; 6 months after we introduced this legislation for \nthe first time, the bipartisan Commission on the Prevention of WMD \nProliferation and Terrorism reported it is ``more likely than not'' \nthat a weapon of mass destruction will be used in a terrorist attack by \nthe end of 2013. The Commission's report, World at Risk, found that \nterrorists are more likely to obtain and use a biological weapon than a \nnuclear weapon and, therefore, the U.S. government should make \nbioterrorism a higher priority. According to the report, ``Only by \nelevating the priority of the biological weapons threat will it be \npossible to bring about substantial improvements in global \nbiosecurity.'' Many of the specific recommendations contained in that \nreport are reflected in this legislation.\n  S. 485 achieves two overarching goals. First, it reauthorizes and \nimproves the Select Agent Program. This program was created in the \n1990s to control the transfer of certain dangerous biological agents \nand toxins that could be used for bioterrorism. The program expanded \nafter the anthrax attacks in 2001; however, the authorization expired \nat the end of September 2007.\n  Second, the bill evaluates and enhances the safety and oversight of \nhigh containment laboratories. These laboratories are used by \nscientists to study select agents and other infectious materials. Labs \nare categorized\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\nby their safety level. There are four levels, termed Biosafety Level--\nBSL--1 through 4, with 4 being the highest level. The number of these \nlabs has grown, both domestically and internationally, in the last \nseveral years.\n  The Select Agent Program is jointly administered by the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services HHS Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention--CDC--and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's--USDA--\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service--APHIS. The program was \nintended to prevent terrorism, and protect public and animal health and \nsafety, while not hampering important life-saving research. This is an \nobvious struggle that requires careful consideration, particularly when \nscience is rapidly advancing around the globe.\n  Under the USA PATRIOT Act, it is illegal to possess ``select agents'' \nfor reasons other than legitimate research. The Public Health Security \nand Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 further required \nlaboratories and laboratory personnel to undergo background checks by \nthe FBI prior to approval for possession of select agents. As of \nFebruary 2009, there are 82 select agents, meaning the agents pose a \nsevere threat to public or animal health and safety. Thirteen of these \nagents are found naturally in the United States. There are 336 entities \nand 10,463 individuals registered with the CDC to work with select \nagents and toxins, and 64 entities and 4,149 individuals registered \nwith APHIS.\n  We take four key actions in S. 485 to strengthen the Select Agent \nProgram.\n  First, our legislation reauthorizes the program through 2014 and \ncalls for a comprehensive evaluation of the program. The review, to be \nconducted by the National Academy of Sciences, will look at the effects \nof the program on international scientific collaboration and domestic \nscientific advances. This is timely because the WMD Commission recently \nsuggested the need for an interagency review of the Select Agent \nProgram and its impact on biological security and legitimate scientific \nresearch. Historically, the United States has been an international \nleader in biosecurity. In fact, last year Canada proposed legislation \nto tighten safety and access to pathogens and toxins of concern for \nbioterrorism. Canada's legislation, which was reintroduced earlier this \nmonth, would establish a mandatory licensing system to track human \npathogens, similar to our Select Agent Program. It also ensures \ncompliance with the country's Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines across \nthe country.\n  Second, the bill ensures a comprehensive list of select agents. \nCurrently, CDC and APHIS develop a list of agents and toxins to which \nthe program regulations apply. However, we believe some additional \nfactors should be considered in revising the list. For example, \nscientific developments now make it possible to create agents from \nscratch or to modify them and make them more deadly. Highly infectious \nviruses or bacteria that are otherwise difficult to obtain can now be \ncreated by scientists using ``synthetic genomics.'' In addition, we now \nhave more information from the Department of Homeland Security--DHS--\nabout the threat posed by certain bioterrorism agents.\n  In 2002, U.S. researchers assembled the first synthetic virus using \nthe genome sequence for polio. Later, in 2005 scientists reconstructed \nthe 1918 Pandemic Influenza virus. Then in January 2008, ``safe'' form \nof Ebola was created synthetically. While this ``safe'' Ebola can be \nused for legitimate research to develop drugs and vaccines to protect \nagainst it, a scientist could also change it back to its lethal form. \nAlso, earlier this year, advancements in technology yielded the first \nsynthetic bacterial genome.\n  We must consider these scientific advances, including genetically \nmodified organisms and agents created synthetically, if we are to \naddress all agents of concern. In addition, DHS's recent bioterrorism \nrisk assessments provide new information for our assessment of \nbiological threats. This information should also be considered when \ndetermining which agents and toxins should be regulated.\n  Next, the bill encourages sharing information with state officials to \nenable more effective emergency state planning. State health officials \nare currently not made aware of which agents are being studied within \ntheir state. This leaves medical responders, public health personnel, \nand animal health officials unprepared for a potential release, whether \naccidental or intentional.\n  Lastly, S. 485 clarifies the statutory definition of smallpox. The \nIntelligence and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 criminalized the use \nof variola virus, the agent that causes smallpox. The statutory \ndefinition of the virus includes agents that are 85 percent identical \nto the causative strain. Researchers are worried this could be \ninterpreted to also include the safer strain used to develop the \nsmallpox vaccine, as well as less harmful naturally occurring viruses. \nThis sort of ambiguity could be detrimental to necessary medical \ncountermeasure research and development. Our bill requires the Attorney \nGeneral to issue guidance clarifying the interpretation of this \ndefinition.\n  In addition, in this legislation we take three key actions to \nevaluate and enhance the safety and oversight of high containment \nlaboratories.\n  First, our bill evaluates existing oversight of BSL 3 and 4, or high \ncontainment, labs. The bill requires an assessment of whether current \nguidance on infrastructure, commissioning, operation, and maintenance \nof these labs is adequate. As I mentioned, the number of these labs is \nincreasing around the globe. As these new facilities age, we need to \nmake sure they are appropriately maintained. It is essential that \nlaboratory workers and the public can be assured that these facilities \nare as safe as possible. If the guidance we currently have in place is \nnot adequate, then we need to know how to improve it. In addition, the \nrecent report by the WMD Commission called for HHS and DHS to lead an \ninteragency effort to tighten government oversight of high-containment \nlabs.\n  Second, the bill improves training for laboratory workers. The WMD \nCommission report also called for standard biosafety and biosecurity \ntraining for all personnel who work in high-containment labs and \nfunding the development of such educational materials. As the number of \nlaboratories and personnel increases, we must ensure workers are \nappropriately trained. Accidents and injuries in the lab, such as \nchemical burns and flask explosions, may result from improper use of \nequipment. Our bill develops a set of minimum standards for training \nlaboratory personnel in biosafety and biosecurity, and encourages HHS \nand USDA to disseminate these training standards for voluntary use in \nother countries.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a voluntary Biological Laboratory \nIncident Reporting System. This system will encourage personnel to \nreport biosafety and biosecurity incidents of concern and thereby allow \nus to learn from one another. Similar to the Aviation Safety Reporting \nSystem, which gathers information on aviation accidents, this system \nwill help identify trends in biosafety and biosecurity incidents of \nconcern and develop new protocols for safety and security improvements. \nLab exposures to pathogens not on the select agent list will also be \ncaptured through this type of voluntary reporting system. The WMD \nCommission recommended promoting a culture of security awareness in the \nlife sciences community and establishing whistleblower mechanisms \nwithin the life sciences community so that scientists can report their \nconcerns about safety and security without risk of retaliation. We \nbelieve such a reporting system would help fulfill this recommendation.\n  In closing, I encourage my Senate colleagues to join Senator Kennedy \nand me as we work to improve our nation's biosecurity and biosafety \nsystems by passing S. 485, the Select Agent and Biosafety Improvement \nAct of 2009. I want to thank the many researchers, scientists, and \nstate health officials from across the country who shared with me and \nmy staff their ideas, experiences, and recommendations. In this time of \nexciting scientific advances, we must ensure our laws and prevention \nprograms are updated to reflect current conditions. In addition, we \nmust remain vigilant in our efforts to protect the American people from \nbioterrorism. The Select Agent Program is an important part of ensuring \nthe nation's safety and security, and I\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nlook forward to working with my colleagues to reauthorize and improve \nthe program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself, Mr. Begich, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Burris, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Casey, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 486. A bill to achieve access to comprehensive primary health care \nservices for all Americans and to reform the organization of primary \ncare delivery through an expansion of the Community Health Center and \nNational Health Service Corps programs; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I think everybody recognizes that our \ncurrent health care system is in very serious crisis. We have 46 \nmillion Americans who lack any health insurance. We have even more than \nthat who are underinsured. The cost of health care is soaring. And we \nend up spending twice as much per person on health care as do the \npeople of any other nation, despite having so many people uninsured and \nunderinsured.\n  While a lot of the discussion regarding the health care crisis \nfocuses on insurance coverage, there is another crisis equally severe \nthat we do not talk enough about; that is, the crisis in access to \ndoctors and dentists--in fact, the crisis in terms of primary health \ncare.\n  The truth is that in our country today, we have some 56 million \nAmericans, including Americans who have health insurance, who simply \ncannot find a doctor and, even more, cannot find a nurse. The absurdity \nof that is that when somebody cannot find a doctor, that person will \nend up going to the emergency room at great cost to our Nation or, \nequally likely, that person may not go to the doctor at all, gets sick, \nand ends up in the hospital, and we are spending tens of thousands of \ndollars treating that person when we could have spent far less if that \nman, woman, or child had access to a doctor when the illness first \ndeveloped.\n  I am very gratified, and I thank President Obama, I thank Senator \nInouye and Senator Harkin, Congressman Obey, the Democratic leadership \nin the House for taking this Nation a giant step forward in terms of \naddressing the crisis in primary health care in the stimulus package.\n  What happened in the stimulus package is that $2 billion was \nallocated for community health centers, to help those community health \ncenters expand, to help in the growth of new community health centers. \nOn top of that, another $300 million was appropriated for the National \nHealth Service Corps. The National Health Service Corps is one of the \nimportant health programs we have in this country because it provides \ndebt forgiveness and scholarships for young physicians so they can go \nout and serve in underserved areas.\n  Many medical school graduates are leaving school $100,000, $150,000 \nin debt, and they have no choice but to end up becoming specialists, \nmaking a whole lot of money in order to pay back those debts. What we \nhave done in the stimulus package is almost triple the amount of money \ngoing into the National Health Service Corps, which means that we are \ngoing to be able to enable thousands of young physicians and dentists \nto go out and work in underserved areas, which is a huge step forward \nfor primary health care. That was a very important part of the stimulus \npackage.\n  In fact, on top of all of that, this sum of money is going to create \n44,000 sustainable jobs as we create a primary health care \ninfrastructure and as we provide health care to an additional 4 million \nAmericans.\n  As significant as what we did in the stimulus package is, it is only \na downpayment for what we have to do to address the crisis in terms of \nprimary health care. Therefore, I am very proud to announce that today \nI introduced, along with 21 of my Senate colleagues--and they are in \nalphabetical order--Senators Begich, Bingaman, Boxer, Brown, Burris, \nCardin, Casey, Durbin, Harkin, Inouye, Kennedy, Kerry, Johnson, Leahy, \nMenendez, Merkley, Mikulski, Schumer, Stabenow, Tester, and Wyden--all \nof those Senators join with me in new legislation which, in fact, is \ngoing to revolutionize primary health care in America.\n  Also today, the majority whip in the House, Jim Clyburn of South \nCarolina, introduced a similar bill which I believe has 78 cosponsors. \nThat legislation is called the Access for All America Act. Its goal is \nto significantly expand community health centers all over this country, \nas well as the National Health Service Corps.\n  The community health center concept was developed by Senator Ted \nKennedy over 40 years ago. The truth is that the concept of community \nhealth centers has been long supported in a bipartisan manner. \nPresident Bush was supportive of the concept. Senator McCain certainly \nmentioned it in his campaign for President, and Senator Hatch--many \nRepublicans have supported it, as well as many people on our side of \nthe aisle.\n  The reason for that bipartisan support is that everybody here \nunderstands that community health centers provide quality health care \nin a cost-effective manner. What community health centers do is provide \ncomprehensive health care in terms of access to doctors and dentists. I \npoint out that there is a major dental crisis all over this country. \nCommunity health centers by law have to provide mental health \ncounseling. On top of that, community health centers provide the lowest \ncost of prescription drugs in the United States of America.\n  Today, there are approximately 1,100 community health centers all \nover America. In my State of Vermont, we have gone from 2 to 7 in the \nlast 5 years, and they are now providing health care to over 80,000 \nVermonters.\n  We have 1,100 in this country today. What this legislation will do is \ngo from 1,100 community health centers to 4,800 community health \ncenters, quadrupling the number of health centers in America. By doing \nthat, we will provide comprehensive, high-quality primary health care \nin every underserved area in this country--a giant step forward in \nterms of making primary health care accessible to every man, woman, and \nchild in this Nation.\n  In my view, we need to move toward a national health care program \nwhich guarantees health care for all people, but we can take this \nimportant step forward in terms of primary health care quite soon.\n  Here is one of the very wonderful aspects of what this legislation \ndoes. Right now, we spend about $2.1 billion a year for community \nhealth centers. This legislation, over a 5-year period, will take that \nnumber up to $8 billion. It will go from $2 billion to $8 billion as we \nquadruple the number of community health centers.\n\n  What study after study suggests is that in fact this investment will \nend up saving us money. This investment in primary health care will \nsave us money because those people who get sick will now be able to go \nto a community health center--perhaps the most cost-effective primary \nhealth care in America--rather than walking into an emergency room, \nwhich is one of the most expensive health care providers in the \ncountry. In addition, when people have access to health care and get \ntreatment when they need it, they are not going to get very sick and \nend up in a hospital, where it will cost tens of thousands of dollars \nto deal with their illness.\n  So what this legislation does is quadruple the number of community \nhealth centers, and it very substantially increases the amount of money \nthat goes to the National Health Service Corps so we can provide debt \nrelief and scholarships to young physicians who will then go out and \nserve us in underserved areas.\n  In my view, this legislation, if passed--and I think we have a good \nchance to pass it because there is a whole lot of bipartisan support \nhere in the Senate for this concept, a lot of support in the House as \nwell--will revolutionize primary health care in America. It will bring \nus to the day when virtually every American will have access to a \ndoctor, a dentist, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription \ndrugs. It will enable us to produce the doctors, the dentists, the \nnurses, and the other health care providers we desperately need to get \nout\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\ninto rural, urban America, and underserved areas. It will be a major \nstep forward in providing the primary health care infrastructure we \nneed as we in fact move to a national health care program.\n  This is important legislation, and I thank all of the 21 Members of \nthe Senate who have already come on as original cosponsors. We hope \nthat many more will come on in the coming weeks and months. My hope is \nwe can get this bill out of committee and see it passed as a stand-\nalone piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 487. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nhuman embryonic stem cell research; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have spoken many times in this Chamber \nabout the promise of stem cell research. For more than a decade, ever \nsince scientists first succeeded in deriving human embryonic stem \ncells, I have done my utmost to promote this exciting field, which \noffers so much hope for so many people.\n  President Obama has promised to lift the restrictions on embryonic \nstem cell research that were put in place by President Bush, and I hope \nand expect that he will do so soon. But we have to make sure that the \nfreedom to pursue this research is also protected by Federal law, not \nmerely by an executive order that can be reversed during a future \nadministration.\n  That is why Senator Specter and I, along with Senators Kennedy, \nHatch, and Feinstein, are introducing the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act of 2009. This is the exact same bipartisan bill that \nboth houses of Congress approved in 2007, but was vetoed by President \nBush. I urge Congress to pass this law again, and for President Obama \nto sign it, so our scientists can move forward with this research \nposthaste, without fear of further political interference.\n  Let me spend just a moment reviewing what this bill will accomplish. \nMore than 7 years ago, the President announced that federally funded \nscientists could conduct research on embryonic stem cells only if the \ncells had been derived before August 9, 2001, at 9 p.m.\n  I never understood that. Why 9 p.m.? Why not 9:30? If stem cell \nresearch is morally acceptable at 8:59 p.m., why isn't it OK at 9:01? \nIt's totally arbitrary.\n  When the President announced his policy, he said that 78 stem cell \nlines were eligible for federally funded research. But, today, only 21 \nof those 78 lines are eligible--not nearly enough to reflect the \ngenetic diversity of this Nation. Many of those 21 lines are showing \ntheir age, and all were grown with mouse feeder cells, an outdated \nmethod that raises concerns about contamination.\n  Meanwhile, hundreds of new stem cell lines have been derived since \nthe President's arbitrary deadline. Many of those lines are \nuncontaminated and healthy. But they're totally off-limits to federally \nfunded scientists.\n  That is a shame. If we are serious about realizing the promise of \nstem cell research--about helping people with Parkinson's, cancer, \njuvenile diabetes, and so many other diseases--our scientists need \naccess to the best stem cell lines available. We need a stem cell \npolicy that offers credible, meaningful hope. And that's what this bill \nwould provide.\n  Under this bill, Federally funded researchers could study any stem \ncell line, regardless of the date that it was derived, as long as \nstrict ethical guidelines are met.\n  Most importantly, the only way a stem cell line could be eligible for \nfederally funded research is if it were derived from an embryo that was \notherwise going to be discarded.\n  There are more than 400,000 embryos in the United States that are \nleft over from fertility treatments and are currently sitting frozen in \nstorage. Most of those embryos will eventually be thrown away. All we \nare saying is, instead of discarding all 400,000 of those leftover \nembryos, let's allow couples to donate a few of them, if they wish, to \ncreate stem cell lines that could cure diseases and save lives.\n  Mr. President, it is time to lift the restrictions that have \nhandcuffed stem cell research for more than 7 years. I urge the Senate \nto pass this bill as soon as possible and send it to the President for \nhis signature.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 487\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce--the ``Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act similar to legislation that I have sponsored \nin the last two Congresses with Senators Harkin, Hatch, Kennedy, \nFeinstein, and Smith.\n  I believe medical research should be pursued with all possible haste \nto cure the diseases and maladies affecting Americans. In my capacity \nas ranking member and at times chairman of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I have backed up \nthis belief by supporting increases in funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health. I have said many times that the NIH is the crown \njewel of the Federal Government--perhaps the only jewel of the Federal \nGovernment. When I came to the Senate in 1981, NIH spending totaled \n$3.6 billion. In fiscal year 2009, NIH will receive approximately $29 \nbillion to fund its pursuit of lifesaving research. The successes \nrealized by this investment in NIH have spawned revolutionary advances \nin our knowledge and treatment for diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's \ndisease, Parkinson's disease, mental illnesses, diabetes, osteoporosis, \nheart disease, ALS, and many others. It is clear to me that Congress's \ncommitment to the NIH is paying off. This is the time to seize the \nscientific opportunities that lie before us and to ensure that all \navenues of research toward cures--including stem cell research--are \nopen for investigation.\n  I first learned of the potential of human embryonic stem cells in \nNovember of 1998 upon the announcement of the work by Dr. Jamie Thomson \nat the University of Wisconsin and Dr. John Gearhart at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity. I took an immediate interest and held the first \ncongressional hearing on the subject of stem cells on December 2, 1998. \nThese cells have the ability to become any type of cell in the human \nbody. Another way of saying this is that the cells are pluripotent. The \nconsequences of this unique his legislation is property of stem cells \nare far reaching and are key to their potential use in therapies. \nScientists and doctors with whom I have spoken--and that have since \ntestified before the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee at 20 stem \ncell-related hearings--were excited by this discovery. They believed \nthat these cells could be used to replace damaged or malfunctioning \ncells in patients with a wide range of diseases. This could lead to \ncures and treatments for maladies such as juvenile diabetes, \nParkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases, and \nspinal cord injury. In all, well over 100 million Americans could \nbenefit from stem cell research.\n  Embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos that would otherwise \nhave been discarded. During the course of in vitro fertilization, IVF, \ntherapies, sperm, and several eggs are combined in a laboratory to \ncreate 4 to 16 embryos for a couple having difficulty becoming \npregnant. The embryos grow in an incubator for 5 to 7 days until they \ncontain approximately 100 cells. To maximize the chances of success, \nseveral embryos are implanted into the woman. The remaining embryos are \nfrozen for future use. If the woman becomes pregnant after the first \nimplantation, and does not want to have more pregnancies, the remaining \nfrozen embryos are in excess of clinical need and can be donated for \nresearch. Embryonic stem cells are derived from these embryos. The stem \ncells form what are called ``lines'' and continue to divide \nindefinitely in a laboratory dish. In this way, the 21 lines currently \navailable for Federal researchers were obtained from 21 embryos. The \nstem cells contained in these lines can then be made into almost any \ntype of cell in the body--with the potential to replace cells damaged \nby disease or accident. At no point in the derivation process are the \nembryos or the derived cells implanted in a woman, which would be \nrequired for them to develop further. The process of deriving stem cell \nlines results in the disruption of the embryo and I know that this \nraises some concerns.\n  During the course of our hearings in this subject, we have learned \nthat over 400,000 embryos are stored in fertility clinics around the \ncountry. If these frozen embryos were going to be used for in vitro \nfertilization, I would be the first to support it. In fact, I have \nincluded $2,000,000 in the HHS budget each year since 2002 to create \nand continue an embryo adoption awareness campaign. But the truth is \nthat most of these embryos will be discarded. I believe that instead of \njust throwing these embryos away, they hold the key to curing and \ntreating diseases that cause suffering for millions of people.\n  President Bush opened the door to stem cell research on August 9, \n2001. His policy statement allowed limited Federal funding of human \nembryonic stem cell research for the first time. There is a real \nquestion as to whether the door is open sufficiently.\n  A key statement by the President related to the existence of \napproximately 60 eligible stem cell lines--then expanded to 78. In the \nintervening 5 years, it has become apparent that many of the lines \ncited are not really viable, robust, or available to federally funded \nresearchers. The fact is there are only 21 lines now available for \nresearch. Perhaps, most fundamental is the issue of therapy. It was not \naddressed in the President's statement, but it came to light in the \nfirst weeks after the President's announcement that all of the stem \ncell lines have had nutrients from mouse feeder cells and bovine serum. \nUnder FDA regulations, these lines will face intense regulatory hurdles \nbefore being useful in human therapies. In the intervening years, new \ntechnology has been developed so that mouse feeder cells are no longer \nnecessary for the growth of stem cells. It only makes sense that our \nNation's scientists should have access to the latest technology.\n  Since August 9, 2001, new facts have come to light and the technology \nhas moved forward to the extent that the policy is holding back our \nscientists and physicians in their search for cures. I have a friend \nand constituent in Pittsburgh named Jim Cordy who suffers from \nParkinson's. Whenever I see Jim, he carries an hourglass, to remind me \nthat the sands of time are passing and that the days of his life \nare slipping away. That is a pretty emphatic message from the \nhourglass. So it seems to me that this is the kind of sense of urgency \nwhich ought to motivate Congress and the biomedical research community.\n\n  On March 19, 2007, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, President Bush's appointee to \nlead the National Institutes of Health, testified before the Senate \nLabor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee regarding the NIH \nbudget and stem cells. At that time he stated, ``It is clear today that \nAmerican science would be better served and the nation would be better \nserved if we let our scientists have access to more cell lines . . . To \nsideline NIH in such an issue of importance, in my view, is \nshortsighted. I think it wouldn't serve the nation well in the long \nrun.'' His testimony clearly shows that the time has come to move \nforward.\n  The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act lifts the August 9, 2001, date \nrestriction, thus making stem cell lines eligible for federally funded \nresearch regardless of the date on which they were derived. Expanding \nthe number of stem cell lines would accelerate scientific progress \ntowards cures and treatments for a wide range of diseases and \ndebilitating health conditions. The bill puts in place strong ethical \nrequirements on stem cell lines that are funded with Federal dollars. \nIn fact, several stem cell lines currently funded with Federal dollars \nwould not be eligible under the policies put in place by this bill. The \nrequirements include: embryos used to derive stem cells were originally \ncreated for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical \nneed; the individuals seeking fertility treatments for whom the embryos \nwere created have determined that the embryos will not be implanted in \na woman and will otherwise be discarded; the individuals for whom the\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\nembryos were created have provided written consent for embryo donation; \nand the donors can not receive any financial or other inducements to \nmake the donation.\n  When President Bush's Council on Bioethics reported on several \ntheoretical methods for deriving stem cells without destroying embryos, \nI immediately scheduled a hearing to investigate these ideas. On July \n12, 2005, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee heard testimony from five \nwitnesses describing several theoretical techniques for deriving stem \ncells without destroying embryos. The stem cells would theoretically \nhave the key ability to become any type of cell. The techniques \ndiscussed included single cell derivation of stem cells; altered \nnuclear transfer; deriving stem cells from so-called ``dead'' embryos; \nand, perhaps the most promising, turning adult cells back into stem \ncells.\n  Legislation, which I first introduced with Senator Rick Santorum in \nthe 109th Congress, was meant to encourage these alternative methods \nfor deriving stem cells without harming human embryos. That legislation \nhas been incorporated into the current bill, which amends the Public \nHealth Service Act by inserting a section that:\n  1, Mandates that the Secretary of Health & Human Services shall \nsupport meritorious peer-reviewed research to develop techniques for \nthe derivation of stem cells without creating or destroying human \nembryos.\n  2, Requires the Secretary to issue guidelines within 90 days to \nimplement this research and to identify and prioritize the next \nresearch steps.\n  3, Requires the Secretary to consider techniques outlined by the \nPresident's Council on Bioethics--such as altered nuclear transfer and \nsingle cell derivation.\n  4, Requires the Secretary to report yearly on the activities carried \nout under this authorization.\n  5, Includes a ``Rule of Construction'' stating: Nothing in this \nsection shall be construed to affect any policy, guideline, or \nregulation regarding embryonic stem cell research, human cloning by \nsomatic cell nuclear transfer, or any other research not specifically \nauthorized by this section.\n  6, Define ``human embryo'' by reference to the latest definition \ncontained in the appropriations act for the Department of Health & \nHuman Services.\n  7, Authorizes ``such sums as may be necessary'' for fiscal year 2010 \nthrough 2012.\n  Knowing that scientists are never certain exactly which research will \nlead to the next great cure; I have always supported opening as many \navenues of research as possible. Based on that line of reasoning, I \nhave always supported human embryonic, adult, and cord blood stem cell \nresearch. My goal is to see cures for the various afflictions that \nlower the quality of life--or end the lives--of Americans. I believe \nthis bill implements this philosophy by opening of embryonic stem cell \nresearch and encouraging alternatives.\n  Importantly, the bill does not allow Federal funds to be used for the \nderivation of stem cell lines--the step in the process where the embryo \nis destroyed. Also, the bill does not address the subject of cloning, \nwhich continues to be banned in the appropriations bills for Health & \nHuman Services.\n  President Barack Obama has indicated that he will overturn the \ncurrent restrictions. I feel it is important to codify this important \npolicy change so that the policy does not ping-pong back and forth with \neach successive President. This uncertainty slows the progress of \nscience. Young scientists rightly avoid fields of science for which \nfunding may come and go due to political whim rather than scientific \nand medical merit. A temporary end to the current restrictions is an \nincomplete and ultimately self-defeating solution.\n  I strongly believe that the funding provided by Congress should be \ninvested in the best research to address diseases based on medical need \nand scientific opportunity. Politics has no place in the equation. \nThroughout history there are numerous examples of politics stifling \nscience in the name of ideology. Galileo was imprisoned for his theory \nthat the planets revolve around the Sun. The Institute of Genetics of \nthe Soviet Academy of Sciences opposed the use of hybrid varieties of \nwheat because it was based on the science of the West. Instead, they \nsupported a doctrine called ``acquired characteristics,'' which was \nmade the official Soviet position. This resulted in lower yields for \nSoviet wheat throughout the former Soviet Union in the first half of \nthe 20th century. These historical examples teach us that we must make \nthese decisions based on sound science, not politics. I urge this body \nto support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act so that this Congress \ndoes not look as foolish in hindsight as these examples.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN:\n  S. 488. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to require group and individual health insurance coverage and \ngroup health plans to provide coverage for individuals participating in \napproved cancer clinical trials; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to help \ncancer patients and bring us closer to finding a cure for that \ndevastating and deadly disease.\n  Clinical trials are one of the most effective weapons in our nation's \nongoing fight against cancer. Experimental treatments both save lives \nand advance research.\n  However, many health insurance policies discourage enrollment in \nthese trials by refusing to cover trial participants' routine health \ncare, even as patients continue to pay monthly premiums.\n  Take, for example, Sheryl Freeman from Dayton, OH. Sheryl and her \nhusband Craig visited my office in Washington, DC 2 years ago to tell \ntheir story:\n  Sheryl was a retired school teacher and was covered under Craig's \ninsurance plan. Craig has been a Federal employee for 20 years and has \none of the best health plans in the country.\n  Yet they found that when Sheryl--who had been diagnosed with multiple \nmyloma--tried to enroll in a clinical trial to save her life, their \ninsurance company would not cover routine costs that would have been \ncovered had she not enrolled in the clinical trial.\n  For instance, in addition to participating in the clinical trial at \nOhio State's James Cancer Hospital, Sheryl needed to visit her \noncologist in Dayton at least once a week for standard cancer \nmonitoring, which included scans and blood tests. But her insurance \ncompany would not cover these services if she enrolled in a clinical \ntrial.\n  Sheryl wanted to take part in a clinical trial because she hoped it \nwould help her. She hoped that it might save her life, give her more \ntime, or help future patients with the same type of cancer.\n  But rather than devoting her energy toward combating cancer, Sheryl \nspent the last months of her life haggling with her insurance company. \nBy the time her insurer finally agreed to cover costs they never should \nhave denied, it was too late. The delays and denials from Sheryl's \ninsurance company affected her treatment and, likely, her survival.\n  Sheryl died on December 9, 2007.\n  Sadly, this is not an isolated case. Across Ohio and the Nation, \ninsurers are using patients' participation in clinical trials as an \nexcuse to deny health benefits that would otherwise be covered.\n  In fact, about 20 percent of patients who try to enroll in clinical \ntrials are denied coverage by their insurers. This statistic doesn't \ncapture those patients who refrain from entering a trial because they \nhave been forewarned of coverage barriers.\n  The Access to Cancer Clinical Trials Act--which has been introduced \nin the House by Representative Israel and which I introduced last year \nas well--would eliminate these barriers for cancer patients. Under the \nlegislation, health care costs associated with a clinical trial would \nstill be covered by the trial sponsors; however, insurers would not be \npermitted to deny benefits for other routine health care otherwise \ncovered under their health plan. Similar legislation was passed in the \nOhio General Assembly last year, but this federal bill would apply to \nall insurance carriers, not just those regulated by states.\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\n  The Access to Cancer Clinical Trials Act is a lifesaving bill \nendorsed by over thirty voluntary health organizations, including the \nLance Armstrong Foundation, the National Patient Advocate Foundation, \nand the American Association for Cancer Research.\n  It is unthinkable that patients battling cancer must also fight \ninsurers for basic benefits that should never be in doubt. To make \nprogress on finding a cure for cancer, we need to encourage \nparticipation in research, not permit insurers to inhibit it.\n  I ask my colleagues to please join me in supporting this important \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WEBB (for himself, Mr. Burr, Ms. Collins, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Bunning, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 491. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nFederal civilian and military retirees to pay health insurance premiums \non a pretax basis and to allow a deduction for TRICARE supplemental \npremiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the bipartisan \nFederal and Military Retiree Health Care Equity Act. I introduce this \nbill with Senators Burr, Collins, Cardin, Durbin, Warner, Rockefeller, \nAkaka, Dodd, Kerry, and Bunning. This legislation will provide some \nrelief for our Nation's Federal and military retirees from the \nincreases in their health care plans. This measure extends premium \nconversion to Federal and military retirees, allowing them to pay their \nhealth insurance premiums with pretax dollars.\n  I believe strongly in protecting the rights and benefits of our \nfederal and military retirees, many of whom have given years of service \nto our country. I commend their service to our Nation.\n  The increasing cost of health care is a critical issue, especially to \nFederal and military retirees living on a fixed income. Health care \npremiums are rising for Federal and military retirees and their \nfamilies. This legislation will help to ensure that more Federal and \nmilitary retirees are able to continue their health care coverage with \nthe Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan and supplemental TRICARE \nhealth insurance plans as premiums continue to rise.\n  In the fall of 2000 premium conversion became available to active \nFederal employees who participate in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program. It is a benefit already available to many private \nsector employees. While premium conversion does not directly affect the \namount of the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan premiums, it helps \nto offset some of the increase by reducing an individual's Federal tax \nliability.\n  Extending this benefit to Federal employees requires a change in the \ntax law, specifically section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. This \nlegislation makes the necessary change in the tax code. Under the \nlegislation, the benefit would be concurrently afforded to our Nation's \nmilitary retirees as well to assist with increasing health care costs.\n  A number of organizations representing federal and military retirees \nare strongly behind this initiative: National Active and Retired \nFederal Employees Association, The Military Coalition, National \nTreasury Employees Union, National Association of Postmasters of the \nUnited States, Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, National \nAssociation of Postal Supervisors, National Federation of Federal \nEmployees, National Association of Government Employees, National Rural \nLetter Carrier Association, National Postal Mail Handlers, American \nForeign Service Association, and American Postal Workers Union.\n  The Federal and Military Retiree Health Care Equity Act has enjoyed \noverwhelming, bipartisan support for four Congresses. This is a matter \nof basic fairness. Our Federal employee and military retirees deserve \naccess to the same quality, affordable health care they received as \nactive members of the civil service and military. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in moving this legislation forward in this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 491\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal and Military Retiree \n     Health Care Equity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to increase public confidence in the justice system \nand address any unwarranted racial and ethnic disparities in the \ncriminal process; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Justice \nIntegrity Act of 2009. I am pleased that Senator Specter, the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, has joined me as an original \ncosponsor of this legislation. I think it is important to\n\n[[Page S2566]]\n\nbegin this discussion with the first words that appear in the \nConstitution of the United States. ``We the people of the United \nStates, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice . . \n.'' The Founding Fathers chose Justice as a cornerstone for the \nfoundation of our country. Justice is defined as fairness, moral \nrightness, and as a system of law in which every person receives his or \nher due from the system, including all of their guaranteed rights. \nThere are many perceptions and realities that surround our criminal \njustice system.\n  Our Constitution guarantees that all Americans, no matter their race, \ncolor, creed or gender, have the right to equal protection under the \nlaw. Yet statistics, reports and data reflect a possibility of bias in \nour justice system. For example, a distressing statistic shows that one \nout of every three African-American males born today can expect to go \nto jail during his lifetime. African-Americans are disproportionately \narrested and incarcerated, they are more likely to be pulled over by a \npolice car while driving, and they are three times more likely to be \narrested for a drug offense than white Americans and are nearly 10 \ntimes as likely to enter prison for drug offenses. Take for example, \nhow two forms of the same drug are handled differently in our justice \nsystem: crack cocaine and powder cocaine. In 2006, blacks constituted \n82 percent of those sentenced under federal crack cocaine laws while \nwhites constituted of only 8.8 percent, despite the fact that more than \n66 percent of people who use crack cocaine are white. Government data \nfurther demonstrates that drug rates are similar among all racial and \nethnic groups.\n  A 2007 study released by the Department of Justice's Bureau of \nJustice Statistics revealed that while Black, Hispanic and White \ndrivers are equally likely to be pulled over by police, Blacks and \nHispanics are much more likely to be searched and arrested. These types \nof disparities and the perception of bias is unacceptable and we should \ntake bold steps to correct these injustices. During the last Congress, \nmy good friend and former member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nBiden, introduced this bill and during his introductory speech he \nstated ``nowhere is the guarantee of equal protection more important \nthan in our criminal justice system.'' I couldn't agree more with that \nstatement, which is why I have reintroduced this very important \nlegislation.\n  Just last week Attorney General Eric Holder gave a speech for \nAfrican-American History Month. In that speech, Attorney General Holder \nasked us, as a nation, to ``find ways to force ourselves to confront \nthat which we have become experts at avoiding''. One way to do that is \nto look at the disparities in our justice system that have existed for \nmany years and can be traced back to slavery and the Jim Crow era. In \nPresident Obama's March 2008 speech on Race, he asked Americans to \n``march for a more just, more equal, more free, more caring and more \nprosperous America.'' He further stated that in order to perfect our \nunion we must continue to ``insist on a full measure of justice in \nevery aspect of American life.'' I heard President Obama that day, and \nI heard Attorney General Holder last week. I believe we are at a \ncrossroads today where we can either take on the challenges and attack \nthese injustices or continue to turn our heads away from the problems \nin our justice system. The Justice Integrity Act responds to the racial \nand ethnic disparities and perceptions that surround our Federal \njustice system.\n  The Justice Integrity Act will create 10 pilot programs across the \ncountry that will help create a plan that will ensure that law \nenforcement priorities and initiatives--including charging and plea \ndecisions, as well as sentencing recommendations are not influenced by \nracial or ethnic bias but instead apply the law in a just and fair \nmanner to all individuals. These 10 pilot programs will be set up at \nthe discretion of the Attorney General in 10 different U.S. attorney \noffices. Each U.S. attorney will create an advisory group including all \nthe major stakeholders in the justice system. Each of the individuals \nwill gather information and examine data which will lead to a report on \ntheir findings and recommendations to the district on how to reduce \nunjustified racial and ethnic disparities.\n  Our current justice system is not working at its greatest potential. \nThis bill will not only help restore the public's trust in our justice \nsystem but also restore integrity in our justice system. Any form of \nbias in our criminal justice system erodes the core principles in our \nConstitution specifically that ``all men are created equal'' under the \nlaw and that our justice system is not only fair but just.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 495\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Justice Integrity Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the pursuit of justice requires the fair application of \n     the law;\n       (2) racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal process \n     have contributed to a growing perception of bias in the \n     criminal justice system;\n       (3) there are a variety of possible causes of disparities \n     in criminal justice statistics among racial and ethnic groups \n     and these causes may differ throughout the United States, \n     including crime rates, racial discrimination, ethnic and \n     cultural insensitivity, or unconscious bias, as well as other \n     factors;\n       (4) the Nation would benefit from an understanding of all \n     factors causing a disparate impact on the criminal justice \n     system; and\n       (5) programs that promote fairness will increase public \n     confidence in the criminal justice system, increase public \n     safety, and further the pursuit of justice.\n\n     SEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall establish a \n     pilot program in 10 United States districts in order to \n     promote fairness, and the perception of fairness, in the \n     Federal criminal justice system, and to determine whether \n     legislation is required.\n       (b) Program Requirements.--\n       (1) U.S. attorneys.--The Attorney General shall designate, \n     in accordance with paragraph (3), 10 United States Attorneys \n     who shall each implement a plan in accordance with section 4, \n     beginning not later than 1 month after those United States \n     Attorneys are designated by the Attorney General.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purposes of the plans required by this \n     section are--\n       (A) to gather racial and ethnic data on investigations and \n     prosecutions in the United States districts and the causes of \n     disparities, if any;\n       (B) to determine the extent to which the communities' \n     perception of bias has affected confidence in the Federal \n     criminal justice system;\n       (C) to analyze whether measures may be taken to reduce \n     unwarranted disparities, if any, and increase confidence in \n     the criminal justice system; and\n       (D) to make recommendations, to the extent possible, to \n     ensure that law enforcement priorities and initiatives, \n     charging and plea bargaining decisions, sentencing \n     recommendations, and other steps within the criminal process \n     are not influenced by racial and ethnic stereotyping or bias, \n     and do not produce unwarranted disparities from otherwise \n     neutral laws or policies.\n       (3) Criteria for selection.--\n       (A) In general.--The 10 pilot districts referred to in \n     subsection (a) shall include districts of varying \n     compositions with respect to size, case load, geography, and \n     racial and ethnic composition.\n       (B) Metropolitan areas.--At least 3 of the United States \n     Attorneys designated by the Attorney General shall be in \n     Federal districts encompassing metropolitan areas.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \ncapitation grants to increase the number of nursing faculty and \nstudents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. As we prepare to tackle the many challenges of our health \ncare system, let's take the time to make sure that nursing schools are \nin a position to teach and train a new generation of nurses and nurse \neducators. Today, I am introducing the Nurse Education, Expansion, and \nDevelopment (NEED) Act to provide schools of nursing with grants for \nfaculty, equipment, and clinical laboratories. The proposed grants give \ncolleges of nursing the flexibility to use federal funds to address the \nvery problems that keep nursing schools from hiring more teachers \ntoday.\n  The healthcare crisis is complicated and the challenges are immense, \nbut the runaway costs and inefficiencies in our health care system are \nno longer sustainable. So as we begin to look at healthcare reform in \nthis Congress, let's keep in mind one lesson we learned from \nMassachusetts' recent experience. After a landmark healthcare reform \nlaw to extend healthcare coverage to every person in the State, the \nsudden demand for primary care professionals outpaced the supply.\n  Nurses can help fill that primary care gap. Today, nurse \npractitioners are already taking over at the helm of primary care in \nmany areas that don't have any primary care physicians. Nurses are \nstaffing health care clinics, and many are opening their own practices. \nIncreased standards of training have opened new doors for nurses who \nwant to further their careers but do not want to attend medical school. \nThe numbers tell the story. In 2000 there were roughly 90,000 nurse \npractitioners in the U.S. By 2015, it is estimated there will be as \nmany as 135,000.\n  Unfortunately, the number of nurses is not keeping pace with the \ngrowing health care needs of our Nation. In 2000, the U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services found that the U.S. is 110,000 short of \nthe number of nurses we need. By 2005, the shortage had doubled to \n219,000. By 2020, it is expected we will be more than 1 million nurses \nshort of the need.\n  Contributing to this shortage is a lack of faculty to teach and train \nfuture nurses. In a survey of more than 400 schools of nursing last \nyear, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing found that 63 \npercent of the schools reported vacancies on their faculty. An \nadditional 17.8 percent said\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\nthey were fully staffed, but still needed more faculty to handle the \nnumber of students who want to be trained. Last year, nursing colleges \nacross the Nation denied admission to 49,948 qualified applicants \nbecause there were not enough faculty members to teach the students.\n  Statistics paint a bleak picture for the availability of nursing \nfaculty now and into the future. The median age of a doctorally \nprepared nursing faculty member is 56 years old. The average age of \nretirement for faculty at schools of nursing is 65 years. It is \nexpected that 200 to 300 doctorally prepared faculty will be eligible \nfor retirement each year from 2005 through 2012, reducing faculty even \nthough more than 1 million replacement nurses will be needed.\n  The number of qualified students turned away from nursing schools in \nIllinois reflects the national trend and continues to grow. In 2002-\n2003, 502 qualified students were rejected from Illinois nursing \nschools. In 2008, 2,523 students were turned away because of lack of \nfaculty and resources--over 1600 more students than in 2007. To avoid \nthe vast shortage HHS is projecting, we have to figure out how to make \na significant increase that we can sustain in the number of nurses \ngraduating and entering the workforce each year.\n  My hope is that the bill I am introducing today can be part of the \nanswer. Nursing schools need the resources to teach and train a new \ngeneration of nurses and nurse educators. Let's not take on health care \nreform without considering the more than 2.9 million nurses in our \ncountry today who are critical to our health care system. And as we \nlook at improving our health care system, let's start by investing in \nthe nursing pipeline today for the health care needs of tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 497\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse Education, Expansion, \n     and Development Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) While the Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205) \n     helped to increase applications to schools of nursing by 125 \n     percent, schools of nursing have been unable to accommodate \n     the influx of interested students because they have an \n     insufficient number of nurse educators. The American \n     Association of Colleges of Nursing estimates that--\n       (A) in the 2008-2009 school year--\n       (i) 62.8 percent of schools of nursing had from 1 to 16 \n     vacant faculty positions; and\n       (ii) an additional 17.8 percent of schools of nursing \n     needed additional faculty, but lacked the resources needed to \n     add more positions; and\n       (B) 49,948 eligible candidates were denied admission to \n     schools of nursing in 2008, primarily due to an insufficient \n     number of faculty members.\n       (2) A growing number of nurses with doctoral degrees are \n     choosing careers outside of education. Over the last few \n     years, 20.7 percent of doctoral nursing graduates reported \n     seeking employment outside the education profession.\n       (3) The average age of nurse faculty at retirement is 62.5 \n     years. With the average age of doctorally-prepared nurse \n     faculty at 55.6 years in 2007, a wave of retirements is \n     expected within the next 10 years.\n       (4) Master's and doctoral programs in nursing are not \n     producing a large enough pool of potential nurse educators to \n     meet the projected demand for nurses over the next 10 years. \n     While graduations from master's and doctoral programs in \n     nursing rose by 12.8 percent (or 1,918 graduates) and 4.5 \n     percent (or 24 graduates), respectively, in the 2008-2009 \n     school year, projections still demonstrate a shortage of \n     nurse faculty. Given current trends, there will be at least \n     2,616 unfilled faculty positions in 2012.\n       (5) According to the November 2007 Monthly Labor Review of \n     the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 1,000,000 new and \n     replacement nurses will be needed by 2016.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \ndental insurance for veterans and survivors and dependents of veterans, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce \nlegislation that would give our veterans, surviving spouses, and \ncertain dependent children the option to buy dental insurance coverage \nthrough the Department of Veterans' Affairs, VA. My bill is based on a \nvery successful program that has been in place since 1998 for military \nretirees and their families.\n  Under the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program, TRDP, military retirees are \ngiven the option to purchase dental coverage through the Department of \nDefense. Since the program started, over 1 million eligible \nparticipants have chosen to buy dental coverage through this plan, \nincluding over 56,000 in my home State of North Carolina. Those \nindividuals have access to a network of about 112,000 dental plan \nproviders across the Nation. Premiums range from $14 to $48 per month \nper person, depending on the region and type of dental plan selected. \nWith this kind of success, it seems only fitting that we offer the same \nkind of benefit to our veterans.\n  VA runs the largest integrated health care system in the Nation. \nAlthough VA provides dental benefits to the 7.9 million veterans \nenrolled in the healthcare system, these benefits are either limited to \na select group of people or can only be provided under very limited \ncircumstances. For example, VA provides comprehensive dental care to \nveterans for 180 days after they leave service; who have service-\nrelated dental conditions; who are in nursing homes and require dental \ncare; or who fall under other very strict guidelines.\n  My bill would supplement this limited coverage by giving veterans and \nsurvivors the option to purchase a more comprehensive dental plan. Of \ncourse, many veterans may have dental coverage through their employers \nor through an individual policy. My bill extends this dental plan \noption to all enrolled veterans.\n  As I mentioned, the bill is modeled after the successful program that \nis now offered to TRICARE retirees. Federal employees also have access \nto a similar benefit option for dental coverage. Like these other \nprograms, this VA program would be entirely voluntary and provide \nneeded coverage from a network of dental professionals in local \ncommunities.\n  This bill would not replace VA's dental services; it is just another \noption for those who want to have access to group insurance rates that \nthey could not otherwise get on their own. This idea is like the 44 \nyear relationship VA has with Prudential, who provides active duty \nservicemembers and veterans with group life insurance policies. The \nmost important part of the relationship is that servicemembers and \nveterans get to reap the benefits of group rates and competition.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 501. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nprohibit the marketing of authorized generic drugs; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Schumer, \nKohl, Leahy, and Brown to reintroduce an important piece of \nlegislation, the Fair Prescription Drug Competition Act. Our \nlegislation eliminates one of the most prominent loopholes that brand \nname drug companies use to limit consumer access to lower cost generic \ndrugs; it ends the marketing of so-called ``authorized generic'' drugs \nduring the 180-day exclusivity period that Congress designed to \nspecifically allow true generics to enter the market.\n  An authorized generic drug is a brand name prescription drug produced \nby the same brand manufacturer on the same manufacturing lines, yet \nrepackaged as a generic. Some argue that authorized generic drugs are \ncheaper than brand name drugs and, therefore, benefit consumers. In \nreality, authorized generics only serve to reduce generic competition, \nextend brand monopolies, and lead to higher health care costs for \nconsumers over the long-term. As I have said many times, authorized \ngenerics are a sham. They are brand name prescription drugs in \ndisguise.\n  After up to 20 years of holding a patent for a brand name drug, the \nmanufacturer doesn't want to let go of their enormous profits. So, they \nrepackage the drug and refer to it as a generic in order to achieve a \nvery simple goal--to drive true generics out of the market by offering \nthe drug at a lower price initially; then, when victory is assured, \nraising the cost on the so-called ``authorized generic'' to gain a \nlarger profit. This is a huge problem and one that is becoming even \nmore prevalent as patents on some of the best-selling brand name \npharmaceuticals expire.\n  In 1984, Congress passed the Hatch-Waxman legislation to provide \nconsumers greater access to lower cost generic drugs. The intent of \nthis law was to improve generic competition, while preserving the \nability of brand name manufacturers to discover and market new and \ninnovative products. Over time, brand name manufacturers found ways to \nexploit certain loopholes in the Hatch-Waxman law to the detriment of \ngenerics.\n  As a result, Congress enacted amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act as\n\n[[Page S2570]]\n\npart of the 2003 Medicare prescription drug law. These amendments were \ndesigned to close long-standing loopholes that were delaying generic \ncompetition and hindering consumer access to lower-cost generic drugs. \nThese reforms were also intended to strengthen the 180-day period of \nmarket exclusivity for generic manufacturers that pursue costly patent \nchallenges.\n  The Hatch-Waxman Act and the additional reforms included in the 2003 \nMedicare law provide crucial incentives for generic drug companies to \nenter the market and make prescription drugs more affordable for \nconsumers. As health care spending continues to skyrocket, finding ways \nto reduce costs is crucial. Today, generic medications comprise more \nthen 56 percent of all prescriptions in this country, but they only \ngenerate 13 percent of our Nation's drug costs. Furthermore, generic \ndrugs are 50 percent to 80 percent cheaper than brand name drugs. In \nfact, generic drugs save consumers an estimated $8 to $10 billion a \nyear at retail pharmacies. For working families, these savings can make \na huge difference, particularly during a recession. We must protect the \ntrue intent of the Hatch-Waxman Act and increase access to affordable \nprescription drugs for all Americans. The Fair Prescription Drug \nCompetition Act does just that by eliminating the authorized generics \nloophole, protecting the integrity of the 180 days, and improving \nconsumer access to lower cost generic drugs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this timely and important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 499. A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal the \nultra-deepwater and unconventional onshore natural gas and other \npetroleum research and development program; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to reintroduce the \nWithdraw Energy Addicting New Subsidies Act. I first introduced this \nlegislation in the 109th Congress to repeal what I believed to be a \nback-door subsidy to the oil and gas industry at a time when the oil \nand gas industry didn't need any more subsidies. This hidden subsidy \nwas included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. And what it does is to \ndirectly transfer $50 million dollars a year of oil and gas royalties, \nwhich would otherwise go the Federal Treasury, into a special program \nto research on advanced, ultra-deep drilling technology for the oil and \ngas industry. This transfer isn't a one-time transfer, it's an annual \ntransfer that continues every year through the year 2017, at a cost of \n$250 million over five years.\n  There are plenty of industries in this country that are hurting, but \nthe oil and gas industry is not one of them. It's time, as President \nObama has said, to end Federal programs that we don't really need. And \nthis is one of them. I applaud the decision by the President to propose \nthe repeal of the ultra-deepwater drilling program in the budget he \nannounced today. It's a decision that's long overdue. That's why I am \nreintroducing this bill--the WEANS Act. I urge my colleagues in joining \nme in ending this unneeded subsidy by supporting the WEANS Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 499\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Withdraw Energy Addicting \n     New Subsidies Act of 2009'' or the ``WEANS Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF ULTRA-DEEPWATER AND UNCONVENTIONAL ONSHORE \n                   NATURAL GAS AND OTHER PETROLEUM RESEARCH AND \n                   DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.\n\n       Subtitle J of title IX of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 \n     U.S.C. 16371 et seq.) is repealed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 500. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to establish a \nnational usury rate for consumer credit transactions; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. As the Congress tries to help Americans overcome the most \nserious economic crisis since the Great Depression, we face two urgent \nyet conflicting priorities. We have to increase demand for American \nproducts to resuscitate our economy. And we have to reduce the \nfinancial burden that our children will assume. We need to let \nconsumers keep more of their own money without reducing the revenues \nthat the government needs to pay for essential services.\n  In addition, we need to stop the reckless lending that brought us \nthis economic disaster.\n  Today, I introduce the Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit \nRates Act to try to get at each of these goals. My bill sets a ceiling \nof 36 percent annualized interest rates on consumer credit.\n  Consumers spend approximately $27 billion every year on predatory \npayday loans, high-cost overdraft loans, and hugely expensive refund \nanticipation loans. Imagine if a portion of that $270 billion 10-year \ncost of credit could be redirected towards buying American goods and \nservices. The Center for Responsible Lending estimates that a strong \nfederal usury cap would save low-income borrowers $5 billion each year.\n  And, in an era that has called for trillions of taxpayer dollars to \nbail out banks and jumpstart economic demand, this proposal costs the \ntaxpayers nothing.\n  The Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act would \nestablish a new Federal annualized fee and interest rate calculation--\nthe FAIR--and institute a 36-percent cap for all types of consumer \ncredit.\n  In 2006, Congress enacted a Federal 36 percent annualized usury cap \nfor certain credit products marketed to military servicemembers and \ntheir families, which curbed payday, car title, and tax refund lending \naround military bases. My bill would expand on that premise to include \nall types of credit for all borrowers.\n  If a lender can't make money on 36 percent interest, then maybe the \nloan shouldn't be made.\n  Although I hope to gain widespread support for this bill from \nresponsible lenders, I understand that some of the financial service \nfirms in this country will be uneasy with a broad bill establishing a \nhigh interest rate cap. I hope this bill can open an honest \nconversation about consumer credit rates.\n  My opening question in that conversation is this: what services do \nyou provide for which you can justify charging your customers more than \n36 percent in annual interest?\n  Fifteen States and the District of Columbia have already enacted \nbroadly applicable usury laws that protect borrowers from high-cost \npayday loans and many other forms of credit, while 34 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia have limited annual interest rates to 36 percent \nor less for one or more types of consumer credit.\n  But there is a problem with this State-by-State approach. Those \nlimits can sometimes be evaded by out-of-State lenders that are based \nin States that have weaker usury laws.\n  Various Federal and State loopholes allow unscrupulous lenders to \ncharge cash-strapped consumers pay 400 percent annual interest for \npayday loans on average, 300 percent annual interest for car title \nloans, up to 3500 percent annual interest for bank overdraft loans, \nbetween 50 and 500 percent annual interest for loans secured by \nexpected tax refunds, and higher than 50 percent annual interest for \ncredit cards that charge junk fees.\n  Consider 66-year-old Rosa Mobley, who lives on Social Security and a \nsmall pension.\n  The Chicago Tribune reports that Ms. Mobley took out a car title \nloan--a type of payday loan in which the borrowers put up their cars as \ncollateral--for $1,000. Ms. Mobley was charged 300 percent interest.\n  She wound up paying more than $4,000 over 28 months and at the time \nof the report was struggling just to get by.\n  This bill would require that all fees and finance changes be included \nin the new usury rate calculation and would require all lending to \nconform to the limit, thereby eliminating the many loopholes that have \nallowed these predatory practices to flourish.\n  It would not preempt stronger State laws, it would allow State \nattorneys general to help enforce this new rate cap, and it would \nprovide for strong\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\ncivil penalties to deter lender violations.\n  I included in this bill the flexibility for responsible lenders to \nreplace payday loans that some borrowers once relied on with reasonably \npriced, small-dollar loan alternatives. The bill allows lenders to \nexceed the 36 percent usury cap for one-time application fees that \ncover the costs of setting up a new customer account and for processing \ncosts such as late charges and insufficient funds fees.\n  The Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act would \neliminate predatory lenders, but it also would help borrowers make \nsmarter choices.\n  Congress established the Truth in Lending Act over 40 years ago to \nhelp consumers compare the costs of borrowing when buying a home, a \ncar, or other items by establishing a standard Annual Percentage Rate \nthat all lenders should advertise.\n  My first mentor in politics, the late Senator Paul Douglas from my \nhome State of Illinois, said all the way back in 1963 that too often \nlenders:\n\n     compound the camouflaging of credit by loading on all sorts \n     of extraneous fees, such as exorbitant fees for credit life \n     insurance, excessive fees for credit investigation, and all \n     sorts of loan processing fees which rightfully should be \n     included in the percentage rate statement so that any \n     percentage rate quoted is meaningless and deceptive.\n\n  That was before anyone had ever heard of ``subprime lending.''\n  Unfortunately, as the use of credit has exploded and as the \ncomplexity of the credit products offered by lenders has become mind-\nboggling, Congress and the Federal Reserve have taken several actions \nsince the passage of Truth in Lending to weaken the APR as a tool for \ncomparison shopping. Today, many fees can be excluded from the rate \nthat is given to borrowers. The APR no longer gives consumers the \nconvenient and accurate information it once did. One payday lender in \nPennsylvania used the various exclusions to disclose what was really a \n400 percent APR as 6 percent.\n  This bill would give consumers a way to accurate compare credit \noptions, by requiring that the new FAIR calculation be disclosed both \nfor open-end credit plans such as credit cards and for closed-end \ncredit such as mortgages and payday loans.\n  The bill is supported by 100 groups at the national and local levels, \nincluding the Consumer Federation of American, the National Consumer \nLaw Center, the Center for Responsible Lending, USPIRG, and Consumers \nUnion, and I include a copy of their letter of support for the \nCongressional Record.\n  As Congress considers some very complicated economic challenges, I \nurge my colleagues to also consider simple solutions. We can help give \nmore money to American consumers today without borrowing money that \nmust be repaid tomorrow. Let's start by eliminating some of the worst \nabuses in lending by establishing a reasonable fee and interest rate \ncap.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Protecting Consumers from \nUnreasonable Credit Rates Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the letter of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 500\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Consumers from \n     Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) attempts have been made to prohibit usurious interest \n     rates in America since colonial times;\n       (2) at the State level, 15 states and the District of \n     Columbia have enacted broadly applicable usury laws that \n     protect borrowers from high-cost payday loans and many other \n     forms of credit, while 34 states and the District of Columbia \n     have limited annual interest rates to 36 percent or less for \n     1 or more types of consumer credit;\n       (3) at the Federal level, in 2006, Congress enacted a \n     Federal 36 percent annualized usury cap for service members \n     and their families for covered credit products, as defined by \n     the Department of Defense, which curbed payday, car title, \n     and tax refund lending around military bases;\n       (4) notwithstanding such attempts to curb predatory \n     lending, high cost lending persists in all 50 States due to \n     loopholes in State laws, safe harbor laws for specific forms \n     of credit, and the exportation of unregulated interest rates \n     permitted by preemption;\n       (5) due to the lack of a comprehensive Federal usury cap, \n     consumers annually pay approximately $17,500,000,000 for \n     high-cost overdraft loans, as much as $8,600,000,000 for \n     storefront and online payday loans, and nearly $900,000,000 \n     for tax refund anticipation loans;\n       (6) cash-strapped consumers pay on average 400 percent \n     annual interest for payday loans, 300 percent annual interest \n     for car title loans, up to 3,500 percent for bank overdraft \n     loans, 50 to 500 percent annual interest for loans secured by \n     expected tax refunds, and higher than 50 percent annual \n     percentage interest for credit cards that charge junk fees;\n       (7) a national maximum interest rate that includes all \n     forms of fees and closes all loopholes is necessary to \n     eliminate such predatory lending; and\n       (8) alternatives to predatory lending that encourage small \n     dollar loans with minimal or no fees, installment payment \n     schedules, and affordable repayment periods should be \n     encouraged.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE.\n\n       The Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 141.

Richard J. Durbin,\n     Hart Senate Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jackie Speier,\n     Cannon House Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin and Representative Speier: We applaud \n     Senator Durbin and Representative Speier for proposing a \n     measure that would stop a wide range of lending abuses by \n     capping interest rates for consumer credit at 36 percent \n     annually. Cleaning up the finance industry is essential to a \n     sustainable economic recovery.\n       The ``Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates \n     Act'' would implement a key promise made by President Obama \n     to extend to all Americans Congressional protection against \n     predatory lending for Service members and their families. By \n     limiting the total cost of consumer credit to 36 percent, \n     Congress will keep billions of dollars in the hands of low \n     and moderate-income consumers, helping to stimulate the \n     economy without costing taxpayers a penny.\n       This measure is designed to keep affordable financial \n     products available, as lenders who offer sustainable loans do \n     so at rates well below 36 percent annually. But it would \n     eliminate abuses that rely on high fees, interest and other \n     devices to charge extremely high annual rates--some 400 \n     percent and higher--to trap consumers in debt they cannot \n     afford to pay off.\n       Protections that once curbed abusive lending in America \n     have been shredded, and consumers are paying astronomical \n     rates for credit, especially those who have the fewest \n     resources. Payday loans cost 400 percent APR or higher; car \n     title loans cost 300 percent APR and put car ownership at \n     risk; loans secured by expected tax refunds cost 50 to 500 \n     percent APR; and credit card fees and interest can combine to \n     produce triple-digit rates. Bank overdraft loans can cost \n     quadruple digit interest rates. These extremely expensive \n     credit products drain billions from families who struggle to \n     make ends meet, diminishing their ability to purchase \n     products and services that would boost the economy.\n       The ability of states to enact meaningful reforms on credit \n     card and bank overdraft practices has been severely \n     restricted as a result of federal preemption. Banks are now \n     permitted to locate in a state without consumer protections \n     and then engage in unregulated lending in the other forty-\n     nine states, which are powerless to protect their citizens \n     against high cost credit cards and tax refund anticipation \n     loans. State usury caps have been riddled with loopholes and \n     exceptions, leaving consumers in thirty-five states exposed \n     to outrageously expensive payday loans.\n       The FAIR (Fees and Interest Rate) cap on consumer credit is \n     set high enough not to hamper mainstream responsible lending. \n     A 36 percent rate cap is twice the limit for federally-\n     chartered credit unions and enables credit to be responsibly \n     extended to consumers with less than perfect credit ratings. \n     This is the rate cap enacted by Congress through the Military \n     Lending Act and is the limit typically used in state small \n     loan laws. The FAIR cap will be the maximum amount lenders \n     can charge, but states will be able to set lower rate caps to \n     protect their citizens, such as New York's 25 percent \n     criminal cap and Arkansas's constitutional cap.\n       We urge quick action to implement the FAIR cap to stop \n     usurious credit rates, to protect struggling consumers, and \n     to put all lenders under the same set of protections.\n           Sincerely,\n       Jean Ann Fox, Consumer Federation of America.\n       Pam Banks, Consumers Union.\n       Lauren Saunders, National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of \n     its low income clients).\n       Edmund Mierzwinski, U.

Res. 57\n\n       Whereas dangerous asbestos fibers are invisible and cannot \n     be smelled or tasted;\n       Whereas the inhalation of airborne asbestos fibers can \n     cause significant damage;\n       Whereas asbestos fibers can cause mesothelioma, asbestosis, \n     and other health problems;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases can take 10 to 50 years \n     to present themselves;\n       Whereas the expected survival time for those diagnosed with \n     mesothelioma is between 6 and 24 months;\n       Whereas generally, little is known about late-stage \n     treatment of asbestos-related diseases, and there is no cure \n     for such diseases;\n       Whereas early detection of asbestos-related diseases may \n     give some patients increased treatment options and might \n     improve their prognoses;\n       Whereas the United States has reduced its consumption of \n     asbestos substantially, yet continues to consume almost 2,000 \n     metric tons of the fibrous mineral for use in certain \n     products throughout the Nation;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases have killed thousands of \n     people in the United States;\n       Whereas exposure to asbestos continues, but safety and \n     prevention of asbestos exposure already has significantly \n     reduced the incidence of asbestos-related diseases and can \n     further reduce the incidence of such diseases;\n       Whereas asbestos has been a cause of occupational cancer;\n       Whereas thousands of workers in the United States face \n     significant asbestos exposure;\n       Whereas thousands of people in the United States die from \n     asbestos-related diseases every year;\n       Whereas a significant percentage of all asbestos-related \n     disease victims were exposed to asbestos on naval ships and \n     in shipyards;\n       Whereas asbestos was used in the construction of a \n     significant number of office buildings and public facilities \n     built before 1975;\n       Whereas people in the small community of Libby, Montana \n     have asbestos-related diseases at a significantly higher rate \n     than the national average and suffer from mesothelioma at a \n     significantly higher rate than the national average; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a ``National Asbestos \n     Awareness Week'' will raise public awareness about the \n     prevalence of asbestos-related diseases and the dangers of \n     asbestos exposure: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the first week of April 2009 as ``National \n     Asbestos Awareness Week'';\n       (2) urges the Surgeon General to warn and educate people \n     about the public health issue of asbestos exposure, which may \n     be hazardous to their health; and\n       (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Office of the \n     Surgeon General.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/26/senate-section/article/S2573-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2573-S2574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 58--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MARCH 1 THROUGH MARCH 8, \n                  2009, AS ``SCHOOL SOCIAL WORK WEEK''\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, \nMr. Brown, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Kennedy, and \nMr. Feingold) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 58\n\n       Whereas the Senate has recognized the importance of school \n     social work through the inclusion of school social work \n     programs in the current authorizations of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) and \n     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. \n     1400 et seq.);\n       Whereas school social workers serve as vital members of a \n     school's educational team, playing a central role in creating \n     partnerships between the home, school, and community to \n     ensure student academic success;\n       Whereas school social workers are especially skilled in \n     providing services to students who face serious challenges to \n     school success, including poverty, disability, \n     discrimination, abuse, addiction, bullying, divorce of \n     parents, loss of a loved one, and other barriers to learning;\n       Whereas there is a growing need for local educational \n     agencies to offer the mental health services that school \n     social workers provide when working with families, teachers, \n     principals, community agencies, and other entities to address \n     students' emotional, physical, and environmental needs so \n     that students may achieve behavioral and academic success;\n       Whereas to achieve the goal of the No Child Left Behind Act \n     of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) of helping all children reach \n     their optimal levels of potential and achievement, including \n     children with serious emotional disturbances, schools must \n     work to remove the emotional, behavioral, and academic \n     barriers that interfere with student success in school;\n       Whereas fewer than 1 in 5 of the 17,500,000 children in \n     need of mental health services actually receive these \n     services, and research indicates that school mental health \n     programs improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences, \n     decreasing discipline referrals, and improving academic \n     achievement;\n       Whereas school mental health programs are critical to early \n     identification of mental health problems and in the provision \n     of appropriate services when needed;\n       Whereas the national average ratio of students to school \n     social workers recommended by the School Social Work \n     Association of America is 400 to 1; and\n       Whereas the celebration of ``School Social Work Week'' \n     highlights the vital role school social workers play in the \n     lives of students in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 1 through March 8, 2009, as ``School \n     Social Work Week'';\n       (2) honors and recognizes the contributions of school \n     social workers to the successes of students in schools across \n     the Nation; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     ``School Social Work Week'' with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities that promote awareness of the vital role of school \n     social workers, in schools and in the community as a whole, \n     in helping students prepare for their futures as productive \n     citizens.\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/26/senate-section/article/S2574-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 591.
