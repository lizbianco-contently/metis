Mr. President, every day we do not act, it gets more \nexpensive to stay healthy in America.\n  If you are fortunate enough to have health insurance, this is not \nnews to you. You have no doubt noticed your premiums have more than \ndoubled in the last decade, even though the quality of your health care \nhas not doubled--and that is an understatement.\n  If you are fortunate enough to have coverage, you might have noticed \nthat you are paying at least an extra $1,000 a year to cover all of the \nother families who do not have health insurance.\n  Those with insurance know when premiums eat up a larger slice of \ntheir paychecks, they have less money to take home to their families. \nThose without insurance know the pain of skipping medicine or \ntreatments or doctors visits because it simply costs too much to go to \nthe doctor. Economists tell us if we do nothing, those costs will \ncontinue to climb and to climb. The economists tell us that without \nquestion, if we do not do something, the costs will continue to \nincrease.\n  Very recently, the President's Council of Economic Advisers has \ncrunched the numbers, and this respected group tells us the bill before \nthe Senate will indeed keep health care costs down.\n  Lower costs are good for every American. It means more people who do \nnot have insurance today will be able to afford it, and those who do \nhave insurance will have more stability and security against losing it.\n  The White House's economists highlighted a number of other impressive \neffects of our bill. The amount our government spends on Medicare for \nour seniors and Medicaid for the underprivileged will be much less than \nif we do not act. Our Nation's deficit will be much lower than if we \ndid not act. Health care costs in the private sector will be much lower \nthan they would be if we did not act. And with this bill, American \nfamilies' incomes will increase more than they would if we did not act. \nThe same is true for job creation, small business growth, and our \noverall economy.\n  After all, health reform is economic reform. When you are not \nspending so much of your paycheck on premiums, you have more left to \nfeed your family and to fuel our economy.\n  We also know a healthier workforce is a more productive workforce, \nand a more productive workforce means a healthier economy. Those are \npretty good reasons to act and a pretty strong rebuttal against the \nstrategy of doing nothing. This data proves once again what we have \nsaid from the start: this bill will save lives, save money, and save \nMedicare.\n  That is the reality, and that is why we are working to make it \npossible for every American to afford a shot at a healthy life. It is a \ngoal that will make our economy stronger and make our citizens \nhealthier. It is a goal with an eye to the future, to our children, one \nthat appreciates the long-term effects of what we do.\n  The other side has a goal of its own--one that not only ignores the \nreality of the present but dismisses both the long-term benefits of \nacting and the long-term costs of doing nothing. Whereas we are working \nto slow the growth of health care costs, they are working to slow down \nthe Senate. In fact, they would like to bring this body to a screeching \nhalt.\n  But we will not let talking points meant to scare seniors and \nfrighten families obscure the hard data that show just how unhealthy \nour health care system is. We will not be derailed by those who spend \nmore time hoping for America's leaders to fail than they do helping the \nAmerican people succeed. We will not be sidetracked by those who try to \nstop history in its tracks.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair now announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/14/senate-section/article/S13144-4", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the health \ncare bill that is before us. One of the major points of contention over \nthe last 2 weeks has been the fact that Medicare savings are being \nutilized to leverage an entirely different entitlement and not even \ntaking care of the SGR issue that is so important to physicians around \nour country.\n  The other important stat is the fact that half of the expansion in \nhealth care benefits that is occurring under this bill is under \nMedicaid, probably the worst health care program in America. After a \nyear of discussions among many folks on a bipartisan basis, and ending \nup with a very partisan bill, the fact that half of the expansion is \noccurring in one of the worst programs that exist in our country, \nlocking people at 133 percent of poverty into Medicaid, with no other \nchoice, does not seem to me to be true health care reform.\n\n  I know the Senator from New Hampshire, who has spoken eloquently on \nthis issue, has something to say about that.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for opening this \ndiscussion on the issue of Medicaid. But I did want to ask a couple \nquestions relative to what the Senate leader just said about the bill \nthat is before us.\n  We have to remember the bill that is before us--all 2,074 pages, as I \nunderstand it--is not the bill we are going to actually consider. There \nis somewhere in this building a hidden bill, known as a managers' \namendment, which is being drafted by one or two or three people on the \nother side of the aisle, and which is going to appear deus ex machina \non our desks fairly soon. We do not know what is in it. A lot of the \npeople on the other side do not know what is in it. The press does not \nknow what is in it. The American people do not know what is in it.\n  Mr. CORKER. The President does not know what is in it.\n  Mr. GREGG. The President does not know what is in it. Nobody knows \nwhat is in it. But they are designing this bill, which is going to be \nrepresented to expand Medicaid even further and to also offer the \nability to people age 55 and over to buy into Medicare, which is going \nto have a huge impact.\n  But what the Senator from Nevada said, which I want to ask the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S13145]]\n\nfrom Tennessee about, is, he said this bill before us--this 2,074-page \nbill, which we know is what we are working off of--is going to reduce \nhealth care costs.\n  Is it not true that the President's Actuary--the Actuary for CMS, who \nis the President's Actuary--sent us a letter last week which said that \nhealth care costs in the first 10 years would go up by $235 billion?\n  The majority leader also said people will be able to keep their \ninsurance. Is it not true that the President's Actuary said millions of \npeople will lose their own insurance under this bill?\n  Further, is it not true, in the area of Medicare, that the \nPresident's Actuary actually said that the expansion in Medicare and \nthe Medicare cuts in this bill that are before us in the Democratic \nbill would actually lead to a massive reduction in the number of \nproviders for Medicare; that up to 20 percent of the providers in \nMedicare would become unprofitable and therefore they would have to \nleave Medicare, making Medicare unavailable to people because there \nwould be no recipient?\n  Didn't the Actuary also say, in the area of Medicaid--and I am \nquoting--``it is reasonable to expect that a significant portion of the \nincreased demand for Medicaid would'' be difficult to meet, \nparticularly in the first few years, and that is because providers \nwould no longer be profitable and would have to leave the business of \nproviding--doctors groups, hospitals, small clinics?\n  Are not all those three points true relative to what the President's \nActuary has told us--not us, not the Republican side but what the \nPresident's Actuary said? And don't all three points contradict the \nrepresentations of the majority leader?\n  Mr. CORKER. Not just his representations, but the representations of \nthe President of the United States. As a matter of fact, it is hard to \nunderstand any goal that is being achieved other than making sure our \ncountry has a huge indebtedness.\n  But the senior Senator from Tennessee has talked about this very \nsubject the Senator is talking about--about Medicaid, in essence, \ngiving people a bus ticket, where there is no bus because of the fact \nthat if we add these people to a system where 40 percent of physicians \ndo not take it, 50 percent of specialists do not take it, in essence, \nyou have people accessing a system where there are not providers to \ncare for them.\n  I do not know if the senior Senator from Tennessee wants to expand on \nthat.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank Senator Corker from Tennessee.\n  We have our usual situation on the Republican side--a lot of Senators \nwho wish to speak on the subject of Medicaid--so I am going to keep my \nremarks brief. But looking around I see one, two, three, four of us who \nhave been Governors of a State. The Acting President pro tempore was \nthe Governor of the State of Virginia. Senator Corker, himself, was \nmayor of Chattanooga and the chief operating officer of the Tennessee \nState government.\n  Why do I bring that up? Because the Medicaid Program we are \ndiscussing--I know to many people listening to this debate, it gets \nconfusing. Medicare is the program for seniors on which 40 million to \n45 million people depend. We have talked about that a lot, and how the \ncuts to Medicare are going to be used to pay for this bill. But we have \nnot talked as much about Medicaid, which is an even larger government \nprogram. Sixty million people depend on Medicaid, and they must be low-\nincome people in order to qualify for the program. This bill would add \n15 million more Americans to the Medicaid Program which, as Senator \nCorker said, is like giving someone a bus ticket to a bus line that \nonly operates half the time, because about 50 percent of the time, \ndoctors will not see new Medicaid patients.\n  But there is another problem with the Medicaid proposal, which all of \nthe Governors here--I know if they are like me, nothing made me any \nangrier than to see a bunch of Washington politicians come up with a \nbig idea, announce it, take credit for it, and then send me the bill \nwhen I was Governor. Usually we would find them back at the Lincoln Day \nDinner or the Jackson Day Dinner the next spring making a big speech \nabout local control. Well, what happens here is a huge bill for this \nMedicaid expansion that is going to be sent to the States.\n  I would say to Senator Corker, hasn't our Governor, a Democratic \nGovernor, Governor Bredesen--who like all of us has struggled with \npaying for Medicaid--has he not said this will cause about $750 million \nin added expense? I would ask the Senator from Tennessee, wouldn't that \nrequire either big cuts to higher education or big tax increases to pay \nfor it?\n\n  Mr. CORKER. As you pointed out, in California there was almost an \ninsurrection among students there because of the high cost of tuition, \nbecause of the fact that other programs in the State were eating up \nmoney. It is the same kind of thing that is going to happen in States \nacross this country. Our Governor, who is a Democrat and who probably \nknows as much about health care as anybody in the country, is very \nconcerned about what this is going to do--hoping, by the way, that \nrevenues in our State reach 2008 levels by the year 2013. So he is very \nconcerned.\n  I know Senator Johanns from Nebraska has been a Governor. I am sure \nhe has some things to add to this debate.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I do have some things I wish to add to this debate. I \nhave gone across the State. I have talked to hospital administrators \nand I always ask them the same question: If you had to keep your \nhospital open on Medicaid reimbursement, could you do that? With no \nexceptions whatsoever, from the largest to the smallest hospitals, they \nsay, Mike, we would go broke because the Medicaid reimbursement is so \nbad. No question about it, that is bad news for the hospitals.\n  But ask any Governor. It doesn't matter if they are a Democrat or a \nRepublican--and the senior Senator from Tennessee is so right, nothing \nwould irritate Governors more, nothing would get us in a more \nbipartisan furor than the politicians in Washington passing something, \ntaking all the credit for it, and then sending the bill to the State \ntaxpayers. I will give a speech on this to nail this down in the next \ncouple of days.\n  The States have very limited options. They can raise taxes or they \ncan cut very valuable programs such as education, K-12 education, \nhigher education, and already States are struggling. In Nebraska we had \na special session where our Governor and our legislature stood up and \nsaid, We have to cut spending, and they cut over $300 million. Can you \nimagine if I were to call up later on in a couple of weeks from now and \nsay, I know you did your very best at that special session, but we sent \nyou another bill for millions and millions of dollars over the next 10 \nyears that you have to deal with?\n  The final point I wish to make is, do my colleagues realize what we \nare doing to the people we will be putting on Medicaid? Already 35 to \n40 percent of the physicians won't take Medicaid. Why? Because the \nreimbursement rates are so incredibly pitiful. So if you are at 133 \npercent of poverty, we basically lock you into Medicaid. It is like \ngiving somebody a driver's license but then saying, there is no way you \ncan ever get a car to drive, because, look, here is the problem: They \ncan't get medical care no matter if they have that Medicaid card. What \nit will do to our health care system is literally bring it to its \nknees, because we are going to have this massive rush of people who \nhave the Medicaid card in hand and we don't have the capacity to deal \nwith that. The doctors, the hospitals are all going to be in trouble \nbecause of this. It is the wrong policy for a whole host of reasons.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I read a story this weekend in the New \nYork Times where Medicaid recipients, especially young Medicaid \nrecipients, have huge prescriptions taken out on them for antipsychotic \ndrugs because basically the physicians don't want to take the time to \ndeal with them, and so they are huge users of them.\n  When we speak about physicians, I think it is always important to \ntalk to one. Fortunately, we have one on our side, Senator Barrasso, \nwho I know has treated many Medicaid recipients. I know he has a lot to \nsay on this topic.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I have a couple of points I wish to add because I think \nyou made a point, as does Senator\n\n[[Page S13146]]\n\nJohanns. The concern is are there going to be enough doctors to take \ncare of these patients. We are talking about 18 million more people \nplaced on the Medicaid rolls, which is a huge unfunded mandate to the \nStates. Having practiced in Wyoming for 25 years, in Casper, taking \ncare of families, taking care of lots of patients on Medicaid, it \nbecomes harder and harder for doctors to take new patients.\n  There is an article in this week's Wyoming Tribune Eagle: Doctor \nShortage Will Worsen. As many as a third of today's practicing \nphysicians will retire by the time all of these additional 18 million \nget on to Medicaid.\n  There is an article in the Wall Street Journal and it talks about a \nreport from a research group, nonprofit, based in Washington, the \nCenter for Studying Health System Change, and it says, as the Senator \nhas previously stated:\n\n       Nearly half of all the doctors polled said that they had \n     stopped accepting or limited the number of new Medicaid \n     patients. That is because many Medicaid programs, straining \n     under surging costs, are balancing their budgets by freezing \n     or reducing payments to doctors. That, in turn, is driving \n     many doctors, particularly specialists, out of the program.\n\n  For people in Wyoming, whether in Cokeville or Kemmerer or Casper, in \nall of these communities we are looking to try to recruit physicians. \nIt is making it much more difficult when we look at this health care \nproposal the Democrats have, which is going to raise taxes, cut \nMedicare, cause premiums to go up for people who have insurance, and \none of the reasons is because it underpays so much for things such as \nMedicaid. Yet they are talking about putting another 18 million people \non Medicaid.\n  This morning I called one of the offices of a physician group in \nWyoming and said, What are the differences in terms of Medicaid versus \nregular insurance? For something like carpal tunnel, we know about \noveruse of the wrist and carpal tunnel surgery where the normal fee is \nabout $2,000 for the surgery. Medicaid itself reimburses less than \n$500. Medicare--they are talking about putting a lot more people on \nMedicare--reimburses less than $400.\n  It is very difficult if you are trying to run an office and you pay \nall of the overhead expenses and see everybody who wants to see you to \ndo it on the fees alone that you get from Medicare or Medicaid. That is \nwhy I have great concerns. If we have all these people on Medicaid, \nwill it actually help them get care?\n  I think this Democratic proposal we are looking at fails. It fails in \nterms of getting costs under control. It fails in terms of increasing \nquality or increasing access, but those are the things we need in \nhealth care reform.\n  I see my colleague from Florida is here, who has experience, having \nrun a Governor's office as Chief of Staff. He may want to add to this \ndiscussion as well. I can't see any way this would be sustainable. As a \nmatter of fact, a report that came out recently from the CMS, the group \nthat oversees all of this, said it is not sustainable, that one out of \nfive hospitals by the year 2020 and one out of five doctor groups will \nbasically have to go out of business and close their doors.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, it is pretty amazing when you think about \nit. We have a 2,074-page bill that includes the largest expansion of \nMedicaid in the history of the program. It would take about 1 page of \nthat 2,074 pages to expand Medicaid and do no reform, and yet that is \nwhere 50 percent of the expansion is taking place. Yet, the 2,073 pages \nremaining don't meet many goals that many--any goals, really, other \nthan access--any goals that Americans would stand behind.\n  I know the Senator from Florida, who has spent a lot of time on this \nissue, wants to speak on this topic.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I thank my colleague from Tennessee. I didn't have the \nhonor to be a Governor but I got to sit in the office next door to be \nthe Governor's Chief of Staff. We had these issues of trying to balance \nbudgets because, unlike the Federal Government which is out of control, \nStates actually have to balance their budgets. Receipts have to meet \nexpenditures. When your Medicaid budget grows and grows and grows--and \nin Florida, $18 billion is what we pay in Medicaid. It is the largest \nexpenditure in the Florida State budget. When it grows and grows and \ngrows, what happens? You have to cut education. You have to cut public \nservice programs that do things such as law enforcement, correctional \nfacilities that hold prisoners. You hurt the other main functions of \ngovernment if you keep adding in Medicaid.\n\n  I wish to highlight a point my colleague from Tennessee made. It \noccurred to me when I was going through the Chief Actuary's report we \nreceived last Friday from the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services \nthat this plan the Democrats have put forward is the expansion of \nMedicaid. Let's be honest. This is Medicaid for the masses. Thirty-\nthree million people supposedly are going to be covered by this plan if \nit is implemented. How do those numbers add up? Eighteen million are \nMedicaid, 20 million go into this new exchange, and then we lose 5 \nmillion because their employer drops them because they can go into the \nexchange. So what are the majority of the people who are going to go \nunder this new health care reform going to get? They are going to get \nthe worst health care system in America, called Medicaid, a system \nwhere doctors won't participate. If the doctor is not in, it is not \nhealth care reform.\n  This is not all it is cracked up to be. I did a little back-of-the-\nenvelope math: $2\\1/2\\ trillion to put 18 million people into Medicaid. \nWe could give all of those people $166,000 each, put it into an account \nand say: Here, fund your health care for the next 10 years or we could \ncreate this huge government program that expands a program that most \ndoctors won't accept.\n  My colleague Dr. Barrasso has it right. Forty percent of the doctors \nwon't take Medicaid, and 50 percent of the specialists. How is this \nhealth care reform?\n  I know my colleagues here have a lot of experience on this issue. I \nsee my colleague from Mississippi and it looks as though he has a great \nchart and is going to talk about increased Medicaid spending, so I am \nsure he has something great to say to us.\n  Mr. WICKER. Yes, and I appreciate so many of our colleagues being \nhere today because I am glad we are getting into the Medicaid aspect of \nthis bill. There has sort of been a feeling around this building the \nlast couple of days that if we could only take care of the Medicare \nbuy-in and the government-run option this bill would be OK. So I think \ntoday we are bursting that myth and pointing out the huge unfunded \nmandate the Medicaid portion would put on almost all the States.\n  Every State in red as shown on this chart would be required under \nthis bill to increase their Medicaid spending. Only Vermont and \nMassachusetts would not have to be mandated by us in Washington to do \nthis additional spending. Of course, with the unfunded mandate, what \nthe Federal Government is saying is, We think this is a great idea. We \nthink people should be covered with additional Medicaid Programs and, \nby the way, you folks at the State level should come up with the funds \nto pay for it. That is the very nature of an unfunded mandate.\n  I am not a Governor nor have I been a Chief of Staff of a Governor, \nbut I have a letter from my Governor, Gov. Haley Barbour, who says:\n\n       If the current bill, which would expand Medicaid up to 133 \n     percent, were enacted into law, the number of Mississippians \n     on Medicaid would increase to 1,037,000, or one in three of \n     our citizens. Over 10 years this bill would cost \n     Mississippi's taxpayers $1.3 billion--\n\n     The generosity of this Congress would be to tell the \n     legislators and taxpayers of my State of Mississippi: \n     Congratulations. We get more coverage and, by the way, you \n     have to pay an additional $1.3 billion--\n\n     necessarily requiring Mississippi to raise taxes in order to \n     continue vital programs such as education and public safety.\n\n  As has been pointed out, our State governments don't have a printing \npress. They have to balance the budget and make the numbers come out at \nthe end of every year. We are putting a new burden, if we pass this \nlegislation unamended, a tremendous burden on our Governors.\n  One other comment. There has been mention of the Governor of \nTennessee who is a two-term, respected Democrat who knows a little \nsomething about health care. I think the actual quote last summer from \nGov. Phil Bredesen was that he feared ``Congress was about to bestow \nthe mother of all unfunded mandates on the State of Tennessee.''\n  I have here in my hand--and we don't have time because we have so \nmany\n\n[[Page S13147]]\n\npeople who want to speak--I have 13 quotes, not from Republican \nGovernors such as Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, but Democratic \nGovernors all across this Nation, including the newly elected \nDemocratic Governor's Association chairman, Gov. Jack Markell, and 12 \nothers saying, we cannot afford, we cannot accept, we cannot bear at \nthe State level this unfunded mandate upon this number of States.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator. That was very good. I am hearing \nsome comments about there being a wink and a nod process taking place \nwhich is sort of what we have happening right now with the bill. We \ndon't know what is in it, but I understand there may have been a tilt \nby leaders of the Democratic Party to say to Governors: If you won't \nraise much Cain here, we are going to take care of you down the road on \nthis issue. I don't know if I would trust something like that to happen \nin this body but----\n  Mr. WICKER. Here is the problem there. If they take care of the \nGovernors down the road by saying we are going to send the money from \nWashington to cover this, then all of this talk about the program \ncutting costs at the Federal level goes out the window. Something is \ngoing to have to pay for it. Either we are going to have to gin up the \nprinting press here, borrow some more money from China and send it to \nthe States, which I guess is what the Senator was referring to, or we \nare going to pass the unfunded mandate on to the taxpayers of 48 of our \nStates.\n  Mr. CORKER. So many Senators, so much participation, so little time. \nI think there is about 6 minutes left. The distinguished Senator from \nUtah has not yet spoken. The distinguished Senator from Idaho--a former \nGovernor--has not yet spoken. I wondered if the senior Senator from \nUtah might close us out in the remaining time, just to bring this all \nto a climactic conclusion.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleagues. \nThey are right-on. They know what they are talking about regarding the \nMedicaid program.\n  If this bill becomes law, the CBO estimates that by the year 2019, 54 \nmillion nonelderly, nondisabled Americans will be locked into Medicaid. \nThink about that.\n  Americans with incomes below 133 percent of the Federal poverty level \nare not eligible for tax credits to purchase private coverage through \nthe exchange.\n  I will take a few minutes to read part of a letter I received from \nour Governor in Utah, Gary Herbert--who worked at almost every job from \nlocal government right up to Governor of the State--about the Medicaid \nexpansion included in the Reid bill. My Governor is deeply concerned \nabout the impact the proposed Medicaid expansion would have on \nindividual States. Here is what he said:\n\n       In Utah, we have a good system of public medical programs \n     that provide for our neediest population.\n       The extension of Medicaid to additional populations, as \n     discussed in proposed Federal healthcare legislation, will \n     amount to an unfunded mandate that would create financial \n     havoc for our state.\n       While I understand the idea that everyone must ``share in \n     the pain,'' and appreciate the Administration's commitment to \n     reforming healthcare without increasing the size of the \n     federal deficit, to force Medicaid cost increases onto states \n     will simply shift massive cost increases to the states.\n       As we prepare the state's fiscal year 2011 budget, we face \n     continued cuts to agency budgets and reduced government \n     service on top of painful reductions made last year. The \n     unfunded mandate of a forced Medicaid expansion will only \n     exacerbate an already dire situation.\n       If required to increase our Medicaid program as envisioned \n     in Washington, Utah and most every other state will be forced \n     to fund the money to do so through other means. This will \n     require states to either raise taxes or continue to cut \n     budgets in areas currently suffering from a lack of funding, \n     such as public and higher education. We must work together to \n     ensure that no new requirements for states to fund healthcare \n     for additional populations pass.\n\n  In summary, I ask my colleagues, if the Reid bill is signed into law \nand the Medicaid expansions go into effect, what will the States do to \nmake their budgets work? According to Utah Governor Herbert, States \nwill be looking at a variety of options, such as cutting education \nprograms and raising taxes. It would devastate the State, as Governor \nBarbour has said and as almost every Governor would say. I thought that \nwas an important point to make.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I know the Senator has been a leader in \nmaking sure people throughout this country have appropriate health \ncare. I thank the Senator for those comments.\n  There is no one better to respond than a former Governor, the Senator \nfrom Idaho, Jim Risch.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, first of all, let me say this raid on the \nStates is just that. This is going to be a tax increase, and it is not \nincluded anywhere, it is not talked about anywhere. There is no way the \nStates can deal with this except with massive tax increases or massive \ncuts in education.\n  In most States, I am sure, like Idaho, about two-thirds of the budget \nis spent on education, about 10 percent of it is on public safety, and \nyou have about 20 percent that is on social services. Unless you have \nbeen a Governor, you can't understand how difficult it is to control \nwhat has become an expanding black hole in Medicaid.\n  The first social program this Congress came along with was Social \nSecurity. They decided they would do it, and they funded it. The second \nwas Medicare. They decided they would do it, and they funded it. Along \ncame Medicaid, and some genius here decided the Feds will only pay 70 \npercent or so and we will make the States pay 30 percent. Well, \neverywhere across this country, Governors are saying: Don't do this to \nus.\n  The dozen of us here who are former Governors were asked to \nparticipate in a conference call a couple weeks ago. I listened, but I \ndidn't talk. I didn't need to because there was great bipartisan \nsupport for killing this bill. The most vocal people were Democrats. \nThe most vocal Governors were Democrats, who were saying we cannot \ntolerate this kind of an increase. That is what is going to happen \nunder this bill.\n  I am sorry none of my friends from the other side of the aisle are \nhere, with the exception of the Presiding Officer.\n  Could the Senator from Mississippi take the top chart off. If my \nfriends were here, I would tell them to pay attention to the polls \nbecause that is what America is going to look like on CNN next November \n2, in the evening, if you continue down this road.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator. I know of nobody who has spoken more \neloquently on this topic than the Senator from New Hampshire. Before I \nhand it off to him, when I was in my 40-something-plus townhall meeting \nsince this debate began, our citizens said to me they wanted the same \nchoices I had as a U.S. Senator. This expansion for the American people \nis mostly being done in the area of Medicaid.\n  I don't know if the Senator has any comment to that effect or a \ncomment as to whether we Senators ought to be in Medicaid, if this is \nour idea of health care reform. I certainly hope he will close us out, \nand I thank him for his tremendous contribution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank all of the Senators here for their \ncomments. I say this--and I think the Senator from Tennessee was \nalluding to this at town meetings--this expansion of Medicaid isn't \ngood for people. It is not good for people on private insurance. Their \ninsurance will go up, and a lot of employers will have to drop \ninsurance because it is too expensive. It is not good for people \ngetting Medicaid because the number of providers willing to see them \nwill go down. That is what the Actuary tells us, and that is what \ncommon sense also tells you. When you are only paying 60 percent of the \ncost of seeing somebody, people will stop seeing them. It is not good \nfor everybody in all those red States up there on the chart because \ntheir taxes will go up because the States are going to get the bill for \nthis. States can do nothing but raise their taxes. So it is not good \nfor people and not good for health care in this country, in my opinion.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thirty minutes has been consumed.\n  Mr. CORKER. I am sure the Senator from Tennessee--if there is time \nremaining and if nobody is here to claim it--would like to speak. He is \nalways good at explaining the deficiencies of this bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I am impressed\n\n[[Page S13148]]\n\nwith the number of Senators here this afternoon. One thought comes to \nmind, and I wonder if some of my colleagues may want to talk about it. \nI woke up one day and saw on television a sign that said ``32 percent \ntuition increase for the students of California.'' The University of \nCalifornia could be the best public institution of higher education in \nthe world.\n  One of the great things the United States has--which keeps us \ncompetitive and gives us a chance to continue to grow and create new \njobs--is a superior system of higher education. About half of the best \nuniversities--Harvard, Yale, and the private universities--half or more \nthan half are public universities, where tuition is a few thousand \ndollars a year. Well, what is going to happen with this? All of us who \nhave been Governors have gone through this. You have a pot of money \nleft, and it either goes into higher education or Medicaid. For the \nlast 30 years, we have been having to fight to fund Medicaid, and as a \nresult States have not been funding public higher education properly \nand the quality has gone down and the tuition has gone up.\n  What is this bill saying? It says that, after 3 years, we are going \nto dump a huge new cost on the States. I don't believe I am overstating \nit when I say that in our State of Tennessee, given the terrible fiscal \ncondition our States are in today--and our State is more conservatively \nrun than most--I believe our State could only fund this through a new \nState income tax and/or serious damage to higher education or both. I \nwonder if that is not the case in all of the other States represented \nhere.\n  Mr. CORKER. Listening to what the Senator just said, I looked on the \nother side of the aisle and realized there is no one there. This is one \nof those issues. I know that on Medicare, the other side has been able \nto argue they are extending the life of Medicare. Yet Senator Gregg so \nclearly pointed out yesterday on national television that is impossible \nbecause they are taking those savings to pay for a new entitlement \nprogram. At the end of the day, it really will not be extending the \nlife in any way. We all wonder why those savings are not being utilized \nnow to make Medicare more solvent.\n  I wonder what my friends on the other side of the aisle would argue \nin favor of the largest expansion of Medicaid. I think that would be a \npretty hollow argument. I think everyone knows that it was all about \nmoney, that this was the cheapest way to try to meet some goals--by \npassing it off to States. I would love to hear somebody on the other \nside argue how health care reform, where 50 percent of the people being \nadded are being thrown into the worst program that exists in America--I \nwould love to hear somebody over there argue how that is good for our \ncountry.\n  I know Senator Gregg, myself, and others have signed on to \nlegislation that would give low-income citizens choices among private \ncompanies and, with that, vouchers, nonrefundable tax credits, and then \nto be able to pay for that. That is health care reform. That is \nsomething that creates robust competition, and certainly we would not \nhave these low-income individuals locked into the dungeon of the worst \nhealth care program that exists simply because it is cheap, making, in \nessence, the value of their health care less than the value of ours \nhere in the Senate.\n  I would love to hear anybody on the other side of the aisle argue for \nexpanding Medicaid--how that is a good thing for the citizens it \ncovers.\n  I see we have someone from the other side of the aisle here. Mr. \nPresident, I don't know if we still have time to talk. I know Senator \nJohanns has comments to make.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time for the minority has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the ways in which \nsmall businesses will be helped in this bill.\n  Before my colleagues leave the floor, had some of them stayed at the \nnegotiating table, perhaps some of the provisions they talked about \ncould have been considered. Since they pretty much packed up their bags \nmonths ago and left the debate and they just come to the floor to talk, \nit is very difficult to put any of their provisions in the legislation. \nThere were some amendments that were accepted in the Finance Committee \nand in the HELP Committee.\n  The fact is, there is a lot of choice in this bill. There are a lot \nof choices for individuals and for small businesses. There is help for \nAmericans and for businesses not only in the State of Louisiana, which \nI represent, but all the States in the Union.\n  As you can see on this chart, without reform, the cost for small \nbusinesses will rise from--or the jobs lost because of the lack of \nreform will rise from 39,000, to 70,000, to 103,000, to 137,000, and \nthen to 178,000. These are jobs lost because small businesses are \nhaving a very difficult time affording premiums and because of a lack \nof reform in the private insurance market, which this bill also \nprovides. This trendline will continue unless we do something. That is \nwhy many of us are here working early in the morning, through the \nmiddle of the day, and until late at night trying to figure out the way \nto reform this system.\n  I respect my colleagues. I know them all very well. They made their \nstatements for the record this morning. But the fact is, we have been \nat this since Harry Truman was the President. We can't throw this bill \naway and start over again. There is choice and there is expansion of \nMedicaid and reform in the Medicaid system. There will be strengthening \nand reform of the Medicare system. In the middle, there is great \nstrength and reform of the private insurance market.\n  I am a very strong supporter of choice and competition. I came to the \nfloor to speak about a segment of our population--27 million, to be \nexact. That is the number of small businesses that are depending on us \nto do our very best work on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct pending before the Senate as we speak.\n  Our economic prosperity as a nation, as you know, Mr. President, as a \nformer Governor of Virginia who helped bring millions of jobs to your \nState and now as a leader on small business yourself, the economic \nprosperity of our Nation relies, in large measure, on how we can help \nour small businesses become the economic engines we know they can be to \nhelp lift us out of this recession.\n  Entrepreneurs roll up their sleeves and go to work each and every \nday. They go early to work; they stay late. They create jobs. They push \nthe envelope on technical advances, and they assume the risk necessary \nto succeed in the private marketplace. Small businesses created 64 \npercent of American jobs in the last 15 years, according to the Small \nBusiness Administration and others.\n  Yet as chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have heard time and time again from these same \nbusiness owners that they cannot afford to operate in the current \nbroken health care system, and they desperately need us to fix it. That \nis what this effort underway is.\n  Small businesses have been hard hit by premiums that are regularly \nincreasing at 15 percent, 25 percent and, in many cases, 45 percent. \nThis is the cumulative cost of health benefits: You will see, in 2009, \n$156 billion. Without reform, it is going to go to $717 billion. Then, \nin 2015, it will exceed the $1 trillion mark. This is what happens if \nwe do what my colleagues are urging us to do and do nothing or to start \nagain.\n  We have been, as I said, since Harry Truman was President, trying to \nfigure out a way to provide each and every American with affordable \nhealth insurance, either through the public or the private sector or \nsome combination of the above. That is why this bill is so important \nbecause, without reform, this is the price our small businesses will \nhave to pay, and it is too steep, it is too high of a mountain for them \nto climb.\n  Without these reforms, as I said, costs are expected to more than \ndouble over the next 10 years. But this debate is not about numbers, it \nis about people--people such as Mike Brey, who owns Hobby Works in \nLaurel, MD, and who was here just last week in the Capitol to speak at \na press conference. I have had hundreds of business owners from all \nover the country to come. Mike was one of the last ones to come and \nspeak at a press conference last week. He said to us that his plan not \ntoo long ago cost only $100 a person,\n\n[[Page S13149]]\n\nmost of which he was happy to cover as a company. Over the years, \nhowever, his premiums have tripled and his employees have seen their \ncosts go five times higher as they pay more of their premiums, up to \nalmost a $1,200 deductible.\n  Mike said--and his words are echoed by business owners in my State \nand business owners around the country:\n\n       Those of us who do provide coverage are slowly being \n     dragged down by these costs. Something that we once \n     considered a benefit, a benefit I was proud to provide, has \n     now come to be seen as a burden--a burden to be feared \n     because you don't know what is coming next.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       After years of astonishing rate hikes and declining \n     competition among providers, many small businesses, like \n     mine, may be only one or two years away from having to cut \n     their health care programs entirely. I'm not going to let \n     [these premiums] put me out of business. I'm just going to \n     say we can't do it anymore.\n\n  This is what is happening all across America. Only 15 years ago, 65 \npercent of small businesses in our country offered affordable health \ninsurance, something they were proud to provide--full and comprehensive \ncoverage, many of them picking up a majority of the costs. Today that \nhas dropped to 39 percent and dropping every week that we fail to act.\n  Small business owners, such as Mike from Maryland, hundreds in my \nState, need meaningful health care reform. The Senate health care bill \ncontains measures that responsibly put in place both intermediate and \nlong-term insurance reforms that are very important.\n  Let me start with the immediate benefits. I understand there are \nsome, including myself, who would like to see more immediate benefits, \nbut these are some that are important, substantial, and real.\n  Temporary reinsurance for early retirees will be available under this \nbill. This will help many in a very tough stage in their life.\n  States may establish exchanges to get a jump on, of course, the \nmandatory date that is in the bill.\n  No annual limits and restricted lifetime limits. This will be a very \nimportant benefit to small business.\n  Reporting medical loss ratios. For the first time, insurance \ncompanies will have to report information that will help keep the costs \nlower over time and bring more transparency and accountability to the \nsystem.\n  The bridge credit for small businesses will go into effect almost \nimmediately. It will help businesses that have 10 employees or 25 \nemployees provide health coverage for their workers.\n  Then, in the intermediate timeframe, there are some additional ones. \nThe exchanges will be set up by 2014. When people on the other side \ntalk about choice, there is going to be plenty of choice in this bill \nfor uninsured individuals, for those who are in small businesses up to \n100 employees. They will be able to access these exchanges and look for \naffordable options. That is going to be a major improvement over the \ncurrent system.\n  There is a bridge credit--a credit I call a bridge credit--a bridge \nto the exchanges for small businesses. Once the exchanges are up and \nrunning, businesses with 10 and 25 employees or less will be able to \nget almost 35 percent credit for the insurance they provide. That is in \naddition to the deductibility they have in current law.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for another 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, one of the major criticisms of this bill \nhas been the costs. The bill does show fiscal responsibility, cutting \nbudget deficits by $127 billion in the first decade and $650 billion in \nthe second decade. Anything we do is going to cost money upfront to fix \nthe system, but the way this bill is being designed is that for every \ndollar that is spent, there is a dollar raised to pay for that change. \nThat is a refreshing change of method, considering the last 8 years, \nwhere bill after bill was put on this floor, whether for domestic or \ninternational priorities, and not paid for at all.\n  We can be criticized for trying to push major reform forward, but at \nleast we are finding ways within the system to pay for these important \nchanges that will hopefully drive down costs for everyone.\n  As Mike reminded me, the gentleman who spoke at our press conference:\n\n       It is even more important not to let one problem prevent \n     you from solving another problem.\n\n  While we do have budget deficit problems and we are very sensitive to \nit, we cannot allow that to stop us from doing anything else. What we \ncan do, as we work on the other problems, is to do it in the most \nfiscally responsible way possible. That is why I and many Members of \nthe Senate have said we are not prepared to vote on anything until we \nget a final CBO score, to make sure not only can we afford it and not \nonly have we paid for it but that, over time, premium costs will go \ndown, costs to the government will go down, both at the Federal and \nState level, as well as to small businesses.\n\n  The Business Roundtable reports that these exchanges, both in the \nnear term and the intermediate term, could reduce administrative costs \nfor business owners by as much as 22 percent. If business owners are \nmaking shoes, they can get back to making shoes, not running around \nlooking for insurance they cannot find and, if they can, it is too \nexpensive for them anyway. If they are building high-tech equipment or \nelectronic equipment, they can get back to the business of doing that, \ninstead of being in the business of figuring out insurance actuarial \ntables.\n  Reducing administrative costs for small businesses is important. \nTwenty-two million self-employed Americans have even more unpredictable \ncosts. Their premiums have risen 74 percent since 2001. These exchanges \nwill help them also reduce administrative costs.\n  I am proud that one of the amendments I have pending on the Senate \nfloor would give the self-employed a 50-percent tax deduction so they \ncan be on a similar playing field, if you will, for the small \nbusinesses and large businesses that enjoy favorable tax treatment \nunder the current Tax Code.\n  It has been mentioned before, but insurance companies will no longer \nbe allowed to arbitrarily raise rates or drop coverage. Instead, \ncompanies will be forced to compete on the price and quality of their \nplans, not by underwriting the least risk.\n  The bill also has no employer mandate. Instead, we have a shared \nresponsibility for businesses with more than 50 employees. Ninety-six \npercent of small businesses in America are exempt from the provision of \nrequired coverage, but we have come to terms with a system that \nrequires individuals to purchase insurance, as well as small businesses \nto provide insurance with proper tax credits and subsidies that help \nthem make it possible.\n  To help small businesses more immediately bridge the affordability \ngap, these exchanges will not be up and running until 2014. Again, \nthere is an amendment to push that up. I hope we will be able to do \nthat.\n  In the bill, tax credits will help about 51,000 businesses in my \nState of Louisiana alone. There are hundreds of thousands of businesses \nthat will benefit--51,000 in my home State of Louisiana alone--because \nof the credits that are in the bill, and through the amendment process, \nwe are hoping to enrich and expand them.\n  While these provisions in the underlying bill are strong for small \nbusiness, there is always room for improvement. That is why I, along \nwith many of my colleagues, have submitted a series of amendments. Some \nhave costs to them, such as the 50-percent deduction. It is a $12 \nbillion cost. But if we can find it in the bill, if the mark allows us \nto find $12 billion, that would be a good place to spend it because \nthese individuals, whether they are realtors, attorneys, accountants, \nsole contractors, or carpenters who are working out there creating a \njob for themselves and creating economic opportunity in their \ncommunities, could use a tax cut and a tax credit to help them.\n  There are a series of amendments that I have submitted that do not \nhave any costs associated. They are just common sense and create more \nefficiency in the system. I trust the leadership will consider \nincluding those amendments.\n  In addition, Senator Lincoln has an amendment to expand both the \nbridge credit and the tax credit. It is a $9 billion provision. We are \nhoping the mark will allow for that addition as well.\n\n[[Page S13150]]\n\n  I wish to mention a few other points in my closing. I thank the small \nbusiness owners, organizations, and advocates who remained at the \nnegotiating table. They did not pack up their bags and run away. They \nstayed here in Washington, in State capitals, on telephones, on \nconference calls, in public meetings, in the debates taking place in \nthe many committee rooms to argue for this kind of reform--for choice, \nfor transparency, for insurance market reform, the tax credits, more \nfavorable tax treatment to help them afford the insurance they know is \nthe right thing for them to do and it is the smart thing for them to \ndo. Most small business owners want to provide good health insurance \nfor their employees so they can compete for the best employees out \nthere, which helps them keep their businesses strong.\n  I thank the small business owners, particularly the small business \nmajority, many of the women business owners, organizations that have \nstayed at the table to help negotiate this important bill.\n  In conclusion, as we move forward, I am prepared to work with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to pass meaningful and responsible health care \nreform for small businesses. We have a historic opportunity in \nWashington to fix a system that is broken, that is in desperate need of \nrepair. Let us not let this chance slip away.\n  In these final days of negotiation, let us come together to find a \nway forward, again, one that reforms the private insurance market, \nstrengthens Medicare, and sustains its viability over a longer period \nof time, helps to improve the system of Medicaid, by hopefully \nproviding poor, middle-class, and wealthy people with more choices of \nhealth care and by coming to terms that we are not going to have an \nall-public system and we are not going to have an all-private system. \nWe are going to have to find a middle ground, where we take the best of \nboth sides of the public and private system and put them together so \nevery American can have insurance they can count on and, most \nimportant, that our small businesses can have insurance that help them \ncreate the jobs necessary to lead us out of this recession to start \nturning this deficit situation around and creating wealth and \nprosperity for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague here, the Senator from Vermont, and \nso I thank the Chair and I yield my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as an Independent, let me try to give an \nindependent assessment of where we are--which ain't easy, because this \nis a 2,000-page bill and different people have expressed different \nthoughts about it. I know my Republican friends are down here on the \nfloor every day telling us that the world as we know it will rapidly \ncome to an end if this legislation is passed, and yet I want to say to \nthem: Where were they for 8 years? Where were they during the 10 years \nof President Bush? Some 7 million Americans lost their health \ninsurance, health premiums soared, and tens of thousands of people died \nevery single year because they couldn't get to a doctor. Where were \nthey? It is very easy to be critical, but it might have been a good \nidea if 5 or 6 or 8 years ago they were down here before the crisis \nerupted to the level it is right now.\n  This bill, in my view, is far from perfect, and I am going to talk \nabout some of the problems I have with it, but I also want to very \nbriefly outline some of the real assets, positive provisions that are \nin this legislation. It is not insignificant that this bill provides \ninsurance for 31 million Americans who have no insurance. That is a \nhuge step forward for our country. It is not insignificant that this \nlegislation provides for major health insurance reform, finally \noutlawing some of the most outrageous behavior patterns of the private \ninsurance companies--practices such as denying people coverage for \npreexisting conditions, behaviors such as not renewing health insurance \nbecause somebody committed the crime the preceding year of getting sick \nand running up a huge bill. It eliminates caps on the amount of money \nthat people need. Well, you know what, if people need cancer surgery, \nit is expensive, and you can't tell them there is going to be a cap on \nwhat they receive. This bill, importantly, says to families with young \npeople that young people will get coverage until they are 26 years of \nage. That is a very important provision. All of those are very \nimportant steps forward.\n  Having said that, let me also mention that this bill is strong on \ndisease prevention. The Senator from Iowa, Tom Harkin, has talked for \nyears about the need to understand why we are seeing more and more \npeople coming down with cancer or heart disease or diabetes or other \nchronic illnesses, which not only cause death and pain and suffering \nbut huge expenditures for our health care system. It seems to me to \nmake a lot more sense to get to the root of the causation of those \nproblems, try to prevent them, and in the process keep people healthy, \nand save our system substantial sums of money. We have a lot of \nresources in there for disease prevention.\n  Those are a few of the positive elements that are in this bill, and I \ncongratulate the people who have fought to make those provisions \npossible. But let me talk about some of the weaknesses in this bill and \nsome of the areas where I have real concern.\n  Right now, today, we are spending almost twice as much per person on \nhealth care as any other major country on Earth, despite the fact our \nhealth care outcomes in many cases are not as good. Can I stand here \nwith a straight face and say we have got strong cost-containment \nprovisions in this legislation; that if you are an ordinary person who \nhas employer-based health care your premiums are not going to go up in \nthe next 8 years based on what is in this bill? I can't say that. It is \nnot accurate. So we need to have in this bill, as we proceed on it, to \nmake sure there are far stronger cost-containment provisions than \ncurrently exist.\n  To my mind, at the very least, we must have a strong public option to \nprovide competition to the private insurance companies that are raising \ntheir rates outrageously every single year. What is to prevent them \nfrom continuing to do that under this legislation? Not a whole lot, \nfrankly. So the fight must continue for strong public options, not just \nto give individuals a choice about whether they have a public plan or a \nprivate plan but to also provide competition to the private insurance \ncompanies.\n  Second, let me tell you another concern I have. Right now, our \nprimary health care system in this country is on the verge of collapse. \nThere are people all over this country who cannot get in to see a \ndoctor. In fact, we have some 60 million people in medically \nunderserved areas. Most of them can't get to a doctor. What they end up \ndoing is going to an emergency room. They get sicker than they should \nbe and end up going to a hospital, at great expense to our system, and \nadding a lot of human suffering. What I worry about, if we add 15 more \nmillion into Medicaid, if we add another 16 million people into private \nhealth insurance, where are those people going to get the primary \nhealth care they desperately need? The system is inadequate now. It \ncertainly does not have the infrastructure to address 31 million more \npeople who are getting health insurance.\n  The good news is that in the House there is language put in there--\nand fought for by Congressman Jim Clyburn--that would add $14 billion \nover a 5-year period in order to see a significant expansion of \ncommunity health centers and the National Health Service Corps. \nCommunity health centers today are providing primary health care, \ndental care, low-cost prescription drugs, mental health counseling to \nsome 20 million people. What is in the House bill is language that \ngreatly expands that program and also expands the National Health \nService Corps, which provides debt forgiveness for medical students who \nare going to practice primary health care, dental care, or nursing in \nunderserved areas.\n  We desperately need more primary health care physicians. Certainly we \nhave to change reimbursement rates, but one way we can help is that \nwhen medical school students are graduating with $150,000 in debt, debt \nforgiveness will help them be involved in primary health care. So this \nis an absolutely essential provision we have got to adopt. We have to \ndo what the House did and provide at least $14 billion more for primary \nhealth care, an expansion of community health centers and the National \nHealth Service Corps.\n\n[[Page S13151]]\n\n  There is another issue. I know there are not many people in this \ninstitution who agree with me--although there are millions of Americans \nwho do--that at the end of the day we have to understand that one of \nthe reasons our current health care system is so expensive, so \nwasteful, so bureaucratic, so inefficient is that it is heavily \ndominated by private health insurance companies whose only goal in life \nis to make as much money as they can. We have 1,300 private insurance \ncompanies administering thousands and thousands and thousands of \nseparate plans, each one designed to make a profit. The result is we \nare wasting about $400 billion a year on administrative costs, \nprofiteering, high CEO compensation packages, advertising, and all the \nother stuff that goes with the goal of private insurance companies to \nmake as much money as they can. So I will be offering on the floor of \nthe Senate, I believe for the first time in history, a national single-\npayer program, and I look forward to getting a vote on that.\n  I am not naive; I know we will lose that vote. But I will tell you, \nat the end of the day--not this year, not next year, but sometime in \nthe future--this country will come to understand that if we are going \nto provide comprehensive quality care to all of our people, the only \nway we will do that is through a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system, \nand I am glad to be able to start that debate by offering that \namendment.\n  But more importantly for the immediate moment, we have language in \nthis legislation which must be improved which gives States--individual \nStates--the right, if they so choose, to go forward with a great deal \nof flexibility in order to provide quality care to all of their people. \nMany States may look at a single payer, other States may look at other \napproaches. But I believe it is absolutely imperative--and I am working \nwith Senator Ron Wyden on this issue--to give maximum flexibility to \nStates to be able to take the money that otherwise would be coming in \nto their State to use for their own innovative health care programs \ndesigned to provide quality, universal, comprehensive health care in a \ncost-effective way. Some may choose to go single payer, some may choose \nto go in another direction. We have language in there which must be \nimproved so that States can begin that process when the exchange comes \ninto effect in 2014.\n\n  I want to touch on two other issues briefly. The House has very good \nlanguage in determining how we are going to pay the $800 billion to \n$900 billion we are spending. What the House says is there should be a \n5.4 percent surtax on adjusted gross income above $2.4 million for \nindividuals and $4.8 million for couples. That means nobody in this \ncountry who is making less than $2.4 million or less than $4.8 million \nas a couple will pay one nickel.\n  What we have here in the Senate, unfortunately, is a tax on health \ninsurance programs which, in fact, will result in the middle class \npaying, over a period of time, a not so insignificant amount of money \nas part of this process.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, in joining me, Senators Brown and Franken \nare supporting this amendment, as well as the AFL-CIO, the National \nEducation Association, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the \nCommunication Workers of America, the United Steelworkers of America, \nthe American Postal Workers Union, and many other organizations \nrepresenting millions of Americans.\n  The bottom line here is that at a time when we are in the worst \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression, do we want to ask the \nmiddle class to pay more in taxes as part of health care reform or \nshould we ask the wealthiest people in this country to start paying \ntheir fair share of taxes? I think the evidence is overwhelming that we \nshould do that.\n  I would point out that, according to the consultant group Mercer, the \nSenate tax on health insurance plans--despite what we are hearing about \na so-called Cadillac plan--would hit one in five health insurance plans \nin 2013. The CBO has estimated that this tax would affect 19 percent of \nworkers with employer-provided health coverage in 2016. So what we have \ngot to do is junk the tax on health insurance plans, move to the House \nprovision, which says let us ask the wealthiest people in this country \nto pay a modest amount in order to make sure many more Americans have \nhealth insurance.\n  The last point I want to make is that in the current bill being \ndebated now there is a provision which deals with the reimportation of \nprescription drugs. This is an issue I have been involved in almost \nsince I have been in the Congress. I was the first Member of the \nCongress to take Americans into Canada, across the dividing line, in \norder to purchase low-cost prescription drugs. I will never forget the \nreality that women who were with me from Franklin County, VT, ended up \npaying one-tenth the price for Tamoxifen--a widely used breast cancer \ndrug--than they had been paying in the United States. They pay one-\ntenth the price in Montreal, Canada, for the same exact medicine.\n  We have to be bold. I know and you know that the drug companies are \nvery powerful. They are delighted that the American people are paying \nby far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That is \ngood for them. They are making a lot of money. But it is not good for \nthe average American who cannot afford to buy the prescription that his \nor her doctor is writing. So we have to pass prescription drug \nreimportation. We have to lower the cost of prescription drugs in this \ncountry significantly.\n  The bottom line here is that this bill has a number of very important \nfeatures which I think will make life easier for a lot of our fellow \nAmericans. There are problems remaining, and I hope that in the coming \nweeks we will successfully address those problems.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Nelson \nfrom Florida be allowed to speak for 10 minutes; after that, that I be \nallowed to speak for 10 minutes; after that, that Senator Murkowski \nspeak for 10 minutes; and after that, Senator Dodd. Following that--\nSenator Murkowski for 20 minutes, I am sorry; and after that, Senator \nDodd.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is a wonder this health care \nbill has survived this far with so many people shooting at it. But \nsurvive it must and survive it will, because it is the right thing to \ndo. With a country that has 46 million people who do not have health \ninsurance, when they do get health care, it costs the rest of us a lot \nof money because they get it free in the most expensive place. That is \nnot a system that is operating as it should and that is what this whole \neffort is about. This whole effort is about trying to help people who \ncannot get insurance get it--those who desperately want it, who cannot \nget it, to be able to get it--and those who have it to not have it \ncanceled on them in the middle of their treatments.\n  It is all about people who desperately want insurance suddenly having \nan excuse from an insurance company: No, you can't get insurance \nbecause you have a preexisting condition. Some of those preexisting \nconditions are the flimsiest excuses. But what about those who have had \na heart attack who definitely desperately need health insurance after \nthat? This legislation is all about folks who desperately want \ninsurance and they finally find an insurance company that will insure \nthem and then they cannot afford it.\n  Why, in America, in the year 2009 and almost 2010, aren't we at the \npoint of being able to give our people the confidence, the \nsatisfaction, the loss of fright that they cannot take care of their \nfamilies if they get sick? That is what this legislation is all about.\n  But everybody and his brother and sister are taking these potshots \nand every special interest that has their finger in the pie wants their \nshare of the pie and to heck with anybody else. This is what we are \ntrying to overcome. We are trying to overcome a system that has built \nup since World War II, over the last 60 years, that is inefficient and \nis not giving the health care\n\n[[Page S13152]]\n\nto the people who desperately need it, unless they can afford it.\n  So despite all these potshots, survive this bill, it must and survive \nit will. We are going to pass this bill, and somehow we are going to \nget 60 votes cobbled together to break this filibuster so we can get on \nto the final passage of this legislation.\n  I wish to give one example. You remember that story, that famous \nnovel, ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' about London and Paris? I am going to \ngive you a story, a tale of two industries and what they are doing in \nthis bill. One industry is the insurance industry, the other industry \nis the pharmaceutical industry--two industries that have an enormous \ninterest in the outcome and high stakes in how this legislation comes \nout. On the one hand is the insurance industry. They are running TV ads \nall over this country, trying to torpedo this. If you watch those 30-\nsecond and 60-second ads, you would think this is the worst thing that \nis going to bankrupt America, and we are not going to have anybody \ngiven any insurance. Why are they doing this? Because they know they \nare going to have to suddenly act responsibly. They are not going to be \nable to have the excuse of a preexisting condition, they are not going \nto be able to cancel your policy in the middle of your treatment. You \nthought they would come to the table, when suddenly we were going to \ninsure an additional 46 million people, that they were going to get all \nthose premiums. But because the subsidies were not enough for the poor \npeople or, if they did not buy that insurance in the health insurance \nexchange that the penalty wasn't enough, the insurance industry said: \nForget it.\n  Contrast that with the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical \nindustry, to their credit, is still supporting this bill. That is very \ngood. They are one of the few deep-pocketed industries that can go out \nand buy TV time and support this bill. But remember when I said \neverybody has their finger in the pie? The pharmaceutical industry--I \nwant them to know how much I appreciate what they have done, but they \ncan do more. Let me give a case in point. They say in their so-called \n$80 billion contribution that $20 billion of that is to have a 50-\npercent discount on their brand-named drugs in the doughnut hole. The \ndoughnut hole is that vast amount--of about $3,000 that senior \ncitizens, once Medicare helps them get up to it--it is about $2,300--\nabove that all the way up to about $5,300 the Medicare recipient \ndoesn't get any reimbursement. It is not until that higher level that \ncatastrophic Medicare coverage kicks in.\n  What the pharmaceutical industry has said is they will come in and \ngive a 50-percent discount. Of their $80 billion contribution, that is \nworth $20 billion. But here is what they didn't tell you. Again, I am \nspeaking very favorably for them because they are supporting the \nlegislation. But this is what they did not tell you. They did not tell \nyou, with that 50-percent discount, that, No. 1, they are going to have \nincreased sales of their brand-name drugs to the tune of $5 billion \nover this 10-year period in the doughnut hole because they are selling \nmore drugs in the doughnut hole; and because that means more people get \nabove that $5,300 level and get it into catastrophic coverage, that \nthey are going to be able to sell, incremental sales, another $25 \nbillion or a total of increased sales of $30 billion.\n  They are going to contribute $20 billion, but they are going to get \n$30 billion additional. So they come out a net $10 billion over 10 \nyears to the good.\n  What I would ask the pharmaceutical industry--that we appreciate--to \ndo is come in and give a 100-percent discount and, by their open \nnumbers, they have come up with, in a study by Morgan Stanley--by their \nown numbers, a 100-percent discount would cost them $40 billion over 10 \nyears, but they would reap back, by Morgan Stanley's numbers, $60 \nbillion. They would be, the pharmaceutical industry would be $20 \nbillion to the good.\n  It is a tale of two industries. One is the insurance industry, which \ngrabbed its bag of marbles and said you are not making the penalties \nsevere enough, we are taking our bag of marbles and we are going home \nand we are going to try to defeat your bill.\n  No. 2, the pharmaceutical industry, which has still hung in there but \nwhich can do a lot more. I hope, as we get into these negotiations, \nthey will be willing to step up and set the example of health care \nreform in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me talk for a moment about one aspect of \nthe health care legislation that has been of great concern to our \nNation's Governors. The Presiding Officer can certainly appreciate the \nproblem since, among other Governors and former Governors, the \nPresiding Officer had the responsibility of balancing a State budget \nwith one of the largest obligations, being the payment for the Medicaid \npatients.\n  My Governor, Jan Brewer, of Arizona, was in town last week. She \ntalked to me about the problem. She sent me a letter which, in a \nmoment, I will ask to be printed in the Record. But as a result of that \nconversation, I wish to point out some things to my colleagues and hope \nwe can revisit the legislation that is on the floor.\n  Incidentally, before we do that, let me note the fact that my \ncolleague from Florida referred a moment ago to a filibuster. I wish to \nbe clear. I presume he was not referring to Republicans filibustering \nthe bill, since we have been asking to have votes on the pending \namendment, which is the Crapo amendment, since 6 days ago when that \namendment was posited. As a matter of fact, the Republican leader on \nSunday finally had to file cloture on the Crapo amendment, which will \nripen tomorrow morning, to end the filibuster the majority has been \nconducting.\n  I understand members of the majority have not been able to decide how \nto proceed. But in the meantime, we have not been able to vote on any \npending amendments. Republicans would like to do that, would like to \nget some more amendments up and continue on with our debate on the \nbill. For a bill this important, we should have been able to dispose of \na lot more amendments than we have. So lest anybody believe there is a \nRepublican filibuster going on, I hasten to add that, of course, is not \ntrue.\n  Let me talk about the Medicaid features of this bill. It is against \nthe backdrop of unemployment because, as you get more people on \nunemployment, you are going to have more people on the Medicaid rolls. \nArizona's unemployment rate has risen 6 points just since June of 2007 \nand more and more of our people are, therefore, eligible for our \nMedicaid Program, which is known in Arizona as the AHCCCS Program.\n  Currently, one in five Arizonans is covered through AHCCCS; over \n200,000 Arizonans have enrolled in AHCCCS since December 31. That is \nnearly 20,000 new enrollees every month. So we are talking about a \nsubstantial burden as a result of the recession we are in on our State \ngovernment.\n  As my State and many others have had to deal with the challenges of \nthe recession, declining State revenues, increasing need for certain \nState services, the last thing Washington should do is make things even \nharder for the States. Yet that is exactly what the Reid bill would do. \nThe Reid bill would require States to expand Medicaid eligibility to \nall children, parents, and childless adults up to 133 percent of \nFederal poverty, beginning January 1, 2014, and there is even talk now \nof raising that to 150 percent of poverty. Moreover, the Federal \ngovernment would only foot the bill for 3 years. In 2017, and in \nsubsequent years, the States would have to help finance this expansion. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that $25 billion in new State \nspending would result in the Reid bill.\n  The Arizona Governor's office estimates this bill would require the \nState of Arizona to increase its costs by almost $4 billion, between \nnow and 2020. The State of Arizona does not have that kind of money.\n  Just the so-called woodwork effect alone, meaning the number of \ncurrently eligible individuals who might enroll, would itself entail \nsignificant costs. There are about 200,000 Arizonans currently eligible \nbut not all are enrolled in Medicaid. If only half those individuals \nwould enroll, it would cost the State $2 billion, from 2014 to 2019.\n\n[[Page S13153]]\n\n  As I said, our State simply doesn't have the money to do that. Our \nArizona Governor wrote to Chairman Baucus stating her strong opposition \nto the Medicaid expansion. I ask unanimous consent that her letter, \ndated October 6, to Chairman Baucus be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Let me read a few key excerpts.\n  First:\n\n       Arizona cannot afford our current Medicaid program, despite \n     the fact that we have one of the lowest per member per year \n     costs in the country. Arizona's General Fund spending on our \n     Medicaid agency has increased by 230 percent over the past \n     ten years, rising from 8 percent of total General Fund \n     spending in fiscal year 1998-1999 to 16 percent ten years \n     later. As part of the solutions for our current year's budget \n     shortfall, we have had to reduce Medicaid provider \n     reimbursement by over $300 million and freeze institutional \n     reimbursement rates, resulting in an additional loss of more \n     than $60 million.\n       Despite these reductions, we are sacrificing other state \n     programs that impact the education, health and safety of our \n     children and our seniors in order to cover the growing costs \n     of Medicaid. Considering this, it is incomprehensible that \n     Congress is contemplating an enormous unfunded entitlement \n     mandate on the states. The disconnect between policymakers in \n     Washington and the reality of State and local governments is \n     disheartening.\n\n  Let me quote from some other colleagues of Governor Brewer's, \nDemocratic and Republican Governors around the country who have made \nexactly the same point.\n  The newly elected chairman of the Democratic Governors Association \nchairman is Jack Markell of Delaware. He said:\n\n       We've got concerns . . . And we're doing our best to \n     communicate them. We understand the need to get something \n     done, and we're supportive of getting something done. But we \n     want to make sure it is done in a way that state budgets are \n     not negatively impacted. . . . But I believe all governors \n     are certainly concerned about what the potential impact is of \n     some of these bills.\n\n  Governor Rendell of Pennsylvania, who has been on television a lot \nand makes a lot of sense when he talks about this:\n\n       I don't think it's an accounting trick. I think it's an \n     unfunded mandate. We just don't have the wherewithal to \n     absorb that without some new revenue source.\n\n  Bill Richardson of New Mexico:\n\n       We can't afford that, and that's not acceptable.\n\n  Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee said he feared Congress was about to \nbestow ``the mother of all underfunded mandates.''\n  He was referring to this Medicaid mandate.\n  Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington State:\n\n       As a governor, my concern is that if we try to cost-shift \n     to the states, we're not going be in a position to pick up \n     the tab.\n\n  Bill Ritter, Democrat of Colorado:\n\n       Our only point was that a significant Medicaid expansion \n     should not operate as an unfunded mandate for the states.\n\n  Gov. Brian Schweitzer, Democrat of Montana:\n\n       The governors are concerned about unfunded mandates, \n     another situation where the federal government says you must \n     do X and you must pay for it.\n\n  Let me quote two more.\n  Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio:\n\n       The states, with our financial challenges right now, are \n     not in a position to accept additional Medicaid \n     responsibilities.\n\n  Governor Perdue of North Carolina:\n\n       The absolute deal breaker for me a governor is a federal \n     plan that shifts costs to the States.\n\n  There are more and more I could quote. The point is, virtually all of \nthe Nation's Governors have expressed a concern about this and have \nalluded in one way or another to the disconnect between Washington and \nthe States. The point is, Washington seems to bark the orders but it is \nwith no regard to the difficult financial challenge many of these \nStates are in.\n  One final point. These new unfunded mandates generally mean higher \ntaxes and significant payment cuts to safety net providers, just as \nGovernor Brewer said, and ultimately the loss of jobs. This is the \nexample I want to close with. Phoenix Children's Hospital was built to \nhandle 20,000 emergency cases a year. It is a great hospital. It \nreceives about 60,000 per year. Its capacity does not begin to match \nthe need. To meet the demand--and by the way, more than half of these \nare Medicaid patients--the hospital built a new tower expected to open \nat the end of next year. Good news, right? Not exactly. The hospital \nhas added up the State budget cuts Governor Brewer referred to, the \npayment cuts in the Reid bill I have referred to, and additional State \ncuts that will be needed to finance new Federal mandates, and concluded \nthat the math doesn't add up. As a result, the Phoenix Children's \nHospital informs me they will not be able to move into their new \nbuilding. It would have generated 2,000 new jobs. What we do in \nWashington has real consequences. I submit the Reid bill spells \ndisaster for States.\n  As we debate more and more features of this bill, each day we focus \non something different in this legislation that creates a huge problem. \nToday's focus is on the problem that is focused on States because of \nthe visit from our Governor. She is at her wit's end because they don't \nhave the fiscal means of paying for this new unfunded mandate. She \ndoesn't know what they will do if Congress ends up passing this. I urge \ncolleagues, we have to find a way to not expand the Medicaid \neligibility in a way that adds this new mandate on our States. \nIncidentally, if the Federal Government were to pick it all up, it \nsimply transfers it to the citizens in the form of higher taxes they \nwould have to pay in order to pay for the mandate that is laid off on \nto the States themselves. One way or another, this element of the bill \nhas to be rethought.\n  I encourage my colleagues on the other side, figure out what you need \nto do to reach a vote so that we can actually vote on these amendments. \nRepublicans are ready. We have been ready for a long time now. Whatever \nit is that is causing a problem within your conference, figure it out \nso you can reach agreement with the Republican leader and we can begin \nto take votes starting on the Crapo motion and then move on through \nother amendments we have, one of which is the amendment by Senators \nHutchison and Thune, then an amendment by Senator Snowe, and then an \namendment I hope we will be able to offer at some time to remove this \nunfunded mandate which the States cannot afford to pay for about which \nI have been talking.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 Executive Office,\n\n\n                                             State of Arizona,\n\n                                        Phoenix, AZ, Oct. 6, 2009.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate, Chairman, Senate Finance Committee, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus: I have been following the debate on \n     federal healthcare reform with interest, and I have been \n     working closely with members of Arizona's Congressional \n     delegation to make sure they are well informed about the \n     impact of the various proposals on our state. I am concerned \n     that the proposals under consideration thus far do not \n     consider the fiscal difficulties states are facing and are \n     likely to continue to face over the next few years. Like \n     many, I was particularly focused on the proposal that would \n     emerge from the Senate Finance Committee, and I hoped that \n     your plan would appropriately address state concerns. Given \n     the continued lack of attention to state issues in the \n     Chairman's Mark, I believe it is critical to provide you with \n     my perspective on the state of my state, and how your \n     proposal will impact Arizona.\n       By way of background, Arizona is wrestling with one of the \n     most challenging economic downturns in state history. \n     Arizona's economy is heavily focused on construction, real \n     estate and the service sector, all of which have experienced \n     declines that have combined to create a severe and lasting \n     recession. While experts are expressing reserved optimism \n     that the national economy may be turning the corner, it is \n     likely that states--including Arizona--will not feel that \n     turnaround for some time to come\n       For example, the revenue collections during the most recent \n     fiscal year for Arizona declined by 18 percent. Through the \n     first quarter of the latest fiscal period, revenues from our \n     three major tax sources have decreased an additional 10 \n     percent. Our budget declines are contrasted with our rising \n     Medicaid enrollment, which has grown by 18 percent over the \n     past 12 months. At this time, one in five Arizonans is \n     covered through the Medicaid program and we expect Medicaid \n     enrollment to remain at elevated and unsustainable levels \n     through the near future.\n       Arizona cannot afford our current Medicaid program, despite \n     the fact that we have one of the lowest per member per year \n     costs in the country. Arizona's General Fund spending on our \n     Medicaid agency has increased by 230 percent over the past \n     ten years, rising from 8 percent of total General\n\n[[Page S13154]]\n\n     Fund spending in fiscal year 1998-1999 to 16 percent ten \n     years later. As part of the solutions for our current year's \n     budget shortfall, we have had to reduce Medicaid provider \n     reimbursement by over $300 million and freeze institutional \n     reimbursement rates, resulting in an additional loss of more \n     than $60 million. However, budgetary savings cannot be \n     achieved solely through provider reductions. Arizona also \n     recently made the difficult decision to eliminate coverage \n     for 9,500 parents of children enrolled in our Children's \n     Health Insurance Program. Looking forward to fiscal year \n     2010-2011, we know that further reductions will be necessary.\n       Despite these reductions, we are sacrificing other state \n     programs that impact the education, health and safety of our \n     children and our seniors in order to cover the growing costs \n     of Medicaid. Considering this, it is incomprehensible that \n     Congress is contemplating an enormous unfunded entitlement \n     mandate on the states. The disconnect between policymakers in \n     Washington and the reality of state and local governments is \n     disheartening.\n       These are realities that many states across the country are \n     facing. Arizona's situation, however, is compounded by the \n     fact that we have already expanded our Medicaid program to \n     all residents with incomes under 100 percent of the federal \n     poverty level (FPL). This decision means that, under your \n     proposal, our state will be unable to take advantage of the \n     higher level of federal funding that will be provided to \n     states that have not enacted similar expansions. In essence, \n     the Chairman's Mark penalizes Arizona for its early coverage \n     of non-traditional Medicaid populations, like childless \n     adults.\n       I must also point out my concern that estimates developed \n     at the federal level do not accurately reflect the costs that \n     states will ultimately bear. While I have great respect for \n     the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in this instance, its \n     estimates are substantially below Arizona's fiscal estimates \n     and I believe they understate the cost of expansion. For \n     instance, the CBO analysis estimates the State cost of the \n     Medicaid expansion and ``woodwork'' to be $454 million. \n     Arizona has an estimated 200,000 citizens below 100 percent \n     of the FPL that are currently eligible for Medicaid, but not \n     enrolled. If only half of those individuals enrolled, the \n     cost of this ``woodwork'' effect alone would be over $2.0 \n     billion for FY 2014 through FY 2019, using the traditional \n     Medicaid match. That is a significant difference for just one \n     small state.\n       I want to reiterate my opposition to these unfunded \n     mandates on states. I implore you to bear in mind the fiscal \n     realities states are facing as we attempt to maintain \n     responsible balanced budgets while preserving services for \n     our most vulnerable residents. I hope you find this \n     information useful as you consider the various proposals \n     before you, and please do not hesitate to contact my office \n     should you require additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Janice K. Brewer,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/14/senate-section/article/S13154-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13154-S13156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I know the Senate is focused on health \ncare, but I have come to the floor to speak on another very important \ntopic and that is climate change. I wish to discuss a recent action by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency and the consequences that could \nentail for our economy and why Congress must prevent it from taking \neffect. I remind my colleagues that I have committed to a careful \nevaluation of all the options to address climate change in order to \ndevelop an approach that will benefit both our environment and our \neconomy. Over time it has become increasingly apparent that some \napproaches are better than others. While we have not yet found that \nright approach, we have certainly identified the wrong approach: EPA \nregulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. I believe this \noption should be taken off the table so we can focus our attention on \nmore viable policies.\n  My concerns about this led me to file an amendment in September that \nwould have limited EPA's ability to regulate certain greenhouse gas \nemissions for a period of 1 fiscal year. I offered my amendment for two \nreasons: first, to ensure that Congress had sufficient time to work on \nclimate legislation and to ensure that the worst of our options, EPA \nregulation, did not take effect before that point. Even though Congress \nwas and today remains nowhere close to completing legislation, the \nmajority chose to block debate on my amendment. Since then the EPA has \ncontinued its steady march toward regulation. Last week the \nAdministrator signed an endangerment finding for carbon dioxide and \nfive other greenhouse gases. This finding is supposedly rooted in \nconcerns about the public health and the public welfare. What it really \nendangers is jobs, economic recovery, and American competitiveness. \nSome have praised the endangerment finding as a step forward in our \nNation's efforts to reduce emissions. They view it merely as an \naffirmation of the scientific assertion that human activities \ncontribute to global climate change. Such a conclusion is within EPA's \nauthority and appears to be appropriate given the years of research \nindicating that this is the case. Those same scientific findings \nunderscore my desire to address this challenge in a proactive way.\n  Unfortunately, the endangerment finding is not just a finding. \nDespite what some in the administration have claimed, its effect is not \nlimited to the science of global climate change. In reality, the \nfinding opens the doors to a sweeping and convoluted process that will \nrequire the EPA to issue economywide command and control regulations. \nOnce that finding is finalized, the EPA no longer has discretion over \nwhether they can impose regulations.\n  As the Administrator noted last week, the agency is now obligated and \ncompelled to take action. This is where it becomes evident that EPA \nregulation is an awful choice for climate policy. If a pollutant is \nregulated under one section of the Clean Air Act, it triggers identical \ntreatment in other sections of that statute. So while the EPA initially \nintends to address only mobile source emissions, meaning vehicles, the \nagency will also be required to regulate stationary source emissions as \nwell.\n  Think of it this way: If the EPA attempts to control any greenhouse \ngas emissions, the agency will be required to control all greenhouse \ngas emissions. Because EPA regulations will consist of command and \ncontrol directives rather than market-based decisions, this approach \nwill increase the price of energy, add greatly to administrative costs, \nand create many new layers of bureaucracy that must be cut through.\n  This is why you often see EPA regulations described as intrusive or \nByzantine or maze like. They are all of the above. While the permitting \nprocess that will be created is unclear, the consequences of imposing \nthese regulations are not. The bottom line is, our economy will suffer. \nBusinesses will be forced to cut jobs, if not close their doors for \ngood. Domestic energy production will be severely restricted, \nincreasing our dependence on foreign suppliers as well as threatening \nour national security. Housing will become less affordable and consumer \ngoods more expensive, as we see the impacts of the EPA's regulations \nripple and break their way across our economy.\n  In the wake of the majority's decision to block my effort to \nestablish a 1-year timeout for this process, we now find ourselves in a \nbit of a bind. Even though Congress is working on climate legislation, \nthe EPA is proceeding with a tremendously expensive regulatory scheme. \nIt appears increasingly likely that the EPA will finalize its \nregulations before Congress has an opportunity to complete debate on \nclimate legislation. That outcome is simply unacceptable as our Nation \nstruggles to regain its economic footing.\n  Today I have come to announce that I intend to file a disapproval \nresolution under the provisions of the Congressional Review Act related \nto the EPA's endangerment finding. I have this resolution drafted. I \nwill introduce it as soon as the EPA formally submits its rule to \nCongress or publishes it in the Federal Register, as is required by \nlaw. My resolution would stop the endangerment finding. In general \nterms, I am proposing that Congress veto it. Like my previous \namendment, this one is also rooted in a desire to see Congress pass \nclimate legislation because the policy is sound on its own merits and \nnot merely as a defense against the threat of harmful regulations.\n  While I know that passage of this resolution will be an uphill \nbattle, I believe it is in our best interest. It is the best course of \naction available to us. This is a chance to ensure that Congress, not \nunelected bureaucrats, decides how our Nation will reduce its \nemissions.\n  To understand why my resolution is so critically important, we have \nto dig deeper into the economic consequences that will result from \nregulations based upon the endangerment finding. Because there are no \nregulations within\n\n[[Page S13155]]\n\nthe finding itself, the agency has omitted any projection of what they \nmight cost our Nation.\n  Even though the EPA has not prepared projections of what these \nregulations will cost, I expect the totals would be staggering. The \nprice tags attached to the climate bills pending in the Senate, which a \nmajority of Members have concluded are too high, would almost certainly \npale in comparison.\n  There are a few figures that can help us put the potential costs in \nperspective. In one of its recent proposals, the EPA noted that some 6 \nmillion ``sources'' could be required to obtain new operating permits \nif greenhouse gases are regulated. The word ``sources'' refers to the \nbusinesses, schools, hospitals, and other fixtures found in every town \nin America that would suddenly face scrutiny due to their carbon \nfootprints. Farms, landfills, and any other ``source'' that emits more \nthan 250 tons of greenhouse gases per year would be caught in the same \nnet.\n  Facing the heaviest regulation will be the facilities that are \nsubject to the Clean Air Act's ``Prevention of Significant \nDeterioration'' permitting process. This is referred to as ``PSD.'' \nToday, 300 facilities are covered by that requirement. Under EPA \nregulation, that number would soar to 40,000. The PSD process prevents \nexisting facilities from making certain modifications until the EPA has \ngranted its approval. The same holds true for new construction as well. \nAny facility expected to emit more than 250 tons per year would not be \nallowed to break ground until their owners have secured the EPA's \npermission to proceed.\n  The PSD process is already hugely expensive and time-consuming for \naffected facilities. It can take years, and cost tens if not hundreds \nof thousands of dollars, to navigate the PSD process. And that is true \ntoday, well before the number of facilities it covers is increased by \nan order of magnitude.\n  Earlier this year, in sharing their reference for congressional \naction, the editors of the Washington Post provided a pretty good \ndescription of what EPA regulation would be like on a daily basis. They \nstated in their editorial:\n\n       The EPA in theory . . . could go shopping mall by shopping \n     mall, apartment building by apartment building . . . But even \n     plant by plant, how can you ``limit'' greenhouse gas? The \n     short answer is, you can't. Or, no one knows. Or, you can't, \n     yet. Take, for example, a coal-fired power plant. EPA \n     regulation would be triggered only when someone wanted to \n     build one or update an old one. At that point, the agency \n     could demand that the plant use the ``best available control \n     technology'' (BACT) to limit emissions.\n\n  The editorial goes on to state:\n\n       Right now, no such BACT exists for coal-fired plants beyond \n     better efficiency measures. A lot of attention has been \n     focused on carbon capture and sequestration, but it wouldn't \n     be considered BACT until it was up and running successfully \n     in a coal-fired power plant somewhere in the United States. \n     Even then, its use would have to be weighed against a number \n     of other factors, such as the amount of energy used, the \n     environmental impact and the effect on the output of other \n     regulated pollutants. If past practice applies, the issuance \n     of the final permit would be followed by a series of \n     lawsuits. The whole process could take a decade or more--and \n     that would be multiplied hundreds or thousands of times \n     across the country.\n\n  No one is more aware of how damaging these regulations could be than \nthe EPA itself, so it is no surprise the agency has sought to \ndramatically increase the Clean Air Act's regulatory threshold--from \n250 tons per year right now, to 25,000 tons per year for greenhouse \ngases. As the EPA admitted earlier this year, if the Clean Air Act's \ncurrent threshold is not lifted, ``the administrative burdens would be \nimmense, and they would immediately and completely overwhelm the \npermitting authorities''--meaning, of course, the EPA and its State and \nlocal counterparts.\n  Now, I do give some credit to the EPA for recognizing that the 250-\nton per year threshold is ``not feasible'' for greenhouse gases. While \nmost pollutants are measured in much smaller amounts, greenhouse gases \nare far more abundant.\n  After all, nearly every form of economic activity results in at least \nsome level of emissions. But I am also deeply disturbed that instead of \nrecognizing and accepting that the Clean Air Act is simply not suited \nfor this task, the agency attempted to make it so by ignoring its \nexplicit, statutory requirements.\n  As we all know, whenever an executive agency fails to adhere to the \nlaws passed by Congress, it opens itself up to litigation. The EPA's \nso-called tailoring rule is no exception, and I fully expect that \nlawsuits will be filed if the agency issues it. Once the rule is \nchallenged, I expect the courts will reject it, as it has no legal \nbasis, and restore the regulatory threshold to 250 tons per year. At \nthat point, the agency will be mired in the regulatory nightmare it \nhopes to avoid.\n  In the meantime, it is also worth noting that the EPA is proceeding \nwith the regulation of greenhouse gases even though the tailoring \nproposal is not part of the existing statute. So for all of the \nagency's promises of regulatory relief, and a safety net to help \nminimize the pain associated with these regulations, there is nothing \nbehind that yet. And given the larger conversation that needs to take \nplace about amending the Clean Air Act, that relief may never \nmaterialize.\n  Given the tremendous economic, administrative, and bureaucratic \ndrawbacks associated with EPA regulation, it should come as no surprise \nthat Members of the majority, the administration, and environmental \ngroups have expressed their preference for congressional legislation.\n  The Democratic chairman of the House Agriculture Committee declared \nthat EPA regulation would result ``in one of the largest and most \nbureaucratic nightmares that the U.S. economy and Americans have ever \nseen.'' He went on to add, ``Let me be clear, this is not a \nresponsibility we want to leave in the hands of EPA.''\n  The most senior Member of the House of Representatives, a Democrat, \nwho has served our country for more than half a century, has concluded \nthat EPA regulation would create a ``glorious mess.'' He has also said \nthat, ``As a matter of national policy, it seems to me to be insane \nthat we would be talking about leaving this kind of judgment, which \neverybody tells us has to be addressed with great immediacy, to a long \nand complex process of regulatory action.''\n  Shortly before I filed my amendment in September, the EPA \nAdministrator herself insisted that ``new legislation is the best way \nto deal with climate change pollution.'' You wouldn't guess that by \nlooking at the efforts of some in her agency as they helped to defeat \nmy amendment, but just last week, she reiterated the claim by stating, \n``I firmly believe . . . and the president has said all along that new \nlegislation is the best way to deal with climate change.''\n  With such widespread, high-level, and bipartisan agreement that EPA \nregulation is such a bad idea, you would think it would be easy to \nsuspend the EPA's regulatory efforts. Unfortunately, you would be \nmistaken. Many seem convinced that the threat of EPA regulation will \nforce Congress to work more quickly than it otherwise would.\n  This is not a conspiracy theory. It is an open and well-established \nstrategy on the part of the administration, confirmed just this week \nwhen a senior White House economic official was quoted as saying ``If \nyou don't pass this legislation, then . . . the EPA is going to have to \nregulate in this area . . . And it is not going to be able to regulate \non a market-based way, so it is going to have to regulate in a command-\nand-control way, which will probably generate even more uncertainty.''\n  An author of the House cap-and-trade bill has posed the question: \n``Do you want the EPA to make the decision or would you like your \nCongressman or Senator to be in the room and drafting legislation?'' \ngoing on to say that, ``Industries across the country will just have to \ngauge for themselves how lucky they feel if regarding EPA regulation.'' \nThe Wall Street Journal has referred to this as the `` `Dirty Harry' \ntheory of governance.''\n  This approach is often likened, rather starkly, to ``putting a gun to \nCongress's head.'' Personally, I believe that is a terrible way to \npursue climate policy, and beyond that, a terrible way to govern this \ncountry. It is diffcult to grasp how or why Congress would feel \ncompelled to enact economically damaging legislation in order to stave \noff economically damaging regulations.\n\n[[Page S13156]]\n\nWe are being presented with a false choice that should be rejected \noutright. The majority and the administration are saying: Don't make us \ndo this. My answer to this is, simply: You don't have to.\n  Before concluding, I want to spend a few minutes putting to rest some \nof the criticism that will surely follow my decision to offer a \ndisapproval resolution. During the debate over my last amendment, \nseveral baseless arguments were made. So I would like like to challenge \nanyone who finds reason to oppose my resolution to keep their remarks, \nand thereby this debate, as substantive as possible.\n  First, I want to reiterate my desire to take meaningful action to \nreduce our Nation's greenhouse gas emissions. Such a policy can and \nshould be drafted by Congress, and designed to both protect the \nenvironment and strengthen our economy. I was a cosponsor of a climate \nbill last Congress, and I am continuing to work on legislation that \nwill lead to lower emissions. Senator Bingaman and I spent more than 6 \nmonths developing a comprehensive energy bill in committee, and have \nnow held six hearings on our climate policy options.\n\n  Next, my resolution is not meant to run contrary to the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. Remember, I previously sought \na 1-year delay of this process that would have allowed mobile source \nemissions to be regulated. That amendment was blocked by the majority \nfrom even being considered and, at this point, I am left with little \nchoice but to raise the question of whether the Clean Air Act is \ncapable of effectively regulating greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Finally, I am not interested in trying to embarrass the President, \neither here at home or on the international stage. I have stated \npublicly that I wish the President well in making progress on \ninternational issues. And I think it is safe to acknowledge that I \ndidn't choose to release the endangerment finding on the opening day of \nthe Copenhagen climate conference; that was the EPA's decision. As \nAdministrator Jackson reportedly said, the EPA ``tried to make sure we \nhad something to talk about'' in Copenhagen.\n  Mr. President, I understand I may have come to the end of my 20 \nminutes. I ask unanimous consent for a minute and a half to conclude my \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  If the administration truly wanted something to highlight in \nCopenhagen, it should have prioritized climate legislation over health \ncare. The Senate majority could have devoted weeks spent on a tourism \nbill and other matters to working through a climate bill here on the \nfloor. And even if climate legislation could not be agreed to, Congress \nhas now had nearly 6 months to take up the comprehensive bill we \nreported from the Energy Committee. That bill would have allowed the \nPresident to highlight significant accomplishments on energy \nefficiency, clean energy financing, and renewable energy generation. \nInstead, he is left to tout regulations that his administration doesn't \nreally want, that a wide range of stakeholders dread, and that many \nMembers in both Chambers of Congress actively oppose.\n  We need to only look back to the development of the Clean Air Act \nitself for an example of how this process can, and should, work. The \nproduct of both Presidential leadership and congressional unity, the \n1970 Clean Air Act was unanimously passed by the Senate. I hope the \ncurrent administration will take note of that example. And should we \never reach a point where the President is able to sign climate \nlegislation into law, I truly hope it will be the result of his \nadministration having brought Congress together to complete this \nimportant task.\n  Right now, though, the administration and the majority in Congress \ncontinue to choose a different path. Threatening to disrupt the \nNation's economy until Congress passes a bad bill by the slimmest of \nmargins won't be much of an accomplishment, nor is that approach worthy \nof the institutions and people we serve. It isn't appropriate for a \nchallenge of this magnitude. No policy that results from it will \nachieve our common goals or stand the test of time.\n  As I said earlier, I am submitting this resolution because it will \nhelp prevent our worst option for reducing emissions from moving \nforward. The threat of EPA regulations are not encouraging Congress to \nwork faster, they are now driving us further off course and increasing \nthe division over how to proceed.\n  I understand that some are comfortable with the threat of EPA \nregulations hanging over our heads. But, in closing, I would simply \nremind my colleagues of an observation once made by President \nEisenhower:\n\n       Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do \n     something you want done because he wants to do it.\n\n  What we are dealing with right now isn't leadership--is an attempt at \nleverage. The EPA's endangerment finding may be intended to help \nprotect our environment, but the regulations that inevitably follow \nwill only endanger our economy. That lack of balance is unacceptable. \nWe can cut emissions, but we can't cut jobs. We can move to cleaner \nenergy, but we can't force our businesses to move overseas. It is past \ntime to remove the EPA's thinly veiled and ill-advised threat, and we \ncan do that by passing my resolution and giving ourselves time to \ndevelop a real solution.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from \nConnecticut for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/14/senate-section/article/S13156-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13156-S13157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to resume the conversation about \nthe pending health care proposal.\n  We have had a lot of talk, going back for 60 years, I guess, about \nhealth care. But in the last year, if we tried to calculate the number \nof times there have been meetings and conversations, not including the \nones that occur here on the floor of the Senate but throughout the \nCapitol, both in the other body as well as here, between Members and \nstaffs, it has been voluminous, to put it mildly. We are coming down to \nwhat appears to be the remaining few hours before we will decide as a \nnation whether to move forward or to leave things as they are with the \nhope that one way or the other things may correct themselves in terms \nof the cost, affordability, and quality of health care. So the next few \ndays of debates could largely determine whether, once again, the \nCongress of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, as well as \nthe administration and all of the others who have grappled with this \nissue now for many months, will succumb to what has afflicted every \nother Congress and every other administration and every other group of \npeople since the 1940s. That is our inability to answer the question of \nwhether we can do what almost every other competitor nation of ours \naround the world did decades ago--provide decent, affordable health \ncare for our fellow citizens.\n  If nothing else, this debate has proven how complex this issue is and \nit has demonstrated the wide variety of viewpoints that exist among \nthose not only in this very Chamber but among people across the \ncountry. Certainly, that was evident during this summer's townhall \nmeetings. I held four of them in my State earlier this year. I know \nmost of my colleagues either did telemeetings or conducted them in \ntheir respective States. Because this issue affects one-sixth of our \neconomy and 100 percent of our constituents, not only those here today \nbut obviously the millions yet to come, our debates have been spirited \nand our disagreements at times emotionally charged, not only here in \nthis Chamber but across the country.\n  So to my Democratic colleagues who still have concerns over aspects \nof the legislation, as all of us do; to any of my Republican colleagues \nwho still desire to put people, as I know they do, ahead of \npartisanship; and to my fellow Americans who worry that politics will \nonce again triumph over progress, which it has for six decades, let me \noffer some context for the debate that begins again this afternoon and \nwill arrive at a closure in a matter of hours and days. The answer \nultimately will be whether we move forward and do what I think the \nmajority of our fellow citizens want us to do or fall back, once again, \ninto the same paralysis that affected Congresses, administrations, and \ngenerations before us.\n  The consensus we have already reached as a Senate is that health care\n\n[[Page S13157]]\n\nreform would represent a significant victory for the American people--I \nthink we all agree on that point--and it would be a significant moment \nin our Nation's history.\n  I think all of us can agree that insurance companies should not be \nallowed to deny coverage because of a preexisting condition, that these \nsame companies shouldn't be able to ration the benefits a family \nreceives, and that citizens of the United States should be guaranteed \nthat the coverage they pay for will be there for them when they need \nit. I think all of us in this Chamber, regardless of party or ideology, \nagree that reform should make insurance more affordable; that it should \nprotect Medicare and keep it solvent so that it will be there for \nfuture generations; and that it should improve the quality of health \ncare for all Americans, focusing on preventing diseases, reducing \nmedical errors, and eliminating waste from our system so that our \nhealth care dollars are used more effectively. I think all of us can \nagree as well, regardless of which side of this debate one is on, that \nreform should empower families to make good decisions about purchasing \ninsurance; empower small businesses to create jobs; empower doctors to \ncare for their patients instead of filling out paperwork; and empower \nthe sick to focus on fighting their illnesses instead of fighting their \ninsurance companies. These are the commonsense reforms that will make \ninsurance a buyer's market, keep Americans healthier, and save families \nand the government an awful lot of money in the years ahead. I think \nall of us share these views--at least that is what I have heard in the \nlast year I have been so intensely involved in this debate and \nformulating the policy that is now before us.\n  If we listen to the distinguished minority leader, our good friend \nfrom Kentucky, we might be surprised to learn that his conference has \ndecided to not just oppose our legislation but, unfortunately, to \nobstruct even further progress. After all, he called for a reform bill \nthat incentivizes workplace wellness, allows people to purchase \ninsurance across State lines, and reduces costs. Our bill does all \nthree things. Let me be specific. On page 80, our bill includes a \nbipartisan proposal allowing employers to offer larger incentives for \nworkplace wellness programs. On page 219 of our bill, it includes a \nRepublican proposal allowing health plans to be sold across State \nlines. On page 1 of the Congressional Budget Office analysis of this \nbill, the Congressional Budget Office concludes that our bill would cut \nthe deficit of our Nation by $130 billion over the next 10 years--the \nsingle largest budget deficit reduction since 1997.\n  In a body of 100, as we are, in which both parties claim to agree on \nthese principles, we should be able to achieve, one would think, a \nbipartisan consensus on a matter of this magnitude. But, sadly, it \nwould seem our colleagues--many of them, again, on the other side of \nthis divide--don't seem to care what is in this bill specifically.\n  I am reminded again, as others have been, of what is actually \nincluded in this bill--not that I would expect them or anyone on this \nside of the divide to agree with everything that is here. We don't. \nThere is not a single Member of this body who would not write this bill \ndifferently if he or she could. There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever \nabout that. But we serve in a collegial body of 100 where we have to \ncome to consensus with each other even when we don't agree with every \nsingle aspect of this bill.\n  Yet, when I read the words of the chairman of the Republican National \nCommittee--and again speaking on behalf of a party, this is why I find \nthis so disheartening. At a time such as this, I expect there to be \nfull debate and disagreement over various ideas. But read, if you will, \nthe words of the national chairman of a major political party in this \ncountry. Here is what he is suggesting his party ought to be doing at \nthis critical hour:\n\n       I urge everyone to spend every bit of capital and energy \n     you have to stop this health care reform. The Democrats have \n     accused us of trying to delay, stall, slow down, and stop \n     this bill. They are right.\n\n  Let's hear that again:\n\n       The Democrats have accused us of trying to delay, stall, \n     slow down, and stop this bill. They are right.\n\n  It is awfully difficult to hear my colleagues talk about wanting to \nget a bill done, wanting to come together, when the chairman of their \nnational party is recommending they do everything in their power to \nstop a bill that, in fact, includes many of the very reforms they \nthemselves embrace.\n  Make no mistake, if the status quo prevails, one thing I can say with \nabsolute certainty--if we do what too many of our friends on the other \nside and clearly what the chairman of the Republican National Committee \nare recommending--I can predict with absolute certainty the outcome, \nand that is that premiums will go up dramatically, health costs will \ncontinue to wreak havoc on small businesses, our deficit will grow \nexponentially, and Americans will see premiums nearly double in the \nnext 4 years. In my state of Connecticut, a family of four is paying \n$12,000 a year right now. It is predicted that those premiums will jump \nto $24,000 within 7 years if we do nothing. That much I can guarantee.\n  For those who argue for the so-called status quo or keeping things \nwhere they are, know that more and more people will lose their health \ninsurance. More families will be forced into bankruptcy. Hundreds of \nthousands of Americans are going to die unnecessarily, in my view, in \nthe name of that obstruction. I don't think we can let that happen. So \nit has fallen to the majority to do alone the job we are all sent here \nto do collectively--the hard and honest work of legislating, as \ndifficult as it is.\n  The factors that make this work so hard are not new or unique to this \ndebate, and, as history shows, they will not be what is remembered a \ngeneration from now. The words that have been spoken here in this \nChamber, the charts, the graphs--all of these things are slowly \nforgotten by history.\n  Today, we hold Medicare up as an example of a program worth \ndefending. How many speeches have been given in the last 2 or 3 weeks \nabout the glories of Medicare? I only wish those Members who are here \ntoday had been present in 1965. We might have been able to pass that \nbill without the partisan debate that took place in those days.\n  Today, no one talks about the 50 years it took to bring Medicare to \nthe floor of the Senate. No one talks about what the polls said in 1965 \nwhen it took a lengthy debate involving more than 500 amendments, by \nthe way, to achieve consensus on Medicare. I might add, nobody attacks \nit as socialized medicine as they did in 1965.\n  It is always easier to envision the legislation we want than it is to \npass legislation we need. Such is the case here this afternoon. We \nwon't end up with a bill that I would have written if it were up to me, \nand it won't be the bill that any one of our colleagues would have \nwritten either.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. But it will be a bill that improves the health care of all \nAmericans. It will be a bill that makes insurance more affordable, \nimproves the quality of care, and helps create jobs in our Nation. It \nwill be a bill that saves money and saves lives. And it will be a bill \nthat decades from now we will remember not for the differences we had \nin this Chamber but for the differences it made in our Nation and for \nthe differences it made for our fellow citizens.\n  To get there, we must build on the consensus we have already reached, \nnot tear it down with the petty weapons of political gamesmanship. We \nmust answer not the call of today's poll or tomorrow's election but the \ncall of history that we have been asked to meet, that other \ngenerations, other Congresses have failed to meet but we are on the \nbrink of achieving.\n  My hope is that all of us will come together in these closing hours \nand do that which many predicted we could not do: pass legislation that \nwe need.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/14/senate-section/article/S13157-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13157-S13177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I wish to start by referring briefly to \nthe remarks made earlier by the Senator from Alaska. She indicated \nearlier on the floor that she is going to be offering a motion of \ndisapproval for a set of\n\n[[Page S13158]]\n\nregulations that are not final yet but have been announced by the EPA \nthat they are coming forward with, the so-called endangerment finding. \nI wish to indicate that I intend to support her on that resolution.\n  I cosponsored the amendment she tried offering earlier this year to \none of the appropriations bills that would have prevented the EPA from \nmoving forward with the endangerment finding for a year, which would \nhave allowed Congress an opportunity to examine this issue and perhaps \napproach it with a legislative solution as opposed to having the EPA \nmove forward in a way even they acknowledge they don't have statutory \nauthority to do.\n  I might say that the end result of what is being proposed at EPA--if \nthey are successful--is they will implement a cap-and-trade program, \nonly it will be a cap without the trade.\n  The reason they are moving forward, in my view, is because there \nisn't the political will in the Congress to pass a punishing cap-and-\ntrade proposal this year. The House of Representatives passed it \nnarrowly this year. There are a number of Members of the House who I \nthink would like to have that vote over again. I know there aren't the \nvotes in the Senate because many Senators on both sides realize the \nimpact it would have on the economy--the number of jobs that would be \nlost in our economy and how it would punish certain parts of our \ncountry with crushing energy costs, at a time when we don't need to \npile costs on small businesses and consumers who are trying to come out \nof a recession.\n  This is a wrongheaded move by the EPA. It is something they should \nnot be acting on independently. This should be resolved by the Congress \nof the United States. Honestly, if the EPA moves forward, there are a \nnumber of industries in South Dakota that will be impacted and a number \nof businesses in my State. If the litigation is successful--and, \ninevitably, there will be lots of lawsuits filed--and if the 25,000-ton \nnumber is reduced to the 250-ton number that is used as a threshhold in \nthe Clean Air Act, there will be literally millions of entities that \nwill be covered--hospitals, churches, farmers, ranchers, and small \nbusinesses.\n  In South Dakota, we have a lot of farmers and ranchers who make their \nliving in small businesses that would be adversely impacted were these \nregulations to be enacted and then move forward with regulating and \nputting the caps in place. If the litigation is successful, we know \nwhat will be subsequent to that.\n  I say that as a lead-in to talk about impacts on small businesses. \nThere are so many things happening right now in Washington that have an \nadverse and detrimental impact on the ability of small businesses to \ncreate jobs. I have heard the President talk about creating jobs--that \nis his No. 1 priority--and we need to give incentives to small \nbusinesses to create jobs. I have heard my colleagues on the other side \ntalk about how important job creation is. Yet everything coming out of \nWashington, whether it is in the form of heavyhanded regulation, such \nas this endangerment finding coming out of EPA, or in the form of a \ncap-and-trade proposal or whether it is this massive expansion of the \nFederal Government--the $2.5 trillion expansion to create a new health \ncare entitlement--all these things are raising clouds over the small \nbusiness sector of our economy, which creates about 70 percent of the \njobs.\n  We are essentially telling small businesses that you may end up with \nthese massive new energy taxes or with this employer mandate that will \ncost you up to $750 per employee if you don't offer the right kind of \ninsurance; you are going to be faced with all these taxes imposed on \nhealth insurers and prescription drugs and medical device manufacturers \nthat will be passed on to you.\n  Then we are saying go out and create jobs, in light of all this \npolicy and uncertainty in Washington, all these proposals to tax and \nspend and borrow more money by the Federal Government. You cannot blame \nsmall businesses for acting with a little bit of hesitancy when it \ncomes to making major capital investments and when it comes to hiring \nnew people.\n  Those are the very things we want small businesses to do. We want to \nencourage that type of behavior. We want to encourage that kind of \ninvestment. We want to encourage job creation. Unemployment is at 10 \npercent. We have lost 3.3 million jobs since the beginning of the year. \nWho will put people back to work? It will be the small businesses in \nour economy. In South Dakota, they are about 96 percent of the game, \nwhen it comes to employment in South Dakota. Here we are debating a \nhealth care reform bill which, in addition to spending $2.5 trillion to \ncreate this new health care entitlement, raises taxes on small \nbusinesses, cuts Medicare, and at the end day, according to the \nexperts--the CBO and the Chief Actuary at the CMS, which is the so-\ncalled referee in all this, who tells us what these things will cost \nand their impact--they have all said premiums will either stay the same \nor go up. So the best small business can hope for under this is the \nstatus quo.\n  I hear my colleagues on the other side coming down here, day after \nday, making statements, saying this is going to be good for small \nbusinesses, and this will help small businesses deal with the high cost \nof health care.\n  The problem with all their arguments is one thing: They are \ncompletely and utterly divorced from reality. You cannot look at this \nhealth care reform proposal and come away from it and say this is a \ngood thing for small businesses, when small businesses are saying this \nwill drive up their cost of doing business, it will raise health care \ncosts, and these taxes you are going to hit us with will make it harder \nto create jobs.\n  Why do we proceed in the face of this and then deny what all these \nsmall businesses are saying, what the experts are saying, and what \nincreasingly the American people are saying, which is that this is a \nbad idea. So why don't you reconsider this and start over again and do \nsome things that will actually lower health care costs. That is what \nsmall businesses are saying.\n  We have people down here saying this is good for small business. What \nare small businesses saying--and large businesses, for that matter. The \nNFIB represents small businesses all over the country. They said:\n\n       This bill will not deliver the widely promised help to the \n     small business community.\n\n  They say:\n\n       It will destroy job creation opportunities for employees, \n     create a reality that is worse than the status quo for small \n     businesses. It is the wrong reform at the wrong time, and it \n     will increase health care costs and the cost of doing \n     business.\n\n  That is the National Federation of Independent Businesses, as I said.\n  How about large businesses? The Chamber of Commerce expressed their \ndisappointment with the Senate health care bill and has weighed in with \nstrong opposition against it. That includes the National Association of \nWholesaler Distributors, the Small Business Entrepreneurship Council, \nthe Association of Builders and Contractors, the National Association \nof Manufacturers, the Independent Electrical Contractors, and the \nInternational Franchise Association. The list goes on and on. The Small \nBusiness Coalition for Affordable Health Care--50 organizations around \nthe country that are members of the group--including many that have \nmembers in South Dakota, not the least of which is the American Farm \nBureau Federation. That represents farmers and ranchers who are still \nbusinesspeople out there trying to make ends meet. They said this:\n\n       Our small businesses and self-employed entrepreneurs have \n     been clear about what they need and want: lower costs, more \n     choices, and greater competition for private interests.\n\n  They say:\n\n       These reforms fall short of long-term, meaningful relief \n     for small business. Any potential savings from these reforms \n     are more than outweighed by the new tax, new mandates, and \n     expensive, new government programs included in this bill.\n\n  That is what small businesses across the country are saying. The \nreason they are saying that is because, as I mentioned, not only are \nthey hit with these taxes every year, there is a tax on health plans \nthat will amount to $60 billion over 10 years, which will be passed on \nto small businesses. There is a new payroll tax, Medicare tax, which \nincidentally, for the first time ever, instead of going to Medicare, \nwill be used to create a new entitlement program. That will hit about \none-third of small businesses in this country, we are told.\n\n[[Page S13159]]\n\n  As I said earlier, they have the employer mandate, which is going to \nhit a whole lot of small businesses--another $28 billion that will hit \nsmall businesses across this country. So you have all these new taxes \nheaped upon our small business sector. The small businesses are saying: \nWhat do we get out of this? What is this going to do to affect our \nhealth care costs?\n  I will show you. This chart represents what the CBO has said health \ncare costs would do if this bill is enacted. The blue line represents \nthe cost of essentially, if you will, doing nothing. In other words, \nthe blue line represents what will happen if Congress does nothing, the \nyear over year increases we are already seeing. It represents the \nstatus quo. We have heard people from the other side say we have to do \nbetter than the status quo. The President and the Vice President say \nthat and our Democratic colleagues say that. You cannot accept the \nstatus quo and then attack Republicans for being in favor of status \nquo. The blue line represents the status quo. The blue line is what \nwill happen year over year, in terms of increases in health insurance \npremiums that small businesses and individuals will deal with.\n  It doesn't matter where you get your insurance--the small business \ngroup market or the large business employer group market or the \nindividual market. If you get it in the individual market, your rates \nwill be 10 to 13 percent higher. I ask unanimous consent to extend my \nremarks for another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. It doesn't matter which market you get your insurance in, \nexcept if you are in the individual market, you will pay much higher \ninsurance premiums than the status quo, which is locking in double the \nrate of inflation premiums for the foreseeable future.\n  The red line on the chart represents the spending under this bill. \nThis is what the CBO says will happen. You will see the cost curve bent \nup, not down. You are going to have more money coming out of our \neconomy to pay for health care than you do today. That is what small \nbusinesses are reacting to. That is why they are coming out strongly \nand adamantly opposed to this legislation. It bends the cost curve up, \nincreases the cost of health care, rather than bending it down. We \nheard the same thing come out of the Actuary of the CMS just last week.\n  Again, the experts are saying--the referees, the people who don't \nhave a political agenda--repeatedly, that this will increase the cost \nof health care. This will drive health insurance premiums higher.\n  The other point I wish to make, because after I have shown you how \nhealth care costs will go up under this legislation, the other amazing \nthing about it--this is, again, one of those phony accounting \ntechniques or gimmicks that Washington uses, the same old business in \nWashington, the Washington smoke and mirrors, the ways of disguising \nwhat this really costs: In order to bring this thing in at about $1 \ntrillion, which is what the majority wanted to do, they had to use \nbudget gimmicks.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire knows all about this because he has \nfollowed this closely as chairman of the Budget Committee for many \nyears. He can attest to the fact that one of the things they will do is \nstart the tax increases immediately. So on January 1 of next year--\nwhich is now 18 short days away--all these businesses across the \ncountry are going to see their taxes go up--in 18 days. But the amazing \nthing about it is, many benefits don't get paid out for another 1,479 \ndays. So they front-load all the tax increases; the tax increases will \nbe passed on immediately. By 2013, every American family will be \npaying--starting next year--$600 a year. So every American family will \nfeel the brunt of the additional costs for taxes and the premium \nincreases that will follow from those.\n  The remarkable thing about it is, they structured a bill that would \npunish small businesses and people who will pay these taxes on January \n1 of 2010--18 days away. They don't pay out benefits for another 1,479 \ndays. What does that do? In the 10-year window they use to measure what \nthis will cost, it dramatically understates the cost of the \nlegislation. So we are faced with not a $1 trillion bill but a $2.5 \ntrillion bill, when it is fully implemented and when all the budgetary \ngimmicks and phony accounting is actually taken into consideration. \nThis is a bad deal for small businesses. That is why all the small \nbusiness organizations have come out opposed to it.\n  You cannot get up, day after day, and defy reality, logic, reason, \nand facts. That is what those who are trying to push this huge \ngovernment expansion and huge takeover of health care in this country \nare trying to have the people believe. They are dead wrong.\n  I believe the American people are tuning in to that, which is why, \nincreasingly, in public opinion polls, they are turning a thumbs down \non this by majorities of over 60 percent.\n  I see the Senator from New Hampshire. I appreciate him indulging me \nfor an extra few minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I appreciate the explanation of the \nSenator from South Dakota of the effects of the bill on small \nbusiness--especially the description of the gimmicks played in the bill \nin order to make it look fiscally responsible, which it is not--the \nfact they use 10 years of revenues in Medicare cuts to offset 5 to 6 \nyears of spending and then they claim somehow it is in balance.\n  I wish to turn to another part of the bill. I think it is important \nto recognize it is not our side so much that is representing the \nfailures of the bill. It is actually the administration itself. The \nadministration's Actuary came forward with a letter analyzing the Reid \nbill. You have to remember the Reid bill isn't necessarily the bill. \nThis is sort of like a ``where is Waldo'' exercise here. We have a bill \ncalled the Reid bill--it is 2,074 pages--which we got 10 days ago. It \ntook 8 weeks to develop it, in camera, by Senator Reid and a few of his \npeople.\n  Now we are told there is going to be a new bill. Nobody has seen it. \nNobody on our side has it. I understand most Members on the other side \nhave not seen it, but it is supposed to be a massive rewrite of the \nReid bill. We can only project what that is through news reports. News \nreports are not very good. They represent they are going to expand \nMedicaid which will be a massively unfunded mandate to States and lead \nto letting people into a system that is fundamentally broken, and you \nare going to let people buy into Medicare age 55 and over.\n  Medicare is insolvent today. It has $35 trillion of unfunded \nliabilities on the books, and they are going to let people buy into \nMedicare. What sort of sense does that make? It means that seniors who \nare on Medicare--and, by the way, Medicare gets cut significantly under \nthis bill--will find Medicare under even more pressure when you put \npeople into it.\n  Turning from those two obvious problems to the potential bill that we \nhave not seen but will be asked to vote on before the week is out, it \nappears, I want to turn to this actuary report done by the CMS Actuary \nwho works for the Department of HHS and whose job it is to evaluate \nthis bill. He works for the President. He is a Federal employee. He is \nin the administration.\n  The CMS made a number of points. Remember, when we started down this \nroad, the President said he wanted to do three things, all of which I \nagreed to: One, he wanted to expand coverage so uninsured would get \ncovered. Two, he wanted to bend the outyears cost curve of Medicare and \nof health care generally in this country so we could afford it. And \nthree, he wanted to make sure if you had insurance, you get to keep it. \nIf you like your insurance, if you like the employer plan you have, you \nget to keep it.\n  What did the Medicare Actuary--this is not the Republican side, this \nis an independent, fair analysis of the Reid bill--what did they say on \nthese three points the President held up as his test for what health \ncare should be?\n  On the issue of whether this bill bends the outyears cost curve--\nwhich we have to do, by the way. If we do not get health care costs \nunder control,\n\n[[Page S13160]]\n\nthere is no way we are going to get our Federal budgets under control. \nWhat did the Actuary say:\n\n       Total national health care expenditures under this bill \n     would increase by an estimated $233 billion during the \n     calendar period 2010 to 2019.\n\n  Instead of going down, they go up. The chart that Senator Thune \nshowed is totally accurate. There is no bending down of the outyear \nhealth costs. There are a lot of reasons for that, and I will go into \nit in a second. Primarily they did not put provisions in the bill I \nwould support and should have been in this bill, such as malpractice \nabusive lawsuit reform, such as expanding HIPAA so companies can pay \npeople to live healthier lifestyles--if you stop smoking, your company \ncould pay you; if you lose weight, your company could pay you--which is \nnot in this bill, which would have bent the cost curve down. Those were \ntaken out of the bill because the trial lawyers opposed the first one \nand the unions opposed the second one.\n  On the second point the President set out as his test, which was \nthere would be coverage for everybody who is uninsured, what did the \nActuary say after he looked at this bill? There are 47 million people \nuninsured. Some people say there are 50 million. The Actuary said after \nthis bill is completely phased in, there will still be 24 million \npeople uninsured. So for $2.5 trillion--that is what the cost of this \nbill is when it is totally phased in--for the creation of a brandnew \nentitlement, for cuts in Medicare which will be $1 trillion over the \n10-year period when the bill is fully phased in, $\\1/2\\ trillion in the \nfirst 10 years, $1 trillion when phased in, $3 trillion of Medicare \ncuts in the first 20 years--for that price, $2.5 trillion, what do you \nget? You still get 24 million people uninsured. Why? Because they set \nthe bar so high on the insurance level people still cannot afford to \nget into it and people will be pushed out of their private insurance. \nThat is the third point.\n  The President said if you like your private plan, you get to keep it. \nThat was his third test. I agree with that. I agree with all these \ntests. We should bend the outyear cost curve and get everybody covered. \nThe third test is if you like your private insurance, you get to keep \nit.\n  What does the Actuary say? Once again, the Actuary works for the \nPresident through HHS. The Actuary says 17 million people will lose \ntheir existing employer-sponsored insurance; 17 million people will be \npushed out of their private plans into this quasi-public plan. Why is \nthat? Because the way this bill is structured, there is so much cost \nshifting that is going on as you put people in Medicaid, which only \npays about 60 percent of the cost of health care of a person getting \nMedicaid, and you put more people into Medicare, which only pays about \n80 percent of what it costs to take care of a Medicare recipient, that \ndifference--that 40 percent in Medicaid, that 20 percent in Medicare--\nhas to be picked up by somebody else. The hospitals have to charge the \nreal rate of what it costs them. The doctors have to charge the real \nrate of what it costs them to see that patient. So they put that cost \non to the private sector. They put it on to private insurance. So the \nprivate sector is subsidizing, the person who gets their insurance \nthrough their company is subsidizing the cost of the person who goes \ninto Medicaid or the cost of the person who goes into Medicare.\n  In fact, today, the private sector is subsidizing the Medicare \nrecipient and the Medicaid recipient through the cost of their \ninsurance by almost $1,700 a year. Madam President, $1,700 a year of \nyour private insurance, if you are insured by an employer plan, is to \npay that gap in reimbursements, that underreimbursement for people who \nare under Medicaid and under Medicare.\n  When you put more people into Medicaid--and this bill assumes 15 \nmillion people are going to go into Medicaid--and you put more people \ninto Medicare and this bill puts people age 55 and over into Medicare, \nyou end up with even more people being subsidized. Who pays for it? \nPrivate insurance. So private employers, especially small businesses, \nsee their insurance price going up. They cannot afford it. They figure \nit is cheaper to pay a penalty, a tax, essentially, under this bill \nthan to keep their insurance for their employees. They have to say to \ntheir employees: Sorry, folks, you have to go over to the quasi-public \nplan. Seventeen million people, the President's Actuary has estimated.\n  There is another point that the President's Actuary makes here. It is \ncritical because this Reid proposal is devastating to a program which \nis also under severe stress, and that is Medicare. We know today that \nbecause of the retirement of the baby boom generation, which doubles \nthe number of retired people in this country from 35 million to 70 \nmillion, which generation will be fully retired by 2016, 2017, 2019, we \nknow today that because of the demands of that generation for health \ncare there is a $38 trillion--that is trillion with a ``t''--unfunded \nliability in Medicare. In other words, there are $38 trillion of costs \nwe know we have to pay but have no idea how we are going to pay it. No \nidea. The insurance system does not support it.\n  That program is under a lot of stress right now as it stands. As it \nstands, it is under a lot of stress. But when you start cutting that \nplan even further, which is what is proposed in this bill--under this \nbill there is approximately a $500 billion cut in the first 10 years \nfor Medicare, $1 trillion in the second 10-year period when it is fully \nphased in, and $3 trillion over the 20 years. When you cut Medicare \nbeneficiaries by those amounts and you eliminate essentially Medicare \nAdvantage for probably a quarter of the people who get it today, \nproviders can no longer afford to provide the benefits to their \nrecipients, to the Medicare patient. They cannot make a profit.\n  Again, you are going to say, oh, that is just a Republican throwing \nout some language here. No, it is not. That is the Chief Actuary of the \nPresident of the United States say saying that. Let me read to you: \nBecause of the bill's severe cuts to Medicare, ``providers for whom \nMedicare constitutes a substantive portion of their business could find \nit difficult to remain profitable and might end their participation in \nthe program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries).''\n  That is a quote from the President's Actuary. The Actuary suggests \nthat approximately 20 percent of all Part A providers--that is doctors, \nhospitals, and nursing homes--would become unprofitable as a result of \nthe Reid bill. What happens when you become unprofitable? You close. \nPeople will not be available to deliver the care to the senior citizens \nunder this proposal.\n  The representation from the other side of the aisle is, oh, we don't \ncut any Medicare benefits. They cut Medicare benefits from Medicare \nAdvantage, but what they do is cut provider groups. If you don't have \nsomebody who is going to see you, you can have all the benefits in the \nworld and it is not going to do you any good. That is clearly a very \nsignificant cut in benefits. It is not me saying this. It is the \nActuary saying this.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. So this is a critical point, that under this bill, the \nMedicare Actuary has said four major things: first, that it doesn't \nbend the cost curve down, it bends it up. Second, it leaves 24 million \npeople uninsured when fully implemented. Third, 17 million people will \nlose their private insurance and be forced into quasi-public plans. And \nfourth, there are a lot of providers of Medicare who are going to go \nunder and, therefore, will not be available to provide Medicare. That \nis not constructive to the health care debate.\n\n  How should we do this? I will tell you some things we should do that \nare not in this bill, things which are sort of a step-by-step approach, \nrather than this massive attempt written in the middle of the night, \ndropped on our desks for 8 days, 10 days, or for however long. Why \ndon't we try to take a constructive, orderly approach? We know there \nare sections of insurance reform that can occur across State lines. We \nknow we can do things if we set up the proper coverage scenario for \npreexisting conditions so people do not lose their insurance because of \na preexisting condition. We know there is a lot of market insurance \nreform that can be done. We also know if we curtail or at least limit \nabusive lawsuits, we can save massive\n\n[[Page S13161]]\n\namounts of money. We know there is $250 billion of defensive medicine \npracticed every year in this country. CBO scores it as a $54 billion \nimmediate savings just like the plans they have in Texas and \nCalifornia, which work. Why isn't it in this bill? The trial lawyers \ndidn't want it.\n  We know if we say to employers you can pay more to employees in the \nway of cash benefits if they stop smoking, get mammograms when they \nshould, get colonoscopies when they should, reduce weight so they are \nnot subject to obesity issues--if you do that, you get huge cost \nsavings. Some employers, such as Safeway, have already proven that. Why \ndon't we do that under this law? Because labor unions don't want that \nlaw, which was actually in the bill passed out of the HELP Committee, \nbut it was out of this bill.\n  We know there are certain diseases that drive costs in this country--\nobesity, Alzheimer's. Why not target those diseases rather than this \nmassive bill, $2.5 trillion bill which our kids cannot afford? Change \nthe reimbursement system so we reimburse doctors for quality and value \nrather than quantity and repetition. Things such as that can be done.\n  If you want to insure everyone, which I do, you can follow the \nsuggestion I and other people have made around here. Let people buy \ninto a catastrophic plan, especially the young and healthy, people \nbetween the ages of 20 and 45. They don't need these gold-plated plans \nor bronze-plated plans which have excessive amounts of mandated \ncoverage in them. They don't need them. What they need is a plan that \nsays if they are severely injured or they contract a very difficult \ndisease, they are going to have coverage so their responsibility of \ncare does not fall on the rest of the country. That can be done.\n  There are a lot of specific things that can be done to improve our \nhealth care system without this quasi-nationalization effort which is \ngoing to expand the size of the government so dramatically by $2.5 \ntrillion that there is no possible way our kids are going to be able to \nafford the debt that is going to come on to their backs as a result of \nthis because this will not be fully paid for, in my opinion.\n  Certainly, we can at least look at the points made by the Actuary of \nthe President who has disagreed with four of the core proposals in this \nbill, saying they do not meet the tests which were set out for good \nhealth care reform and say in those areas: Let's go back and take \nanother look; let's start over again; let's do it right. That is our \nproposal. Let's do it right rather than rush this bill through.\n  Remember, most of the programs in this bill do not start until 2014. \nSo why do we have to pass it before Christmas, especially when we have \nnot even seen the final bill? It makes no sense at all.\n  Listen to the Actuary of the President and let's get this right.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleagues from Vermont and Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues in \nthe Senate to support Senate amendment No. 3135 to replace the proposed \nexcise tax with a surtax that would affect only those making literally \nmillions of dollars a year. Senator Brown and Senator Sanders, with \nwhom I will engage in this colloquy, have shown tremendous leadership \non the issue, and I thank them and join them in their efforts.\n  Before I get into this, though, I want to answer a couple of things I \nhave seen and heard on the Senate floor. I walked in and my colleague \nfrom South Dakota, Senator Thune, had a chart up. He had a chart up \nthat said when your taxes will kick in and when your benefits will kick \nin. So I didn't hear the whole speech, and I felt bad about that--not \nhaving heard his whole speech--and I went up to him and said: I didn't \nhear your whole speech.\n  And he said: Oh, man, that's too bad.\n  But I said: Did you actually happen to mention any of the benefits \nthat do kick in right away?\n  And he said: No.\n  So I think we are entitled to our own opinions, but we are not \nentitled to our own facts. Benefits kick in right away. If you are \ngoing to hold up a chart that says when taxes kick in and when benefits \nkick in, and you say 1,800 days, you better include the benefits that \ndo kick in right away.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, will the Senator from Minnesota yield for \na question?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. THUNE. Did the Senator understand that what I was pointing out on \nthe chart--the point I was making--was that the tax increases start 18 \ndays from now, and the benefits--the spending benefits under the bill, \nwhich are the premium tax credits and the exchanges that are designed \nto provide the benefits delivered under this bill--don't start until \n2014. Did the Senator miss that?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Does the Senator understand that spending benefits start \nright away?\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator missed that point, I can get the chart out.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I asked a question. I yielded to you for a question. I \nam asking you a question. Does the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota may only yield for \na question, and the Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Has to what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the floor.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I have the floor. The Senator from South Dakota said: \nDid I realize he was talking about the spending doesn't start for 1,800 \ndays on health care--that the benefits don't start. Well, here is one: \n$5 billion in immediate Federal support starts immediately for a new \nprogram to provide affordable coverage to uninsured Americans with a \npreexisting condition.\n  I don't know about anyone else in this body----\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I yield.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is exactly right, what Senator Franken says. The $5 \nbillion is for the high-risk pool--people who have the most trouble \nbecause of preexisting conditions, because of the behavior of insurance \ncompanies. And this debate is really all about the insurance companies. \nMy friends on the other side of the aisle always come down with the \ninsurance companies. The insurance companies really are the ones that \nare driving so much waste and so much bad behavior in the system.\n  Another thing in this bill that is very important now is the Medicare \nbuy-in. The Medicare buy-in we have been discussing is for somebody who \nis 58 to 62 years old and who can't get insurance. Maybe they have been \nlaid off or maybe they have a preexisting condition or maybe they are a \npart of small business that doesn't insure them. At 58 to 62 years old, \nthey simply can't get insurance. This legislation will allow them, so \nfar, to buy into Medicare.\n  I know my Republican friends can't make up their minds what they \nthink about Medicare. They have opposed it, mostly, for 40 years. They \nopposed its creation; they tried to privatize it in the mid-1990s. They \nsucceeded in partially privatizing it. They have cut it. Now, when we \nare--at AARP's request, in part--pushing legislation which will cut \nsome of the waste out of Medicare, all of a sudden they are big fans of \nMedicare. But then they don't like Medicare again because we are trying \nto do the Medicare buy-ins. I guess I am confused.\n  Mr. THUNE. Would the Senator from Ohio yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. We gave the other side 30 minutes.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. We have our time now.\n  Mr. BROWN. Senator Thune wants to sort of monopolize our 30 minutes.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. We have our time, and the Senator from South Dakota just \nsaid, when he gave his presentation, nothing that we are paying for \nstarts until 1,800 days from now. There is a whole list of things that \nstart. The Patient Protection Affordable Care Act----\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor. He \nmay engage in a colloquy. He does not have to yield for any further \nquestions.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will \nprohibit insurance from imposing lifetime\n\n[[Page S13162]]\n\nlimits on benefits starting on day one--starting on day one, Senator. \nHe doesn't want to hear it.\n  We are entitled to our own opinions, but we are not entitled to our \nown facts. The fact is, benefits kick in on day one and the large \nmajority of benefits kick in on day one, and we shouldn't be standing \nup here with charts that say the exact opposite.\n  Senator McCain, a week ago, said: Facts are stubborn things. These \nare stubborn things. Small business tax credits will kick in \nimmediately. The Senator from South Dakota just said that no payments, \nnothing that costs any money will kick in right away. That is not true. \nWe are not entitled to our own facts.\n  I stand here day after day and hear my colleagues, my good friends \nfrom the other side, say things that are not based on fact.\n  We hear about this $78 trillion unfunded liability. You know, I \nremember during the Social Security debate that we used to hear about \nthis $11 trillion unfunded mandate for Social Security. They asked the \nActuary what that was about--Treasury Secretary Snowe--because the \nAmerican Actuarial Society got mad about this. You know what it was? It \nwas into the infinite horizon, was the liability. It was into infinity. \nThat was a figure used by the President of the United States--George \nBush at the time--that we have an $11 trillion unfunded mandate. What \nwas the actuarial thinking behind it? Into infinity, and that people \nwould live to be 150 years old.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. One second. I want to explain the end of this.\n  So this was the unfunded liability--assuming people lived to 150 and \nstill retired at 67. That meant an 83-year retirement and that we would \nlive to 150. I assume the first 50 years would be great, the next 50 \nyears not so great, and the last 50 years horrible. Ridiculous stuff.\n  Let's have an honest debate, for goodness' sake. Let's not put up \ncharts that contend one thing and that are just not true.\n  I yield to Senator Sanders.\n  Mr. SANDERS. What I wanted to do is to get back to an issue that is \nof great importance to the American people, in addition to everything \nSenator Franken appropriately pointed out; that is, as we proceed \nforward on this legislation, there is a provision in the Senate bill \nthat I think needs to be changed. I have offered an amendment to do \nthat. I am delighted Senator Brown and Senator Franken and Senator \nBegich, who is not here, and Senator Burris, who is also not on the \nSenate floor, are in support of that amendment, as I think the vast \nmajority of the American people are.\n  Madam President, this bill is going to cost some $800 billion to $900 \nbillion, and the American people want to know where that money is going \nto come from. Is it going to come from the middle class whose incomes \nin many ways are shrinking, who have lost their jobs, are having very \nserious financial problems, or is it going to come in a more \nprogressive way?\n  The amendment that we are supporting would simply say we will get rid \nof the 40-percent excise tax on health care benefits above a certain \nlimit and move toward a more progressive way of funding, which is close \nto what exists in the language in the House.\n  Essentially, what we would be doing is addressing the fact that the \nso-called Cadillac plan is not a Cadillac plan because in a relatively \nfew years, millions of workers with ordinary health care benefits are \ngoing to be impacted by that. According to a major health care \nconsultant, the Mercer Company, this tax would hit one in five health \ninsurance plans by the year 2016--one in five. The Communications \nWorkers of America have estimated that this would cost families with a \nFederal employees health benefit--Federal employees with a standard \nplan with dental and vision benefits--an average of $2,000 per year \nover the 10-year course of this bill.\n  So what this issue is about is do we sock it to the middle class \nagain, with the heavy tax that over a period of years is going to \nimpact more and more ordinary families, or do we say that at a time \nwhen we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income, when \nPresident Bush gave huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people, that \nmaybe we ask people who have a minimum income of $2 million a year to \nstart picking up their fair share?\n  I yield to my friend from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for kicking off \nthis debate. My understanding is that this amendment would eliminate \nthe tax on people's health insurance plans, even people who have pretty \ngenerous union-negotiated--obviously, not just union, but when a union \nnegotiates a good plan, the white-collar workers in those same plants, \nthose same companies often get decent plans too. It would take away the \ntax for them, and it would then tax 1 percent, \\1/2\\ percent of wealthy \npeople?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Interesting that the Senator asks that. What this \namendment does is it imposes a 5.4-percent surtax on adjusted gross \nincomes above $2.4 million for individuals and $4.8 million for \ncouples.\n  What that means, I would tell the Senator from Ohio, is that this \nimpacts the top two one-hundredths of 1 percent, which means 99.98 \npercent of the American people would not pay one penny in additional \ntaxes. It is the top two one-hundredths of 1 percent, and I think that \nis in fact the proper thing to do.\n  Mr. BROWN. So that would be 2 out of 10,000--1 out of every 5,000 \nfamilies would pay that or 1 out of 5,000 of the wealthiest families \nwould pay that; is that what the Senator is saying?\n  Mr. SANDERS. That is true. Of the approximately 134 million \nindividual tax returns filed in 2005, which is the latest data we have \navailable, only two one-hundredths of 1 percent or about 26,000 \nindividuals reported adjusted gross incomes over $2.4 million.\n  Mr. BROWN. So 26,000 out of 134 million people would pay this.\n  Mr. SANDERS. That is right.\n  Mr. BROWN. As opposed to millions of families who have good health \ninsurance that they have negotiated or been provided by their employer.\n  This brings me back to the discussion we had earlier this year; that \nwhen people talk about legacy costs, about pension and health care, \nwhich many people have, fortunately, almost always these health \nbenefits and pensions people earn by giving up pay today. They say: I \nwill take a little less pay today if I get a good pension and good \nhealth insurance. So that is why the Senator from Vermont is arguing \nthat we shouldn't be taxing this insurance, I assume.\n  Senator Franken.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Let me go into this term ``Cadillac.'' You know, I never \nhad a Cadillac, but that was the thing, right?--a Cadillac? That was an \nincredible extravagance--a gold-plated extravagance. But, in fact, this \nwould be taxing plans that provide basic comprehensive coverage for \nthousands of middle-class workers and their families. One of the \nproblems with the excise tax is that it categorizes plans based on \ntheir actuarial cost, not solely on the generosity of their benefits. \nPlan characteristics explain only a small percentage of the \ndifferential in cost. Some reports suggest only 6 percent of the \ndifference in cost is explained by generosity of benefits.\n  Let me give an example: A small business that employs many older \nworkers is going to face--actuarially, it is going to be considered \nhigher than a business with a young workforce. So even if both of these \nemployers provide the exact same benefits, their costs will be \ndifferent. The employer with the older workforce faces a higher risk of \nfalling under this tax--not due to the richness of the benefits but due \nto the age of its employees.\n\n  The same goes for small workforces. If a small business offers one \nset of health benefits and a large company offers the exact same set of \nbenefits, the cost for the smaller employer is higher because its risk \npool is smaller.\n  Do we really want to penalize small businesses or workplaces that \nretain older workers?\n  Senator Sanders.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me pick up on the point the Senator from Minnesota \nmade. When you use the term ``Cadillac,'' the implications are that \nmaybe we will get some of those guys at Goldman Sachs who have this \noff-the-wall outlandish benefit package.\n  The reality is, the CWA--Communications Workers of America--has done \na bit of work on this. What their\n\n[[Page S13163]]\n\nestimate is, as health care costs continue to rise--and we are seeing 6 \npercent, 7 percent, 8 percent increases every year--obviously, the way \nthe language of this legislation is written, it will impact more and \nmore health care plans. By the year 2019, it will burden one out of \nthree health care plans in this country. Does that sound like a \nCadillac plan, one out of three plans? And eventually, as health care \ncosts continue to rise, it will impact virtually every plan in this \ncountry.\n  The bottom line we are talking about is, yes, we need to raise money. \nHow do you do it? Do you do it by socking it to the middle-class and \nworking families? And as the Senator from Ohio has indicated, many of \nthese workers have given up wage increases in order to maintain a \nstrong health care benefit. Are those the people we are going to tax or \ndo you tax the top two one-hundredths of 1 percent, many of whom have \nreceived generous tax breaks in recent years?\n  Mr. BROWN. If the Senator will yield, I want to talk for a moment \nabout the people who will be paying more taxes. The Senator said their \nincome is over a couple of million a year, those who will pay these \ntaxes.\n  During the last 10 years--during the 8 years President Bush was in \nthe White House, the tax system changed pretty dramatically during that \ntime. It is my understanding--maybe the Senator can shed some light on \nthis, either colleague--my understanding for sure is that the tax \nsystem, as it changed, had much more of a tilt toward the wealthy; that \nis, President Bush's tax cuts always included a few middle-class \npeople, so a family making $50,000 might get $100 in tax savings over a \nyear but, on the other hand, if you made millions of dollars, you got \nhuge tax cuts.\n  I remember Warren Buffett, one of the most successful businesspeople \nin America, who generally likes what we are doing here and wants a \nfairer tax system, Warren Buffett said he pays a lower tax rate than \nhis secretary and he said he pays a lower tax rate than a soldier \ncoming back from Iraq.\n  Talk, if you would, either Senator, Senator Franken or Senator \nSanders, about what happened over the last decade to taxes for the \ngroup of people, the wealthiest, who we think should pay a little more \nunder this plan.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I think the evidence is overwhelming that one of the \nreasons we have seen recordbreaking deficits and we have a $12 trillion \nnational debt--it is not just the war in Iraq but also the huge tax \nbreaks that have been given to the very wealthiest people in this \ncountry. As the Senator from Ohio indicated, the facts are very clear. \nYes, the middle class may have gotten some benefit, but the lion's \nshare of tax breaks went to the people on top.\n  What we are seeing in this country is a growing gap between the very \nwealthy and virtually everybody else. In many ways, the middle class is \nshrinking. Poverty is increasing. It makes zero sense to me that in the \nmidst of all of that, we ask the middle class to pay more in taxes to \nprovide health care to more Americans and we leave the top one-\nhundredth of 1 percent alone.\n  Let me also say this: There is a lot of support out there for the \namendment Senator Brown, Senator Franken, Senator Begich, Senator \nBurris, and I are offering. Let me just read one. This is from the \npresident of the Fraternal Order of Police. These are cops out on the \nstreet. Most people do not think the police are getting extravagant \nhealth care benefits.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       I am writing to you on behalf of the membership of the \n     Fraternal Order of Police to express our support for your \n     amendment which would eliminate the excise tax on high cost \n     insurance plans.\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera.\n\n       This provision is intended to tax the health plans of the \n     wealthiest Americans, but it will also tax the plans of many \n     law enforcement officers who need high cost and high quality \n     insurance due to the dangerous nature of their profession. \n     The Fraternal Order of Police strongly supports your \n     amendment, because health care reform legislation should not \n     increase the tax burden for those who fearlessly risk their \n     health, and even their lives, to keep our communities safe.\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Again, let's think about what these folks, these union \nfolks who negotiated these health care policies and sacrificed in \nsalary--what are they getting? They are getting affordable deductibles. \nThey are getting affordable co-pays. Sometimes, they are getting vision \nand dental care. This is comprehensive health care we want Americans to \nget. That is who is going to get hit.\n  Over the last 20, 30 years, we have seen a squeeze on these people. \nWe have seen a squeeze on the middle class, a shift in the risk to \npeople. That is what this whole bill is about. We are trying to \neliminate the risk of losing your health care if you have a preexisting \ncondition; we are trying to lose the risk of going bankrupt. That is \nthe whole point of this bill. Let's not shift more risk onto these \nfolks who are doing these kinds of jobs and supporting their families \nwith their salaries and their benefits.\n  Mr. BROWN. Exactly right. Think about that. We want to give \nincentives for people to do the right thing. We are glad when people \nhave good health insurance because then they do not rely on Medicaid or \nthey don't show up in the hospital or the emergency room and get the \ncare for free, while other people have to pay for that care--others who \nuse the emergency room and have insurance, others who use the hospital. \nSo the hospitals don't get stuck with the costs. If they have dental \ncare, they are getting the right kind of preventive care so they do not \nhave more expensive care later.\n  Ideally, we want everybody to have one of these ``Cadillac'' plans. \nWe want people to have insurance that includes vision, that includes \neye care, that includes catastrophic coverage, that includes preventive \ncare. If more people had this, there would be a lot less burden on \ntaxpayers to take care of everybody else.\n  It is clear the arguments here are not just it is the right thing for \npolice officers, as Senator Sanders said. It is the right thing for the \nperson Senator Franken talked about who is getting dental and vision \ncare, but it is good for society as a whole, that people are willing to \ngive up some of their wages to get a good medical plan.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I could jump in, a moment ago Senator Brown asked me \na question about the extent of the tax breaks given to the wealthiest \npeople, and I do have that information. Since 2001, I say to Senator \nBrown, the richest 1 percent of Americans received $565 billion in tax \nbreaks. In 2010 alone, the most wealthy 1 percent of Americans are \nscheduled to receive an additional $108 billion in tax breaks. That is \npoint No. 1.\n  Point No. 2--let me be a little political here. In the Presidential \nelection of 2008, one of the candidates said that it was a good idea to \ntax health care benefits. That candidate--Senator McCain--lost the \nelection. The other candidate said it was a bad idea to tax health care \nbenefits. That was Barack Obama; he won the election.\n  Let me quote from what then-Senator Obama said when he was running \nfor President. On September 12, 2008, he said:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge, under my plan no family making \n     less than $250,000 will see their taxes increase, not your \n     income taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital \n     gains taxes, not any taxes. My opponent, Senator McCain, \n     cannot make that pledge and here is why. For the first \n     time in American history--\n\n  This is Senator Obama speaking about Senator McCain's plan.\n\n       For the first time in American history, he, Senator McCain, \n     wants to tax your health benefits. Apparently, Senator McCain \n     doesn't think it's enough that your health premiums have \n     doubled. He thinks you should have to pay taxes on them, too. \n     That's his idea of change.\n\n  I agree with what Senator Obama said in 2008. I disagree with what \nSenator McCain said then. Right now, we are in a position to follow \nthrough on what Senator Obama said at that point and make sure the \nmiddle class of this country does not pay taxes on their health \nbenefits.\n  Mr. BROWN. If the Senator will yield, I say thank you. I think that \nmade it very clear.\n  Earlier, the Senator talked about what the tax cuts for the \nwealthiest citizens during the Bush years did to our national debt. He \nmentioned the war in Iraq, the trillion-dollar war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, not to mention the huge cost it is going to be to continue \nto take care of the men and women who served us courageously with their \nphysical and mental injuries from Iraq.\n\n[[Page S13164]]\n\n  Senator Franken is so familiar with this because of tours he made as \na private citizen to battle zones, year after year, to talk to our \ntroops and entertain our troops. He didn't get a lot of credit for \nthat, but he didn't care about the credit for that. He was there, \nalways doing that.\n  One of the things that is pretty interesting, listening to my \nRepublican friends on the other side of the aisle talk about this bill \nnow, which the Congressional Budget Office says is paid for and more, \nwhile they continue on their side to talk about the budget deficit, it \nwas that group who passed--Senator Sanders and I were both House \nMembers at that time and voted against it--passed the Medicare \nPrivatization Act, and the people who were on the floor talking to us \nvoted for cloture for the Medical Modernization Act. That bill was not \npaid for. That bill was a giveaway to the drug industry and the \ninsurance industry. It has added tens and tens of billions of dollars \nto our national debt.\n  On the one hand, they support these tax cuts that are not paid for, \nthey support the Iraq war which was not paid for, and they now want us \nto go into Afghanistan and not pay for it, yet increase the number of \ntroops. They continue down this road when we are on this bill doing the \nright thing. Even with our amendment here to eliminate the Cadillac--\nthe taxing Cadillac plans, we are saying we are going to find another \nway to pay for it. We are not just going to eliminate that cut in \ntaxes. We want to, but we are going to pay for it some other way.\n  I yield for Senator Franken.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. We are actually addressing that doughnut hole that was \nin the Medicare Part D bill. We are closing it by half. Do you know \nwhen it starts? Next year.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thought Senator Thune said none of the benefits started \nthen.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Senator Thune did say none of the benefits started next \nyear, but I guess he just hasn't read the bill. I have so many \nconstituents come to me and say: Read the bill, read the bill. I ask--\n--\n  Mr. BROWN. If the Senator will yield, perhaps if you are going to \nvote against it, you do not need to read it? Is that the way to think \nabout it?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I do find that many of my colleagues with whom I am very \nfriendly have not read the bill and are not very familiar with it. I \nthink if you are going to get on your feet and debate and make \nassertions, you should really be familiar with the content of the bill. \nThat is what I thought. I have only been here a while, so maybe I am \nnaive, but I think when you say none of the benefits are going to start \nnext year, you should be right.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I could just add to the point Senator Brown and \nSenator Franken have made regarding concern about the national debt, \nevery day there is a Republican coming up here to say we have a $12 \ntrillion national debt and we have to cut this and cut that--all that. \nYet I think virtually every one of them is in support of the repeal of \nthe asset tax, which would benefit solely the top three-tenths of 1 \npercent and would cost the Treasury $1 trillion over a 20-year period--\n$1 trillion over a 10-year period. I am sorry, $1 trillion over a 10-\nyear period.\n  I am really concerned about the deficit, I am concerned about the \nnational debt, but I am prepared to vote for repealing the entire \nestate tax which only impacts--gives $1 trillion in tax breaks over a \n10-year period to the top three-tenths of 1 percent.\n  Some may question the sincerity about their concern about the \nnational debt.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. In fairness, I am not sure they are all for that. I \nthink I have heard some soundings from the other side to extend what we \nhave this year because this runs out on January 1 and we do not want to \nsee a lot of plugs pulled.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I am talking about what happens now. Overall, the vast \nmajority of our Republican friends----\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Yes, in theory.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Want to abolish the estate tax, which is $1 trillion in \ntax breaks.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I just want to bend over backward to be fair to my \ncolleagues on the other side.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The Senator is so nice.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Maybe I do that to a fault, and I apologize to our side.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, polls show there is overwhelming \nsupport among the American people for what we are discussing today. \nOrganizationally, it has the support of the AFL-CIO, the National \nEducation Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the United \nSteelworkers of America, AFSCME, the American Postal Workers Union, and \na number of other organizations representing millions of working \npeople. This is not a complicated issue. Somebody will have to pay for \nthis bill. Should it be the middle class and working families or should \nit be the people at the top two one-hundredths of 1 percent who, over \nthe period of the last 8 or 9 years, have enjoyed huge tax breaks? This \nis kind of a no-brainer.\n  The good news here is that our friends in the House have moved \ncorrectly in this area. The bill before us in the Senate does not. What \nwe are trying to do is to get an amendment to take out the tax on \nhealth care benefits and replace it with similar language, not exactly \nthe same as exists in the House.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Let's get back to the excise tax and what it is \npurportedly supposed to do. It is supposed to bring down costs and \ngenerate revenues. Those are both necessary objectives. I have been \nsubmitting stuff over and over again to bring down costs, including a \n90-percent medical loss ratio, including uniform standardized insurance \nforms which will save billions of dollars. I don't think this excise \ntax is the best way to bring down costs and generate revenue. We should \nbe focusing on actually bringing down the cost of services instead of \ntrying to limit the availability of care.\n  One way to actually bring down the cost of services is the value \nindex in the bill, which Senator Cantwell introduced in the Finance \nCommittee and which is still in this bill, and which Senator Klobuchar \nfought for, and many of us from high-value States. That will change the \nMedicare reimbursement rates to incentivize value. Another unintended \nconsequence of the excise tax is its effective penalty on comprehensive \nbenefit packages secured for workers by their unions. Again, I come \nback to these unions who gave up salary benefits, who gave up earning \nbenefits. As soon as this gets going, this is going to be returning \nyear after year as we see medical inflation go up and up. This is the \ncost of living index plus 1; right?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Right.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Plus 1 percent. That is not what we have seen from \nmedical costs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. That is the point. The point is that medical costs are \ngoing up substantially more than inflation. In fact, general inflation \nis actually going down. There is no question but that as medical \ninflation continues to remain high, millions and millions more workers \nare going to be forced to pay this tax. One of the other side effects \nof this tax is that many employers, in order to avoid it, are going to \nstart cutting the health care benefits that workers receive. Today it \nmay be dental; tomorrow it will be vision. The next day it will be more \ncopayments, more deductibles. This is grossly unfair to working \nfamilies.\n  Mr. BROWN. Again, it is making the choices. Unlike the Medicare \nModernization Act, which Republicans pushed through in 2003--I know \nSenator Ensign voted against that although he voted for cloture, but he \nactually opposed that, to his credit--that was legislation that wasn't \npaid for. It was a giveaway to the drug insurance industry. It wasn't \npaid for. Our legislation is, and our amendment is. We made a choice. \nDo you charge the middle class? Do you say to the middle class, you are \ngoing to pay a tax on your health care benefits, or do we have someone \nelse pay who has gotten a lot of advantages in the last few years? \nSince 2001, the richest 1 percent of Americans, because of the Bush tax \ncuts, got $565 billion in tax breaks. This year that same wealthiest 1 \npercent of Americans are scheduled to receive an additional $108 \nbillion in tax credits. It is clear we want to go to the right place in \nthis. We want to keep it fiscally sound. We want to keep it balanced. \nWe want to pay for it, something my friends on the other side of the \naisle rarely do when it comes to\n\n[[Page S13165]]\n\nwar, when it comes to tax breaks for the rich, when it comes to \ngiveaways to the drug and insurance companies.\n  We are doing it that way. That is why the Sanders-Franken-Begich-\nBrown amendment makes so much sense.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. One last word on the deficit and the debt. May I remind \neveryone that when the Republicans were in the majority and President \nBush came to Washington, we had a surplus, a record surplus. At the \ntime the Chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, testified to Congress \nthat we had a new problem. The new problem was that because of the \nprojected surpluses, we were, in a number of years, going to have too \nmuch money, that we were going to pay off the debt and the Federal \nGovernment would be forced to buy private equities and that this would \nnot have a maximizing effect on our economy. That is what he said, \nafter Bush became President. That was what he said. He said we were \ngoing to have too much money. That is what the Chairman of the Fed \nsaid. So we handed the ball off to President Bush, and we handed the \nball off to these Republicans. The problem was, we were going to have \ntoo much money. That is not a problem anymore, is it? Now you hear them \nscreaming about the deficit. Think about the deficit they left us. \nThink about the economic circumstances they left us in. We are talking \nabout getting rid of this excise tax, but we are talking about paying \nfor it. The CBO has scored this bill as cutting the debt in the next 10 \nyears by $179 billion and then $500 billion in the next 10. That is \nresponsible.\n  What we saw in the years that we had a Republican President and a \nRepublican House and a Republican Senate was an explosion in the \ndeficit. I don't want to hear lectures about the deficit. When I hear \npresentations from my colleagues, I want them to remember what Senator \nMcCain said when he said facts are stubborn things.\n  When we debate in this Hall on this floor, let's stick to the facts. \nSo many of the benefits in this bill start immediately. It is simply \nnot fact to say they don't.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no time limit on the colloquy.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I think we are coming to the end of it. I hope, focusing \non the issue of the excise tax, the Senate is prepared to support our \namendment. If that is not the case, certainly support what the House \nhas done in the conference committee. Taxing middle-class workers is \nnot the way we should fund health care reform.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Senator. I thank both of my colleagues from \nVermont and Ohio, and urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 3135.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto engage in a colloquy with the senior Senators from Connecticut and \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, when the American people demanded last \nNovember and throughout this year that we make it possible for every \nAmerican to afford to live a healthy life, they did so because they \nknow from personal experience how broken our country's health care \nsystem is. As the Senate has worked to answer that call this year, we \nhave drafted a bill that will save lives, save money, and save \nMedicare. Many aspects of the current bill achieve that goal. But there \nis one more thing we could do, closing the notorious gap that \narbitrarily charges seniors in Nevada and throughout the Nation \nthousands and thousands of dollars for prescription drugs.\n  As seniors know all too well, the prescription drug plan is called \nMedicare Part D, and the coverage gap is commonly known as the doughnut \nhole. Right now Medicare will help seniors afford their prescription \ndrugs only up to a certain annual dollar limit, $2,700 a year, then \nstop, then help it again only once their bills reach another much \nhigher level, $6,100. So from $2,700 to $6,100, that is the notorious, \nbad doughnut hole. Between these two points, seniors are stuck with the \nfull bill. Imagine if you had car insurance that covered you until you \ndrove 2,700 miles in a given year, then stopped, then started covering \nyou again once you hit 6,100 miles. From 2,700 to 6,100 miles would be \npretty scary. That wouldn't work for drivers, and the doughnut hole \ndoesn't work for seniors. The effects of this broken system are \npainfully simple. More and more seniors have to skip or split the pills \nthey need to stay healthy. It means that in January someone will pay \n$35 to fill a prescription, but by October he or she could be asked to \npay thousands of dollars for the very same pills.\n  I was at CVS a day or two ago to pick up some stuff for my wife at \nthe prescription counter. They had on the counter there where you were \nwaiting a list of the cost of all drugs. I didn't fully understand it, \nbut I looked at it. Some had values of thousands of dollars to fill a \nprescription. The only one I saw--I didn't want to flip through the \npages--but the one page, $9,800 for one prescription. I don't know if \nthat was 30 pills or what, but it was striking.\n  If someone will pay $35 to fill a prescription, that is fairly \ninexpensive. But by October, he or she would be asked to pay thousands \nof dollars. That is what it is. It is not an uncommon problem. Millions \nof seniors, a quarter of all in the Part D Program, reach that no man's \nland during the year, the doughnut hole. But only a small fraction get \nto the other side. Both numbers will only get worse if we don't act. \nNot surprisingly, those caught in the middle don't take the medicine \nthey need at far greater rates than those who do have coverage. Like we \nsee with uninsured Americans of all ages, those who can't afford the \ntreatments they need to get healthy will get even sicker. Down the road \nthat means more expensive doctor visits, more expensive hospital stays, \nand more expensive medicines. It means more sickness and more death.\n  We have already taken the first steps to fix this in the current \nbill, closing the gap by half and by an additional $500 for 2010. \nBecause I am committed to saving lives, saving money and saving \nMedicare, I personally am committed to fully closing the doughnut hole \nonce and for all. Once we pass this bill out of the Senate, we will do \nso in the conference committee with the House, whose bill already \ncloses the gap. The House legislation closes the doughnut hole. The \nlegislation we will send to President Obama for signature will make \ngood on his promise and ours to forever end this indefensible injustice \nfor America's seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I agree with my friend the majority leader \nthat we must close the doughnut hole. I think it is something all of us \nappreciate. I second his commitment to doing so with this bill that we \nwill send to the President. As most seniors live on modest incomes, we \nall know it is imperative that they can afford the prescriptions they \nneed. As the majority leader has noted, seniors who have trouble paying \nfor prescription drugs are more likely to skip doses or stop taking \ntheir medications altogether which would lead to more serious health \nproblems and higher long-term costs, both for them and our health care \nsystem as a whole. In my State of Connecticut, 25 percent, a quarter of \nall Part D enrollees fall into the doughnut hole. I understand the \nsignificance of delivering on the commitment to fixing this problem.\n  We have a responsibility, as all of us can appreciate, to protect and \nstrengthen Medicare and to improve the lives of our seniors. If we fail \nto act, the doughnut hole, we are told, will continue to grow in size, \ndoubling in less than 10 years. The size of the doughnut hole is \ndirectly tied to drug prices, prices that are rising at an alarming \nrate.\n  Seniors who have spent thousands and thousands of dollars--not \nincluding the cost of their premiums--before they get out of the \ndoughnut hole and get the treatments they need cannot afford to wait \nany longer to close this costly gap.\n  Our historic reform effort must improve the quality and affordability \nof Medicare. Closing the doughnut hole is a very clear and concrete way \nto do that.\n  I understand we may not have the opportunity to fix this issue in the \nSenate bill before it leaves this Chamber,\n\n[[Page S13166]]\n\nbut I want it to be known that I support the idea of closing the \ndoughnut hole in the conference committee that will meet with the other \nbody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, closing the doughnut hole is clearly the \nright thing to do. Medicare beneficiaries face extremely high out-of-\npocket costs for outpatient prescription drugs. In fact, they face \ncosts that are six times higher than out-of-pocket costs for those of \nus fortunate enough to have employer-sponsored coverage.\n  The doughnut hole contributes to these high out-of-pocket costs. As a \nresult, the doughnut hole often results in seniors skipping vital \nmedications.\n  Eliminating the coverage gap in the Medicare prescription drug \nprogram will save people with Medicare thousands of dollars every year. \nLowering the costs for seniors will also keep them healthier by \nensuring they can afford their medications.\n  In my home State of Montana, 33 percent of seniors enrolled in the \nMedicare prescription drug program fall into the doughnut hole every \nyear--one-third. We all know what the consequences are when people \ncannot afford the medicines they need to stay healthy, both for the \naffected individuals and for society at large.\n  Recognizing the scope of this problem, in his address to a joint \nsession of Congress in September, President Obama promised to close the \ndoughnut hole once and for all. It is our responsibility to make good \non this promise and provide this needed relief to seniors. I join my \ncolleagues in committing that we will send a bill to the President that \ncloses the doughnut hole and fulfills his promise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I wish to, if I could, ask my two \ncolleagues, through the Chair, if it is their understanding that the \nPresident fully supports this action.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, responding to the leader, that is my \nfull understanding.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I would add, that is my full understanding \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I want to address a few of the things \nthat were mentioned on the floor just now. However, I want to start by \ntalking about how this health care bill will affect small businesses.\n  Small businesses are the engine that drives our economy. We know they \nare struggling right now. The President met with some bankers today at \nthe White House because many of the large banks are not loaning money \nto small businesses. We all know that. Many small businesses are \nstruggling to keep their doors open.\n  One of the reasons small businesses are a little nervous right now is \nbecause they do not know if this bill goes into effect, what that \nmassive effect is going to be on them. They are uncertain about the \nfuture.\n  Let me tell you a few things.\n  First of all, we all know that there is a $500 billion tax increase \ncontained in this 2,074-page bill that is before us today. In that \nbill, there is also an employer mandate of $28 billion. This is what \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said about that $28 \nbillion: Not only does it fall heavily on small businesses, but the CBO \ngoes further to say that ``workers in those firms would ultimately bear \nthe burden of those fees'' in the form of reduced compensation. That is \na direct quote.\n  This bill also discourages small businesses from hiring folks. CBO \nwent on to say: `` . . . the employment loss would be concentrated \namong low-income workers.'' Do we want to do that to folks out there \nwho are struggling right now? We have heard across this country that \nrecord numbers of people are signing up for food stamps, welfare, \nunemployment insurance, and all of the various government subsidies \nthat are out there to try to help people through a tough time. Do we \nwant to keep them from getting a job?\n  The Medicare payroll tax, that is $54 billion in this bill, will hit \none-third of all small business owners. Those small business owners \nthat it will hit about 30 million people in the United States. If you \nput a tax on somebody, especially during a recession, you are going to \ninhibit them from investing in their business and creating jobs.\n  I have heard many people from the other side of the aisle say that it \nis not a good time to raise taxes, and yet they are raising taxes in \nthis bill. Sometimes they call them fees, penalties, assessments, or \ndifferent things, but they are taxes.\n  This bill will also require small businesses to buy a government-\napproved insurance plan. So even for those small businesses that \ncurrently have a plan that they like, one that works for them and their \nemployees, and one that is affordable and even though these small \nbusinesses have tried to do the right thing, the plan that they have \nselected may not quite meet the government criteria. This may be \nbecause the plan they chose was a little more of a bare-bones type of \nplan--in any event, this bill will require them to spend more money for \na higher level of coverage than maybe they can afford.\n  What will that do? Well, if the small business is barely getting by \nnow, barely keeping its doors open, and the government requires it to \nspend more money on health insurance, some employees may be laid off or \nin some cases, small businesses may close and all its employees may \nlose their jobs.\n  Most people in this body have never operated a small business. I \nbuilt, owned, and operated two different small businesses--veterinary \nclinics. I understand how difficult it is for a small business owner, \nespecially when you are just starting out and you are investing, you \nare putting everything you have into it, with all your hard work, and \nthe few profits you make you plow right back into the business. You are \ntrying to expand. You are trying to hire the next person, and you are \ntrying to grow your business. When the government comes along and puts \nextra taxes and extra burdens on you, it makes it tough. That is not \nwhat we should be doing, especially during a time of recession.\n  This bill before us also caps what are called flexible spending \naccounts at $2,500. Flexible spending accounts are used by a lot of \nsmall businesses, but they are also used by a lot of Federal employees. \nThey are used by a lot of people. They are especially used by a lot of \npeople who have serious chronic diseases.\n\n  If you are a Federal employee, for instance, you can put $5,000 in a \nflexible spending account, and then you can pay, for instance, for \napproved out-of-pocket health care expenses. This bill caps that at \n$2,500 a year. So for somebody who has multiple sclerosis or somebody \nwho has diabetes or somebody who has a chronic disease that requires a \nlot of medical attention, you are hurting those people who need that \nmoney the most. That is not something we should be doing, but that is \nexactly what this bill does.\n  Let me talk about some of the general provisions in this bill and not \njust how it affects small businesses. We have talked about the Medicare \nprovisions in the bill a lot on the floor. We know there is a $500 \nbillion cut in Medicare. Folks on the floor were just talking about the \ndoughnut hole for senior citizens in the Part D prescription drug plan \nunder Medicare. Under this bill, Medicare Advantage will be cut by $120 \nbillion. Most Medicare Advantage plans have no doughnut hole, yet this \nbill would take $120 billion out of Medicare Advantage, cutting extra \nservices. According to CBO, there will be a 64-percent reduction in \nextra benefits by the year 2016 for those seniors who have Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Ten million seniors in the United States today have Medicare \nAdvantage. They have chosen it. They were not forced into it. As a \nmatter of fact, Medicare Advantage is a relatively new program. Seniors \ndo not like change that much, yet they saw an advantage in this \nprogram. They did not have pay to pay their Medigap insurance. They did \nnot have a doughnut hole. Many of them get vision and dental services, \nyet their extra benefits are going to be cut by 64 percent because of \nthis bill.\n  Overall, because of the smoke and mirrors that are used, it is said \nthis bill only costs $849 billion. But, the costs are hidden. First of \nall, $849 billion is a huge number. But it is actually a $2.5 trillion \nspending bill. The reason is because when you look at it fully \nimplemented--right now, a lot of the benefits do not start right away \nbut the taxes start right away--when\n\n[[Page S13167]]\n\nyou look at the full 10 years when taxes, benefits, and everything is \nimplemented, it is a $2.5 trillion bill. This is a massive increase in \nthe Federal Government.\n  As an example, within the 2,074 pages of this bill there are almost \n1,700 new places where authority is provided to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to make health care decisions for the American \npeople. Madam President, this bill gives the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services the authority to make health care decisions for the \nAmerican people 1,700 times. If that is not a massive government \nexpansion into our health care field, I do not know what is.\n  There is also about $500 billion in new taxes. I have this chart in \nthe Chamber. This is a quote by President Obama on his health care \npromises. He said:\n\n       Let me be perfectly clear. . . .if your family earns less \n     than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a \n     single dime. I repeat: not one single dime.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to \n     change the coverage or the doctor that you have. Let me \n     repeat this: nothing in our plan requires you to change what \n     you have.\n\n  And thirdly, he said:\n\n       Under the plan, if you like your current health [care] \n     insurance, nothing changes, except your costs will go down by \n     as much as $2,500 per year.\n\n  Let me focus on the first quote about the new taxes that are in this \nbill. The bill includes a 40-percent insurance plan tax. There is a \nseparate insurance tax on top of the 40-percent insurance plan tax. \nThis is the one, by the way, that several of my colleagues were talking \nabout that the unions are all up in arms about. It is the Cadillac \nplans they were talking about that are going to be taxed. Most union \nmembers have a Cadillac plan, and their plans are going to be taxed at \n40 percent above a certain dollar figure. Because this tax is not \nindexed to inflation, by the end of a decade, most Americans' plans \nwill be subject to this 40-percent tax.\n  There is also an employer mandate tax. But as the Congressional \nBudget Office said, this tax actually gets shifted down to the workers. \nThere is a drug tax. Every time you purchase drugs, taxes are passed \nonto you by the drug companies, so all of us are going to be paying \nmore for drugs. There is a laboratory tax. Every time you go in, there \nis a tax on lab work. All of these taxes end up raising health care \npremiums. There is a medical device tax. There is a failure to buy \ninsurance tax. There is a cosmetic surgery tax. And, there is an \nincreased employee Medicare tax.\n  At this point, let's remember that first quote I showed where \nPresident Obama said he would not raise taxes on families making \n$250,000 or less, and on individuals making $200,000 a year or less. \nWell, 84 percent of the taxes in this bill will be paid by people \nmaking less than $200,000 a year--84 percent of the taxes.\n  I would like to point out another problem with this bill. It contains \na sense of the Senate on medical liability reform. In his September \naddress on health care reform, the President talked about the need to \ndo something about medical liability reform. The problem is that this \nbill before us today only includes a sense of the Senate on medical \nliability reform. Let me show you. As shown on this chart, this is how \nmuch money this health care bill saves with their sense of the Senate. \nZero.\n  However, the Congressional Budget Office said that real medical \nliability reform would save $100 billion in this country--between what \nthe government spends and what the private sector spends, that is $100 \nbillion in total.\n  The problems with this bill are so numerous that we could go on and \non discussing them, but we truly do need to start over. We need to \nstart over and take more of a step by step approach. We need to develop \nan incremental approach, where both sides can agree on some of the \nreforms we need to do--without destroying our current health care \nsystem. We need to enact meaningful medical liability reform.\n  We need to agree on provisions about eliminating preexisting \nconditions. We need to agree on an incremental approach to reward \npeople for engaging in healthy behaviors. It is cheaper to insure \npeople who are nonsmokers and people who are not obese. It is about \n$1,400 less to insure a non-smoker versus a smoker; and it is about \n$1,400 less to cover someone who has the proper body weight versus \nsomebody who is obese. Encouraging individuals to engage in healthy \nbehaviors is a good thing. We can agree on that.\n  We also need to allow small businesses to join together to take \nadvantage of purchasing power in the same manner that big businesses \ndo. This is an incremental reform proposal that would not destroy the \nquality of our health care system and would not take the costs and put \nthem on the backs of small businesses. This is something we should do. \nThis is something we can do.\n  The only way to enact these incremental reforms is to stop the bill \nthat is before us today. The only way for us to do that is to sit down \ntogether, not as Republicans or Democrats, but to sit down together and \ncome up with ideas that we can all agree on that will actually help the \nhealth care system in America. That is what this body should do if we \nwant to do what is right for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMcCain and I be permitted to engage in a discussion regarding the \nhealth care matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, last Friday, we heard from two \nentities. We heard from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, \nindicating health care costs in this country would actually go up under \nthe Reid bill. We also heard from CNN. We heard from CMS and from CNN. \nWe heard from CNN about how the American people feel about this \nmeasure. At a time when all the polls indicate the American people do \nnot favor this bill, do not want us to pass it, and when the \ngovernment's Actuary indicates the bill will actually not cut health \ncare costs, which we thought was what this debate was all about in the \nfirst place, we are being confronted with a procedure that is quite \nunusual: an effort to restructure one-sixth of the economy through a \nmassive bill that it appears almost no one has seen.\n  At what point, I would ask my friend and colleague from Arizona, \ncould we expect that the American people would have an opportunity to \nsee this measure that has been off in the conference room here and \nbeing turned into sausage in an effort to get 60 votes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my friend, the Republican leader, that I \nhave seen a lot of processes around here and a lot of negotiations and \na lot of discussions, but I must admit I have not seen one quite like \nthis one, nor do I believe my leader has.\n  I was on the floor in a colloquy with the assistant Democratic leader \na couple days ago, and I said: What is in the bill? He said: None of us \nknow. Talk about being kept in the dark.\n  I would say to my friend from Kentucky, we have to put this into the \ncontext of what the President of the United States said in his campaign \nbecause the whole campaign, as I well know better than anyone, was all \nbased on change. On the issue specifically surrounding health care \nreform, I quote then-Candidate Obama on October 18, 2009:\n\n       I am going to have all the negotiations around a big table \n     televised on C-SPAN so that people can see who is making \n     arguments on behalf of their constituents and who is making \n     arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance \n     companies.\n\n  He went on to say that a couple more times.\n  I would ask my friend: Hasn't it been several days that we basically \nhave been gridlocked over one amendment, which is the amendment by the \nSenator from North Dakota that would allow drug reimportation from \nCanada and other countries?\n  So then, guess what the reports are today:\n\n       PhRMA renegotiating its deal? Inside Health Policy's Baker, \n     Pecquet, Lotven and Coughlin report: `The pharmaceutical \n     industry is negotiating with the White House and lawmakers on \n     a revised health care deal under which the industry would \n     ante up cuts beyond the $80 billion it agreed to this summer, \n     possibly by agreeing to policies that would further shrink \n     the . . . doughnut hole. . . .'\n\n  I will not go into all the details of that.\n\n[[Page S13168]]\n\n  Just a few minutes ago on the floor, guess what. They announced there \nwould be some change made, an amendment that would be included in the \nmanagers' package.\n  I would ask my friend, is it maybe the case that the majority leader, \nwho is having a meeting, as we speak, of all the Democratic Senators \nbehind closed doors, without C-SPAN, has cut another deal along with \nthe White House with--guess who--the pharmaceutical companies that have \nraised prices some 9 percent on prescription drugs this year?\n  This is a process the American people don't deserve, so I would ask \nmy friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Arizona, that is a \nprocess that gives making sausage a bad name.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So we were hung up--or should I say gridlocked--for 2 or \n3 days, over the entire weekend. The Republican leader even agreed to a \nunanimous consent agreement that would allow a Democratic side-by-side \namendment, and that was not agreed to--until over at the White House, \naccording to this report, PhRMA renegotiated its deal and apparently \nthey now have sufficient votes to defeat the Dorgan amendment which, as \nof last summer, according to the New York Times, said the last deal \nshortly after striking that agreement, the trade group--the \nPharmaceutical Research Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA--also set \naside $150 million for advertising to support the health care \nlegislation.\n  I ask my friend, is this changing the climate in Washington or is it \nnot only business as usual but, in my opinion, I haven't seen anything \nquite like this one.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend, it certainly is not changing \nbusiness as usual in Washington. Even more important than that, it is \nnot changing American health care for the better, which is what we all \nthought this whole thing was about when we started down this path of \nseeing what we could do to improve America's health care, which almost \neveryone correctly understands is already the best in the world.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Hadn't there been charge after charge that Republicans \nare ``filibustering'' and Republicans have been blocking passage of \nthis legislation? I would ask my friend, hasn't the Republican leader \noffered a series of amendments we could get locked into and have votes \non?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We have been trying to get votes on the Crapo motion, \nfor example, since last Tuesday. It will be a week tomorrow. Maybe at \nsome point we will be able to have amendments again.\n  We started off on this bill with each side offering amendments, and \nwe went along pretty well until, I think, the majority decided it was \nnot only better to write the bill in secret, it was better to not have \nany amendments to the bill. So they began to filibuster our efforts for \nSenators to have an opportunity to vote on aspects of this bill, such \nas the $\\1/2\\ trillion worth of cuts in Medicare which we, fortunately, \nwere able to get votes on; the $400 billion in new taxes, which we \nwould like to be able to get votes on.\n  This is the core of the bill. The American people have every right, I \nwould say to my friend from Arizona, to expect us to debate the core of \nthe bill--the core of the bill, the essence of the bill--which is not, \nof course, going to be changed behind closed doors or during this \nmeeting that is going on with Democrats only.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As I understand it, there is a meeting going on behind \nclosed doors, again, where there are no C-SPAN cameras.\n  According to the Washington Post this morning, it says:\n\n       The Senate will resume debate Monday afternoon on a popular \n     proposal to allow U.S. citizens to buy cheaper drugs from \n     foreign countries which led to a last-minute lobbying push by \n     drug makers last week and bogged down negotiations over a \n     health care reform bill.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The fight over the imported drugs proposal poses a \n     particularly difficult political challenge for President \n     Obama who cosponsored a similar bill when he was in Congress \n     and who included funding for the idea in his first budget. \n     But the pharmaceutical industry, which has been a key \n     supporter of health care reform after reaching agreement with \n     the White House earlier this year, has responded with a \n     fierce lobbying campaign aimed at killing the proposal, \n     focusing on Democratic Senators from States with large drug \n     and research sectors.\n\n  So it will be interesting to watch the vote.\n  I would also point out to my friend, it is clear that if we allow \ndrug reimportation, we will save $100 billion, according to CBO, and \nthe deal that was cut--the first deal that was cut with the White House \nwas they would reduce it by $80 billion, so they had a $20 billion \ncushion. Now it will be very interesting to see what the latest deal is \nand how the vote goes.\n  But, again, I wish to ask my Republican leader, we get a little \ncynical around here from time to time and we see sometimes deals cut \nand things done behind closed doors. I am past the point of \nfrustration; I am getting a little bit sad about this. Because I think \nwe know we are now bumping up against Christmas. Sometime we are going \nto break for Christmas. So the pressures now are going to be even more \nintense because I think it is well known and reported that if they \ndon't get a deal before we go out for Christmas, then it will be very \nmuch like a fish sitting out in the sun. After awhile, it doesn't smell \nvery good, when people see a 2,000-page bill which has all kinds of \nprovisions in it.\n  So I understand, without C-SPAN cameras, that all the 60 Democratic \nMembers of this body are going to go down to the White House for \nanother meeting tomorrow, and we will see what happens then.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Arizona, talk about an \nexample of manufactured urgency. Is it not the case, I ask my friend \nfrom Arizona, that the benefits under this bill don't kick in until \n2014?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, my understanding is, if you go out and buy a car \ntoday from any car dealer, you don't have to make payments for a year. \nYou can get that kind of a deal if you want it. This deal is exactly \nupside down. You get to make the payments early, and then you get to \ndrive the car after 4 years.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So the urgency, it strikes me, I would say to my \nfriend from Arizona, is to get this thing out of the Congress before \nthe American people storm the Capitol.\n  We know from the survey data, do we not, that the American people are \noverwhelmingly opposed to this bill? So what is the argument I keep \nhearing on the other side? I was going to ask my friend from Arizona: I \nhear the President and others say: Let's make history. Well, there has \nbeen much history made but much of it has actually been bad, right?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would also like to say, there is a history we should \nnot ignore; that is, that every major reform ever enacted in the modern \nhistory of this country has been bipartisan, whether it be Medicare, \nwhether it be Social Security, whether it be welfare reform, as we \nremember under President Clinton. Every major reform has been \naccomplished by Democrats and Republicans sitting down together and \nsaying: OK, what is it we have to do? What kind of an agreement do we \nhave to make?\n  Some of us have been around here long enough to remember that in \n1983, Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill, a liberal Democrat from \nMassachusetts and the conservative Republican from California, sat down \nwith their aides across the table and key Members of Congress when \nSocial Security was about to go broke.\n  Why can't we, since there must be areas we agree on, now say to our \nDemocratic friends and the President, rather than trying to ram 60 \nvotes through the Senate, why can't we now sit down and proceed in a \nfashion--we will give things up. We are willing to make concessions to \nsave a system of Medicare that is about to go broke in 6 years. We will \nmake some concessions but get us in on the takeoff and don't expect us \nto be in on the landing when already the bill is written and the fix is \nin, as the fix apparently is in on the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Could I say to my friend from Arizona, no one has done \nmore in the Senate, in the time I have been here, to express opposition \nto and warn us about the perils of excessive spending.\n  As I recall, one of the things the Senator from Arizona told us after \nhe came back following his campaign was, what the American people are \nconcerned about is the cost of health care--the cost. Of course, we are \nalso\n\n[[Page S13169]]\n\nconcerned about government spending--the cost to consumers of health \ncare and the cost to government spending. Dr. Christina Romer, a part \nof the White House's economic team, said on one of the shows yesterday:\n\n       We are going to be expanding coverage to some 30 million \n     Americans and, of course, that's going to up the level of \n     health care spending. You can't do that and not spend more.\n\n  Maybe she didn't get the talking points for yesterday's appearances. \nBut we have conflicting messages out of the White House on this very \nmeasure.\n  In short, it is safe to say this is a confused mess, a 2,100-page \nmonstrosity of confusion and unintended consequences. Yet they are in \nthis rush to enact a bill--the benefits of which don't kick in until \n2014--before Christmas Day this year. I am astonished at the \nirresponsibility of it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is a remarkable process we are going \nthrough. I see that my friend from Tennessee is here. I know he, being \nthe head of our policy committee and a major contributor to keeping us \nall informed and up to date, would also like to say something.\n  First, I will say something I had not planned on saying; that is, \nthis has been a vigorous debate. I think we have been able to act in an \neffective way, which has been reflected in the polls of the American \npeople who are largely opposed to this measure and greatly supportive \nof a process where we can all sit down together--with the American \npeople in the room, to be honest--when we are talking about one-sixth \nof the GDP. The Republican leader's job has been compared by one of his \npredecessors to herding cats--I agree with that--or keeping frogs in a \nwheelbarrow. I have not seen the Republican Members on this side of the \naisle as much together and as cohesive and working in the most \ncooperative and supportive fashion of each other since I have been in \nthe Senate. For that, I congratulate the Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I congratulate the Senator from Arizona for his \ncomments and his own leadership on this issue. I want to add my \ncommendations to the Republican leader.\n  My thought is that the reason we are working so well together is \nbecause we are afraid our country is about to make a historic mistake. \nThere is a lot of talk about making history. There are a lot of ways to \nmake history. Put aside all of the laws about race--don't talk about \nthem. When we talk about race, that is often misunderstood. We didn't \nfail to make a historic mistake on laws about race until the 1960s, \nwhen we began to correct those laws. Let's put aside all the historic \nmistakes we might have made in failing to stop aggression before World \nWar II. We know about those mistakes. We can remember historic \nmistakes.\n  I ask the Republican leader if the Smoot-Hawley tariff sounded like a \ngood idea when President Hoover pushed it in the late 1920s. We were \ngoing to raise tariffs on 20,000 imported goods, create more American \njobs, and it created the Great Depression. The Alien and Sedition Act \nsounded like a great idea. That made a little history. Shortly after \nour country was founded, we made it a crime to publish false and \nscandalous comments about the government. It has never been repealed. \nOur Supreme Court said it was a historic mistake. Then there was the \nMedicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. I wonder if the Senators \nmight have been here then.\n  So we are capable of making historic mistakes. As the Senator from \nArizona has said very well, most Americans, if presented with a \nproblem, would not try to turn the whole world upside down to solve it. \nThey would say: What is the issue? The issue is reducing costs. We can \nall talk to family members and others--we know what they are paying \nmonthly for premiums, and we would like that to be less, and we would \nlike for the government's costs to be less.\n  Why don't we, as we have proposed day after day, and as the Senator \nfrom Arizona has said--why don't we go step by step in the direction of \nreducing costs.\n  I will not go into a long litany of proposals we have made. We can \ntake five or six steps on small business health plans, reducing junk \nlawsuits against doctors, or buying health insurance across State \nlines. We should be able to agree on that instead of a 2,000-page bill \nthat raises premiums, raises taxes, and seems to have a new problem \nevery day.\n  I think the cohesion on the Republican side is not so partisan. I \nlike to work across party lines to get results. That is why I am here. \nI am just afraid that our country is about to make a historic mistake, \nand we are trying to help and let the American people know what this \nbill does--what it does to them and their health care.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The fear is palpable. In addition to the public \nopinion polls we have all seen, we are each having experiences with \nindividuals. I will cite three.\n  I ran into a police officer--a long-term police officer, an African \nAmerican. He came up to me and said: Senator, you have to stop this \nhealth care bill.\n  Then there are the health care providers. I see Dr. Barrasso from \nWyoming. Within the last week, I spoke to one of the Nation's fine \ncardiovascular surgeons. He said: Please stop the health care bill. \nThis is going to destroy the quality of our profession. He told me of a \nfriend of his, a neurosurgeon, who called him with the same concern.\n  I get the sense that there are an enormous number of health care \nproviders--physicians, hospitals, everybody involved in the health care \nprovider business--apparently, with the exception of the pharmaceutical \nindustry, which seems to have cut a special deal--who are just \napoplectic about the possibility that the finest health care in the \nworld is going to be destroyed by this--as the Senator from Tennessee \npoints out--``historic mistake.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will mention, also, on the issue of PhRMA, again, here \nwe are in the direst of economic times, with a Consumer Price Index \nthat has declined by 1.3 percent this year, and they have orchestrated \na 9-percent increase in the cost of prescription drugs--that is \nremarkable--laying on an additional burden, which naturally falls more \non seniors than anybody else since they are the greatest users of \npharmaceutical drugs. I don't blame them for fighting for their \nindustry. But the point is, what they are doing is harming millions and \nmillions of Americans.\n  Again, about contributing to the cynicism of the American people, \nwhether you are for or against the issue of drug reimportation, to cut \na deal behind closed doors and then, apparently, because of support of \nan amendment by Senator Dorgan, go down and negotiate another deal--how \ndo you describe a process like that?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, ``unsavory'' would be a minimum word that comes \nto my mind. The problem I have is that Americans have a perfect right \nto their view, and the pharmaceutical industry has a perfect right to \nadvocate its point of view.\n  As I hear the Senator describe what has been going on, am I hearing \ncorrectly? I mean, the pharmaceutical industry is saying we don't like \ndrug reimportation. The White House says: OK, we will cut a deal with \nyou behind closed doors--as far as we can tell--and we will change the \nlaw this way, and then--\n  Mr. McCAIN. The original deal was published in every newspaper, and \nit was that they would close the so-called doughnut hole by some $80 \nbillion. CBO said their profits would be reduced by some $100 billion \nif we allow reimportation. They had a $20 billion cushion.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So it is a negotiation between the White House, the \nPresident, and big industry about profits: I will do this, you do that, \nand then you go out--and my understanding is that you write in as part \nof the deal that the industry spends $150 million on television \nadvertisements in support of the deal. Is that the deal?\n  Mr. McCAIN. But then, incredibly, they counted the votes. The votes \nwere there to pass the Dorgan amendment. According to published \nreports, the pharmaceutical industry is negotiating with the White \nHouse and lawmakers on a revised health care deal under which the \nindustry would ante up cuts beyond the $80 billion it agreed to this \nsummer.\n\n  In other words, because that wasn't sufficient to get votes to kill \nthe Dorgan amendment that would allow reimportation of drugs, they went \ndown and renegotiated. What is that called?\n\n[[Page S13170]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, if I am remembering right, earlier this year the \nRepublican leader made a talk on the Senate floor. The attitude of the \nWhite House toward a large company in Kentucky, as I remember, was: If \nyou don't agree with us on health care, we will tax you. That was the \nattitude, it seems, to come out. If you don't agree with us, we will \ntax you, or we will make it difficult for you to do business. If you do \nagree with us, we will make a deal with you that affects your profits.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friends, beyond that, the administration \nbasically told this company to shut up. They issued a gag order that \nwas so offensive, even an editorial in the New York Times said it \nshould not have been done. They could not communicate with their \ncustomers the impact of various parts of this bill on a product they \nbuy, Medicare Advantage. The tactics have been highly questionable, it \nstrikes me, from the beginning of the year up to the present. What \nSenator McCain is talking about is just the most recent example.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I also give you this to illustrate it graphically? In \nthis news report, several lobbyists told Inside Health Policy--that is \nthe organization that is reporting this--they have heard that the \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America may have already \nreached a deal with the White House and AARP to close the Senate bill's \ncoverage gap by 75 percent versus the 50 percent under the current \nbill. PhRMA declined to confirm the reports that it may be agreeable to \nreforms that would further close the doughnut hole but signaled \ndiscussions were underway, and AARP said no agreement has been reached. \nWe haven't seen a deal.\n  Here are our old friends at AARP at it again. They are at it again.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for this point?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is that the same AARP that would, I am told, actually \nbenefit from the decline of Medicare Advantage because they sell \npolicies themselves that would be more likely to be purchased by \nseniors? Is that the same AARP?\n  Mr. McCAIN. When you lose Medicare Advantage, as Dr. Barrasso will \nfully attest, then you are almost forced into the so-called Medigap \npolicies, which then cover the things that are no longer covered under \nMedicare Advantage, such as dental, vision, fitness, and other aspects \nof Medicare Advantage.\n  So if you destroy Medicare Advantage, then people will be forced into \nthe Medigap policies. Who makes their money off Medigap policies? AARP.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield for a question about this \ndeal with big PhRMA, a few days ago I made reference to and quoted from \na scathing editorial by Robert Reich, who served as Secretary of Labor \nin the Clinton administration, who is a leading intellectual liberal \nDemocrat who criticized these deals in the most scathing terms. He used \nwords I was reluctant to use on the floor--as my colleague said, \n``unseemly,'' whatever. I would say it goes beyond that. He used the \nword ``extortion.'' I don't think he used that word lightly.\n  I think it is the kind of process--the Senator has been here and many \nwho are on the floor now have been here for a long time--but it seems \nto me this is pushing the envelope on dealmaking to the point that \nreally is a dangerous step. It goes beyond anything we should \ncountenance, in my view.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with the Senator. Again, I would like to ask Dr. \nBarrasso because he has treated patients who are under Medicare \nAdvantage. Before I do, I want to say again that the whole process has \nbeen wrong. The process of going behind closed doors; the process \nwhere, after nearly a year of addressing this issue, the \ndistinguished--and he is a fine person, a fine Senator from Illinois--\nthe No. 2 leader in the majority, in a colloquy I had with him just 2 \ndays ago, said no one knows what is in the bill. He said no one knows \nwhat is in the bill. This is after a year. It is wrong. What it does \nis--this issue is vital, but it destroys the confidence of the American \npeople to be truly represented here to have their interests overridden \nby the special interests, of which PhRMA and this deal that is going on \nright now is a classic example. I ask Senator Barrasso.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Before Dr. Barrasso speaks, just listening to the \nSenator from Arizona, it seems to me it puts the Democratic leadership \nin the extremely awkward position of even its leadership--proposing a \nbill that affects 17 percent of our economy and the leadership of the \nDemocratic Senate doesn't yet know what is in the bill, we certainly \ndon't know what is in the bill, and they are in the awkward position--\nat least they have been the last few days--of filibustering their own \nbill at a time when they are insisting that we pass the bill before \nChristmas, which we can hear the sleigh bells ringing. It is just a few \ndays before that happens.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It seems, as we are on the Senate floor talking--\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I interrupt? I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee take over this colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Go ahead. I am sorry.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It seems to me, as we are on the Senate floor \ndiscussing the issue wide open--any American can come in here and \nlisten to us--hidden behind closed doors is the other party, maybe \nsharing what is in the secret negotiations, maybe not, because it \nsounds as if a number of their members don't know.\n  What I do know from practicing medicine for 25 years and taking care \nof families around the State of Wyoming is that people depend on \nMedicare for their coverage. There are seniors who depend on Medicare \nand Medicare Advantage. The reason they call it Medicare Advantage is \nbecause there are advantages to being in it. It coordinates care. It \nhelps with preventative care, which is not part of the regular Medicare \nProgram.\n  Yesterday, I heard my colleague from Arizona say there are those who \nwant to shut down Medicare Advantage--AARP, he said--because they are \nthe ones to benefit and profit if, in fact, Medicare Advantage is lost \nto the seniors in this country. Madam President, 11 million Americans \ndepend on Medicare Advantage. Yet they are losing because of a vote \nthis body took. This body voted to strip $120 billion away from our \nfolks who depend on Medicare Advantage.\n  I know the Senator from Arizona has another important point he wants \nto make.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The point I want to make is this process has turned into \nsomething, again, like I have never seen before. I was just handed this \nFOX News, just-reported breaking news that Harkin said--I guess \nreferring to the Senator from Iowa--Harkin said that Medicare buy-in \nand public option are now dead. I don't know what to say except it \nseems to me they are just throwing everything against the wall and \nseeing what sticks and what doesn't stick. This is really, again, one \nof the most astounding kinds of situations I have observed in the years \nI have been in the Senate. Medicare buy-in is dead, public option is \nnow dead.\n  What I would like to see is that Harkin would report that now \nRepublicans and Democrats will sit down together and try to work out \nsomething of which the American people would heartily approve.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I have great concerns about the health care \navailability for the people of our great country. This is a front-page \nstory in the Wyoming Tribune Eagle on the 13th: ``Doctor shortage will \nworsen.'' That is what I am worried about. I am worried about the \npatients at home. I am worried about the folks in Arizona, Alabama, and \nTennessee. ``Doctor shortage will worsen.'' ``It is estimated that as \nmany as one-third of today's practicing physicians will retire by \n2020'' and provider shortages will continue to increase. It says that \nbased on health care so-called reforms they are proposing, the strain \non certainly Wyoming's physician shortage will even possibly lead to \nlonger wait time for appointments as patients travel even farther for \ncare.\n  As I look at this bill that raises taxes $500 billion, cuts Medicare \n$500 billion, and causes people who already have insurance--insurance \nthey like but they are concerned about the cost--they will see the cost \nof their premiums going\n\n[[Page S13171]]\n\nup. There is very little in this bill that I think the American people \nwould be interested in having for themselves.\n  The President has made a number of promises. He said: I won't add a \ndime to the deficit. Eighty percent of Americans do not believe him. \nRecent poll, CNN: 80 percent of Americans don't believe the President \non that point. How about taxes? With taxes, he said he won't add a dime \nto your taxes. Eighty-five percent of Americans don't believe him \nthere. They believe their taxes are going to go up. Yet they don't \nbelieve the quality of their care will be better.\n  So when we talk about a bipartisan solution, we want to improve \naccess to care, we want to get costs under control. This bill raises \ncosts.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I see the Senator from Idaho is here. We both had the \nexperience of being Governors, as did the Presiding Officer in her \nState of New Hampshire. We were talking the other day--and I hope he \ndoesn't mind me repeating that--I worked with a Democratic legislature \nthe whole time I was Governor. But what we always did on anything \nimportant was we sat down together. We had our different positions, we \nfought during elections, but we worked things out. We didn't go forward \nunless we found a way to agree. That meant I usually didn't get my way. \nI got some of my way, but I had to take into account that someone \nelse--in this case, the Democratic legislature in Tennessee--might have \na different idea. Sometimes it was a better idea.\n  I ask the Senator from Idaho, we talk a lot about bipartisanship \naround here. The reason for bipartisanship is that these big bills are \ntough bills. We are expected to make difficult decisions: Are we going \nto reduce the growth of Medicare? Are we going to expand Medicaid? Are \npeople going to be required to buy insurance? What are we going to do \nabout health care premiums? Many of these decisions are controversial.\n  When the American people look at Washington and they see that just \none side of the political spectrum is pushing a bill through and the \nother side says: Absolutely not, what kind of confidence is that going \nto give the American people? On the other hand, if they look at \nWashington as they did with the civil rights legislation we talked \nabout in the 1960s when Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, was President and \nEverett Dirksen was the Republican leader, they saw the Republican \nleader and the Democratic President saying: OK, this is a tough \nproblem, but we have a solution with which we both agree. Then the \nAmerican people had some confidence in that.\n\n  Bipartisanship is not just a nice thing; it is a signal to the \nAmerican people that people of different points of view think a \ncontroversial decision is in the country's interest. Isn't that totally \nlacking here? Isn't that bipartisanship signal lacking across the \ncountry?\n  Mr. RISCH. I thank the Senator. I am astonished at the process that \nis involved here. If one steps back and has a look at this from 30,000 \nfeet and you look at what we are doing here, what we are doing here \nis--and I say ``we'' but it is actually the other side of the aisle--\nwhat the other side of the aisle is doing here is attempting to \nentirely revamp the health care system of this country and they are \ndoing it all in one bill, which we think is a mistake. It should be \nbroken into its component parts. The bill contains and attempts to \naddress quality, cost, accessibility, and the insurance industry all \nput into one bucket and stirred and expected to resolve all of these \nproblems at one time.\n  If you look at what has happened here, the House produced three \nbills, a multithousand-page bill. Those bills were stirred around over \nthere, and eventually in the dead of night they finally got one of them \npassed with one or two votes to spare. Then it came over here. There \nwere already two bills over here.\n  The two bills were produced through the committee process. The \ncommittee process is a very good process by which we produce bills. \nAdmittedly, both of those bills were heavily skewed to the Democratic \nside, and all of the Republican amendments--or virtually all of the \nRepublican amendments, certainly all the significant amendments--were \nvoted down on a party-line basis.\n  Those two bills came out of those committees. One would expect that \nthen they came to the floor and would go through the process. But, no, \nthe two bills were taken over to the majority leader's office, doors \nshut, curtains closed, and various people were brought in. We don't \nknow who, we don't know how, we don't know what the negotiations were, \nbut at the end of the day, a third bill over here was produced, and it \nis 2,074 pages long. It is usually kicking around here on the desks. I \nsee they removed most of them. I suspect they removed most of them \nbecause most people were afraid they were going to fall over and hurt \nsomebody. These were 2,074 pages that were put together. Nobody really \nknows exactly what is in them. There are some generalities that we \nknow, but we don't know all the specifics.\n  Then what happened is a week ago, they decide they will put 10 people \nin a room, leave the rest of the 90 of us out, and they will try to \ncome up with some type of compromise. And they did. The next day, I got \ncalls from home: I guess it is over; they put out an announcement; they \nhave a compromise. I said: That is news to me. I don't know what is in \nit. I started to make some calls. Nobody would release the details of \nwhat this supposed compromise is.\n  Remember, in the last election we were promised things would be \nchanged. Change we could believe in. These things would be done out in \nthe open, without lobbyists coming and getting their input in the bill \nbehind closed doors. That is exactly what has been produced. You have a \nsecret document that has been produced that we have not even seen.\n  In spite of all this, the other side is saying: By golly, we are \ngoing to produce a bill before Christmastime. Christmas is coming, and \nChristmas is very close.\n  I can tell you, after looking at these 2,074 pages--not looking at \nthe compromise because we are told we cannot see it--it would be \nreckless, absolutely reckless to shove down the throat of the American \npeople something that has been put together in secret, something that \nhas been put together in the dead of night, something they will not let \nus look at and examine, and to say: We are going to take this now and \nshove it down the American people's throats before Christmastime.\n  This is not a Christmas present the American people want. If you \ndon't believe me, all you have to do is look at the polling. The \npolling shows every single day support for this bill deteriorates. It \ndeteriorates amongst Republicans, amongst Democrats, and amongst \nIndependents. The last poll, I think, was up to 61 percent of the \nAmerican people said: Don't do this to us.\n  We need health care reform in this country. We want health care \nreform in this country. But this monstrosity that has been produced, \nand whatever it is they are going to drag out of the alley tomorrow and \nsay: This is what we are going to vote on now, is not what the American \npeople want.\n  I have a message for those on the other side from the American \npeople: Don't do this to us. Stop. Bring some sanity into this. Do it \nright.\n  I yield the floor back to my good friend from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, may I ask the Senator from South \nDakota, unless the Senator from Arizona wants to, to lead the colloquy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I can speak for just about 10 seconds.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Let me ask the Senator from South Dakota to lead the \ncolloquy on the Republican side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Very briefly, I say to my friends, apparently, if the \nnews reports are right, the public option and Medicare is out. That is \nan interesting twist, and again, I think affirmation that they are just \nthrowing things against the wall to see if anything sticks. But it \ndoesn't change the core of the bill, which the Senator from South \nDakota has been so eloquent about, and that is the $\\1/2\\ trillion in \ncuts from Medicare and increases in taxes.\n  So you can take the public option out or leave it in, and it still \ndoesn't change the fundamental fact that it is going to restructure \nhealth care in America and do nothing to reduce the cost and nothing to \nimprove the quality. I just wanted to make that comment and ask for \ncomment from the Senator from South Dakota.\n\n[[Page S13172]]\n\n  By the way, could I just mention, I haven't quite seen anything on \nthe floor of the Senate as I saw when the Senator from South Dakota was \nchallenged earlier today. I was watching the proceedings on the floor, \nand I wonder if the Senator from South Dakota would like to maybe \nrespond to accusations of misleading information, I guess is the \nkindest way I could describe it.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate the Senator from Arizona yielding and the \ndiscussion of all our colleagues on the Senate floor this evening, \npointing out how flawed this process is and that it is being conducted \nbehind closed doors in contradiction of all the promises and \ncommitments that were made that this would become a transparent and \nopen process. I think the Senator from Arizona has been great at \nholding the other side accountable when it comes to all these \npronouncements about how this was going to be an open, transparent \nprocess, and that is just not the case. There is something going on \nright now that we are not privy to, and I think at some point they are \ngoing to throw something, as the Senator from Arizona said, at the \nwall, hoping that the latest thing will stick.\n  But I do want to make an observation with regard to the discussion \nheld earlier today because a Member from the other side--the Senator \nfrom Minnesota--had indicated that he thought this chart was somehow \ninaccurate or misleading, and I want to point out again, Madam \nPresident, that the chart is very accurate. In fact, the taxes in the \nbill begin 18 days from now, on January 1 of next year. January 1, \n2010, is when the taxes in this bill begin.\n  In fact, almost $72 billion of taxes will have been collected before \nthe benefits that start to kick in will be paid out--the premium \nsubsidies that are going to support the exchanges, that are supposedly \ngoing to help those who don't have insurance get access to it. That is \n1,479 days from now.\n  The Senator from Minnesota got up and said, and I quote: We are \nentitled to our own opinions; we are not entitled to our own facts. The \nfact is, benefits kick in on day one. The large majority of benefits \nkick in on day one, and we shouldn't be standing up here with charts \nthat say the exact opposite.\n  Well, Madam President, it is not me saying this; it is the \nCongressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office has said \nthat 99 percent of the coverage spending in this bill doesn't kick in \nuntil January 1, 2014--1,479 days from now.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues, and most Americans around this country: Do \nyou think it is fair to construct a bill that in order to understate \nits total cost starts raising taxes in 18 days, but doesn't start \ndelivering 99 percent of the coverage benefits until 1,479 days from \nnow?\n  If the other side wants to have an argument about whether 99 percent \nof the coverage benefits kick in in the year 2014 or 100 percent, I am \nhappy to have that argument. The point is simply this: Taxes start 18 \ndays from now--tax increases--so that $72 billion in taxes will have \nbeen imposed upon the American people, and the benefits 1,479 days from \nnow.\n  So, Madam President, I want to make that point and refute the \nargument that was made by the Senator from Minnesota that a large \nmajority of benefits kick in on day one. Ninety-nine percent of the \nbenefits don't kick in until later.\n  Incidentally, I have an amendment on which I hope we will get a \nchance to vote that delays the taxes until such time as the benefits \nbegin. We think it is only fair to the American people that we \nsynchronize the tax increases with the benefits. Many of us don't \nsupport the tax increases in the first place, which is why we will be \nsupporting the Crapo amendment to recommit the tax increases back to \nthe committee to get rid of them. But if you are going to have tax \nincreases and start raising revenue immediately, you ought to start \npaying out the benefits today, or at least delay the tax increases so \nthe benefits and the tax increases are synchronized. That, to me, is a \nfair way to conduct and do public policy for the American people.\n  The reason it was done this way, let's be honest about it--and the \nnewspapers have made it pretty clear in some of their statements--for \ninstance, the Washington Post states:\n\n       The measure's effective date was also pushed back to the \n     year 2014. That projection represents the biggest cost \n     savings of any legislation to come before the House or Senate \n     this year.\n\n  The measure's effective date was also pushed back. They keep pushing \nthe date back to understate the cost. The reason they want to start \ncollecting revenue right away and not start spending until later is \nbecause they know if they start the spending early on, they are going \nto start inflating significantly the cost, and the goal was to try to \nkeep it under $1 trillion. We all know now, and they have acknowledged, \nthe 10-year, fully implemented cost of this isn't $1 trillion, it is \n$2.5 trillion.\n  The American people deserve to know the facts. That is the fully \nimplemented cost. The only reason they can say in the 10 years it comes \nin at $1 trillion or thereabouts is because the tax increases started \nJanuary 1, 2010, and the benefits--99 percent of the benefits--don't \nstart kicking in until January 1, 2014.\n  So I thank the Senator from Arizona for giving me the opportunity to \nclarify that. It is important we make this debate about the facts. I \nhave tried to do that when I speak, and I am happy to have the \nopportunity to restate the facts as they exist and as they have been \npresented to us by the experts--by the Congressional Budget Office and \nby the CMS Actuary, both of whom have concluded the same thing when it \ncomes to the benefits and the impact this will have on premiums in the \ncountry. I think that is probably the most devastating blow to the \nargument the other side has made in support of this bill--when the CMS \nActuary came out last week and said this is actually going to increase \nthe cost of health care in this country by $234 billion over the next \n10 years.\n  So, Madam President, I am happy to yield. I see a number of our \ncolleagues on the Senate floor, and the leader is here as well, and I \nwould certainly yield time to the leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I could, Madam President, Senator McCain and I had \nan opportunity to talk off the floor about things that may be in or out \nof the current Reid bill. It is over there behind closed doors.\n  Whether things are popping up or being left out, and whether any of \nthat is significant, I would say to my friend from Arizona, it doesn't \nmake a whole lot of difference, does it? Because the core of the bill, \nthat which will not change, has not changed in any of these various \niterations of Reid that we have seen, with $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts in \nMedicare, $400 billion in new taxes, and higher insurance premiums for \neveryone else.\n  I would ask my friend from Arizona, if he thinks any of that is going \nto change?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would respond by saying whether the public option is in \nor out or whether expansion of Medicare is in or out, the core of this \nlegislation will do nothing to reduce or eliminate the problem of \nhealth care in America, which is the cost of health care not the \nquality of health care. In fact, it will, in many ways, impact directly \nthe quality of health care, increase the cost, as we all know, by some \n$2.5 trillion, according to the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n\n  But I also want to point out the back and forth of this--is it in \nthere, is it out? Well, let's try this. Who, up until a week ago, ever \nheard we were going to expand Medicare? Now it is out, now it is in. We \nused to have hearings around here, proposals, witnesses, and then we \nwould shape legislation, which would be amended in the committee, and \nthen brought to the floor and amended on the Senate floor. Here we have \nto get news flashes to know whether the public option is in or out, \nwhether Medicare expansion is in or out. Again, this is kind of a \nbizarre process.\n  But my friend is right; it doesn't affect the core problem with this \nlegislation, which is that it does not reduce cost, and it increases \nthe size and scope of government and the tax burden that Americans will \nbear for a long period of time, including, by the way--and, again, I \ndon't mean to sound parochial, but there are 337,000 of my citizens in \nthe Medicare Advantage Program. The other side has admitted that the \nMedicare Advantage Program will go by the\n\n[[Page S13173]]\n\nwayside. That is affecting a whole lot of people's lives, I would say, \nand that is in the core of the bill. That will not be changed by \nexpansion of Medicare or with a public option or with no public option.\n  Mr. THUNE. Would the Senator from Arizona yield? I see a number of \nour colleagues and the leader.\n  I would simply add that this idea of expanding Medicare, which just \nemerged last week, was a bad one, and one even I think a lot of the \nDemocratic Senators have come out in opposition to, which is why we are \nnow back to the drawing board. But this relentless effort to try to \ntweak this bill around the edges, to somehow get that 60th vote, \ndoesn't do anything to change the fundamental features of the bill, \nwhich the leader and the Senator from Arizona have been talking about, \nand that is the tax increases and spending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could just mention this. Over the weekend, obviously \npeople watched football games. I was obviously pleased to see my alma \nmater prevail over those great cadets at West Point. We have a tendency \nto divert our attention--even seeing, for a change, the Redskins \nwinning a football game--but what we talked about late last week is \nvitally important. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had \nsome devastating comments to make.\n  This is the organization that is tasked to provide us with the best \nestimates of the consequences of legislation--specifically Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  The CMS, referring to this bill, said:\n\n       . . . we estimate that total national health expenditures \n     under this bill would increase by an estimated total of $234 \n     billion during calendar years 2010 to 2019.\n\n  It goes on and on and talks about the devastating effects of this \nlegislation, whether the public option is in or out, whether we expand \nMedicare or not. It is remarkable information that is in this study, a \nstudy being ignored by the other side. Clearly, what is happening on \nthe other side is only one Senator is throwing proposals back and forth \nto the CBO until they get something that perhaps looks like it might be \nsellable. But the CMS has already made their judgment on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CORKER. If I could respond to that, I have only been around here \nby about 3 years, but I passed an incredible scene--I think many of you \ncoming to the floor may have seen it--a huge gaggle of journalists and \nreporters and folks waiting outside a room where our colleagues are \nmeeting. There is reason this bill does not lower cost. I came from a \nworld where if you had a problem, you identified what the problem was \nand then you had sort of a central strategy that you built out to try \nto lower cost, which I think is what all of us thought that health care \nreform should do--let's lower cost and create greater access for the \nAmerican people.\n  Well, instead of that, we have had a process where it has been \nliterally like 50 yellow stick-ums were put up on the wall to figure \nout how they could get 60 votes. There hasn't been an attempt to \nactually lower cost. There hasn't been an attempt to try to create a \nmechanism where Americans can actually choose, with transparency, the \ntype of plans that work for them. Instead, it has been a game from the \nvery beginning of trying to get 60 votes, and that is why none of the \ngoals, except for one, has been achieved that they set out to achieve.\n  This is going to drive up premiums, it is going to add to the \ndeficit, and it is going to make Medicare more insolvent, which is \npretty incredible because when I got here there was a bipartisan effort \nto make Medicare more solvent. Instead we are using money from that to \nleverage a whole new program with unfunded mandates to States, new \ntaxes, as the Senator from South Dakota was talking about.\n  So, again, what is happening in this room, and the reason I bring up \nthe 50 yellow stick-ums on the wall, some of which were circled to try \nto get votes, that is what this has been about from day one. What is \nhappening in the room right now is they are sitting around not dealing \nwith the core of this bill, which is very detrimental to our country. \nBut they are in this room trying to figure out which yellow stick-ums \nwill get them the 60 votes. In the process, doing something that is \ngoing to be very detrimental to this country.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It could be the reason they are so anxious to do this \nbefore Christmas is they think Americans will be too occupied with the \nholiday season and somehow they can sneak this unpopular bill through \nand everybody will be busy opening presents or taking care of their \nfamilies and somehow the American people will not notice.\n  I suggest to my colleague, I think this is going to be a vote that \nwill be remembered forever. This is going to be one of those rare votes \nin the history of the Congress that will be remembered forever.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could, before my friend from Alabama, I wonder also, \nwhen we are talking about dropping expansion of Medicare as is reported \nby news reports--I don't know; we have not been informed--could it \npossibly have anything to do with the fact that the AMA came out in \nopposition to it? Could it have anything to do with the fact that the \nAmerican Hospital Association came out in opposition to it? Of course, \nthat the PhRMA situation is a parliamentary procedure that is awaiting \naction on the floor speaks for itself.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I agree with the Senator completely. As Senator McCain \nalready said, it is baffling. Here we are, all these weeks, and now we \nare being told the public option is being dropped? Today? And maybe \nthis expansion of Medicare? Oh, we just changed our mind on this? On a \nbill that is designed to reorganize one-seventh of the entire American \neconomy? This is how we are being led here? I say to Senator McCain, it \nis historic. I think the American people have rejected this plan.\n  The numbers do not add up. The money is not there to pay for these \nschemes. I think the American people know it. So I guess I would \nsuggest--my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, is not here--\nrather than jamming forward before Christmas, isn't it time to slow \ndown and think this thing through and start over in a step-by-step \nprocess that might actually produce some positive change in health care \nin America?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Absolutely. That is what Senate Republicans have said \nfor quite a while. Let's start over and go step by step to deal with \nthe cost issue. Instead, there is this consuming desire on the other \nside of the aisle to transform one-sixth of our economy, to have the \nGovernment take it over and to make history and, as has been pointed \nout in this colloquy by many Senators: There are many things that \nhappened in our history that we wish had not occurred. This is \ncertainly going to be one of them.\n  I am optimistic. We just need one Democrat, just one to stand up and \nsay: Mr. President, I am sorry, this is not the kind of history I want \nto make. I would love to listen to you but I also want to listen to my \nconstituents and it is very clear where my constituents are. If I have \nto choose between you and my constituents, with all due respect I am \ngoing to pick my constituents. Just one Democrat needs to stand up and \nsay I am willing to listen to the American people rather than \narrogantly assume that all the wisdom resides in Washington.\n  If we figure this out, we are going to do it for you whether you want \nus to or not.\n  Mr. RISCH. I want to add to what the Republican leader has said. I \nthink there is this push to get this done before Christmas because they \nthink people are not watching. People are watching. If you look at the \npoll, the poll is moving. It is moving in the wrong direction for them, \nbut it is clearly moving.\n  More important, I have news for the people on the other side. If they \nthink this is going to go away after Christmas, they have another \n``think'' coming. This is one of the largest issues to be debated in \nthis room for a long time. Every senior citizen in America is going to \nwake up after Christmas and say: Wait a minute, let me get this \nstraight. Those people in Washington, DC cut $500 billion out of \nMedicare? Don't they care about me? The system is already going broke \nand they took $500 billion out of Medicare, benefits I have paid into \nall my working life, and transferred it over to start a new program, a \nnew social program that also is not sustainable? What is wrong with \nthose people?\n\n[[Page S13174]]\n\n  This discussion is going to go on. Because of the complexity of this, \nbecause of the size of this bill, there are going to be news stories \nevery single day from now until November 2 of 2010. My friends, \nNovember 2 of 2010 is coming a lot quicker than you think. By the time \nyou get there you are not going to be able to run from this vote. The \nAmerican people are wisely going to respond and they are going to tell \nWashington, DC, through their voting what they think of what happened \nin this debacle that is called health care reform. It is misnamed, \nhealth care reform. It is higher taxes, higher insurance premiums, it \nis stealing from the Medicare Program, and it is creating a new giant \nWashington, DC bureaucracy.\n  The American people do not want this.\n  I yield to my friend from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is interesting because what you are doing now is \nfundamentally talking about the core of the bill, the core that cannot \nbe changed as they drop this or add that. It is the core that led the \ndean of Harvard Medical School to say this bill, the core, is going to \nmake spending worse. It is going to drive up spending and it is going \nto not improve quality.\n  This physician at Harvard has said people who are supporting this are \nliving in collective denial. It is no surprise that the American people \nare very skeptical, very suspicious. It is why the dean at Johns-\nHopkins Medical Center this past week wrote an editorial that said \n``this bill will have catastrophic effects'' and it will do more harm \nthan good. We are talking about the health care of the people of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield? Those two deans are saying that \nthe entire promises of this bill--that it would reduce cost and improve \nquality--both are not true?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. That is what we are hearing from the deans of medical \nschools. It is what I hear at home all the time. People in Wyoming read \nthis and say this is wrong. This is going to make it harder for doctors \nto practice, harder for us to recruit doctors, harder for hospitals to \nstay open. We are saying in Wyoming--the Washington Post said it on \nSaturday, ``Medicare Cuts Could Hurt Hospitals, Expert Warns.'' We are \nseeing that affecting the quality of care. We are seeing it in terms of \nwill we have a doctor shortage? Will that worsen? We are going to deal \nwith that at home, but people are seeing it all across the country \nbecause fundamentally this bill is flawed. It does not address the sort \nof concerns we have, and we are trying to get costs under control. This \nwill drive up costs. We are trying to help improve the quality of care. \nThis will not improve the quality of care. We are hoping to improve \naccess for patients. This will make it harder. This will make longer \nwaiting lines, this will limit people's choices, it will limit care in \nthe rural community. I know about those in Wyoming. You know about them \nin Alabama.\n  When we read the report by the Actuaries from the committee that \noversees Medicare--and they didn't rush to do this. They are talking \nabout the bill that now has been out, the 2,000-page bill that has been \nout for people to read for 3 weeks. It took them 3 weeks to do the \nreport because they wanted to do a very thorough evaluation and they \nlooked at it, and they said we think one out of five hospitals in the \nUnited States will end up closing within 5 years and one out of five \ndoctors offices will close if this goes through. This is what the \nDemocrats are proposing, something that is going to lead to one in five \nhospitals closing, one in five doctors offices shutting their doors, \nsaying we can't continue to keep the doors open under these \ncircumstances.\n  This report has said the whole effort to drive down the costs of care \nis wrong. At its core it is wrong; that the cost of care is going up if \nwe pass this bill that is ahead of us now, regardless of the little \nchanges they may make at the periphery. At the core this is going to \ndrive up the cost of care. At the core it is going to cut our seniors \nwho depend on Medicare for their health care.\n  Medicare is going broke. This is not going in any way to help that. \nIt is going to make it worse. Then if they try to put more people into \nthat Medicare ship that is already sinking, that is going to make it \nworse as well.\n\n  Plus the way they try to solve this, to say we are going to cover all \nthese new people, many of them, the majority of them are going to be \nput on Medicaid--Medicaid, a program that Governors across the \npolitical spectrum have all said is a failed program, a program that is \ndriving the States into bankruptcy, a program that Governors call the \nmother of all unfunded mandates--that is the way they are trying to get \nthe costs down, by putting the cost on the States.\n  It is still the same people of America who have to pay those bills, \nwhether you are paying your taxes here or there. Plus they are going to \nraise taxes. This report from the Medicare Services Group looked at \nthat and said all of those taxes are going to go up, $500 billion in \ntaxes. Of course those are going to get passed on, so people of all \ndifferent income brackets in the United States, all people are going to \nget hit with those taxes. Some people may see a little benefit, but by \n4 to 1, four times as many people are going to get taxed as people who \nare going to see any benefits.\n  We are looking at a program, a core fundamental of a bill that to me \nis fatally flawed--fatally flawed--that will raise prices, raise \ninsurance premiums for people who have insurance, cut Medicare and \nraise taxes. And you say, how could people support that?\n  We need the solution to improve quality, get costs under control and \nimprove access. This does not do any of those things. Plus it starts \ncollecting taxes, as my friend from South Dakota said--it starts \ncollecting taxes in 3 weeks but yet doesn't give services for 4 years.\n  Mr. CORKER. If the Senator will yield, I was listening to him talk \nabout this bill being fundamentally flawed, which it is. I think back \nabout the comments Senator McConnell said on the floor, and I think \nOrrin Hatch, from Utah, the other day expanded on it. Anything that is \nthis major, this major of a reform that we are going to live with for \ngenerations, should be done in a bipartisan way. I know Senator Hatch \ntalked about the fact that something of this size should have 70 votes, \nto pass a bill that will stand the test of time.\n  Earlier today I heard a friend on the other side of the aisle talk \nabout the fact that Republicans walked away. I don't look at it that \nway. But I remember very early on when we saw the basic, fundamental \nbuilding blocks of this bill, almost every Republican Senator wrote a \nletter to Senator Reid, our majority leader, and told him if there were \ngoing to be Medicare cuts that were used to leverage a whole new \nentitlement, we could not support the bill. So what did the majority \nleader and the finance chairman, Max Baucus, do? They used that as one \nof the fundamental building blocks of this bill. That is paying for 50 \npercent of this bill--taking Medicare cuts, a program that is \ninsolvent, and using it to leverage a new program.\n  What I would say--and I see the leader here on the floor--I agree a \nbill of this size has to have bipartisan support. I don't know how you \nget bipartisan support, though, when almost everyone in our caucus \nwrote a letter in the very preliminary stages of negotiation to let \nthem know that we considered that to be a fundamental flaw; we \nconsidered that not to pass the commonsense test. Yet it has been the \nmajor building block in causing this bill to come to fruition or to \ncome to where it is today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Tennessee is entirely correct. We \nmade a major effort. Senator Grassley and Senator Enzi, the two ranking \nmembers of the relevant committees, as well as Senator Snowe, were in \nendless discussions with the majority. Then it became clear that they \nwere not interested in doing anything short of this massive \nrestructuring of one-sixth of our economy, which includes, as the \nSenator indicated--we expressed our concerns early about these $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion cuts in Medicare to start a program for someone else.\n  I would go so far as to suggest the reason the public's reaction to \nthis has been so severe is because they have chosen such a partisan \nroute. Had they chosen a different route, had we produced a bill in the \nmiddle, a bill much more modest in its intention rather than this \naudacious restructuring, the American people would see us behind it and \nthey would be behind it.\n\n[[Page S13175]]\n\n  By choosing this sort of narrow ``my way or the highway'' approach, \n``we are going to get the 60 votes and jam you,'' they have made it \nimpossible to make this a proposal that they could sell to the American \npeople.\n  The American people are not foolish. The difference between this \nissue and most issues is everybody cares about health care regardless \nof age. The older you get the more you care about it, but everybody \ncares about health care. But they are paying attention and they see \nthat this is not in any way a bipartisan proposal. So they have created \nfor themselves not only a terrible bill, in my judgment, that should \nnot pass and probably will not pass, but an enormous political problem \nfor themselves along the way that would have been entirely avoidable \nhad they chosen a different route from the beginning.\n  Mr. CORKER. I think the fact is the two parties certainly have \ndifferences. We are seeing that by the huge amount of spending that is \ntaking place right now. But the fact is, when we come together around \nbills, we do things that can stand the test of time.\n  When we do that, it is not about political victory, it is about us \nairing our differences and seeing those places where we have common \nground. I have watched each of you in your deliberations on the floor. \nI know very early on we talked about the fact that if we could just \nfocus on the 80 percent we agree upon, we could pass a piece of \nlegislation that would stand the test of time. Maybe it wouldn't solve \nevery problem in the world, maybe it wouldn't go from end zone to end \nzone, but maybe if we went 50 yards down the field, it was 50 yards of \nsolid gain for the American people, something that would stand the test \nof time, then we could come back and maybe get another piece of it as \nwe moved along.\n  I know almost everyone in this room has been a part of discussions to \nincrease access, increase competitiveness, to drive down cost, to \nincrease choices. This may be historic, if it passes. I actually still \nbelieve there is a chance that some of our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle will realize that this is historic. But what is historic \nabout it is this: If we pass this bill or if the Senate passes this \nbill, we will have missed a historic opportunity to work together and \ndo something that will stand the test of time. All the energy would \nhave been expended on a bill that does not pass the commonsense test, \nwhere the basic fundamentals are flawed.\n  This issue will not come up again for a long time. I know how the \ncalendar on the floor is. I certainly know about the patience of the \nAmerican people. But the history part of this, we will have missed a \nhistoric opportunity to do something that will be good for the American \npeople. That is the part, I guess, that bothers me the most.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the Senator has been the mayor of a good-\nsized city, a small businessperson, actually probably bigger than a \nsmall businessperson. But if you were running a business and you were \nin an environment such as we are in today, a tough economy, trying to \nfigure out ways to cut back on your costs and figure out a way to sell \na little bit more of whatever it is you are making or doing, and \nsomebody comes to you and says: We are going to reform health care and \nwe want to do something that will get health care costs down and yet \nwhat they are selling is going to raise your taxes and, according to \nthe referees--the Actuary at the Center for Medicare Services is sort \nof a referee in all this; they don't have a political objective; they \nsimply want to get the facts out. Of course, that is the role that is \nplayed traditionally in Congress by the CBO, both of which now say--the \nCBO says it is going to increase health care spending by $160 billion \nover the first 10 years and the CMS Actuary is now saying it will \nincrease health care costs by $234 billion over the first 10 years. You \nalso have now the CMS Actuary saying it could close 20 percent of the \nhospitals, that 17 million people who get their insurance through their \nemployers are going to lose it, that the Medicare cuts are not \nsustainable on a permanent basis in this legislation, and that a lot of \nthese tax increases are being passed on in the form of higher premiums \nwhich will mainly be borne by people trying to provide insurance. If \nyou are sitting there as a businessperson--and you have been there--and \nyou are looking at that balance sheet and that income statement and \nsomebody is trying to sell you on an idea about health care reform that \nhas the features I mentioned, how do you react to something such as \nthat? I see what small business organizations are saying, but the \nSenator has been there. Tell me how you view it.\n  Mr. CORKER. I met with a businessman in Tennessee on one of my more \nrecent trips. They have an annual payroll of $4.2 million--their health \ncare costs are $4.2 million a year for their employees. They file their \ntax return as a sub S company. The income from the company actually \nends up being attributed to the partners. So when they file an income \ntax return, they don't take the money out of the company. They leave \nthe money in to invest and make sure it is productive and they have \njobs for other people. But that income is attributed to them. So he was \nshowing me what this bill did to them. First, their percentage of \nhealth care costs is 12 percent of their payroll. He is way above the \nminimums this bill has said you have to be. I think it is 7 percent or \nsomething such as that. By the time he looked at the taxes that were \ngoing to be assessed to them because they filed--in other words, it \nwas, again, their individual income, even though the money stayed in \nthe company itself. What he was saying is: This means not only will we \nnot hire any additional employees, we are not going to do that. But in \naddition, we are going to seriously look at dropping our health care \nplan and paying the penalties that come with this bill. I do fear, one \nof the things people do when they see that the government--a lot of \ncompanies in this country do things because they think it is the right \nthing to do. But a lot of companies, when they see government sort of \nmandating what they have to do or if they don't do that, there is an \noption for them to opt out and pay a penalty, when they feel like the \ngovernment is being intrusive, sometimes they decide: Look, I am not \ngoing to do this anymore.\n  What I would say, to answer the Senator's question is: No. 1, you end \nup depressing people's wages when you have these huge increases. \nBecause at the end of the day, you have to have a profit to operate. \nYou encourage people who are trying to do the right thing. You tax \npeople at a level that, because of the way our taxation system works, \ntakes money out of the company which, again, is used for productive \ngood and to hire employees. At the very time when we are trying to \ncreate jobs--and I know you have been out here a great deal talking \nabout the fact that we need to create jobs--we have legislation. This \nlegislation that is before us is a job killer. The uncertainty of \nAmerican companies about health care and then the fiscal issues and \nthen this whole notion of cap and trade is, in fact, what resoundingly \npeople across the country are saying is keeping them from hiring \npeople.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I hear--and I know my colleagues have--they are about \nto send us another stimulus bill. I think I hear the Senator from \nTennessee saying the single most important thing we could do to jump-\nstart this economy would be to stop this job-killing health care bill.\n  Mr. CORKER. There is no question--and return to certainty. The fact \nis, people, businesspeople--and I know sometimes it is hard for the \nother side of the aisle to see this, but it is all about the cost of \ndelivering goods; secondly, understanding what the environment is going \nto be into the future. This body has been so active and this President \nso active producing legislation that is a job killer, No. 1, but also \nproducing such uncertainty that they are afraid to hire. That is, \nagain--I know I have said this before--resoundingly, that is the No. 1 \nreason people are not hiring people on Main Street.\n  I do hope we stop this. I do believe this directly will kill jobs. \nBut I also hope we will stop it and the American people will see we are \nworking on things that save money and not things that cost money and \ntake money out of businesses' pockets, out of Americans' pockets, \nwhich, by the way, that works hand in hand from the consumption \nstandpoint. But this body doesn't seem to have gotten that message yet. \nI am feeling that a few of my friends on the other side of the aisle \nare greatly concerned. I hope, as the leader has said,\n\n[[Page S13176]]\n\nwe can stop this but then work together on something that lowers cost \nso businesses will actually have a desire to hire even more people.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I would like to ask my colleague, we are talking about \na job-killing bill, and we are not talking about a couple of jobs. The \nNational Federation of Independent Business estimates that mandating \nthat employers provide health care will cost 1.7 million jobs over the \nnext 4 years, between now and 2013. We are not talking about a couple \njobs, 1.6 million jobs when our unemployment rate is already 10 \npercent. When I look at this as a job-killing bill, bad for our economy \nat a time when the No. 1 issue I hear about at home are jobs and the \neconomy, that is another fundamental reason to take a look at a bill \nthat at its core is fatally flawed and say: Don't do that right now. \nOur economy can't afford it. The jobless rate, we cannot afford to see \nthat number get worse.\n  Mr. CORKER. It is amazing the Senator brings that up. If he \nremembers, during the General Motors and Chrysler debate, which I know \nAmericans equally paid attention to, there was this discussion about \nthe fact--advocates for government funding talked about the fact that \nthey had to compete against companies in other countries that may not \nprovide health benefits. If you remember this whole discussion began \naround the fact that we wanted to lower costs, lower health care costs \nso our economy would be more productive. I think all of us said that is \nexactly what we need to do. So here we end up with a 2,074-page bill \nthat does exactly the opposite. How we got here, it is kind of like you \ncouldn't make this up--that a year ago here we were, as a matter of \nfact almost this exact time, having another historic vote around the \nwhole issue of what might happen with these automotive companies and \nthe big driving issue being, we can't be competitive because we have \ncosts that they don't and all of us saying: Health care costs do make \nour country less competitive. So here we have a bill that is going to \ntake us in exactly the opposite direction.\n  This is why so many people have lost, rightfully so, faith in our \nability to solve problems.\n  Mr. THUNE. The Senator has made a payroll. He knows what this is \nlike, how hard these decisions are when it comes to making decisions \nabout whether you are going to hire somebody and to try and squeeze \nthose costs down so you can buy a new piece of equipment. I think all \nsmall businesses are dealing with that. The Senator from Wyoming \nmentioned the National Federation of Independent Business which, of \ncourse, is a very business-oriented organization that represents a lot \nof small businesses across the country, indicating the employer mandate \nwould cost about 1.6 million jobs so the job issue is so absolutely \npertinent to this debate. That is why NFIB and the Chamber of Commerce \nand every business organization I think I know of in this country, \nincluding organizations such as the American Farm Bureau organization, \nwhich represents a lot of farmers and ranchers in my State, those are \nthe organizations that speak for these various small businesses. They \nhave all weighed in, and they weighed in heavily, in no uncertain \nterms, that this sets us back. This does not move us forward. You \ntalked about getting that cost curve down. Every analysis that has been \ndone, including by the referees--the Congressional Budget Office, the \nActuary at CMS--all come back with the same conclusion.\n  The Senator from Alabama also probably has a lot of small businesses \nin his State, members of the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, the Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Wholesale \nDistributors, the National Association of Manufacturers, lots of these \norganizations that have weighed in. It seems to me they have looked at \nthis carefully, and they have come to the same conclusion. I would be \ninterested in what the Senator from Alabama might be hearing from the \nsmall businesses he represents, with regard to the impact this would \nhave on jobs.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to Senator Thune, I think you have made the point \nabout the cost curve. And I say to Senator Corker, you hit it right on \nthe head. There is a need for us to work together to help reduce the \ncost of health care and not hurt its quality at the same time. This \nbill does not do that. I say to Senator Corker, what businesses tell me \nis that when you make it more expensive to hire a worker, that makes \nyou less able to hire more workers. If this bill, in effect, is driving \nup the cost of health care--not to mention the new taxes that are out \nthere--as an economic principle, it does mean we are jeopardizing jobs. \nWould you agree?\n  Mr. CORKER. Look, I do not think that could be debated in a real way. \nThere is no question when you add these mandates, you add the taxes, \nyou actually drive up one of the major costs around hiring an employee \nin a firm. Then you add all the government intrusion. There is just the \nwhole hassle factor of having to meet all the obligations that are laid \nout in this type of legislation. All those things just cause people to \nnot want to hire folks.\n  The thing is, it actually affects the most responsible companies \nmost. The way this bill is written, if you are one of those companies \nthat has not been providing health benefits, you can just pay a \npenalty, just pay a penalty and not cover them. But this bill actually \ndoes not just stymie job creation, it punishes the companies that are \nthe most responsible smaller companies in our country.\n  So, again, you all said it over and over again: The core of this \nbill, regardless of all the accouterments--and maybe we get three votes \nif we do this and lose one vote. I am sure there is some scribe in \nthere that is confused with all the vote counting that has been taking \nplace over the last few weeks. But the fact is, regardless of all these \naccouterments, the core of this bill is detrimental to our country.\n  I certainly appreciate serving with all Senators, and I know all of \nus would love to see appropriate health care reform. I hope we are \ngoing to have the opportunity, after this bill is hopefully defeated, \nto be able to do that.\n  I thank everyone for the time and patience.\n  Mr. THUNE. I think we have to wrap up. But I just want to make one \npoint in closing and say to the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming--the leader is here from Kentucky--that the citizens in my \nState of South Dakota, and I think most citizens, would expect that if \nwe are going to reform health care, we do something about their cost, \nwhich clearly that point has been made very clear, repeatedly, here--\nthat all the studies say that does not happen.\n  The other thing I will mention is, I cannot imagine any of our \nconstituents would say that if you are going to implement public \npolicy, you should raise taxes in 3 weeks and not start the benefits \nuntil 4 or 5 years later. It just seems to me the average American out \nthere has to be saying: OK, that is like me going to the bank and \ntaking out a mortgage, but I can't move into the house for another 4 or \n5 years, and in the meantime I will be making payments.\n  Mr. CORKER. I would say to the Senator, if I could, his point is so \ngood. So many businesses in my State are saying: I wish I could go to \nmy local banker and use 6 years' worth of cost and 10 years' worth of \nrevenues to get a loan. They are saying: We can't do that back home. I \nthink it is that very thing the Senator pointed out so eloquently, it \nis that very thing, again, that builds the huge amount of distrust. \nThey know it does not work. They know it does not pass the commonsense \ntest in South Dakota and Tennessee. I think they continue to again \nwonder: You can't make this kind of stuff up. Certainly, you can't do \nit back home.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank my colleagues from Tennessee, Wyoming, Alabama, \nKentucky, and Arizona, all who have been here.\n  In closing, I will quote the Associated Press:\n\n       In part to reduce costs, the legislation would delay until \n     Jan. 1, 2014, creation of so-called insurance exchanges in \n     which individuals and small businesses could shop for \n     affordable coverage.\n\n  All done to disguise the bill's real cost of this, which it is being \nacknowledged now widely by the Democrats as well. This is not a $1 \ntrillion bill; this is a $2.5 trillion bill. It is a job killer. It \ncuts Medicare, raises taxes, and raises premiums for most of the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n[[Page S13177]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have heard this described as a \nhistoric moment. My friend from Iowa, Mr. Harkin--we have served \ntogether on the Agriculture Committee and have worked closely on \nappropriations and other issues--he has described this as a ``historic \nmoment.'' I think we can all agree on that, but that is about all we do \nagree on in regards to this issue.\n  I think we just have to come out and say it: This Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act is controversial. It sounds like it is just \nwhat the doctor ordered, until you look at it closely. If you look at \nit closely, doctors are not favorably impressed with it. Neither are \nthe taxpayers, especially those who earn less than $200,000 a year, \nthey are not impressed with it.\n  Another issue that is troubling is Senator Dorgan's amendment on the \nreimportation of drugs. The Food and Drug Administration has concerns \nabout the safety of the reimportation of drugs.\n  If the Senate tries to ignore these and other serious concerns about \nthe bill before the Senate, it will be an act of hope over reality. It \nwill be an act which this Senator cannot support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/14/senate-section/article/S13177-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 3590\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nafter the opening of the Senate tomorrow, Tuesday, December 15, and \nfollowing the leader time, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. \n3590, and there then be a period of 5 hours of debate, with the time \ndivided as follows: 2 hours equally divided between Senators Baucus and \nCrapo or their designees and 2 hours equally divided between Senators \nDorgan and Lautenberg or their designees, and 1 hour under the control \nof the Republican leader or his designee or designees; that during this \ndebate time, it be in order for Senator Baucus to offer a side-by-side \namendment to the Crapo motion to commit; and Senator Lautenberg be \nrecognized to offer amendment No. 3156 as a side-by-side to the Dorgan-\nMcCain amendment No. 2793, as modified; that no further amendments or \nmotions be in order during the pendency of this agreement, except as \nnoted in this agreement; that upon the use or yielding back of all \ntime, the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the aforementioned \namendments and motion in this order: Baucus, Crapo, Lautenberg, and \nDorgan, with each subject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold, and that \nif they achieve that threshold, then they be agreed to and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table; that if they do not achieve that \nthreshold, they be withdrawn; further, that the cloture motion with \nrespect to the Crapo motion be withdrawn; provided further that upon \ndisposition of the above-referenced amendments and motion, the next two \nSenators to be recognized to offer a motion and amendment be Senator \nHutchison to offer a motion to commit regarding taxes and \nimplementation and Senator Sanders to offer amendment No. 2837; that no \namendments be in order to the Hutchison motion or the Sanders \namendment; that upon their disposition, the majority leader be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I am \nnot going to object, I would just want to confirm with the majority \nleader our understanding that even though it is not locked in in this \nconsent agreement, we anticipate voting on both the Hutchison amendment \nand the Sanders amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. And I say to my friend, either vote on them or have \nsome kind of procedural motion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Which I have no idea what it would be at this stage. But \nthe answer is yes.\n  I would also say, I have spoken to the Senator's floor staff, and, as \nI indicated to the Republican leader, we have to be at the White House \nfor a while tomorrow afternoon--we will give the Republican leader that \ntime--for which we will probably have to be in recess because the whole \ncaucus is called to go down there. But it is my desire to make sure we \nfinish this tomorrow. I think that is to everyone's interest. That is \nwhat we are doing here, with 5 hours.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would that include both Sanders and Hutchison?\n  Mr. REID. No. No. As I explained, again, to floor staff, I would like \nthose to be offered tomorrow, but I think we would have a pretty good \nday's work if we have 5 hours of debate and then those four votes we \nhave playing out.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. During the time that Democratic Senators are at the \nWhite House, would we be in recess or would we be allowed to----\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I think we should be in recess.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Do you have any idea how long that meeting is going to \nbe?\n  Mr. REID. The meeting is scheduled for 1 hour and 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And at what time is it?\n  Mr. REID. I think it is at 1:30.\n  So, Mr. President, I am glad we finally got the balancing back and \nforth, unanimous consent request finally settled on these matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise, of course, to speak on the health \ncare legislation.\n  The Senate is the greatest deliberative body this world has ever \nknown. Since the inception of this body, its Members have practiced and \nperfected the art of compromise. It has been said that politics is the \nart of the possible--and this Chamber is teeming with experienced \nlegislators who know how to work with Members of both parties to forge \na more perfect bill. This means that individual Senators must \ninevitably give ground in the interest of achieving legislation that is \nbuilt on consensus.\n  As a body of lawmakers--and particularly as a Democratic Party--we \nhave compromised throughout our history to bring about the greatest \nlegislative achievements this Nation has known. In the process, this \nSenate has made the country better.\n  Today, we find ourselves debating a measure that could overhaul the \nentire American health care system. We stand at this point after nearly \n100 years of discussion and deliberation, stretching from Teddy \nRoosevelt to Barack Obama.\n  What has defined us across that century is our commitment as a party \nto the fundamental pillars of health care, all of which have been \nechoed in this recent debate. These values served us well in 1935, when \nthe Senate took up a proposal called Social Security. History recalls \nthat debate was fierce. It was not without struggle and was not without \ncompromise. But in the end, we achieved one of the greatest, most \nenduring public policy successes in American history.\n  Thirty years later, these very same values led this party and this \nSenate to take up a bill known as the Medicare Act. Again, that fight \nwas not easy, and compromise was necessary to realize our vision. But, \nonce again, this body and this party brought historic change to \nAmerica.\n  These hard-fought programs have been the valued cornerstone of our \ndomestic policy for generations. They define the way we legislate and \nunderlie the principle that this government's chief responsibility is \nto its citizens.\n  Today, a new generation of Americans and a new Congress find \nourselves in the midst of another historic debate.\n  Earlier this year, a new President was swept into office, full of \nenergy and ideas, and armed with a clear mandate to bring real reform \nto a health care system that was badly broken. So, once again, we took \nup the task of fighting for a more perfect health care system.\n  Americans all over the country, struggling and suffering, many in \npersonal health crises, have looked to us. There is urgency there, and \nthis body needs to act.\n  Those who need help the most need that help now.\n  So let's pass this health care reform legislation, but let's also do \nit right. Let's not pass something just to pass something.\n  Everyone in this room is a legislator. We approach our \nresponsibilities with the knowledge that our most optimistic ideas must \noften be tempered\n\n[[Page S13178]]\n\nwith a pragmatic reality. In the process of this debate, we have all \nmade concessions and we have all compromised.\n\n  My own preference was for a single-payer system. Some of my friends \non the other side would like to see no reform bill at all. But as a \nbody and at least as a Democratic Party, I hope we will stay true to \nthose fundamental pillars that have determined our course for the last \n100 years.\n  As Mohandas Gandhi once famously said:\n\n       All compromise is based on give and take, but there be no \n     give and take on fundamentals. Any compromise on mere \n     fundamentals is a surrender.\n\n  It was in the spirit of constructive compromise that 10 of our \ncolleagues met and worked to forge the new compromise deal we have all \nheard about. I thank them for their hard work. We are all deeply \ninvested in this issue. I applaud their willingness to come together at \nthe table.\n  At this point, the specifics of this proposal are few. As are many in \nthis Chamber, I am actually awaiting the chance to examine the full \ndetails of the proposal. I do have deep reservations, deep concerns, \nabout what you have heard up to this point. Until I see more, I can \nonly say again what I have said from the very first day of this debate \nso many months ago: I am committed to voting for a bill that achieves \nthe goals of a public option, competition, cost savings, and \naccountability. I will not be able to vote for lesser legislation that \nignores these fundamentals.\n  I will continue to fight every day to strengthen this legislation \nuntil its final moments on this floor. I fully realize how hard my \ncolleagues have worked. I know how difficult it has been to get this \nfar. My colleagues may have forged a compromise bill that can achieve \nthe 60 votes that will be needed for its passage, but until this bill \naddresses cost, competition, and accountability in a meaningful way, it \nwill not win my vote.\n  The American people most in need of help know we can do better, and \nwe must do better.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share a few other thoughts in \nthe 5 minutes I believe I have to speak on a different matter than we \nhave been talking about earlier, but it is a very important matter. It \nis the procurement contract, the request for proposals the Defense \nDepartment has put out in order to request proposals for the Defense \nDepartment to purchase a new tanker for the U.S. Air Force. It will be \nperhaps the largest contract purchase in the history of the Defense \nDepartment, certainly since World War II. I regret that I must come to \nthe floor today to give this speech, but it is important that we do \nthis right.\n  Earlier, one of our colleagues, Senator Murray, for whom I have great \nadmiration, I understand told NPR:\n\n       All things considered, I have stood on the line in Everett, \n     Washington, where we have thousands of workers who go to work \n     every day to build these planes. I would challenge anybody to \n     tell me that they stood on a line in Alabama and seen anybody \n     build anything.\n\n  Well, we are prepared, as I will explain, to construct the finest \naircraft for a tanker the world has ever known in Alabama, my area of \nMobile, AL, at the old Brookley airfield, which was a fabulous, huge \nairfield. It was closed 40 years ago, but the runway and the capacity \nand the location and access by water and rail and interstate are all \nthere. It is going to be a fabulous place, and already there is a \nsignificant engineering center constructed there, and there are plans \nto go forward if and when this contract is awarded.\n  I would note that the people of Alabama get a little bit offended \nwhen people suggest they are not able to produce anything of world-\nclass quality. I would remind my colleagues that it was in Alabama that \nthe Saturn V rocket was developed that took a man to the Moon and that \nvirtually everything that goes into space goes through Alabama; that we \nhave some of the finest automobile manufacturing plants in the history \nof the world, including Mercedes, Honda, Hyundai, Toyota, all producing \nlarge amounts of some of the best automobiles in the world. In Mobile, \nhave built a new trimaran ship that can cruise at 40 knots and has \nfabulous capability for cargo. It is one of the finest new ships of its \nkind the world has ever known. We have a fabulous workforce second to \nnone of which I am utterly proud.\n  I would just say one of the complaints I have about the Department of \nDefense's request for a proposal--I have four I plan to talk about, but \none I am going to highlight now in light of the comment of my colleague \nis that I believe there is an inadequate government assessment of \nacquisition and performance risk. In other words, the government should \nassess how well we can believe the bidders are able to produce the \nproduct at the price and in the time frame in which they would like to \nsee it produced.\n  I am so confident the plant in Alabama could be competitive with any \nother bidder, that I believe the government should give this aspect \nhigher weight. In fact, they did so in the previous bid process, and \nthe aircraft plant in Alabama came out with a better score on risk than \nthe one in my colleague's State.\n  So there are other matters that are important, but I just wanted to \nemphasize that point. We are ready, able, willing, and anxious to \nproduce the finest tanker the Air Force has ever seen. This tanker \naircraft today is now 50 years old.\n  I regret we are having the kinds of difficulties we are in this bid \nprocess. I respect so much the men and women of the Department of \nDefense, but I do have to say this newly configured bid process is \ndramatically different from before, and I believe it is in the wrong \ndirection. I believe it has failed our warfighters. I have to express \nmy concerns about it, particularly as reflected in the request for \nproposal that has been sent out to the two bidders.\n  My intent here is simple. I will point out a few things that I think \nare significant.\n  In essence, the Department of Defense abandoned, out of the blue and \nwithout serious discussion, so far as I can tell, its decision to \nprovide a transformational and game-changing aerial refueling tanker to \nthe warfighter. Those were their words. And how has that resulted in or \nwas the result of major changes in the request for proposals that have \nbeen sent out? The bidders are considering those proposals. In doing \nso, the result, I have to say, evidences a clear bias toward one \naircraft over another. I hate to say that.\n  Let me provide a snapshot of what this new RFP does. I asked the \nSecretary of Defense about it at the hearing a few weeks ago. He \nindicated that this process for altering the RFP is still ongoing, but \nI am not sure the Air Force has been listening, so I am concerned about \nit.\n  Let me provide a snapshot of what our concerns are. Of the six key \ndiscriminating features that favored the KC-45 Northrop/EADS aircraft \nover the Boeing aircraft in the previous competition, five of the six \nfeatures were either eliminated or changed to a nonmandatory status in \nthe current draft RFP--a bias, I suggest. In contrast, eight features \nof the Boeing aircraft were upgraded in the new draft RFP, which \nresulted in seven of those eight areas favoring their aircraft.\n  So what is the bottom line? The very sad conclusion I have had to \nreach is that this closely watched competition was altered with a \npurpose, and that purpose was to favor one bidder over another.\n  So we are in a comment period now, and I hope the Department of \nDefense will listen to the concerns I believe are legitimate and to \nensure fairness in this. Replacing the tanker is the Air Force's No. 1 \nprocurement priority and has been for quite a number of years. In fact, \nthe Department of Defense has indicated they understand this, and I \nthink they understand their integrity and the whole acquisition process \nis at stake in this so closely watched and so important bid.\n  So I will show this chart. I am going to point out something we call \na spider chart. It looks a bit like a spider web.\n  The green lines, the inside circle lines, represent the capability of \nthe existing 50-year-old KC-135 tanker in 11 different category areas, \nsuch as passengers, fuel offload at 1,000 nautical miles, fuel offload \ncapacity, boom envelope, operational availability--all of these 11 \nfactors.\n\n[[Page S13179]]\n\n  The red represents the latest RFP requirements for this new--what \nused to be considered--transformational aircraft. It follows almost the \nsame as the current capability. This is really unthinkable to me. It \nfollows those capabilities on point after point after point. In some \nareas, it is less capable than the current aircraft that is 50 years \nold.\n  The black line represents the capabilities of the Boeing aircraft. \nFor example, Boeing's offering would carry 190 passengers, whereas the \nother aircraft, the one that would be built in Alabama if it were to be \nthe winner, would carry 226 passengers.\n  And so, let me say again that\n  I love and respect the men and women of our armed services. But, \ntheir leadership, at least so far, has failed them on this matter. All \nI have ever asked for is that the DOD choose fairly the aircraft that \nprovides the best value.\n  Let me outline my concerns with the disturbing actions taken in the \ncurrent tanker draft request for proposal, RFP.\n  My intent here is simple. I will outline, through a series of charts, \nhow the Department of Defense abandoned, out of the blue without \nserious evaluation, its decision to provide a transformational and game \nchanging aerial refueling tanker to the warfighter. This is clearly \nevidenced by the major changes in the request for proposal sent to the \ntwo potential bidders. Furthermore--and in doing so--the result has \nbeen a clear bias towards one aircraft over another.\n  Let me provide a snapshot of what the RFP does: Of the key \ndiscriminating features that favored the KC-45--Northrup/EADS \naircraft--over the 767 Boeing aircraft in the previous competition, \nfive of the six features, 83 percent were either eliminated or changed \nto nonmandatory in the current draft RFP. In other words, these \nfeatures are less important to the outcome of the competition.\n  In contrast, eight features of the Boeing aircraft were upgraded in \nthe new draft RFP which resulted in seven of those eight areas, 87.5 \npercent, favoring the 767--Boeing aircraft--over the KC-45.\n  What is the bottom line?\n  The very, very sad conclusion that one must reach is that this \nclosely watched competition was altered with a purpose, and that \npurpose was to favor one bidder over the other.\n  The DOD is now in a comment period for this draft RFP for a reason--\nto listen to concerns and to ensure fairness in the process.\n  Replacing the tanker is the Air Force's No. 1 acquisition priority \nand the Department of Defense's most critical acquisition program. In \nfact, the Department of Defense's integrity in acquisition and \ncontracting are at stake.\n  This effort has stretched for over a decade and has been consumed by \ncontroversy, fraud, illegal activity, and political posturing. Let me \nremind my colleagues--both DOD and Boeing employees were prosecuted, \npunished, and some even went to jail over the failed attempt at a sole \nsource lease arrangement that would have cost the taxpayers billions.\n  Our national security relies on this critical capability--the men and \nwomen in uniform who protect this country deserve the best value, and \nthey deserve a transformational aircraft.\n  Let me now turn to some specific concerns.\n  DOD's latest acquisition strategy for the KC-X aerial refueling \ntanker replacement competition is, unfortunately, deeply flawed. \nInstead of the modern, multirole, game-changing, transformational \naircraft that the Air Force has said it wants and needs for the past 10 \nyears, the Department's draft RFP specifies an aircraft that is \nessentially the same as the existing 50-plus-year-old KC-135.\n  This acquisition strategy cannot be justified and the DOD must make \nchanges to ensure fairness.\n  The draft RFP released by the Department of Defense on September 24 \nis significantly different than the previous RFP created by the Air \nForce and released in January of 2007. While the GAO sustained 8 of the \n111 complaints Boeing raised regarding the previous source selection \nprocess, the Department's initial reaction, as stated to Congress, was \nto fix those 8 flaws, and release a modified RFP to keep the program on \ntrack.\n  So how exactly have we arrived at a completely new draft RFP that \nfundamentally not only changes the acquisition process for the tanker, \nbut is unlike any major procurement in the history of Defense \nacquisition?\n  The first change is a paramount focus on cost.\n  While controlling costs is important, when it becomes the \noverwhelming discriminator it has a negative impact on the capability \nthat is produced. Holding cost far above capability, as this draft RFP \ndoes, will result in an aircraft without the kind of game-changing \ncapability the Air Force has consistently requested.\n  The new draft RFP has many flaws. While there isn't enough time for \nme to list every single problem, the RFP's flaws can be summarized in \nfour major themes:\n  1. The evaluation methodology does not consider best value, but \nrather lowest cost.\n  2. This results in a significant bias toward a smaller aircraft.\n  3. There is an inadequate government assessment of acquisition and \nperformance risk.\n  4. The wrong contract mechanism is proposed.\n  Evaluation methodology is not best value.\n  The fundamental tenet of the RFP is the winner will be the lowest-\npriced offer that meets a minimum threshold of specified capabilities. \nThis is a far cry from the ``value-based acquisition,'' as the \nDepartment claims and as the warfighter deserves. Additionally, this \nstrategy represents a departure from the normal DOD acquisition process \nand goes against the generally recognized public policy standards of \nDOD which seeks the best value and most capability at the best price \nfor the warfighter.\n  Because the options for the tanker aircraft will be based on existing \ncommercial platforms, the ``low cost'' approach provides an inherent \nadvantage to the smallest and least-capable aircraft. Because no \nadditional credit is offered for additional capability--beyond the \nminimum thresholds of the RFP--additional size and capabilities will \nalmost certainly be a negative because they can only come with some \nhigher price.\n  There is inherent bias in this procurement--beyond the low cost \napproach--that substantially favors a smaller less capable aircraft. It \nis extremely troubling that nearly every single key discriminator from \nthe previous competition that would have given additional credit to an \naircraft with greater than the minimum capability required has been \nneutralized or eliminated under this new RFP.\n  The primary measure of tanker effectiveness--the ability to offload \nfuel at range--will not even be considered in the evaluation beyond a \nminimum distance requirement that, incidentally, is equal to the \ncurrent 50-plus-year-old KC-135 aircraft.\n  This defies logic.\n  The very reason for a tanker to exist, and a key discriminator in the \nprevious competition, has now become a ``non-mandatory'' aspect of the \naircraft. This change substantially benefits the less capable aircraft \nand will result in a fleet of tankers that is no better than what we \nare currently flying.\n  I cannot recall a time when the Department of Defense, instead of \nenhancing capability when purchasing a new weapons system, made a \ndeliberate decision to procure a new system that is no more capable \nthan the system it is meant to replace, in this case a 50-plus-year-old \naircraft.\n  This is especially so where much more capability can be obtained for \nso little cost.\n  This RFP change defies previous statements of senior Air Force \nleaders. For example, on November 30, 2005, following his statement at \nthe Defense Logistics Conference, current Air Force Chief of Staff \nGeneral Schwartz, who at the time was Commander of the U.S. \nTransportation Command, told reporters that the next tanker ``needs to \nbe multi-mission, it cannot be a single-mission airplane.''\n  On December 1, 2005, Mike Wynne, who was the Secretary of the Air \nForce, told reporters ``Tankers are not only tankers any more. They are \ngoing to be multi-mission aircraft.''\n  If 4 years ago the senior leadership of the Air Force recognized the \nneed for\n\n[[Page S13180]]\n\nmore capable, multi-role tankers, why have we not been able to \nstructure an acquisition that reflects that need?\n  General Duncan McNabb, Commander, US Transportation Command stated in \na press briefing on December 11, 2009:\n\n       New KC-X tanker aircraft in the Air Force's inventory today \n     would make the enormous task of surging more US troops into \n     Afghanistan by mid 2010 and then sustaining the entire force \n     there easier. As the Air Force envisions it, it would be ``a \n     very efficient cargo and passenger carrier'' in the war zone, \n     in addition to its primary aerial refueling tasks, due to its \n     ``floors, doors, and defensive systems.'' Instead of having \n     to fly commercial aircraft, which lack defensive systems, \n     into outlying places like Manas AB, Kyrgyzstan, and then \n     transloading their passengers and palletized cargo onto \n     military transports for delivery into Afghanistan, KC-X \n     aircraft could move them directly there, thereby preserving \n     C-17 transports for moving ``rolling stock'' military \n     equipment.''\n\n  The draft RFP does not require any government evaluation of price or \nschedule risk. Standard acquisition practice allows the government to \nadjust the proposed pricing and schedules of the offers based on an \nindependent assessment, in order to protect the government's interest \nagainst an unreasonable ``low-ball'' offer.\n  This lack of a price and schedule risk evaluation in the new RFP is \nespecially troubling considering that one company--Boeing--has its \ncompetitors pricing data from the previous competition and can consider \nNorthrop's data when developing a competitive position.\n  The government should do the prudent thing and evaluate the potential \nprice and schedule risk of each offering. A failure to include this \nprovision, as was done previously without objection, is an abdication \nof fiduciary duty to the taxpayers, and will undoubtedly result in \nunreasonable bids that will haunt this program for years.\n  The business and contracting construct of this competition is simply \nunacceptable. The contracting mechanism used by the Department--an 18-\nyear firm fixed price contract--will require industry to assume many \nfuture risks, including inflation and the risk associated with \ndeveloping a new tanker.\n  The new RFP incorrectly assumes that both tankers are fundamentally \nnondevelopmental items. While it is true that they are derived from \ncommercial platforms, they are far from nondevelopmental.\n  In fact, this idea is inconsistent with the proposed structure of the \nprogram, which includes at least three years and several billion \ndollars for development. The new RFP will require both companies to \nmake significant changes to the baseline commercial aircraft platforms, \nincluding redesigning the cockpits and fire-control equipment.\n  It sounds to me like the Department needs to make up its mind and \neither buy an off-the-shelf product at a fixed price or properly \nstructure a development contract. Trying to do both will inevitably \nresult in doing neither very well.\n  The bottom line is I am baffled as to why the Department changed the \nRFP so substantially.\n  Why am I baffled? Let me highlight a few quotes from DOD that \nillustrate my point: On February 29, 2008, at a DOD news briefing \nfollowing the previous award to the Northrop Grumman/EADS tanker, \nGeneral Art Lichte, Light-EE, then commander of the Air Force Air \nMobility Command, explained why the Northrop tanker was selected:\n\n       From a warfighter's perspective, I can sum it up in one \n     word: more. More passengers, more cargo, more fuel to \n     offload, more patients that we can carry, more availability, \n     more flexibility and more dependability.\n\n  On September 18, 2008, John Young, the Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisition, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying that the \nNorthrop tanker was selected because it ``provided more tanker \ncapability and offload rate and was substantially cheaper to develop.''\n  Since then, little has changed to suggest that the capabilities \nvalued during the last competition are no longer necessary. It is even \nclearer today that we need an aircraft that is more than a tanker; one \nwith enhanced multirole capabilities to meet global challenges, such as \nthe President's decision to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to \nAfghanistan.\n  In fact, before the new and radically different RFP was released, \nvery few people associated with the program had any idea that the needs \nhad changed.\n  During his opening statement in his testimony before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on March 17, 2009, General Duncan McNabb, Commander \nof U.S. Transportation Command, testified before Congress:\n\n       The KC-X will be a game changer. Its value as a tanker will \n     be tremendous. Its value as a multi-role platform to the \n     mobility enterprise will be incomparable. . . . It will be an \n     ultimate mobility force multiplier.\n\n  In fact, on September 24, 2009, the very same day DOD unveiled the \nnew RFP, the Air Force Air Materiel Command released a white paper that \nstated the KC-X must be dual mission capable--able to perform airlift \nand air refueling missions.\n  Yet the new RFP values multirole capabilities far less than the \nprevious RFP and will undoubtedly result in a less capable aircraft. In \nfact, Air Force Magazine recently quoted USAF General Duncan McNabb, \nCommander of the U.S. Transportation Command as he addressed defense \nreporters on December 9, 2009--just last week. General McNabb stated:\n\n       The KC-X, as the Air Force envisions it, would be a very \n     efficient cargo and passenger carrier.\n\n  According to General McNabb, the Air Force still wants a game \nchanging aerial refueling tanker. So not allowing additional credit for \nextra cargo and passenger capacity in the draft request for proposal, \nRFP, makes no sense.\n  During a DOD press conference after the new draft RFP was released on \nSeptember 24, 2009, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Bill Lynn assured \neveryone that the competition would not be a ``Low-Price Technically \nAcceptable approach,'' and would in fact be a ``Best Value competition, \nwith both price and non-price factors taken into account.''\n  Now that sounds good, and while they can argue its technically true, \nit isn't the whole story. While the RFP does allow for consideration of \nnon-price factors, it is a far second to consideration of price. Most \nnon-price factors, including the ability to deliver additional fuel and \ncargo, won't even be considered if the price difference in the two bids \nis less than 1 percent.\n  Let's think about that for one moment. Under the current RFP \nstructure, if one aircraft costs 1.1 percent more than the other--even \nif--it delivers 20 times more fuel and cargo at twice the distance, it \nwould not be selected.\n  This approach turns a blind eye toward providing the most capability \nto warfighters at the best value for taxpayers. A rational person \ncertainly wouldn't use this approach for buying a family a car, so why \nis it being used to buy one of our most critical national security \nassets?\n  Is that the kind of approach we want to use to buy tankers that will \nbe the backbone of our global posture for the next 50 years? The answer \nshould be a resounding ``no.'' Indeed, in the decades to come, the \nability of this tanker fleet to transport people and cargo may become \neven more important than today. And it should prompt us to ask how we \ngot such a bizarre and illogical RFP.\n  While the reasons for the dramatic changes have no rational \nexplanation, their impact on the RFP is clear. The changes favor one \ncompany. Following its loss in the previous competition, Boeing filed \n111 complaints about the selection process.\n  Although the GAO only upheld eight of these complaints, the \nDepartment addressed many more of their complaints in the new RFP to \nthe disadvantage of the Northrop Grumman offering. These include:\n  Boeing complained the methodology used to estimate the refueling \ncapability of each aircraft was flawed. The new RFP has adjusted that \nmethodology to favor its smaller aircraft.\n  Boeing complained fuel costs should be considered over a 40-year time \nperiod, not the 25-year time period used in the previous competition. \nThe new RFP has adjusted the time-period used to evaluate fuel costs to \n40 years, again to favor its smaller aircraft.\n  Boeing complained about the schedule risk assessment. The new RFP \ndoes not include a schedule risk assessment.\n  Boeing complained that the bidders' past performance was too heavily\n\n[[Page S13181]]\n\nweighted. The new RFP significantly diminishes past performance.\n  Boeing complained that additional credit was given for an aircraft \nthat had much higher capability. The new RFP offers no real additional \ncredit for exceeding minimum capability thresholds.\n  Finally, the price competition has been tainted by the Air Force \nreleasing the Northrop Grumman team's pricing data to Boeing following \nthe previous competition and now refusing to release Boeing's pricing \ndata to Northrop Grumman.\n  For these reasons, I am deeply troubled by the Departments' approach \nfor selecting the next tanker. If the Department continues down the \npath that it is currently on, warfighters and taxpayers will be done a \ngreat disservice.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would like to return to my initial \ncomment.\n  It is clear to me that the draft RFP abandons the Air Force's need to \nprovide a transformational and game changing aerial refueling tanker to \nthe warfighter.\n  And, furthermore, I must reluctantly conclude, it did so with a bias \ntowards one aircraft over another. If we continue down the path of this \ndraft RFP--without competition--we are moving headlong towards a sole \nsource contract where the warfighter and the taxpayer ultimately pay \nthe price.\n  This will be a stain on the integrity of DOD's procurement process \nthat will not be removed for decades. It is not too late. Secretary \nGates has said the purpose for the RFP comment period is to allow for \nthe DOD to correct flaws. The DOD must listen and take action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is a matter of such importance that I will need to \nspeak about it again in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/14/senate-section/article/S13181-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13181-S13183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, this effort to reform our \nNation's health care system is finding ways to make quality health \ncoverage affordable and accessible to all Americans. I believe the bill \nwe are considering in this Chamber as it currently stands goes a long \nway toward making that vision a reality. But even with this solid \nlegislation, there is still a large group of Americans who continue to \nbe left behind. I am talking about our country's first Americans, the \n1.9 million American Indian and Alaska Natives who are suffering \nbecause the Federal Government isn't living up to its propositions.\n  The law that provides the framework under which the health care \nprograms for Native Americans are delivered hasn't been reauthorized \nfor more than 10 years.\n  This means that the Indian Health Services' delivery system is \nchronically underfunded and, given the rapid advance of health care \ntechnology, outdated. As a result, too many Native Americans are \nstruggling to receive quality, timely health care.\n  This agency is supposed to be the principal health care provider and \nhealth advocate for Indian people. Yet every day, because we fail to \nact, the health care situation in Indian Country grows more urgent. \nNative Americans are diagnosed with diabetes at almost three times the \nrate of any other ethnic group. They often don't have access to \npreventive care. And Native American youth are attempting and \ncommitting suicide at devastating and alarming rates. Just 2 months \nago, in New Mexico, a 14-year-old girl from the Mescalero Apache \nReservation became the fourth young person from that tribe to take her \nown life--in a little more than 1 month. That is four young people in 1 \nmonth on one reservation. Tell me this doesn't cry out for action.\n  The Senate Indian Affairs Committee has reported the reauthorization \nbill. The House has put in its health care package the same kind of \nreauthorization bill. Both of these bills would bring us much-needed \nreform to the Indian health care system.\n  This legislation, the Senate must act upon it. We can no longer \ndelay. For the past several years, Congress has failed to get this \nlegislation across the finish line. It has passed both bodies in the \nlast several years--the House at one point and the Senate at one \npoint--but it is still not law. Now is the time to put this in the \nhealth care bill and get the job done.\n  I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are in agreement that \nour Nation's health care system needs reform. We know health care \nreform is needed now. We know the status quo is unacceptable. But what \nis missing is the same sense of urgency for our Native American \ncommunity, this despite the alarming statistics from the Civil Rights \nCommission several years ago that the United States spent more than \ntwice the amount on a Federal prisoner's health care than that of a \nNative American man, woman, or child; that is, $3,800 per year per \nFederal inmate, versus $1,900 per year per Native American. That is \nright, our inmates have better health care than the population with \nwhom we signed treaties and made a promise to provide health services. \nAmerican Indian and Alaskan Natives are three times as likely as Whites \nto be uninsured, and almost half of our low-income American Indians and \nAlaskan Natives lack health coverage.\n  The longer we wait, the more Native Americans suffer needlessly. The \nlonger way wait, the more Native Americans go without treatment for \nchronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. The longer we \nwait, the more Native American teens who may take their own lives \nbecause they are not getting the help they need.\n  America has an obligation to provide quality, accessible health care \nfor our country's first Americans. So I say again, it is time to act on \nthis important piece of legislation. It is time to reform the Indian \nhealth care system and permanently reauthorize the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the health care \nreform legislation that is before us. I want to talk a little bit, \nspecifically, about what the bill does to reform our health care \ndelivery system. That is really health care jargon for the way we \nprovide health care to people who need it.\n  I heard a lot of debate earlier this afternoon about the fact that \nthe health care bill doesn't do anything to address costs. I think that \nis just wrong. The fact is, this health care bill does begin to address \ncosts in our system. That is one of the reasons we have to pass it. In \nfact, we know that over the next 10 years it is going to reduce our \ndeficit by $130 billion.\n  But more important than that are the changes that I believe this is \ngoing to begin to make in how we provide health care for the people of \nthis country. The fact is--we all know it, even our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle--our current health care system is not working; \nit costs too much; and for too many families quality health care is \nsimply out of reach. One of the problems is that 30 percent of the $2.5 \ntrillion we spend right now each year on health care goes to \nunnecessary, inappropriate care and administrative functions that do \nlittle to improve our health.\n  Our health care system didn't get this way overnight. Years of \nperverse incentives have encouraged health care professionals to \npractice more medicine rather than better medicine. They struggle to \nsee more patients and do more procedures to keep up. Hospitals race to \nbuild new wings and state-of-the-art units. As patients, we too often \nlive unhealthy lifestyles, and we expect the newest high-tech services \nto fix it. In the meantime, we have undervalued things such as primary \ncare, preventive care, and mental health services. Despite all of our \nspending, we are not any healthier.\n  Over the past few months, I have joined, as the Presiding Officer \nhas, with all of our freshman colleagues on the floor to discuss why we \ncan't continue this current system. It is too costly and too \ninefficient.\n  Last week, the freshman Senators introduced a package of amendments \nthat emphasizes cost containment. The provisions contained in our \npackage may not be those that are currently grabbing headlines, but I \nbelieve they really go to the crux of our reform efforts. They are the \ndelivery system reforms that will improve quality and control costs \nover the long run. How are these going to work? Well, our delivery \nsystem reforms build upon the\n\n[[Page S13182]]\n\ncurrent underlying bill. They reward improvement in providing care for \na better health outcome.\n  One way we can be more efficient in delivering care is through what \nare called accountable care organizations or ACOs. These ACOs allow \nmedical providers to work in teams, to take responsibility for \ndecisionmaking, and they offer financial rewards for better health \noutcomes. Our amendments allow medical providers to align Medicare, \nMedicaid, and private sector strategies for improving care. Doing this \nwill help ensure all Americans receive high-quality care no matter how \nthey are insured. ACOs provide the right kind of incentives and promote \nvalue over volume.\n  For years, the Dartmouth Institute of Health Policy and Clinical \nPractice has shown us that there are regional differences in the way \ncare is delivered and how health care dollars are spent. Over the \nsummer, Dr. Atul Gawande eloquently highlighted Dartmouth's findings in \nan article he wrote for New Yorker Magazine. He clearly made the case \nthat higher quantity do not necessarily translate into higher quality, \nso that more procedures do not necessarily mean better care. Dr. \nGawande's article has had a tremendous influence on the health care \ndebate. It has been quoted frequently by President Obama and referenced \nright here on the floor of the Senate.\n  In his latest article, which just came out recently, Dr. Gawande has \nonce again made an important contribution to the health care reform \ndialog. In this article, he emphasizes the importance of delivery \nsystem reforms and fixing our health care system. He points out that \nthere is not one single answer, there is no silver bullet to what we \nneed to do to change our health care system.\n  While we can all agree that something must be done, what we can't \nagree on is what specific model or provision will be the best and have \nthe most desirable outcomes.\n  Dr. Gawande pointed out that our country faced a similar challenge \nbefore. In the article, Dr. Gawande draws a parallel between our \ncurrent health care system--one that is very costly, a money drain, one \nthat is fragmented, disorganized, and inconsistent. He compares our \ncurrent health care system to the agricultural system at the start of \nthe 20th century. At that time, more than 40 percent of a family's \nincome went to paying for food. The inefficiency of farms meant lower \ncrop yields, higher prices, limited choice, and uneven quality. \nAgriculture was on an unsustainable path. Dr. Gawande points out that \nthe Federal Government did not, however, offer a grand solution; \nrather, it provided incentives to change the way farmers produced \ncrops. Through innovation, the promotion of best practices, and smart \ndissemination, today food only accounts for about 8 percent of a \nfamily's income compared to that 40 percent at the start of the last \ncentury.\n\n  As you know, as we have heard discussed on the floor, we have \nexamples of great innovation and excellence in health care, such as \nDartmouth in my State; the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, which Senator \nKlobuchar can speak to; Intermountain in Utah, and numerous other \nplaces of excellence around the country. These institutions have \ndeveloped integrated health care systems that are patient focused. \nTheir practices have promoted high value and excellent outcomes, best \npractices, which should be shared throughout the country.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Choices Act identifies some of \nthese best practices and provides the types of incentives for doctors, \nnurses, and patients to change the status quo and to experiment with \ninnovation and excellence. The many programs supported in the bill \nbefore us move us in the direction of delivery system reform, which is \nso important to our effort.\n  By promoting innovative practices, such as accountable care \norganizations, payment reform, and medical homes, we can move away from \nthe current fee-for-service system that rewards volume over value. That \nis true reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor mentioning the Mayo Clinic, along with several other great \nfacilities in this country that have done things a little differently. \nThey have done it by focusing on the patient, by saying what is best \nfor the patient is best for all of us. When you do what is best for the \npatient, you get higher quality care. When you get higher quality care, \nyou actually get lower costs.\n  I think of people when they go in to pay for a hotel room and they \nsay: If I pay more, I will get a better view and a bigger room. That is \nusually true. Not in health care. If you look at trends across the \ncountry, the States, the metropolitan areas that have the least \nefficient health care tend to cost the most. That is what we need to \nchange if we want true cost reform. It is good in States such as \nMinnesota, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin. Why? Because we tend to have \nhigher quality care at lower costs. We are rewarded for that.\n  It is also good for the States that need to get their quality of care \nup, so that we don't see massive readmissions to hospitals. Who, when \nthey go to a hospital and are sick, wants to go back in because they \nget sick in the hospital? Who wants to have something go wrong in the \nhospital so they have to go back? Who wants to go to an area where they \nhave massive fraud, so all this money gets drained in the amount of $62 \nbillion a year in Medicare fraud? That is what happens.\n  That is why, on delivery system reform, the courageous thing is to \nstep back and say: How do we do this better? How do we do it so we are \nrewarding quality and not just quantity, so that we are putting the \npatients first?\n  That is what this bill is about. Why does this matter? I think \nanybody who has a checkbook understands what this means. At $2.4 \ntrillion a year, health care spending represents close to 17 percent of \nthe American economy, and it will exceed 20 percent by 2018 if the \ncurrent trend continues. Hospitals and clinics in every part of the \ncountry are providing an estimated $56 billion in uncompensated care. \nThat is taxpayer money going down the tubes--$2.4 trillion per year. \nThat is where we are now. Everybody knows it is costing them and making \nit very difficult for big businesses to compete against businesses from \nother countries that have more efficient health care systems. It is \nmaking it impossible for small businesses to keep all of their \nemployees on health care. Why? Well, their costs are 20 percent more \nthan big businesses.\n  The small businesses have created 64 percent of the jobs in the last \ndecades in this country. We have to allow them to continue to thrive, \nnot with these health care costs that are a drag on these small \nbusinesses.\n  I always tell people to remember three numbers: 6, 12, and 24. Ten \nyears ago, the average American family was paying about $6,000 in \npremiums. Now they are paying $12,000. That is average. We have a lot \nof small business owners all over our State paying $20,000 a year, \n$23,000 a year. If we do not do anything, if we do not do anything at \nall, 10 years from now it is going to cost between $24,000 and $36,000 \naverage in this country for individual families to buy health care--\n$24,000 to $36,000 average per family. That is why we must act. We know \ninaction is not an option. If we do not act, costs will continue to \nskyrocket, and 14,000 Americans will continue to lose their health \ninsurance every single day.\n  What does this bill do? First, it gives coverage to 31 million people \nwho do not have coverage now. People are saying: Wow, where are they \ngetting health care now? I will tell you where: the emergency room, \nsuch as in the hospital I used to represent when I was the county \nattorney for the biggest county in Minnesota. That was paid for by the \ntaxpayers. When someone does not have insurance, when they don't have a \ndoctor, they have diabetes, they are supposed to be doing their insulin \nand watching their diet and they wait and wait and they end up in the \nemergency room and they get their leg cut off and have big costs for \nall taxpayers, not to mention the disastrous quality of life for the \nperson involved. That is going on in this country.\n  Last year, I was down in one of our smaller towns in southern \nMinnesota. I heard how one science hospital had three people come in \nwith stomach problems, appendicitis attacks. Their appendixes burst. \nThis was over a period of several months. They asked:\n\n[[Page S13183]]\n\nHow come you didn't come in earlier? Two of them said: We work at a \nsmall business; we didn't want the premiums to go up. It would hurt \neveryone at the small business. Another said: I had such high premiums \nI would have to pay I didn't want to come in and have it checked out.\n  If you do not have that kind of safety net in place for people, you \nget more expenses on the far end. That is what this bill does. It \nchanges the delivery system, insuring 31 million more people.\n  What else does it do? It helps to reduce the deficit. That is what I \nsaid from the beginning. I do not want to support a bill that adds to \nthe deficit. Actually, this bill we are talking about--some changes are \nbeing made--reduces the deficit by billions and billions of dollars.\n  A third thing: What does this bill have? Insurance reforms. What does \nthat mean? It means if you have a sick kid, you no longer are going to \nlose your insurance. You cannot be pushed off, put off in the deep end \nall by yourself if your kid gets sick. It means if you have a kid going \nto college, you can keep them on your insurance until they are 26 years \nold. That is what the bill does. It gives a safety net, consumer \nprotections that people in this country have demanded.\n  Finally, with Medicare, it adds 9 years onto the life of Medicare. \nRight now, Medicare is scheduled to go into the red by 2017. No one \nwants to talk about it. We need to talk about it. What this bill does \nis keep it solvent for 9 more years.\n  I can tell you, my mom, who is 82, wants to stay on Medicare until \nshe is way into her nineties. People in their fifties who want to get \non Medicare at 65 want to make sure it is there for them, that it is \nsolvent.\n  What this bill does with the reforms that are in it, with the \npromotion of high quality, closing that doughnut hole, which is \ndifficult for seniors, it helps our seniors. This is an idea, someone \nsaid today--I was listening to other Members--whose time has come. This \nbill is not going to be perfect for everyone. I think about the people \nI heard from, such as the woman who wrote to me from northern \nMinnesota. She wrote this heartfelt letter about how she had gotten a \ncall from her daughter whose husband worked at a small business. She \nsaid that husband, her son-in-law, had just found out they were not \ngoing to have insurance anymore at his small business. The woman who \nwrote, the mom, said she couldn't even understand her daughter. The \ndaughter was sobbing, sobbing: What is wrong? What is wrong? What \nhappened? I lost my insurance.\n  Do you know why this mattered so much for her family? Her daughter \nhas cystic fibrosis. Her daughter needs this insurance every moment of \nher life. When that small business yanked that insurance coverage \nbecause they probably had to--I am sure they didn't want to, but they \njust couldn't afford it anymore--that daughter has to go on the open \nmarket now which, if you have a preexisting condition, is not an easy \nthing to do. She may not get insurance. That is what we are talking \nabout when we talk about this bill.\n  At the end of the letter, the mom said: I need you to be my \ndaughter's voice. She is not going to be able to go to Washington, DC, \nand lobby for this like all the companies that have come over here and \nlobbied for this thing and that thing. She needs us to be her voice, \nand that is what this is about.\n  The good thing here is that, as we look at some of the things in the \nbill, I didn't get everything I wanted to reduce costs, I can tell you \nthat right now. But there are some great provisions in this bill.\n  Look at this. According to researchers at Dartmouth Medical School, \nnearly $700 billion per year is wasted on unnecessary or ineffective \nhealth care. That is 30 percent of total health care spending.\n  To rein in costs, we introduced a value index. I introduced a bill--\nSenator Cantwell, Senator Gregg are coauthors of this bill. Senator \nCantwell got it on the Finance Committee bill and it is still in the \nmerged bill today. What that does is it says, when you look at the \nMedicare fees, evaluate them on a lot of things but make sure you \nevaluate them on value. This indexing will help reduce unnecessary \nprocedures because those who produce more volume will need to also \nimprove care or the increased volume will negatively impact their fees.\n  Doctors will have a financial incentive to maximize quality and value \nof their services instead of quantity. My doctors in the State of \nMinnesota support this. They have supported this bill. They have \nendorsed this bill. They understand that if we want to get that high-\nquality care like we see in Minnesota in places such as the Mayo \nClinic, the Cleveland Clinic, Intermountain, Kaiser--all over the \ncountry--you have to have those kinds of incentives in place.\n  This bill also focuses on bundling and integrated care. I was \nthinking, as I watched the Vikings game this weekend--I do not know if \nyou noticed, but the Vikings won again; Brett Favre is quarterback--we \nare talking about a primary care provider who works with a team. We do \nnot have 15 wide receivers running into each other. We have one person \nin charge--a quarterback in football, a primary care doctor in \nmedicine--working with a team, with a wide receiver, with a tight end, \nwith all the team they have working together, whether it is a \ncardiologist, whether it is a urologist, whether it is any kind of a \ndoctor they want to work with as a team, depending on what the illness \nis. That is what integrated care is. You work as a team, share medical \nrecords. Patients do not get lost in the shuffle. They do not get sent \nto one specialist and another specialist without anyone watching over \ntheir care. That is what integrated care is about, a quarterback with a \nteam.\n  The other thing about this bill is, we start to focus much more, as I \nmentioned, on reducing readmissions, on rewarding places such as Health \nPartners or St. Mary's in Duluth, places that work to have this \nintegrated care, places that make sure we have less readmissions in the \nhospitals.\n  Finally--and I am pleased we got this in the freshman package that is \ncoming out--there is a much bigger focus on fraud in the system. Mr. \nPresident, $60 billion a year is going down the tubes, going to \nfraudsters, to con men, siphoning off the system by storefronts that \nare not doctors' clinics that claim they should get some of the \nreimbursements that should be going to our seniors. That is $60 billion \nin Medicare fraud alone every single year.\n  There are increased penalties with tools to make sure we are better \nenforcing the law. We can reclaim some of that money and give it to the \nAmerican taxpayers, give it to our seniors.\n  Those are a few things. I will be talking more about this, this week, \nwhen we focus on and talk about cost control in this bill.\n  Thank you for allowing me to share some of my thoughts on cost. \nAgain, remember 6, 12, 24. Ten years ago, the average American family \nwas paying $6,000 for their premiums. Now what are they spending? They \nare spending $12,000. What are they going to spend 10 years from now if \nwe don't do anything? They will spend $24,000 to $36,000 a year. We \nknow this is not going to be easy to bend this cost curve. We know \nthere are going to be bumps in the road. We know it is not going to \nautomatically turn itself around. To do nothing, to put our heads in \nthe sand at this moment in history is just plain wrong. The American \npeople deserve to have better health care. They deserve to have that \nhigh-quality, low-cost care, and this bill is the beginning.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/14/senate-section/article/S13183-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13183-S13185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the \nOmnibus appropriations act for fiscal year 2010, H.R. 3288. This bill \ncombines six appropriations bills that provide funding for essential \nprograms related to improving education, housing, and transportation; \nincreasing research opportunities; providing justice; strengthening our \nforeign operations; constructing needed military facilities; and caring \nfor our Nation's veterans. I thank the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, Senators Inouye and Cochran, as \nwell as the various subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, for \ntheir efforts to bring this important bill to the floor.\n  I am pleased that included in this bill is funding for a number of K-\n12 and postsecondary educational initiatives,\n\n[[Page S13184]]\n\nas well as cultural and financial literacy efforts. These programs will \nbenefit Hawaii and the Nation and are especially critical now when \nStates are facing increased financial pressure. These investments in \neducation will aid individuals and society as a whole by helping to \nbetter prepare our keiki, our children, for tomorrow's challenges.\n  For elementary and secondary education, resources in the act support \nsuch areas as history, science, literacy, and college prep. I supported \nadditional resources for National History Day, a program that \nencourages more than half a million students each year to research, \nsynthesize, and interpret primary and secondary sources in order to \ncreate an original work for the programs' annual contest. As science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math, STEM, are four subjects whose study \nis critical to national goals, the Maui Economic Development Board and \nKauai Economic Development Board will work to advance STEM education \nand careers for students from underrepresented groups on Maui and Kauai \nusing appropriations in this act. I also joined a number of my \ncolleagues in working to fund Reach Out and Read, a nonprofit \norganization that makes use of pediatric doctor's visits as a teachable \nmoment on the importance of parents reading to their children. \nAdditionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act will assist programs \nthat prepare high school students for college at Hawaii Community \nCollege, Leeward Community College, and the Pacific Islands Center for \nEducational Development.\n  Included among the postsecondary initiatives in the bill are two \nprograms at the Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii at \nManoa, one of which comprehensively works to address issues relating to \nNative Hawaiians and the law and a second that will create a center on \nhealth policy. The bill will also allow the University of Hawaii at \nHilo to expand programs at the Imiloa Astronomy Education Center and to \nestablish a clinical training and applied science programs at the \nstate's only pharmacy school.\n  I believe that historic preservation is necessary to ensure that \nfuture generations benefit from an understanding of their heritage and \nthat cultural programs are integral to a broad-based education in a \nmulticultural nation and interconnected world. Therefore, I am pleased \nthat the Henry Giugni Kupuna Memorial Archives at the University of \nHawaii, Bishop Museum, and Polynesian Voyaging Society will receive \nfunding.\n  In addition, this bill includes vital financial education resources. \nMy Excellence in Economic Education, EEE, Act program will receive \n$1.447 million for fiscal year 2010. The Triple-E funds a range of \nactivities such as teacher training, research and evaluation, and \nschool-based activities to further economic principles and ensure that \nour students are more financially literate. Financial literacy in \nschools is essential to ensure that students are able to be prepared to \neffectively participate in the modern complex economy. Moreover, I was \npleased to continue my efforts in championing financial literacy \nefforts by backing provisions for the Council for Economic Education \nand Center for Civic Education.\n  Additionally, the Department of Treasury's Office of Financial \nEducation will have an increase of $1 million to further their efforts, \nrevise the national strategy on financial literacy, and develop \nmeasurable goals and objectives for the Financial Literacy and \nEducation Commission.\n  One of the fundamental causes of the financial crisis was that people \nwere steered into mortgages with risks and costs they could not afford \nor even understand. The Financial Education and Pre-Home Counseling \nPilot Program was authorized pursuant to section 1132 of the Housing \nand Economic Recovery Act of 2008, Public Law 110-289. I am proud that \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee and I were able to secure \n$3.15 million for a demonstration program in Hawaii. This program will \nstrengthen the CDFI Fund's support for a range of financial education \nand counseling services to prospective homebuyers and address critical \nfinancial literacy needs of families.\n  This is a competitive grant that will be awarded by the Department of \nthe Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. \nGrants awarded through the Pilot Program will have the ultimate goal of \nidentifying successful methods of financial education and counseling \nservices that result in positive behavioral change for financial \nempowerment and establishing program models for organizations to \ndeliver effective financial education and counseling services to \nprospective homebuyers.\n  The National Low Income Housing Coalition's Out of Reach report \nranked Hawaii as the most expensive State for housing. As credit has \nbecome harder to obtain and downpayment requirements for home purchases \nhave significantly increased, working families in Hawaii need \nassistance to better prepare for purchasing a home. These services can \ninclude credit counseling, assisting with savings planning, and \neducating potential home buyers about mortgage products and available \nprograms intended to support home ownership. Pre-home ownership \ncounseling helps prepare prospective homeowners to be better able to \npurchase a home and select an appropriate mortgage product and \nincreases the likelihood that families will be able to remain in their \nhomes. This project will focus on providing assistance to low-and \nmoderate-income prospective home buyers in under served communities. \nThe Government Accountability Office is required to study the impact \nand effectiveness of the demonstration grants authorized by section \n1132.\n  Additionally, the legislation provides necessary resources for \nhousing and transportation. Thirteen million dollars is provided for \nthe Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant, which is administered in the \nState of Hawaii by the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, DHHL. These \nresources are extremely important to support additional home ownership \nopportunities for residents throughout Hawaii. DHHL is the largest \nhousing developer in the State of Hawaii.\n  In addition to having high housing costs, Honolulu has among the \nNation's worst driving travel times. That is why I am pleased that this \nbill contains Federal dollars to supplement the substantial local \ninvestment in the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project. \nFurthermore, I am glad that the Neighbor Islands will receive needed \nresources for their rural bus service. These projects will help to \nreduce our reliance on imported fuels that pollute our islands, promote \neconomic development and provide additional transportation options for \nour State's families.\n  A number of programs through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration in the Consolidated Appropriations Act will also assist \nmy State. Funding for Hawaiian monk seal recovery plan implementation \nfurthers work to protect the less than 1,200 monk seals living today, \nwhile funds for coral reef maintenance are important to coastal \ncommunities in terms of supporting tourism, fisheries, biodiversity, \ncarbon sequestration, and shoreline protection. The bill's funding of \n$2 million facilitates a University of Hawaii, University of \nMississippi, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and University of \nCalifornia San Diego consortium dedicated to employing infrasound, or \nlow-frequency sound, as a warning tool for natural hazards, such as \nvolcanic eruptions and tsunamis, having the potential for catastrophic \nhuman and economic impacts to taxpayers. Efforts at the International \nPacific Research Center, IPRC, within the University of Hawaii School \nof Ocean and Earth Science and Technology are also supported by $1.5 \nmillion in funding. The IPRC makes data resources readily accessible \nand usable to researchers and the general public and conducts data-\nintensive climate research activities.\n  The bill also includes provisions that will help to improve the \neffectiveness of State and local justice systems to enforce the laws, \nbring criminals to justice, address the needs of crime victims, and \nprevent crime and delinquency. In particular, this bill includes \n$500,000 for the National Center for State Courts, NCSC, which serves \nas a think tank, forum, and voice for 30,000 judges, and 20,000 \ncourthouses, in the State court system in the 50 States, DC, Puerto \nRico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, where annually \n98 percent of court filings are submitted. Funding in this bill\n\n[[Page S13185]]\n\nwill implement the NCSC's State Courts Improvement Initiative to \nprovide increased support services to judges, administrators, and other \npersonnel in the State court system as well as help to shape and \nbolster Americans' understanding of and confidence in the Nation's \njudicial system. I am also pleased that this bill provides $300,000 to \nthe Hawaii Innocence Project, which provides pro bono assistance to \nHawaii prisoners with credible claims of actual innocence who no longer \nhave access to legal resources and whose innocence may now be proven by \ntechnology unavailable at the time of their trials.\n  To address the needs of victims and prevent crime and delinquency, I \nam pleased that the bill provides $400,000 to enable both the Hawaii \nand Kauai YWCAs to continue their programs to address sexual and \ndomestic violence and provide services for victims of such violence. It \nalso provides $500,000 for A Child Is Missing, ACIM, Hawaii, which will \nprovide the critical rapid response that will assist Hawaii law \nenforcement agencies to locate missing children and adults. In \naddition, $350,000 is provided for Ka Wili Pu--Native Hawaiian for \n``the blend''--which will provide 400 at-risk youth on Maui with adult \nguidance and adult role models and one-on-one instruction to encourage \nthem to remain in school, fulfill their promise, avoid a problematic \nfuture with few meaningful options while promoting a healthy and stable \nsociety. To help provide cost-effective legal, medical, psychological, \nand social services to indigent immigrant women, the bill also provides \n$200,000 for the Hawaii Immigrant Justice Center to help prevent \nviolence against women.\n  In addition to providing for our domestic needs, the bill provides \ncritical funding to improve our foreign relations. I am particularly \npleased by two programs funded by this bill: the East West Center, \nwhich will receive $23 million, and the U.S. Institute of Peace, which \nwill receive $19.2 million. The Hawaii-based East West Center is a \npremier U.S. public diplomacy program focusing on Asia and the Pacific \nand is a vital tool to promote U.S. values and interests in the region. \nThe funding provided by this bill will allow existing programs to \ncontinue and provide additional funds for program enhancements and some \nfacility upgrades.\n  The U.S. Institute of Peace, a national center of research, \neducation, and training on conflict management, works to resolve \ninternational conflicts by peaceful means without violence and war. The \nUSIP was championed by former Senator Spark Matsunaga, and I am pleased \nto see the vital work of this institution continue, especially in this \ncurrent international climate.\n  Significant funding for military construction projects is also \nincluded in this bill, which will support the construction of troop \nbarracks, mission critical operational facilities, support the \nconstruction needs of the Guard and Reserves, and the construction of \nmilitary family housing, child care centers, and chapels. We must \ncontinue to provide for our troops and their families as they sacrifice \nso much for this Nation.\n  I am particularly pleased that my request for a shipyard \nmodernization project at the Pearl Harbor Naval Station was authorized \nand appropriated at $25 million. Shipyard modernization is essential to \ngive our workers the opportunity to most efficiently maintain and \nrepair our fleet. The Production Services Support Facility is a much \nneeded step in the right direction. In addition, my request for an \nadditional runway at Kona was approved as funding was included for the \nplanning and design of a C-17 short auxiliary airfield. Once completed, \nthis will allow Hickam AFB C-17 aircrews to complete their required \ntraining in the local area instead of travelling the 16-hour round trip \nto the mainland.\n  In addition to ensuring that our military members have the facilities \nnecessary to assist in the performance of their duties, this bill \nensures that our military members are taken care of when they return \nhome. As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased \nthat the Omnibus appropriations bill includes strong funding for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA, in recognition of the fact that \ncaring for veterans is a cost of war and must be funded as such.Funding \nfor VA would be substantially increased, billions of dollars above the \nprevious budget. This funding will allow VA to improve care for \nveterans of all service-eras and further the administration's goal of \nopening enrollment for more than 500,000 veterans of modest incomes by \nproviding VA with the resources to prepare for them in the coming \nyears. The bill also fully funds VA's research programs, which are \nvital to improving the Department's ability to treat the signature \nwounds of the current conflicts and develop other improvements that \nwill help veterans and nonveterans alike.\n  I am delighted that for the first time VA will receive advance \nappropriations for fiscal year 2011 for three VA medical care accounts. \nThis coincides with the landmark legislation, Veterans Health Care \nBudget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009, which was signed into law \nas Public Law 111-81 by the President on October 22, 2009. Funding VA \nhealth care in advance will go a long way toward resolving the \nproblematic underfunding of VA health care, which left so many of the \nNation's veterans with unmet health care needs.\n  Importantly, this bill contains an amendment I offered that will \nextend VA's authority to operate the Manila VA Regional Office. I \nextend my deepest thanks to the staff of the Manila Regional Office who \nhave continued to demonstrate unwavering dedication to their duty to \nassist Filipino World War II veterans and indeed all veterans who apply \nfor benefits from VA. Earlier this year, more than 60 years after the \nend of the World War II, surviving Filipino World War II veterans who \nserved under U.S. military command received a measure of compensation \nfor their service in the form of a one-time lump sum payment. \nDispersing these payments has been a significant challenge as a series \nof steps are required to authenticate their World War II service. In \naddition, the Manila Regional Office administers Social Security in the \nPhilippines while at the same time administering compensation, pension, \nvocational rehabilitation, employment, and education benefits to over \n18,000 individuals. Without this extension, VA's authority to operate \nthe Manila VA Regional Office would have expired on December 31, 2009.\n  These are just some of the projects and programs this important bill \nwill fund for the 2010 fiscal year. Once again, I want to thank the \nhard work of the Appropriations Committee for bringing this bill before \nus today, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate voted Sunday on final passage \nof the conference report to accompany H.R. 3288, the Transportation, \nHousing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act \nfor 2010.

Mr. President, with over 2 million inmates, many who are \nin prison for nonviolent drug offenses, the United States has the \nhighest rate of incarceration in the world. In recent years, we have \nrightly begun to question how our criminal justice system can better \nensure our communities are safe and free of drugs and violence, while \nfostering healthy families and communities through drug treatment and \nrehabilitation for those who are not violent or a danger to society. \nThat is why I cosponsored the Second Chance Act, which became law last \nCongress. It is also why I am a proud cosponsor of S. 714, the National \nCriminal Justice Commission Act of 2009, introduced by Senator Webb.\n  As we engage in a dialogue regarding the criminal justice system, I \nstrongly recommend to my colleagues recent remarks Chief Judge Robert \nW. Pratt of the Southern District of Iowa made before the U.S. \nSentencing Commission. Chief Judge Pratt authored the trial court \ndecision in Gall v. United States, where the Supreme Court provided for \ngreater discretion for Federal court judges in imposing criminal \nsentences, and he has become one of the leading\n\n[[Page S13186]]\n\nlegal thinkers in our country on criminal sentencing. While I do not \nnecessarily endorse every idea Chief Judge Pratt discusses, I commend \nto my colleagues his incredibly thought-provoking speech on this \ncomplex and challenging topic.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of Chief \nJudge Pratt's statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Sentencing Commission Testimony\n\n                           Judge Robert Pratt\n\n       Thank you for the invitation to testify regarding the work \n     of the Sentencing Commission. Like almost every district \n     judge with whom I have discussed the matter, I believe that \n     sentencing is the single most important task performed by \n     district court judges. According to the Sentencing \n     Commission, federal district judges sentenced 72,865 criminal \n     defendants in 2007. I would be remiss in my testimony if I \n     did not remark upon the difficult emotional toll that \n     sentencing places on a judge. Even when sentences are fair \n     and appropriate, and even when a defendant ``deserves'' the \n     particular term of imprisonment, it is not a pleasant task to \n     pronounce the judgment of the law. I am not complaining about \n     the job. Rather, I am just stating my personal belief, shared \n     by many judges, that it is impossible for any human being to \n     be confident that he or she has imposed the ``correct'' \n     sentence. It is important to state this fact from the outset \n     of my testimony because we too often lapse into a recounting \n     of judicial statistics that fail to capture the enormity of \n     the single act of pronouncing a sentence.\n       I want to begin by remarking that these hearings are very \n     much in keeping with the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which \n     advised that one of the purposes of the Sentencing Commission \n     was to ``establish sentencing policies and practices for the \n     federal criminal justice system that'' assure that the \n     purposes of sentencing set forth in Title 18, United States \n     Code, Sec. 3553(a)(2) are met. Section 991 of Title 28, which \n     established the Sentencing Commission, goes on to state that \n     the Commission was also intended to ``provide certainty and \n     fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, avoiding \n     unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with \n     similar records who have been found guilty of similar \n     criminal conduct while maintaining sufficient flexibility to \n     permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating \n     or aggravating factors not taken into account in the \n     establishment of general sentencing practices'' and to \n     ``reflect, to the extent practicable, advancement in \n     knowledge of human behavior as it relates to the criminal \n     justice process.'' The Commission is further charged with \n     ``develop[ing] means of measuring the degree to which the \n     sentencing, penal, and correctional practices are effective \n     in meeting the purposes of sentencing as set forth in section \n     3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.''\n       I will try and follow the questions that were posed to me \n     when I was asked to come and testify, so as to properly limit \n     the scope of my presentation. The federal sentencing system \n     is not working well. Sentences are routinely more harsh and \n     punitive than they need to be, especially in run-of-the-mill \n     narcotics and pornography cases. The starting point for this \n     result, of course, is with the United States Attorneys and \n     their general charging authority. ``Prosecutors decide \n     whether and how to charge an individual. They decide whether \n     to offer a plea to a lesser charge, set the terms of the \n     plea, and assess whether the conditions have been met.'' \n     Angela Davis, The American Prosecutor: Independence, Power, \n     and the Threat of Tyranny, 86 Iowa L. Rev. 393, 408 (2001); \n     see also Kenneth Culp Davis, Discretionary Justice: A \n     Preliminary Inquiry 188 (1969) (``Viewed in broad \n     perspective, the American legal system seems to be shot \n     through with many excessive and uncontrolled discretionary \n     powers but the one that stands out above all others is the \n     power to prosecute or not to prosecute.''). While \n     ``disparities,'' both warranted and unwarranted, are often \n     discussed in the context of sentencing, the reality of \n     federal sentencing today is that federal sentences are \n     dramatically longer than state sentences for similar \n     offenses. As well, the time that offenders actually serve \n     is substantially longer in the federal system than in the \n     state system. While federal sentences are categorically \n     harsher, the unanswered question that remains is: What \n     legitimate penological reasons exist that can account for \n     the difference? With few exceptions, the Sentencing \n     Guidelines advise sentences that are simply too punitive. \n     The very first thing the Sentencing Commission should do \n     is to advise Congress to eliminate all mandatory \n     sentences. Mandatory sentences come in two types--the \n     mandatory minimum, which requires a sentence of ``x \n     years'' upon a plea of guilty or a conviction, and the \n     sentencing enhancement, where a plea or conviction will \n     trigger a specific sentence. The overly punitive \n     Sentencing Guidelines and the mandatory minimum sentences \n     (which include the enhancement statutes) all have their \n     origins in the mistrust of judges. This mistrust of life-\n     tenured judges does not find a similar mistrust of \n     executive branch actions by politically appointed United \n     States Attorneys serving at the pleasure of the President. \n     Mandatory minimum sentences have the effect of letting the \n     prosecutor determine the sentence. This is simply \n     untenable in a sentencing regime that advises judges to \n     render sentences that are ``sufficient but not greater \n     than necessary.'' For the very first time in our legal \n     history, we now have a regime under the Booker advisory \n     guideline system where the United States Attorney will be \n     involved in sentencing justice. Under the pre-mandatory \n     guideline system, the United States Attorney played \n     virtually no part in the determination of the appropriate \n     sentence. Indeed, in the indeterminate sentencing system, \n     judges had almost unfettered discretion to individualize \n     sentences for particular defendants. While prosecutors \n     cared about what the ultimate sentence was, questions of \n     sentencing justice could be left to the judge and to the \n     parole board. With the advent of the Sentencing Reform Act \n     and the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, prosecutors \n     merely needed to ``prove up'' sentencing facts and argue \n     Guideline law in order to effectively restrain judicial \n     discretion. The prosecutors, however, still were not \n     concerned with the justice of the sentence--a matter left \n     to the Sentencing Commission and, to a much lesser extent, \n     to the judge. To quote from Professor Simons' article:\n       ``Superficially, this limiting of the prosecutor's \n     involvement at sentencing made sense and was consistent with \n     traditional institutional roles: the prosecutor decided the \n     charge, the jury decided guilt or innocence, and the judge \n     decided the sentence. This division of roles, however, had \n     one major exception: mandatory sentences. At the same time it \n     created the Sentencing Guidelines, Congress also began \n     creating a variety of crimes that carried mandatory minimum \n     sentences, typically for offenses involving drugs and guns. \n     Because these mandatory sentences ``trump'' the Sentencing \n     Guidelines, the charge often determined the sentence. In \n     other words, by charging (or not charging) an offense with a \n     mandatory minimum sentence, the prosecutor effectively became \n     the sentencer. In a system in which sentencing is viewed as a \n     judicial function and in which prosecutors are typically not \n     asked to engage with questions of sentencing justice, this \n     ``sentencing by charge'' increases the risk of unjust \n     sentences.''\n       Michael A. Simons, Prosecutors as Punishment Theorists: \n     Seeking Sentencing Justice, 16 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 303, 305-06 \n     (Winter 2009).\n       As a result of Booker, the Supreme Court has created a \n     third system that merges some of the elements of the pre-\n     Guidelines and post-Guidelines systems. The Supreme Court has \n     decided that sentences should be decided based not only on \n     the ``advice'' a judge receives from the Sentencing \n     Commission, but also on the traditional purposes of \n     punishment: retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and \n     rehabilitation. The Court also announced that a trial judge's \n     decision would be reviewed based upon a concept of \n     ``reasonableness.'' Now, prosecutors not only prove up \n     sentencing facts and argue guidelines law, but also are in \n     the unfamiliar role of arguing both at sentencing and on \n     appeal that a particular sentence is or is not reasonable. \n     Within this framework, the Government and the Court, as well \n     as defense counsel, should remember what the Supreme Court \n     said about the role of the United States Attorney in Berger \n     v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935):\n       ``The United States Attorney is the representative not of \n     an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty \n     whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as \n     its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, \n     therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win \n     a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a \n     peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the \n     twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or \n     innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and \n     vigor--indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard \n     blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as \n     much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to \n     produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every \n     legitimate means to bring about a just one.''\n       If prosecutors thought and acted this way about sentencing, \n     it would animate their charging decisions with respect to \n     mandatory minimums, sentencing enhancements, and arguments \n     about sentences that are considered to be ``sufficient but \n     not greater than necessary.'' The end result of a \n     prosecution--``substantive justice'' regarding the sentence--\n     should be considered an integral part of the United States \n     Attorney's job. This is the indirect result of Booker and its \n     progeny. An oft-quoted inscription on the walls of the \n     Department of Justice states: ``The United States wins its \n     point whenever justice is done its citizens.'' (quoting Brady \n     v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963)). Simply asking these \n     questions before charging decisions are made can truly \n     improve the sentencing system under the post-Booker advisory \n     regime.\n       There is no question in my view that the now-advisory \n     system of guideline sentencing has improved the quality of \n     sentences that I have rendered. The entitlement that the \n     defendant has at sentencing is to an ``individualized \n     assessment'' based upon the facts presented has improved the \n     ability of judges to consider factors that were not permitted \n     to be taken into account pre-Booker. See Gall v. United \n     States, 522 U.S. 38 (2007). This rationale, of course, built \n     upon what the Supreme Court has called ``the uniqueness of\n\n[[Page S13187]]\n\n     the individual case,'' as well as the following practice of \n     the federal courts that Justice Kennedy referred to in Koon: \n     `` `It has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial \n     tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every \n     convicted person as an individual and every case as a \n     unique study in the human failings that sometimes \n     mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment \n     to ensue.' '' Gall, 552 U.S. at 598 (quoting Koon v. \n     United States, 518 U.S. 81, 113 (1996)). Prior to Booker, \n     federal district court judges were almost always prevented \n     from considering the defendant's age, see U.S.S.G. 5H1.1, \n     education and vocational skills, id. 5H1.2, mental and \n     emotional condition, id. 5H1.3, physical condition, \n     including drug or alcohol dependence, id. 5H1.4, \n     employment record, id. 5H1.5, family ties and \n     responsibilities, id. 5H1.6, socio-economic status, id. \n     5H1.10, civic and military contributions, id. 5H1.11, or \n     lack of guidance as a youth, id. 5H1.12. These guideline \n     prohibitions are directly at odds with many of the \n     sentencing statute's directives contained in 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3553(a). While sentencing is now more complex and \n     demanding than it was when courts merely had to plug in \n     the numbers that Rule 32 required and impose the mandatory \n     provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines severed in Booker, \n     it now leads more frequently to a sentence that is \n     ``sufficient but not greater than necessary.'' Post-Booker \n     sentencing has also led to more innovative and imaginative \n     advocacy on the part of many defense lawyers. Courts are \n     now presented with sentencing alternatives that can better \n     suit offenders' needs and that will lead to more community \n     based solutions. Such alternatives in sentencing are \n     sometimes far more appropriate than imposing sentences of \n     incarceration, where offenders are commonly deprived of \n     familial and other support mechanisms. Breaking the cycle \n     of parentless children, many of whom will fail in the same \n     way as their parents, must be inculcated into sentencing \n     practices.\n       The Sentencing Guidelines should continue to be advisory \n     and should play a role in helping judges achieve the goals of \n     sentencing. The preference of the Guidelines, however, for \n     custodial sentences as opposed to non-custodial sentences \n     should be eliminated by promulgating guidelines that \n     encourage non-custodial sentences--particularly for first \n     time and non-violent offenders. These new guidelines should \n     be based upon empirical research into such emerging topics as \n     the effects of brain maturity and should encourage analyzing \n     the ``whole person,'' which would include psychological and \n     vocational evaluations, intelligence tests, and risk factor \n     identification. This would require judges to look at the \n     sentencing goal of rehabilitation, rather than mere \n     retribution. The current preference in the Guidelines for \n     custodial sentences also does not appropriately permit the \n     sentencing judge to employ the ``institutional advantages'' \n     that Justice Stevens referred to in Gall. Many times, a judge \n     can ``feel'' or sense the sincerity of a defendant during \n     allocution, and such a factor can never be properly \n     ``conveyed by the record'' of the proceedings. Some \n     acknowledgment should be made in an advisory guideline or in \n     a policy statement regarding the importance of a defendant's \n     right of allocution, as well as to the right of allocution of \n     any victims of the offense. Such an acknowledgment will add \n     to the record available to counsel, to the sentencing judge, \n     and to any reviewing court that must determine the \n     reasonableness of a sentence. Indeed, it seems to me that \n     offering this type of advice to sentencing judges would keep \n     with the initial Congressional intent in passing the \n     Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which delegated to the \n     Commission the responsibility of developing sentencing \n     policies and practices that achieve certainty and assure \n     fairness.\n       Another suggested advisory guideline or policy statement \n     that could be added to the sentencing practices is one that I \n     have used in my post-sentencing work. The opportunity to \n     talk with ex-offenders about their incarceration \n     experience, rehabilitative efforts, educational programs, \n     and attitudes about their upcoming supervised release term \n     is an ``institutional advantage'' that can only add to a \n     judge's sentencing expertise. Seeing what a probationary \n     sentence or a short or long sentence does to a defendant \n     is a useful tool in knowing what sentence to give in a \n     similar case. At a minimum, it provides insight to the \n     sentencing judge that no one else has. These changes with \n     respect to sentencing, while not mandatory, could \n     certainly be useful to judges on some level. The \n     Sentencing Commission currently issues reports that relate \n     a statistical approach to sentencing and that continues to \n     center judges' attentions on the Sentencing Guidelines, as \n     if a certain percentage of ``within Guidelines'' sentences \n     can be determinative of the quality of those sentences. \n     While I do believe that these reports are helpful to \n     judges in that they tell us something about sentencing, I \n     also believe that these reports tend to erroneously \n     ``anchor'' a judge into thinking that a guideline sentence \n     is preferred or even that an unwritten presumption for the \n     guideline sentence exists.\n       A final set of suggestions for the Sentencing Commission \n     would be, first, to reconsider aforementioned Guideline \n     provisions that all but dismiss an offender's family and \n     community contributions. Our law should recognize and value \n     those rare offenders who consistently provide financial \n     support for their children, participate positively in their \n     children's lives, and benefit the community through \n     consistent charitable or public service. These traits speak \n     not only to an offender's overall character but also to their \n     ability to reintegrate into society. Moreover, the Sentencing \n     Commission should reconsider the sheer number of enhancements \n     that are applicable in many drug, firearm, and pornography \n     cases, as they place many offenders' guideline ranges near \n     the statutory maximum, despite the dramatic differences in \n     culpability among the offenders. Perhaps, the Sentencing \n     Commission should also reconsider utilizing a higher standard \n     of proof, more in tune with other criminal law principles, \n     for all enhancements. Indeed, the use of acquitted conduct, \n     for example, proven only by a preponderance of the evidence, \n     to dramatically increase an offender's guideline range serves \n     to functionally undercut the jury system and discredit the \n     Sentencing Commission and the larger criminal justice system \n     in the eyes of the public.\n       With respect to the balance between uniformity and \n     discretion, I believe that any system that allows judges to \n     individually assess a defendant within the broad parameters \n     of the sentencing statute will necessarily sometimes appear \n     to be ``non-uniform or disparate'' in terms of the ultimate \n     sentence. This ``unwarranted disparity'' is a price worth \n     paying because sentencing is inherently fact based and \n     because human beings (including judges) are unique. Thus, any \n     appearance of disparity, and indeed, any actual disparity, \n     should be viewed as a necessary consequence of an \n     appropriately individualized process. As in many arenas of \n     the law where ``discretion'' is the rule, there will always \n     be different results in different cases. While we should \n     attempt to limit unequal results where all other factors are \n     equal, no system can ever truly and adequately account for \n     the disparate acts of police, prosecutors, probation \n     officers, and judges--all players that interact in a system \n     that will eventually result in an offender's conviction. The \n     current perception in working-class and poor-America is that \n     society has one set of rules that apply to well-to-do people, \n     and another set of rules that impacts on them. Certainly, any \n     statistical analysis of the impact of the Sentencing Reform \n     Act on the federal prison population would show that \n     incarceration rates have doubled or even tripled for poor \n     people and minorities, but have remained steady for well-\n     to-do people and non-minorities. The Supreme Court in Gall \n     made reference to my own comment in the underlying \n     sentencing of Mr. Gall that ``respect for the law'' has to \n     mean something more than long sentences. Indeed, in \n     sentencing Mr. Gall to 36 months of probation, I \n     specifically found that ``a sentence of imprisonment may \n     work to promote not respect, but derision, of the law if \n     the law is viewed as merely a means to dispense harsh \n     punishment without taking into account the real conduct \n     and circumstances involved in sentencing.'' Gall, 552 U.S. \n     at 599 (quoting the district court decision). The current \n     law overlooks, or at least gives less weight to, the \n     collateral consequences of conviction in our country and \n     in the majority of our states. The offender is deprived of \n     the right to vote in most states, the right to serve on a \n     jury, the right to run for elective office, and the right \n     to possess firearms (whatever the eventual Supreme Court \n     view of that right entails). Moreover, a conviction will \n     inevitably forever harm an offender's employment \n     opportunities, and in turn, the chances the offender's \n     children will have to get an education and succeed on \n     their own merits. The fact is that, unlike most, if not \n     all, democracies, we condemn more than the conduct of the \n     offender. We also condemn the convicted individual \n     personally, telling them, in effect, that society no \n     longer wants their contributions or values their \n     existence. Limiting the stigma of conviction after a \n     sentence is completed should be one of the primary goals \n     of the sentencing commission.\n       With respect to analyzing a sentence within or outside the \n     Sentencing Guideline range, I think determining a sentence \n     with the Guideline as the ``norm'' gives too much weight to \n     the Sentencing Guidelines which, after all, are just one of \n     the Sec. 3553(a) factors to be considered. The Supreme Court \n     has instructed us that the ``overarching'' provision of the \n     Sentencing Reform Act that must be given effect is the \n     ``parsimony provision''--that is, the Court is charged with \n     arriving at a sentence that is ``sufficient but not greater \n     than necessary.'' This provision has a long pedigree. As \n     early as 1748, Baron Charles de Montesquieu wrote in The \n     Spirit of the Laws, Bk. XIX. 14 (G. Bell & Sons 1914): ``All \n     punishment which is not derived from necessity is \n     tyrannical.'' I think a better approach is the sentencing \n     statute itself, which allows the sentencing judge to gather \n     evidence on each of the Sec. 3553(a) factors and to determine \n     what, if any, incarceration is necessary, and then to \n     determine, if the circumstances warrant, the length of \n     confinement that would best serve the purposes set forth in \n     the statute. While the Gall Court properly instructed \n     sentencing judges to start with correctly calculating the \n     advisory Sentencing Guideline range, it employed this \n     starting point to aid in ``secur[ing] nationwide \n     consistency'' in sentencing, not because Guideline \n     calculations are entitled to greater weight than any other \n     sentencing factor. While the Sentencing Guidelines attempt to \n     render a ``wholesale'' overview to the sentencing \n     considerations outlined in Sec. 3553(a), the Rita Court \n     explained that guidelines certainly cannot routinely provide \n     a ``sufficient but not greater than necessary'' sentence if \n     the district court is engaged in an individualized\n\n[[Page S13188]]\n\n     assessment of the offender and the offense. See Rita v. \n     United States, 551 U.S. 338 (2007). Accordingly, a sentencing \n     judge must use his or her experience and common sense when \n     determining what value the ``starting point'' should have in \n     the final analysis. As Judge Cabranes and Professor Stith \n     point out in their book, ``the explosion of case law on \n     federal sentencing contains almost no discussion of the \n     purposes of sentencing generally or in the specific case--\n     almost no articulated concern as to whether a \n     particular defendant should be sentenced in the interest \n     of general deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, and/or \n     incapacitation.'' Kate Stith & Jose Cabranes, Fear of \n     Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts \n     (Univ. of Chicago Press 1998). Now that judges are free to \n     discuss these purposes of sentencing within the context of \n     the individualized facts of the offender and the case, an \n     exchange among the courts, defenders, prosecutors, \n     probation officers, victims, and the Sentencing Commission \n     can take place and a ``common law'' of sentencing can and \n     should emerge. A great example of this ``common law'' of \n     sentencing that actually addresses the purposes of \n     sentencing can be found in United States v. Cole, 622 F. \n     Supp. 2d 632 (N.D. Ohio 2008), where the trial court \n     discussed the purposes of sentencing in the following \n     manner:\n       ``We have long understood that sentencing serves the \n     purposes of retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and \n     rehabilitation. Deterrence, incapacitation, and \n     rehabilitation are prospective and societal--each looks \n     forwards and asks: What amount and kind of punishment will \n     help make society safe? In contrast, retribution imposes \n     punishment based upon moral culpability and asks: What \n     penalty is needed to restore the offender to moral standing \n     within the community?''\n       The Cole court went on to describe how each of these \n     purposes was consistent with the sentencing statute found at \n     Sec. 3553, and how the law and the facts (which involved a \n     financial crime) should be analyzed given these sentencing \n     concerns.\n       With respect to appellate review, I believe that the \n     ``abuse of discretion'' standard has worked well and will \n     continue to do so. District court judges ``live with a case'' \n     for a substantial period of time and have face-to-face \n     interactions with the offender. Appellate courts do not have \n     these advantages available to district judges in formulating \n     an appropriate sentence, making a less deferential, ``de \n     novo'' standard of review inappropriate. While district \n     judges can and do get it wrong from time to time, I believe \n     the current ``abuse of discretion'' standard adequately \n     allows appellate courts to determine the point at which the \n     latitude afforded district court judges has been \n     transgressed. If a Court of Appeals canvasses the entire \n     record and is left with a ``firm and abiding'' conviction \n     that the sentence is not ``reasonable,'' then the Court of \n     Appeals can and should intervene and reverse the district \n     judge. I am not certain that this is a test which ``shocks \n     the judicial conscience,'' but I am confident that Court of \n     Appeals judges will be able to identify an unreasonable \n     sentence when they see it and articulate the reasons why the \n     sentence is unreasonable in the context of the particular \n     facts of a case.\n       Lastly, with respect to changes in either the sentencing \n     statutes or the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, I would \n     emphasize the necessity of eliminating all mandatory minimum \n     statutes and sentencing enhancement statutes. These statutes \n     unfairly and improperly shift the sentencing function of \n     government from the judicial branch to the executive branch. \n     With respect to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, it \n     should be expanded to permit a broader exchange of \n     information in advance of the actual sentencing proceedings. \n     Additional authority should be provided within the Rules to \n     allow medical, psychological, or vocational testing when such \n     testing would aid the sentencing judge in formulating an \n     appropriate sentence.\n       Thank you for the invitation to submit testimony before the \n     commission. I look forward to the opportunity to verbally \n     address any concerns or questions you may have about my \n     testimony.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/14/senate-section/article/S13188-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Stephen Murphy\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to express my sincerest \ncondolences and deepest sympathies to the family of SSG Stephen F. \nMurphy, who died in Al Asad, Iraq, on November 8. Staff Sergeant \nMurphy, a native of Troy, NH, served his country for 16 years as a \nmember of the U.S. Marine Corps. The American people will forever be \ngrateful for his service.\n  Staff Sergeant Murphy exemplified the best in America's long \ntradition of duty, sacrifice and service. Despite being turned away \nfrom a Marine recruiting station as a teenager for being too small and \nstill lacking a high school diploma, Stephen was determined to enlist \nand rededicated himself to his studies and weight training until he \ncould join the Corps. The selfless determination he displayed is what \nmakes our Armed Forces the best in the world.\n  When he formally established Veterans Day in 1954, President \nEisenhower described the importance of a national day of remembrance: \n``On that day let us solemnly remember the sacrifices of all those who \nfought so valiantly, on the seas, in the air, and on foreign shores, to \npreserve our heritage of freedom, and let us reconsecrate ourselves to \nthe task of promoting an enduring peace so that their efforts shall not \nhave been in vain.''\n  In the town of Troy this past Veterans Day, those words undoubtedly \ntook on a new poignancy as the community came together to honor the \nsacrifice of one of its own. Our nation can never fully repay this \nsacrifice, nor fully assuage the loss to Stephen's family. Through his \nyears of service, he helped preserve the safety and security of the \nAmerican people. It now falls to all of us to honor his memory by \nsupporting our veterans and their families and ensuring America's \ncontinued security.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring the life \nof SSG Stephen Murphy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/14/senate-section/article/S13188-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING AMBASSADOR THOMAS F. STROOCK\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President. Wyoming has lost a statesman. On Sunday, \nDecember 13, 2009, Ambassador Thomas F. Stroock passed away at the age \nof 84. Tom once said, ``I don't know why God gave me this wonderful \nlife. Good fortune, I guess.'' Those of us who had the benefit of \nknowing Tom are certain that his wonderful life was a result of his \ndetermination, toughness, and confidence.\n  Tom served our Nation as a marine in WWII. In 1948, he graduated from \nYale University and then found his way to Wyoming. His first job was as \na roughneck on an oil rig. The following year, the lovely Marta Freyre \nde Andrade agreed to be his wife.\n  Tom was a man who saw possibilities and opportunities. He started his \nown oil and gas properties firm in 1952, Stroock Leasing Corporation \nand Alpha Exploration, Inc. It grew to be one of Wyoming's most \nrespected and successful oil and gas businesses.\n  While he was busy with his successful energy endeavors, Tom still had \nmuch to give Wyoming and our Nation. He served for 16 years in the \nWyoming Legislature. He was chairman of the local school board, as well \nas the Wyoming School Boards Association and Wyoming Higher Education \nCouncil. Tom used his energy and business acumen to lead the industry \nthough his service on the Wyoming Natural Gas Pipeline Authority and \nthe Enhanced Oil Recovery Commission.\n  In 1989, his good friend and college classmate, President George H. \nW. Bush, tapped him to be the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of \nGuatemala. It was a tough assignment. Guatemala was in the midst of a \ndecades-long civil war. Tom approached this job as he did all of his \nother challenges--with forthrightness and courage. Ambassador Stroock \nprovided challenge and support to our friends in Guatemala as they \nworked toward a more stable economy, a decrease in political violence \nand perhaps most notable to the outside world, increased internal \nsafety measures. Tom helped bring about changes that greatly impacted \nthe daily lives of Guatemalans.\n  Tom Stroock's accomplishments were numerous. Throughout his lifetime \nof leadership and service, Marta was at his side. The couple, married \nfor 60 years, served as a pillar of the Casper, WY, community. Their \ndaughters Margie, Sandy, Betty, and Anne, are carrying on their \nfather's commitment to business and public service.\n  Mr. President, while we are saddened by the passing of Ambassador \nThomas F. Stroock, we are left with the example of a life well lived.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/14/senate-section/article/S13188-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13188-S13189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ERNIE LOMBARD\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today to give recognition to Ernie \nLombard who has been at the forefront of preserving and recording \nIdaho's great past.\n  For more than 20 years, Ernie has had a vision of a State park that \nwould showcase Idaho's mining history and allow for motorized \nrecreation. In 2009, the vision was realized when thanks to Ernie's \nleadership, the Bayhorse ghost town in Custer County became the newest \naddition to Idaho's State park system.\n\n[[Page S13189]]\n\n  It was not an easy task. Many parcels in the park needed to have \ncentury-old toxic mine waste removed. Bayhorse was one of the first \nsites in the country to use brownfields grant funds to accomplish that \nfeat. The work was such a success the Bayhorse project was awarded the \nPartners in Conservation Award by the U.S. Department of the Interior \nfor outstanding conservation results among many partners.\n  As an architect, Ernie has had a hand in designing several of Idaho's \nmost significant buildings. His talents and passion for architecture \nand history, along with a strong interest in photography and art, have \npreserved Idaho's rugged and unique past. Ernie's photographic library \nincludes more than 3,000 images of historic Idaho buildings. His \npresentation, ``Ghost Towns of Idaho'' has been presented to audiences \nmore than 200 times. Every school district in the State has the video \ncreated from this presentation to use in teaching Idaho history.\n  His work on a county historical advisory board led to the \npreservation of the historic Guffey railroad bridge across the Snake \nRiver between Canyon and Owyhee Counties. This bridge is a centerpiece \nfor Celebration Park.\n  Ernie also conducts historical ``safaris'' to ghost towns such as \nSilver City and teaches about Idaho ghost towns and photography in the \nBoise Community Education Program. He is the longest continuing \neducation instructor in the history of the program having taught 27 \nyears.\n  Recently, the Idaho State Historical Society awarded Ernie Lombard \nwith their ``Esto Perpetua'' award for significant contributions to the \npreservation of Idaho history.\n  It is indeed an honor for me to give recognition to Ernie Lombard for \nhis vision and many years of work to preserve Idaho's significant \nhistory and his passion and willingness to educate Idahoans and others \nabout our wonderful State. Future generations of Idahoans have received \na great gift from Ernie Lombard, and we are very grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/14/senate-section/article/S13189-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DALE HANINGTON\n\n Ms. COLLINS.

The men and women of Maine's trucking industry are \ngrateful for his determined and effective leadership. I am grateful for \nhis guidance and support on transportation legislation, and for his \nfriendship.\n  Dale, a Maine native who earned his bachelor's degree in business \nadministration, retired from the Maine State police at the rank of \nlieutenant after 20 years of service. After retiring from the Maine \nState police, he served as a safety engineer with a large construction \ncompany for 2 years. In 1989, Dale joined the Maine Motor Transport \nAssociation as assistant to the executive director, and he became the \npresident and CEO of the association in 1993.\n  Dale has been a strong advocate for Maine's most important \ntransportation needs, including raising the Federal truck weight limit \nin Maine, which we have worked together tirelessly to address. With \nDale's help and support, we finally have made progress in securing a 1-\nyear truck weight pilot project for Maine.\n  I am grateful for our strong working relationship over the years.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2881. A bill to provide greater technical resources to FCC \nCommissioners; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Warner, to \nintroduce legislation that provides greater technical resources to the \nCommissioners of the Federal Communications Commission.\n  Specifically, this legislation simply proposes modifying existing law \nso that each Commissioner may hire an additional staff member--an \nelectrical engineer or computer scientist--to provide in-depth \ntechnical consultation. Currently, the statute allows each Commissioner \nto appoint only three professional assistants and a secretary. \nTypically, these professional assistants have been legal advisors \ncovering the wireline, wireless, and cable/media sectors. However, in \norder to properly regulate communications, Commissioners must be well-\nversed in both the legal and technical aspects of the issues.\n  With the rapid advancement of technologies and innovation within the \ntelecommunications industry, it is imperative that Commissioners have \nthe technical expertise on their staff to make well informed regulatory \ndecisions. As one Commissioner recently remarked, ``not one of us is an \nengineer. Do you really want us making these highly technical \ndecisions?'' We should not expect every Commissioner to be an engineer, \nbut having one on staff is prudent. Having both technical and legal \nadvisors provides the requisite complement of staff experience for the \nCommissioners to properly address increasingly complex technical and \nlegal matters.\n  While the Office of Engineering and Technology, OET, has been and \nwill continue to be a valuable resource, there has been concern in the \ntechnical community about the depletion of engineering expertise at the \nCommission. From 1995 to 2001, the FCC's engineering staff dropped by \nmore than 20 percent. And at the time, more than 40 percent of the \nengineering staff were to be eligible for retirement between 2001 and \n2005. More recently, the FCC's Managing Director has identified that \nthe Commission has a shortage of network engineers.\n  In addition, several engineering membership and standards bodies have \nweighed in voicing concern about the lack of technical depth at the \nFCC. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, IEEE, the \nlargest technical professional organization in the world, sent a letter \nin June of 2008 to then-Chairman Martin writing ``despite the generally \nexcellent nature of its internal staff, given all of the technical \nissues within the FCC's jurisdiction, it may be prudent to seek means \nto supplement the internal technical capabilities of the Commission.'' \nThe Society of Broadcast Engineers has outlined that one of its \nlegislative goals for 2009-10 is ``to promote the maintenance or \nincrease of technical expertise within the FCC to ensure that decision-\nmaking by the FCC is based on technical investigation, studies and \nevaluation rather than political expenditures.'' I would like to thank \nthese two organizations for supporting this beneficial legislation.\n  This bill takes a step towards properly addressing a glaring \ndeficiency by ensuring each Commissioner has a technical expert on \nstaff to provide individual technical advisement. This is absolutely \ncritical given how rapidly technologies are changing and the \nimplications that regulation could have on the underlying technical \ncatalysts of innovation.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. 10003.

ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided for in this \n     section, the time for the commencement of a health care \n     lawsuit shall be 3 years after the date of manifestation of \n     injury or 1 year after the claimant discovers, or through the \n     use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the \n     injury, whichever occurs first.\n       (b) General Exception.--The time for the commencement of a \n     health care lawsuit shall not exceed 3 years after the date \n     of manifestation of injury unless the tolling of time was \n     delayed as a result of--\n       (1) fraud;\n       (2) intentional concealment; or\n       (3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no \n     therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of \n     the injured person.\n       (c) Minors.--An action by a minor shall be commenced within \n     3 years from the date of the alleged manifestation of injury \n     except that if such minor is under the full age of 6 years, \n     such action shall be commenced within 3 years of the \n     manifestation of injury, or prior to the eighth birthday of \n     the minor, whichever provides a longer period. Such time \n     limitation shall be tolled for minors for any period during \n     which a parent or guardian and a health care provider or \n     health care institution have committed fraud or collusion in \n     the failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured \n     minor.\n       (d) Rule 11 Sanctions.--Whenever a Federal or State court \n     determines (whether by motion of the parties or whether on \n     the motion of the court) that there has been a violation of \n     Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (or a similar \n     violation of applicable State court rules) in a health care \n     liability action to which this Act applies, the court shall \n     impose upon the attorneys, law firms, or pro se litigants \n     that have violated Rule 11 or are responsible for the \n     violation, an appropriate sanction, which shall include an \n     order to pay the other party or parties for the reasonable \n     expenses incurred as a direct result of the filing of the \n     pleading, motion, or other paper that is the subject of the \n     violation, including a reasonable attorneys' fee. Such \n     sanction shall be sufficient to deter repetition of such \n     conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated, \n     and to compensate the party or parties injured by such \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 10005. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.\n\n       (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses \n     in Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, nothing \n     in this title shall limit the recovery by a claimant of the \n     full amount of the available economic damages, \n     notwithstanding the limitation contained in subsection (b).\n       (b) Additional Noneconomic Damages.--\n       (1) Health care providers.--In any health care lawsuit \n     where final judgment is rendered against a health care \n     provider, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered from \n     the provider, if otherwise available under applicable Federal \n     or State law, may be as much as $250,000, regardless of the \n     number of parties other than a health care institution \n     against whom the action is brought or the number of separate \n     claims or actions brought with respect to the same \n     occurrence.\n       (2) Health care institutions.--\n       (A) Single institution.--In any health care lawsuit where \n     final judgment is rendered against a single health care \n     institution, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered from \n     the institution, if otherwise available under applicable \n     Federal or State law, may be as much as $250,000, regardless \n     of the number of parties against whom the action is brought \n     or the number of separate claims or actions brought with \n     respect to the same occurrence.\n       (B) Multiple institutions.--In any health care lawsuit \n     where final judgment is rendered against more than one health \n     care institution, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered \n     from each institution, if otherwise available under \n     applicable Federal or State law, may be as much as $250,000, \n     regardless of the number of parties against whom the action \n     is brought or the number of separate claims or actions \n     brought with respect to the same occurrence, except that the \n     total amount recovered from all such institutions in such \n     lawsuit shall not exceed $500,000.\n       (c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages.--In any \n     health care lawsuit--\n       (1) an award for future noneconomic damages shall not be \n     discounted to present value;\n       (2) the jury shall not be informed about the maximum award \n     for noneconomic damages under subsection (b);\n       (3) an award for noneconomic damages in excess of the \n     limitations provided for in subsection (b) shall be reduced \n     either before the entry of judgment, or by amendment of the \n     judgment after entry of judgment, and such reduction shall be \n     made before accounting for any other reduction in damages \n     required by law; and\n       (4) if separate awards are rendered for past and future \n     noneconomic damages and the combined awards exceed the \n     limitations described in subsection (b), the future \n     noneconomic damages shall be reduced first.\n       (d) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each \n     party shall be liable for that party's several share of any \n     damages only and not for the share of any other person. Each \n     party shall be liable only for the amount of damages \n     allocated to such party in direct proportion to such party's \n     percentage of responsibility. A separate judgment shall be \n     rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to \n     such party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact \n     shall determine the proportion of responsibility of each \n     party for the claimant's harm.\n\n     SEC. 10006.

PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) Punitive Damages Permitted.--\n       (1) In general.--Punitive damages may, if otherwise \n     available under applicable State or Federal law, be awarded \n     against any person in a health care lawsuit only if it is \n     proven by clear and convincing evidence that such person \n     acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant, or that \n     such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury \n     that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain \n     to suffer.\n       (2) Filing of lawsuit.--No demand for punitive damages \n     shall be included in a health care lawsuit as initially \n     filed. A court may allow a claimant to file an amended \n     pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the \n     claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of \n     supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after \n     weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a \n     substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the \n     claim for punitive damages.\n       (3) Separate proceeding.--At the request of any party in a \n     health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a \n     separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; and\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n\n     If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only \n     to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by \n     applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding \n     to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (4) Limitation where no compensatory damages are awarded.--\n     In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory \n     damages is rendered against a person, no punitive damages may \n     be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit against \n     such person.\n       (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n     punitive damages under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     consider only the following:\n       (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such \n     party;\n       (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     such party;\n       (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;\n       (D) the number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, \n     of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;\n       (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and\n       (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such \n     party as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages awarded \n     in a health care lawsuit may not exceed an amount equal to \n     two times the amount of economic damages awarded in the \n     lawsuit or $250,000, whichever is greater.

These communications services include \n     services in connection with significant examples, such as--\n       (A) hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Hugo, and Andrew;\n       (B) the relief effort at the World Trade Center and the \n     Pentagon following the 2001 terrorist attacks; and\n       (C) the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995.\n       (4) Amateur Radio Service has formal agreements for the \n     provision of volunteer emergency communications activities \n     with the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency, the National Weather Service, \n     the National Communications System, and the Association of \n     Public Safety Communications Officials, as well as with \n     disaster relief agencies, including the American National Red \n     Cross and the Salvation Army.\n       (5) Section 1 of the joint resolution entitled ``Joint \n     Resolution to recognize the achievements of radio amateurs, \n     and to establish support for such amateurs as national \n     policy'', approved October 22, 1994 (Public Law 103-408), \n     included a finding that stated: ``Reasonable accommodation \n     should be made for the effective operation of amateur radio \n     from residences, private vehicles and public areas, and the \n     regulation at all levels of government should facilitate and \n     encourage amateur radio operations as a public benefit.''.\n       (6) Section 1805(c) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 \n     U.S.C. 757(c)) directs the Regional Emergency Communications \n     Coordinating Working Group of the Department of Homeland \n     Security to coordinate their activities with ham and amateur \n     radio operators among the 11 other emergency organizations \n     such as ambulance services, law enforcement, and others.\n       (7) Amateur Radio Service, at no cost to taxpayers, \n     provides a fertile ground for technical self-training in \n     modern telecommunications, electronic technology, and \n     emergency communications techniques and protocols.\n       (8) There is a strong Federal interest in the effective \n     performance of Amateur Radio Service stations, and that \n     performance must be given--\n       (A) support at all levels of government; and\n       (B) protection against unreasonable regulation and \n     impediments to the provision of the valuable communications \n     provided by such stations.\n\n     SEC. 3.
