Mr. President, later today Democrats will move forward on a \nbill sponsored by Democrats and Republicans--lots of Republicans--a \nbill that creates jobs at a time when we need them the most. I \nencourage the Republicans to join with those of us who want to move \nforward on this piece of legislation. Democrats will do our jobs--using \nthis great legislative body to legislate--and make life better for \nstruggling Americans. I encourage my Republican colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  The travel promotion bill is critical for our economy. Tourism and \ntravel generate $1 trillion in economic activity every year--$1 \ntrillion. In its first year, this bill will create 40,000 new jobs.\n  There isn't a State in the Union that doesn't depend on tourism. I \ncan remember the first time I went to a place where we had a Democratic \nretreat in Virginia. I walked out of my room and I saw this huge body \nof water and I thought: Gee, I didn't know we were on the ocean. It was \njust a huge--must have been a mile at least to the other side of that \nbody of water. It was the James River. It was a river.\n  The reason I mention that is I have had the good fortune of traveling \naround Virginia. It is a wonderful place to visit. There are all kinds \nof tourist attractions in Virginia. But every State is about the same. \nEvery State has its unique possibilities and places to go. I have been \nto virtually every State in the Union. There are so many wonderful \nplaces. I know Virginia better because for quite a long time my non-\nNevada home was in Virginia and\n\n[[Page S6862]]\n\nthree of my five children graduated from schools in Virginia. It is a \nwonderful place, and tourism is very important to Virginia. This bill \nis important to Virginia.\n  Again, travel and tourism generate $1 trillion in economic activity \naround the country every year, and in its first year, this bill will \ncreate more than 40,000 jobs. The bill will cut our deficit. We are not \nasking for money from the public trough to take care of this. This bill \nwill cut our deficit by $425 million over the next decade. We save \nmoney by doing this. We make money by doing this. We will be taking the \nstrategies that have made Las Vegas such a success and bringing them to \nour entire Nation's tourism industry. It is one of the many ways we are \nworking to create jobs and help our economy recover.\n  So far, the minority has shown no interest in either creating jobs or \nin helping our economy recover. I hope that, in this case, past is not \nprologue.\n  One of my floor staff here said they saw a Republican staffer just a \nshort time ago and the Republican staffer said: Why won't you let us \noffer amendments?\n  That is some kind of game being played. I have had conversations with \nthe Republican leader and with other Republican Senators on this bill, \nand I have said: Let's move on with this legislation. Under the rules, \nthe amendments ultimately have to be germane, but I have said: I don't \ncare if they are germane or not. If you want to offer amendments, that \nis what we have done all year and we will do it here.\n  They wanted to offer four amendments on TARP, and I said: Well, that \nhas nothing to do with tourism, but if you want to do that, go ahead \nand do it.\n  In response, Senator Sanders, from Vermont, told me that he had an \namendment he wanted to offer. I said: Listen, Bernie, if you want to \noffer a nongermane amendment, you can do it. If they want to offer a \nnongermane amendment, they can; otherwise, we are not going to do that.\n  So we have all these nongermane amendments they want to offer, and he \nhas one he wants to offer. His amendment simply restates the law and \nmakes it a little stronger, and in effect what it does is takes a look \nat the oil companies to see if they are manipulating prices. So the \nRepublicans said: No, we are not going to agree to that; we want you to \ntake all of our amendments, we will vote on them, and none for you. \nWell, that is not fair, it is not reasonable, and it is only an excuse \nfor Republicans to again stymie legislation.\n  So let's get the facts straight. At the start of the debate, we \noffered Republicans nongermane amendments. They could have more \namendments than we could have. We agreed to do that. Not a single one \nof the Republican amendments was related to this bill, and some of the \namendments were even duplicates. But I said: Let's go ahead and do it \nanyway. Of course, the Republicans said no. They refuse to let us move \nforward, once again wasting the American people's time and money. They \nrefuse to let us move forward--I repeat--once again wasting the \nAmerican people's time and money.\n  It is difficult to watch what is going on here and come away with a \nsense that the Republicans have even the slightest interest in \nlegislating or that they have the slightest understanding of what \nfamilies are facing across the country. Just last week, in the Roll \nCall publication, a Republican Senator said--and it is on the front \npage--``Senate GOP Still Saying No.'' A Republican Senator said this \nlast week in one of the newspapers that cover Capitol Hill, Roll Call:\n\n       Democrats need to know when they bring [bills] up, we're \n     going to extend debate as long as we can--even if we can't \n     win it.\n\n  So I say to this Republican Senator and all Republican Senators: This \nisn't a game. I say to those watching and listening today: The next \ntime Republicans trot out their stale standard talking points about \ncongressional approval ratings or the inefficiency of government, pay \nattention to see whether they also quote their fellow Republican \nSenator who admits they are not here to work. These partisan tactics \nhave consequences. These consequences will be evident on every kitchen \ntable, every family budget, and every American's peace of mind.\n  I encourage Republicans to finish this legislation. I have said that \nif there are nongermane amendments they want to file, even though we \nhave no obligation to do that, we will have those amendments during the \n30-hour postcloture time and dispose of them. I don't understand what \nthe deal is here. This is the 18th time we have had to file cloture \nthis year--the 18th time. In spite of that, we have been able to get a \nlot of work done. But I do encourage Republicans to join with us in \nmoving this legislation forward. It is important.\n  I look around the floor, and I see Virginia, Nevada, and Arizona \nSenators here. Tourism is very important. It will create jobs. It will \ncut our deficit. It is not a bad combination. So I would encourage \nRepublicans to join in this important travel promotion bill and to \nopenly pass it so we can bring jobs home, helping our country prosper \nonce again. We know if we can get past this procedural hurdle where we \nneed 60 votes, all Democrats will vote to move forward. That is the \nright thing to do. Shouldn't we get even the sponsors of the bill to \njoin in?\n  We haven't stopped the amendment process. They are going to have to \ncome up with a different reason for voting against it than that because \neveryone has had an opportunity.\n  So I hope we can move forward. It was a bill that was originally \ngoing to be managed by Senators Dorgan and Ensign. Senator Martinez has \nbeen heavily involved. I thought we had things all worked out with him \nand Senator Dorgan on Thursday, but it all fell apart because of the \ninability to have Senator Sanders have his amendment.\n  I simply don't understand what excuse they have for not moving \nforward with this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/22/senate-section/article/S6862-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there is a news report from the Associated \nPress entitled ``Iranian Police Use Force To Break Up Protest.'' The \narticle reads as follows:\n\n       Tehran, Iran--Riot police attacked hundreds of \n     demonstrators with tear gas and fired live bullets in the air \n     to disperse a rally in central Tehran Monday, carrying out a \n     threat by the country's most powerful security force to crush \n     any further opposition protests over the disputed \n     presidential election. Witnesses said helicopters hovered \n     overhead as about 200 protesters gathered at Haft-e-Tir \n     Square. But hundreds of anti-riot police quickly put an end \n     to the demonstration and prevented any gathering, even small \n     groups, at the scene. Iran says at least 17 protesters have \n     been killed in a week of unrest so far after the electoral \n     council declared hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \n     winner of the June 12 election.\n       Severe restrictions on reporters have made it almost \n     impossible to independently verify any reports on \n     demonstrations, clashes, and casualties. Iran has ordered \n     reporters for foreign news agencies to stay in their offices, \n     barring them from any reporting on the streets.\n\n  The story goes on. Demonstrations followed by repression, followed by \nmurder in the streets. As these things seem to evolve, an event took \nplace yesterday which may be the defining moment in the struggle of the \nIranian people to be able to peacefully disagree with their government, \nin this case, because of a corrupt and fraudulent election, without \nbeing killed in the streets and beaten and imprisoned.\n  It has to do with a woman named Neda. I quote from an ABC news story \ndated June 22, 2009.\n\n       She sinks to the ground--and a few minutes later she is \n     dead. A video that has been repeatedly posted on the Internet \n     purports to show the last moments of Neda, a young Iranian \n     woman shot in the heart by government sharpshooters. \n     Overnight she has become a symbol of the opposition. [Her] \n     shaky\n\n[[Page S6863]]\n\n     blurred images: A young woman collapses onto the pavement, a \n     dark pool of blood spreads beneath her body. Two men kneel \n     next to the woman and press on her chest, screaming. The \n     camera phone which is filming her zooms in on her face. Her \n     pupils roll to the side. Blood streams out of her nose and \n     mouth.\n       ``Neda, don't be afraid! Neda, stay with me. Neda, stay \n     with me!'' [cries one man.]\n\n  Another man beseeches someone to take her in a car. Then the footage \nstops.\n  The video footage appeared on the social networking sites Facebook \nand Twitter on Saturday evening. It immediately became a viral \nsensation, being forwarded repeatedly. User groups were determined to \nget around YouTube's attempts to block the immensely graphic film. They \nposted the clip so often it became impossible for YouTube to remove it.\n  So we have seen, as we have in cases of other brutal repressions \nthroughout history, a living example or the dying example of martyrdom. \nBy Sunday morning, Neda became the fifth most common topic on Twitter. \nShe had already become a kind of Joan of Arc.\n  ``It took only one bullet to kill Neda, it will take only one Neda to \nstop Iranian tyranny'' was one posting from Tehran on Twitter.\n\n       Neda died with open eyes. Shame on us who live with closed \n     eyes.\n\n  ``They killed Neda, but not her voice'' was another.\n  During the day, thousands of people replaced their profile pictures \nwith tributes to the young woman such as ``I am Neda,'' or ``Neda \nforever.'' Others posted images of a broken heart in green, the color \nof the opposition movement.\n  So a debate has been going on as to how much the United States of \nAmerica, its President, the Congress, and the American people should \nspeak out in favor and in support of these brave Iranians--the average \nage in Tehran is 33 years of age--and their quests for the fundamentals \nof freedom and democracy that we have enjoyed for more than a couple of \ncenturies.\n  Today, I and all America, pay tribute to a brave young woman who was \ntrying to exercise her fundamental human rights and was killed in the \nstreets of Tehran. All Americans are with her, our thoughts and our \nprayers for her, her family, and her countrymen.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have two news articles that I quoted \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From abcnews.go.com June 22, 2009]\n\n                    Neda, Is She Iran's Joan of Arc?\n\n\n     Neda Has Become a Symbol and Martyr for the Iranian Opposition\n\n                            (By Ulrike Putz)\n\n       Beirut.--She sinks to the ground--and a few minutes later \n     she is dead. A video that has been repeatedly posted on the \n     Internet purports to show the last moments of Neda, a young \n     Iranian woman shot in the heart by government sharpshooters. \n     Overnight she has become a symbol of the opposition.

Her pupils roll to the side, blood streams out of \n     her nose and mouth. ``Neda, don't be afraid! Neda, stay with \n     me. Neda, stay with me!'' cries one man. Another man \n     beseeches someone to take her in a car. Then the footage \n     stops.\n       It cannot be confirmed if the 40-second film, which was \n     posted on the Internet on Saturday, really shows the death of \n     a young Iranian demonstrator. Like almost all the video and \n     photo material coming out of Iran these days, it is \n     impossible to verify its authenticity. However, even if it \n     may never be certain if these images really show the death of \n     a young woman named Neda, she has still become an icon, a \n     martyr for the opposition in Iran. Neda has given the \n     regime's brutality a bloody face and a name. Overnight ``I am \n     Neda,'' has become the slogan of the protest movement.\n       The video footage appeared on the social networking sites \n     Facebook and Twitter on Saturday evening. It immediately \n     became a viral sensation, being forwarded repeatedly. User \n     groups were determined to get around YouTube's attempts to \n     block the immensely graphic film. They posted the clip so \n     often that it became impossible for YouTube to remove it. The \n     first postings were furnished with a commentary. A supposed \n     eyewitness described what was happening. He gave details, \n     presumably in order to underscore the clip's veracity. The \n     incident occurred on the Karekar Avenue, at the corner of \n     Khoravi Street and Salehi Street in Tehran at 7:05 p.m. local \n     time, he reported.\n\n\n            Could Neda Change the Course of Iran's History?\n\n       A young woman, watching the protests together with her \n     father, the commentary said, was shot in the heart by a \n     sharpshooter with the Basij, the government militia. ``I am a \n     doctor, so I rushed to try to save her,'' the man says. ``But \n     the impact of the gunshot was so fierce that the bullet \n     blasted inside the victim's chest and she died in less than \n     two minutes.'' ``The film is shot by my friend who was \n     standing beside me,'' he continues. ``Please let the world \n     know.'' Persian-speaking Internet users quickly supplied a \n     translation. The screams, ``Stay with me, Neda!'' are said to \n     have come from the young woman's father. By Sunday morning \n     ``Neda'' was the fifth most commented topic on Twitter. She \n     had already become a kind of Joan of Arc. ``It took only one \n     bullet to kill Neda. It will take only one Neda to stop \n     Iranian tyranny,'' was one posting from Tehran on Twitter.\n       ``Neda died with open eyes. Shame on us who live with \n     closed eyes,'' was one entry. ``They killed Neda, but not her \n     voice,'' was another. During the day thousands of people \n     replaced their profile pictures with tributes to the young \n     woman, such as ``I am Neda'' or ``Neda forever.'' Others \n     posted images of a broken heart in green, the color of the \n     opposition movement. Many blogs, including that of the New \n     York Times, are now speculating if the footage could change \n     the course of history. There are parallels being drawn to the \n     images that became iconic during the Islamic Revolution. The \n     film could become as much as a symbol as those now historic \n     images from 1979 which showed the Shah's troops shooting on \n     unarmed demonstrators.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Iranian Police Use Force To Break up Protest\n\n                   (By Nasser Karimi and Jim Heintz)\n\n       Tehran.--Riot police attacked hundreds of demonstrators \n     with tear gas and fired live bullets in the air to disperse a \n     rally in central Tehran Monday, carrying out a threat by the \n     country's most powerful security force to crush any further \n     opposition protests over the disputed presidential election.\n       Britain, accused by Iran of fomenting post-election unrest, \n     said it was evacuating the families of diplomats and other \n     officials based in Iran--the first country to do so as Iran's \n     worst internal conflict since the 1979 Islamic Revolution \n     escalated.\n       Witnesses said helicopters hovered overhead as about 200 \n     protesters gathered at Haft-e-Tir Square. But hundreds of \n     anti-riot police quickly put an end to the demonstration and \n     prevented any gathering, even small groups, at the scene.\n       At the subway station at Haft-e-Tir, the witnesses said \n     police did not allow anyone to stand still, asking them to \n     keep on walking and separating people who were walked \n     together. The witnesses asked not to be identified for fear \n     of government reprisals.\n       Just before the clashes, an Iranian woman who lives in \n     Tehran said there was a heavy police and security presence in \n     another square in central Tehran. She asked not to be \n     identified because she was worried about government \n     reprisals.\n       ``There is a massive, massive, massive police presence,'' \n     she told The Associated Press in Cairo by telephone. ``Their \n     presence was really intimidating.''\n       Iran says at least 17 protesters have been killed in a week \n     of unrest so far after the electoral council declared hard-\n     line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad winner of the June 12 \n     election. His main challenger, Mir Hossein Mousavi, charged \n     the election was a fraud and insists he is the true winner. \n     His followers have been staging near-daily rallies, at least \n     one of them drawing a massive crowds of hundreds of \n     thousands.\n       Severe restrictions on reporters have made it almost \n     impossible to independently verify any reports on \n     demonstrations, clashes and casualties. Iran has ordered \n     reporters for foreign news agencies to stay in their offices, \n     barring them from any reporting on the streets.\n       The country's highest electoral authority, the Guardian \n     Council, acknowledged on Monday that there were voting \n     irregularities in 50 electoral districts, the most serious \n     official admission so far of problems in the election. But \n     the council insisted the problems do not affect the outcome \n     of the vote.\n       Earlier Monday, the elite Revolutionary Guard issued its \n     sternest warning so far in the post-election crisis. It \n     warned protesters to ``be prepared for a resolution and \n     revolutionary confrontation with the Guards, Basij and other \n     security forces and disciplinary forces'' if they continue \n     their near-daily rallies.\n       The Basij, a plainclothes militia under the command of the \n     Revolutionary Guard, have been used to quell street protests \n     that erupted after the election result was announced.\n       The Guard statement ordered demonstrators to ``end the \n     sabotage and rioting activities'' and said their resistance \n     is a ``conspiracy'' against Iran. On Sunday, acting joint \n     chief of the armed forces Gen. Gholam Ali Rashid issued a \n     thinly veiled warning to Mousavi, saying ``we are determined \n     to confront plots by enemies aimed at creating a rift in the \n     nation.\n       Mousavi vowed Sunday night to keep up the protests, in \n     defiance of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds \n     ultimate\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\n     power in Iran. In a sermon to tens of thousands on Friday, \n     Khamenei said demonstrators must stop their street protests \n     or face the consequences and he firmly backed Ahmadinejad's \n     victory.\n       ``The country belongs to you,'' Mousavi's latest statement \n     said. ``Protesting lies and fraud is your right.''\n       Mousavi's Web site called Monday for supporters to turn on \n     their car lights in the late afternoon as a sign of protest.\n       Mousavi's latest statements posted on his Web site also \n     warned supporters of danger ahead, and said he would stand by \n     the protesters ``at all times.'' But he said he would ``never \n     allow anybody's life to be endangered because of my actions'' \n     and called for pursuing fraud claims through an independent \n     board.\n       The former prime minister, a longtime loyalist of the \n     Islamic government, also called the Basij and military ``our \n     brothers'' and ``protectors of our revolution and regime.'' \n     He may be trying to constrain his followers' demands before \n     they pose a mortal threat to Iran's system of limited \n     democracy constrained by Shiite clerics, who have ultimate \n     authority.\n       Mousavi ally and former president Mohammad Khatami said in \n     a statement that ``protest in a civil manner and avoiding \n     disturbances in the definite right of the people and all must \n     respect that.''\n       Britain's Foreign Office said it was pulling staffers' \n     dependents out because ``the families of our staff have been \n     unable to carry out their lives as usual.''\n       In Washington, President Barack Obama said he does not want \n     to become a scapegoat for Iran's leadership as the \n     postelection upheaval continues, but Republicans continued \n     criticizing him for being overly cautious.\n       The Czech EU presidency summoned the Iranian charge \n     d'affaires to reject claims by Iran that the 27-nation bloc \n     has been interfering in its internal affairs.\n       Iran state media reported at least 10 people were killed in \n     the fiercest clashes yet on Saturday and 100 were injured.\n       A graphic video that appears to show a young woman dying \n     within minutes after she was shot during Saturday's \n     demonstrations has become the iconic image seen by millions \n     around the world on video-sharing sites such as YouTube.\n       Police said Monday that 457 people were arrested on \n     Saturday alone, but did not say how many have been arrested \n     throughout the week of turmoil.\n       The country's highest electoral authority agreed last week \n     to investigate some opposition complaints of problems in the \n     voting. The Guardian Council said Monday it found \n     irregularities in 50 voting districts, but that this has no \n     effect on election outcome. Council spokesman Abbas Ali \n     Kadkhodaei was quoted on the state TV Web site as saying that \n     its probe showed more votes were cast in these constituencies \n     than there were registered voters.\n       But this ``has no effect on the result of the elections,'' \n     he said.\n       Mousavi has demanded that the election result be annulled \n     and a new vote held.\n       Khatami said ``taking complaints to bodies that are \n     required to protect people's rights, but are themselves \n     subject to criticism, is not a solution''--effectively \n     accusing the Council of collusion in vote fraud.\n       The government has intensified a crackdown on independent \n     media--expelling a BBC correspondent, suspending the Dubai-\n     based network Al-Arabiya and detaining at least two local \n     journalists for U.S. magazines.\n       English-language state television said an exile group known \n     as the People's Mujahedeen had a hand in the street violence \n     and broadcast what it said were confessions of British-\n     controlled agents.\n       The exile group, also called the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, is the \n     military wing of the Paris-based National Council of \n     Resistance of Iran. The council says it is dedicated to a \n     democratic, secular government in Iran, but the military wing \n     has been blacklisted by the United States and the European \n     Union as a terrorist organization.\n       The Foreign Ministry lashed out at foreign media and \n     Western governments, with ministry spokesman Hasan Qashqavi \n     accusing them of ``a racial mentality that Iranians belong to \n     the Third World.''\n       ``Meddling by Western powers and international media is \n     unacceptable,'' he said at a news conference shown on state \n     TV, taking particular aim at French President Nicolas \n     Sarkozy.\n       ``How can a Western president, like the French president, \n     ask for nullification of Iranian election results?'' Qashqavi \n     said. ``I regret such comments.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/22/senate-section/article/S6864-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6864-S6865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to talk a bit about health \ncare, since that seems to be a major issue also of concern to all \nAmericans. Today is June 22, 2009. Millions of Americans still lack \nhealth insurance coverage, and we need to pass reforms that help them \nget coverage. Yet more time has gone by with no plan from the majority. \nWhile we wait, how many more people will forgo needed care today? How \nmany emergency rooms will have to care for Americans who could have \nreceived care earlier, and at a lower cost, from a medical professional \nif they had insurance?\n  The majority talks about reform and how critical it is to move with \nurgency. They also assert that the economic recovery depends on health \ncare reform. So many of us would like to know: Where is the plan? It is \nimpossible for us to move forward in any manner, let alone with \nurgency, if we do not even have a complete bill.\n  On Tuesday June 9, after months of waiting, the majority in the HELP \nCommittee, on which I serve, offered a partial list of health reform \nproposals, indicating that the missing pieces would be shortly \nforthcoming. The majority quickly pulled together a roundtable to \ndiscuss a wide variety of issues. They even held some walk-throughs \nwith our side on issues of prevention, quality, et cetera.\n  The following week we were told we would receive the missing pieces \n``soon'' or ``early last week.'' Then we were told they would come \nforward with the missing pieces ``this past Friday.''\n  Now it is Monday and we have received nothing. While we have waited, \nthe Congressional Budget Office told us what many of us had expected \nand feared about this bill: The cost of the bill would have a cost \nexponentially higher than many had predicted. In fact, the incomplete \nbill would cost over $1 trillion, and this cost would only cover one-\nthird of the 48 million Americans who are currently uninsured.\n  So we wait and wait and wait, having no details of the much-wanted \ngovernment plan or the proposal regarding penalties the other side \nwants to impose on employers who either cannot provide health coverage \nor who are not able to provide the coverage according to the government \ndictate.\n  Now we hear this Friday might be the day we have a chance to see what \nthey have been working on behind closed doors. Friday also happens to \nbe the day of the Fourth of July recess. The President and \ncongressional Democrats have told the American people that health care \nreform legislation must be passed by the Senate prior to the August \nrecess.\n  Given that we will not have the text of the legislation prior to the \nFourth of July recess, I am skeptical that the HELP Committee and the \nFinance Committee will be able to complete their work, combine two \npossibly divergent bills on the Senate floor, and pass a bill during \nthe 5 weeks remaining in the July work session.\n  One thing I have found out around here is that we miss a lot of \nthings, but we never miss a recess. The Senate passed the budget \nblueprint in late April. That included a possible budget reconciliation \nprocess for considering health care reform legislation.\n  One must wonder. One must wonder if the majority is intentionally \npushing back the schedule and dragging out this process so that a \nbipartisan process and solution is not feasible. Under budget \nreconciliation, which sounds arcane to most Americans, the majority \nwould be allowed to jam this important policy through the Senate with \n51 votes instead of the typical 60, with limited time for debate and \namendments.\n  I am left to wonder if this contingency was not planned on all along, \nto use reconciliation, to muscle through the health reform we all know \nis desperately needed but to circumvent the normal procedures of the \nSenate.\n  I and my colleagues on this side of the aisle continue to await the \nDemocrats' complete bill and their plan to make taxpayers pay for this \ntrillion dollar new government program. So many questions remain until \nthe missing parts of the bill are provided.\n  When will we get details of the government insurance plan we are told \nis essential to reform? When will we see what employer health care \nmandates look like? How much will the complete plan cost? How will it \nbe paid for? Each day the majority fails to provide a complete plan, \nalong with the complete cost and how it will be paid for, is another \nday that millions of Americans go without health insurance.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for as much time as I consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/22/senate-section/article/S6865-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6865-S6867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as this country tries to pull itself out \nof a very significant economic crisis in which millions of Americans \nhave lost their jobs, lost their homes, lost hope, there are a number \nof things we have to do that also threaten the future of this country, \nin addition to trying to restore some economic health, and those \ninclude health care to be sure--we are working on this issue of health \ncare; the second is an energy policy that makes us less dependent on \nforeign oil, where we are far too vulnerable and far too dependent; and \nthe third is the relentless march of increased Federal budget deficits. \nAll three of these issues, in my judgment, threaten our country's \nfuture. I wish to speak about them in the coming days. Today, I wish to \ntalk about health care specifically.\n  Let me again say, I do that with the understanding that first and \nforemost we have to pull this country out of the difficulties we are in \nwith the general economy and try to find ways to promote economic \ngrowth and put people back to work with jobs that pay well and give \nthem the opportunity to care for their families. That is what gets \nAmerica moving again. But when we do that, when we begin to restore \nthis economy to economic health, the vulnerabilities that will remain \nare health care, energy, and the Federal budget deficits far into the \nfuture. So let me talk about health care just a bit.\n  I know there is a lot of discussion in the committees, the two \nrelevant committees, the Finance Committee and the so-called HELP \nCommittee, both of which are writing pieces of the health care reform \nbill.\n  It is true that increased health care costs--the increased cost of \ninsurance for families, businesses, and governments--are on the march. \nNow it consumes over 17 percent of the domestic product of this \ncountry. Of all the goods and services we produce, over 17 percent of \nthat is consumed by health care. And the rate of increase is \nunsustainable. Families will not be able to pay the extra cost year \nafter year after year. We are told that nationally it now costs about \n$12,000 for a family health insurance policy.\n  So what do we do about this? Well, we hear a lot of discussion on the \nfloor of the Senate, when we start talking about health care, where \npeople will say: Well, now you are talking about a government-run \nhealth care system in which a bureaucrat is going to make decisions \nabout how much treatment your doctor can provide to you personally.\n  That is just absurd. That is not what this discussion is about. But \nif we can get back to some thoughtful discussion rather than \nthoughtless discussion on health care, maybe we can all reach an \nagreement of how to improve this system. I personally think this system \nneeds improving. Let me describe some things I think we should do.\n  First of all, we do not have a health care system so much as we have \na sick care system. We do not pay any attention in this country to the \nthings that can keep you from being sick or getting sick; we just pay a \nlot of money to put you into acute-care beds once you have gotten sick. \nThat makes no sense at all. We ought to change the entire model to say \nit is much, much less costly to do the preventive things than it is to \npay for acute-care beds in a hospital once someone gets sick.\n  This is all about behavior in many respects, and nobody wants to talk \nmuch about that. But behavior is a very important part of this. We are \ntold that two-thirds of the American people are overweight and one-\nthird are obese. Just that alone imposes unbelievable costs on this \nhealth care system of ours.\n  By the way, attendant to that issue of obesity and being overweight \nis the march of diabetes. The incidence of diabetes in this country is \nunbelievable. It just ratchets up and up and up every year.\n  Now, you wonder about that, wonder about America's children and the \nnumber of children who are overweight and obese. Walk into a school and \nthen find out that in a number of schools in our country, they have \ndecided to make money by allowing the soda machines, the pop machines, \nfrom the largest manufacturers in this country to sell Coke and Pepsi \nand other soft drinks in the school hallways. You can buy not only a \nsoft drink full of sugar, you can then buy, perhaps, a bag of Doritos \nto go with it in the middle of the afternoon at school. So what kind of \nmessage is that in a country in which a substantial number of the \npeople--especially children--are vastly overweight and in which we, by \nthe way, minimize physical fitness in our schools because we have \nbecome very obsessed--and necessarily so--we care now more about math \nand sciences and getting out of our school system more engineers, more \npeople steeped in the maths and sciences. But should that be at the \nexpense of physical fitness? What kind of a brain is walking around \nwithout a physical being to propel it? How about some physical fitness \nin our schools? How about moving soda machines or the soft drink \nmachines and the Doritos and Cheetos out of the school hallways? Those \nthings are just common sense. It is about personal behavior, and it is \nabout what we do in this country.\n  By the way, the reason those machines are there is, if they can put \nmachines in the hallways of schools, the companies will provide money \nto the schools. So that is how we are going to fund our school system \nthese days--through soft drinks and chips? It does not make much sense \nto me.\n  With respect to this issue of personal responsibility and behavior, \nlet me describe a meeting we held about a week and a half ago with the \nCEO of Safeway corporation. I know he has met with groups of \nRepublicans and Democrats here in the Congress. He said something very \ninteresting, and I am using numbers that I think approximate what he \nsaid. They may not be precise, but I believe he told us there are \nbetween 40,000 and 50,000 employees at Safeway corporation who are \nnonunion. He began a project with those 40,000 and 50,000 people in \nhealth care, and now he is beginning to try to move that into the union \ncontracts.\n  Here is the project. That company says to its employees: I want \nresponsibility for four areas in exchange for lower cost health \ninsurance. We believe behavior is an important part of controlling \nhealth care costs. No. 1, if you have high blood pressure, we want you \ntaking medicine to control your high blood pressure. No. 2, if you have \nhigh cholesterol, we want you taking medicine to control your high \ncholesterol. And I believe he said the company is paying for that. No. \n3, if you are smoking, you have to have stopped or be on a program to \nstop. No. 4, if you are overweight, you have to be on a program to deal \nwith that issue.\n  Cholesterol, high blood pressure, weight, and smoking--in each case, \nfrom a baseline of the cost of health insurance policies, those who are \nengaged in behavior that addresses these four issues have gradations of \nlesser costs for their health insurance premiums. In other words, it is \nabout personal behavior and taking responsibility for addressing the \nthings that can keep you healthy.\n  He indicated to us that they have had flat costs for 5 years in that \nbody of employees dealing with this criteria in health care. That is a \nsuccess. If that is the model he is using, saying: You have a \nresponsibility.\n  By the way, even in their cafeteria, where they have partially \nsubsidized company food during the lunch hours, just as an example, he \nsaid: We still serve unhealthy things. But we charge much, much more \nfor it--once again trying to induce the behavior to take a healthy \nalternative.\n  So I think what Steve Burd, the CEO of Safeway, has suggested \nrepresents something we need to consider as we write our health care \nlegislation.\n  There is another element that was brought to my attention recently \nand I think has been brought to the President's attention and Members \nof the Congress, and that is a New Yorker article written by Atul \nGawande, a doctor from Harvard. He visited McAllen, TX, and El Paso, \nTX, and wondered why in one city you have the highest\n\n[[Page S6866]]\n\ncosts per capita for health care and why the other city is just \naverage. What caused this? He has a lot of conclusions, and I think \nvery interesting conclusions, about overutilization in health care, and \nthe movement of doctors' ownership with respect to the business side of \nhealth care. The doctors' ownership in a cancer clinic, ownership in a \nnew heart clinic, those kinds of things that he suggests promote \nsubstantial overutilization.\n\n  The fact is, in our part of the country, where it is reasonably \nsparsely populated--the northern Great Plains--almost every hospital of \nany size wants to have a cardiac surgical unit so they can do open-\nheart surgery. They do not all need to do that. In fact, it duplicates \nservices, which then ends up costing more because you are duplicating \nservices. But every hospital wants it. So many of our States have more \nthan is necessary of cardiac surgical suites.\n  This weekend, I was reading about two hospital groups merging, and \none of them indicated that one of the advantages would be they would be \nable to then perform perhaps procedures they do not now perform, citing \nespecially heart transplants. Why would we want duplication of a lot of \nfacilities doing heart transplants? It does not seem to make sense to \nme. There are not so many done in the United States that we should not \nat least try to suggest that you do not need too many heart transplant \ncenters.\n  Some say: Well, then who should tell them they cannot do that?\n  Well, if you just decide that overutilization is all right; whatever \nit costs, it costs; whatever it pays, it pays, I think I can tell you \nthat you cannot solve this issue. Again, I am not suggesting \ngovernment-run health care, but I am saying we ought to be reasonably \nsmart about what we are doing, and that has not always been the case.\n  I wish to talk about one of the fastest rising areas of health care \ncosts for a moment; that is, the issue of prescription drugs.\n  By the way, maybe they ought to tone down some of this advertising or \nknock it off. You get up in the morning and brush your teeth. If you \nhave a television set near and have it on just for listening purposes, \nyou are no doubt going to hear a commercial that says: Do you know \nwhat, you should go ask your doctor whether the purple pill is right \nfor you. I do not know what a purple pill is, but they have described a \npurple pill that is going to do something for you, and they ask you to \ngo ask your doctor if you should be taking the purple pill because you \ncannot get it unless a doctor thinks you need it.\n  We have massive amounts of advertising on prescription drugs in this \ncountry. In fact, some have indicated that the promotion and \nadvertising and marketing of prescription drugs exceed research and \ndevelopment by the companies that manufacture prescription drugs. \nFrankly, for anything that is prescribed only by a doctor and capable \nof being prescribed only by a doctor, why do you have direct-to-\nconsumer advertising? Most nations like ours do not allow it. I believe \nthere is only one other of the industrialized nations that does--\nsomething to consider about perhaps reducing health care costs.\n  But I want to talk about the other side of prescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, if I might by unanimous consent show these two \nbottles.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Lipitor is one of the most popular prescription drugs in \nthe United States, I believe, for lowering cholesterol. These bottles \nare identical. One is blue and one is red. They look identical because \nthey are produced by the same company. It is produced in Ireland. \nLipitor is produced in Ireland and shipped around the world. The \ndifference between these two bottles is not the medicine inside. It is \nthe same pill, made by the same company, in the same place. The \ndifference is it is shipped to different places. This one is shipped to \nCanada, and this one is shipped to the United States. The U.S. consumer \nhas the pleasure of paying twice the cost as the Canadian consumer. But \nit is not just Canadian. It is French. It is Italian. It is British. It \nis that almost every other industrialized country pays a fraction of \nthe price we do. Why should the American consumer be charged the \nhighest price in the world for this prescription drug? Because those \nwho apply the price have the ability to do it.\n  Some of us--Senator McCain, myself, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nGrassley--Republicans and Democrats--Senator Snowe, especially, my \ncosponsor on the importation of prescription drug legislation--some of \nus believe the American people ought to have the ability and the \nadvantage of the world marketplace to purchase that identical \nprescription drug--FDA approved, produced in an FDA-inspected plant--to \nbe able to purchase it from anywhere in the world at a fraction of the \nprice.\n  We put together legislation that dramatically improves the safety of \nour domestic prescription drug supply and the drugs coming in.\n  By the way, a lot of the prescription drugs we take are imported. \nLipitor is imported into this country. The pharmaceutical industry--\nwhich has always opposed our legislation because they want to charge \nthe highest prices in the world to the U.S. consumers--they say: Well, \nif you do this, if you allow Americans to import FDA-approved drugs, \nthere is a greater possibility of counterfeiting. Our legislation \nactually will dramatically improve safety because we require pedigree--\nwe do all kinds of safety mechanisms that do not now exist with respect \nto our prescription drug supply.\n  So my point is, this is not rocket science. Do you want to reduce \nhealth care costs? I would say to the Finance Committee, and the HELP \nCommittee, make sure you put this piece in your legislation because \nsome of the fastest rising costs in this country are prescription \ndrugs, and we know how to solve that. If we pass the legislation \nSenator Snowe and I have introduced, with broad bipartisan support, \nthat allows the importation of FDA-approved prescription drugs by \nAmerican consumers, it will require the pharmaceutical industry to \nreprice their drugs and allow our consumers to have fair prices for the \nprescription drugs they take.\n  By the way, our legislation is actually a winner. It is $50 billion \ndollars in cost savings and deficit reduction, according to the CBO \nevaluation.\n  So the fact is, there are a lot of things we can do and a lot of \nthings that represent common sense. I know some will want to put \ntogether a health care proposal that would look like a Rubik's Cube \nwith all kinds of moving pieces. It need not be that complicated. I \njust described some of the things we can do that represent common \nsense.\n  Let me make one more point. Medicare has been a very successful \nprogram. When Medicare was started, the fact is, they established a \nbase funding for Medicare that represented the cost for health care \ndelivery at that time from that place. The result is, those areas with \nthe highest costs got the biggest reimbursements. And it is still true \ntoday that some of the States--including my State--measured with some \nof the highest quality of health care in this country get the lowest \nreimbursement because they are the most efficient. That is \npreposterous. Whatever we do on health care, it has to address that \nissue. Let us at least, after nearly 40 years, begin to decide we will \nnot reward inefficiency and we will not reward higher costs.\n\n  I am not suggesting this is unbelievably simple; it is not. In many \nways, I kind of wish we could hearken back to the old days, but in the \nold days we didn't have the medical miracles and the medicine we have \nnow. In my hometown of 300 people--a small town--we did have a doctor. \nHe came as a young man and stayed until he died, and he provided health \ncare. There was no Medicare. He provided health care to anybody who \nneeded it, and if they couldn't pay him, he would take some chickens or \na hog or a side of beef. If he was out on a ranch or a farm and \ndelivered a baby and they didn't have any money, and somebody else had \nmoney, he would charge a little extra to make up for the people who \ncouldn't pay, so he administered his own health care system.\n  Then we couldn't look inside the human body. We didn't have the \nmiracle medicines through the NIH and PhRMA and others that allow us to \nstay out of an acute care bed. We didn't have all of those things. So \nnow health care has become much more complicated. According to the New \nYorker\n\n[[Page S6867]]\n\nmagazine article, which I recommend to everybody, when we have decided \nto make health care a ``business proposition'' where you can get \nseveral doctors together and open a cancer center, that becomes \nsomething in which you promote overutilization. And it is happening in \nparts of our country. We need to be concerned about that and try to \nevaluate what can we do together to deal with it.\n  One final point. Some of my colleagues march to the floor every \nsingle day and allege that a bill that doesn't yet exist is going to be \na government takeover of health care. Well, apparently they are \nclairvoyant, because we don't yet have a bill. When that bill exists, \nthey have every right to come to the floor and describe the facts about \nthe bill. One would hope in this debate we could stick to those facts, \nbut there is not yet a fact that allows somebody to say there is a \ngovernment takeover of health care, because there is not yet a bill out \nof either of our committees. There have been some introductions of \ntopics and legislative proposals, but that is far different than a bill \nfrom a committee. We will have undoubtedly a robust debate on this, and \nwe should. Health care is a very important element in this country's \neconomy. It is growing, and growing too fast, and we need to deal with \nit to make sure all Americans have access to health care. A sick child \nshould not have to wonder whether they get to see a doctor depending on \nhow much money their parents have in their wallet or their bank \naccount. That is not what health care ought to be in this country. So \nwe can and will do much better.\n  I indicated I wish to talk about the future threats to this country, \none of which is the march of health care costs. The second, in my \njudgment, is our unbelievable vulnerability on foreign oil and energy. \nThe third is deficits. I will talk about the following two in the \ncoming days as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss bipartisan \nlegislation that I am cosponsoring with my colleague Senator Corker \nconcerning the Federal Government's recently acquired ownership stake \nin a number of private companies.\n  I think we all know the taxpayers have been on a roller coaster ride \nfor the past 9 months, and from their perspective, each twist and turn \nhas left us more deeply invested in troubled markets and oftentimes \ntroubled companies. Americans are concerned about getting their money \nback and want to keep politics out of how we manage these investments \nwe have had to make over the last few months.\n  Last week, Senator Corker and I introduced S. 1280, the TARP \nRecipient Ownership Trust Act. What will this bill do? Three very \nsimple things. First, it will remove politics from our management of \ntaxpayer investments in private companies. Second, it will ensure these \ninvestments are managed in order to maximize taxpayer returns. Third, \nit will allow us to plan for removing the government from the private \nsector by setting a date certain for selling these investments.\n  To achieve these goals, Senator Corker and I are proposing that if \nthe government owns more than 20 percent of a private company we place \nthat ownership stake in an independent trust. This trust would be run \nwith a fiduciary duty for taxpayers by three independent directors \nappointed by the President. These directors would agree to perform this \nwork for free as a service to the country and in doing so would give \nthe American taxpayers what they deserve: the upside of the massive \ninvestments they have provided over the past 9 months. The trust \nwouldn't be an open-ended ownership in these companies; the trust would \nhave to sell all of these assets by the end of 2011, though they could \nask for a brief extension if it were, again, in the interest of the \ntaxpayers' return. In this way, taxpayers can know we won't own stock \nin these companies for the next 20 years. In practice, this means that \ntaxpayer ownership of AIG, Citigroup, and General Motors would be \nmanaged in order to maximize the return on these taxpayer investments.\n  We have all seen how political and contentious the TARP program is \nbecoming. I know back when we voted on this matter earlier this year \nhow controversial it was. I still think it was unfortunate that we got \ninto this circumstance but fortunately the right thing to do. While \nthere are a lot of challenges about how we got into this program, if we \ndid look around--actually, Steven Pearlstein of the Washington Post \npointed out in an article recently that if 9 months ago, if 6 months \nago, or even 3 months ago, back in the middle of March when the stock \nmarket was at its all-time low in terms of reacting to this crisis, any \neconomist would have said by the end of June, would you be willing to \nlook at a circumstance where the market was up 25, 30 percent--although \nit was a little bit down today--if many of the banks we had invested \nTARP funds in were actually trying to repay those TARP funds, and if we \nhad seen the housing market, at least in many communities, start to \nstabilize, would we view that as a good outcome. Well, that is \nbasically where we are. While we have enormous problems, we are seeing \nsome progress. But one needs only to look at the number of TARP-related \namendments that have been filed in the Senate in these past months. As \na matter of fact, the leader was speaking today about the number of \nTARP amendments that could potentially be on the travel bill that we \nwill have before us to know that this has become a lightning rod.\n  Some of the reasons for this concern are truly relevant and they are \nbecause the American people don't know when and how the TARP program is \nsupposed to end. The American people, unfortunately, who invested in \nindividual companies--some of the companies that now we have invested \nin--don't know how much we as the public will get back, or whether we, \nas the public investment, will politically interfere with the \nmanagement of these companies. That is, again, why we need to implement \nthis legislation Senator Corker and I have laid out that will put these \nownership shares in this independent fiduciary trust.\n  I don't support cutting off TARP right now or limiting the tools it \ncurrently provides the administration, including the limited reuse of \nmoney that is repaid to the government. TARP already has a sunset date \nafter which more funds cannot be spent, and since markets are not back \nto normal, even though there is improvement, we shouldn't prevent the \nuse of the tools we currently have. But we do need to set parameters \nfor managing our investments and winding them down in order to take the \npolitics out of this program.\n  American taxpayers deserve to have their investments managed in order \nto maximize their returns. That is what the trust will do, and I hope \nwe will consider using this model for other investments as well.\n  This trust will also help us take some of the politics out of the \nTARP program, and that is why I am proud of this legislation as \nbipartisan and led by my friend from Tennessee, Senator Corker. I hope \nmy colleagues will join in supporting this bipartisan legislation, S. \n1280, the TARP Recipient Ownership Trust Act. While this measure won't \nresolve all of our concerns surrounding TARP, I hope it can serve as a \nmodel to maximize the taxpayer returns on their investment.\n  Let me also take one additional moment to speak about another \ninvestment-related matter. Under the leadership of Senator Jack Reed \nfrom Rhode Island, when the initial investments and the initial TARP \nplan were put together, Senator Reed, I think appropriately, said if we \ninvest in banks in addition to getting a traditional return, we, the \npublic, who are taking\n\n[[Page S6868]]\n\nthese risks ought to see some upside potential for taking the risks in \nterms of warrants. Luckily, the Congress went along with that and we \ndid receive warrants from a number of the banks we invested in. I \npersonally am very happy to see that a number of these banks are \nstarting to repay the investments the public made. However, there \nremains the question: What are we going to do with the warrants? \nSenator Reed and I have asked Secretary Geithner a number of times, and \nwe hope he would also consider placing these warrants into some type of \nindependent trust as well so that, again, we, the taxpayers, can \nreceive the upside of these investments.\n  We took the risks with these banks during these troubled times. I am \nhappy to see these banks return these funds. However, for the banks to \nbuy back or sell back these warrants at what I believe today is still a \ndiscounted price would not allow us, the taxpayers, to maximize our \ninvestments. So, again, I hope Secretary Geithner responds to the \nrequests that Senator Reed and I have made in making sure that these \nwarrants are appropriately put into the same type of independent \nfiduciary trusts that I am proposing for the private investments we \nhave made under TARP.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/22/senate-section/article/S6868-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6868-S6870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, health care reform is very much in the \nnews and very much on the agenda of the Senate, as the American people \nknow. So far, they have learned very little about how Congress plans to \naddress what is broken in our health care system.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, two committees in the Senate are \nprimarily given the responsibility for writing a health care reform \nbill. Of course, the HELP Committee--the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee--chaired by Senator Kennedy, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and the Finance Committee, chaired by Senator Baucus. \nThe ranking member, of course, is Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa. \nThese two committees, as well as the President of the United States, \nare considering numerous proposals that deserve the careful attention \nof the American people and of Congress, because this legislation, \nhowever it turns out, could fundamentally affect the relationship \nbetween patients and their doctors as well as the relationship between \nthe individual and our government.\n  In the Kennedy bill, which has been proposed and which is pending now \nbefore the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, there are \nseveral troublesome provisions. One, a government-run plan which would \ncompete, allegedly, with the private sector. But as we all know, the \ngovernment is the 800-pound gorilla, and there is no true competition \nwhen government is involved. In fact, one projection is that as many as \nalmost 120 million people would ultimately find themselves in a single-\npayer, government-run system, because essentially the Federal \nGovernment would undercut those private health plans to the point where \nindividuals would find themselves with no choice other than to have the \ngovernment direct their health care.\n  Another troublesome provision is the so-called pay or play mandate. \nIt goes without saying, almost, but I will say it anyway, that small \nbusinesses create the vast majority of jobs in America. Yet this \nproposal, I think mistakenly, would impose a punitive tax on small \nbusinesses that are unable to keep their doors open and provide health \ninsurance for their employees. We want to allow small businesses to \nprovide health care to their employees by bringing down the costs, and \nwe have a number of mechanisms to do that. But the idea that we are \ngoing to impose a punitive tax on small businesses that do not provide \na health care plan for their employees will destroy jobs, so people \nwill not only be without insurance, they will be without jobs, period--\na bad idea.\n  Third, the Kennedy bill would provide new Federal subsidies to \nindividuals making as much as $110,000 a year--astonishing. At a time \nwhen we are looking at spending or borrowing as far as the eye can see \nand deficits up to $2 trillion, unfunded liabilities in the tens of \ntrillions of dollars, there is actually a proposal before the HELP \nCommittee that would increase the size of Federal entitlement programs \nand increase the tenuous position of this Medicaid Program which would \nthen fund health insurance for people making up to $110,000 a year.\n  Fourth, the Kennedy bill would impose a medical advisory council.\n  I always get a kick out of the innocuous names given to some pretty \nsinister stuff up here. I would say it is sort of akin to calling the \nformer Soviet Union's politburo an advisory council. In fact, this \nmedical advisory council--comprised of unelected and unaccountable \nbureaucrats--would have the power to dictate personal health decisions.\n  I don't know anybody who thinks that is a good idea; certainly nobody \nI have talked to. This Kennedy proposal, with all due respect to our \nfriend and colleague from Massachusetts, is chock full of bad care \npolicies. The worst part of it is, they will not lower health care \ncosts for people who have health insurance now. In fact, they will make \nour debt burden and the debt burden of our children and grandchildren \nmuch worse.\n  The price tag on government programs keeps growing and growing and \ngrowing here in Washington, DC. In fact, the President's proposal for \nhis budget this year projected a ``downpayment on health care reform.'' \nWell, I have told people that where I come from we don't make \ndownpayments on something unless we know exactly what it is we are \nbuying. So far the American people don't know what they are being asked \nto buy.\n  Indeed, the other part of that--and this just staggers my \nimagination--is that we already spend almost twice as much as the next \nclosest industrialized nation on health care per capita. We spend \nroughly 17 percent of our economy--our gross domestic product--on \nhealth care. Why does anybody think it is a good idea to spend even \nmore? If we were getting a good value for that spending, that would be \none thing, but we know this current level of spending is full of fraud \nand waste and other problems. So why in the world would we want to make \nmatters worse by spending more money on top of a flawed health care \ndelivery system?\n  Talking about money--and I know it is hard to imagine how much we are \ntalking about--it used to be that $1 million was a lot of money; then a \nbillion dollars seemed like a lot of money--and it is--and now we are \nsort of becoming increasingly immune to these big numbers when people \ntalk about trillions of dollars and more. For example, earlier this \nmonth, the proposal that Senator Kennedy made--that is pending now in \nfront of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee--was \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office, which is responsible for \ngiving us good numbers in an impartial, nonpartisan way, so we can make \nsound policy decisions. They said the Kennedy bill would cost more than \n$1 trillion over the next 10 years. The problem is, that was only for \npart of the bill. In other words, that was not the complete cost of the \nbill proposed by our friend and colleague from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy.\n  To make matters worse, the Congressional Budget Office said the bill \nwould only cover one-third of the uninsured. Ironically, it would \nultimately chase millions of people off the insurance coverage they \nhave right now. So it strikes me as a very bad answer to a very real \nproblem.\n  Last week, we also learned of the Congressional Budget Office's \nestimate for the Senate Finance Committee proposal--the second \ncommittee that is dealing with health care, and the committee on which \nI am privileged to serve. Here again, the Congressional Budget Office--\nthe number crunchers, the folks with the green eyeshades who try to \ncall them as they see them so we can take that into account in \ndetermining policy decisions--said the proposal coming out of the \nFinance Committee would cost $1.6 trillion more over 10 years. So on \ntop of the 17 percent of our gross domestic product, we are talking \nabout proposals that would spend $1 trillion to $1.6 trillion of \nadditional money on top of a broken system.\n\n[[Page S6869]]\n\n  Well, two things are becoming increasingly clear so far; that is, it \nseems like there is less concern in Washington about lowering health \ncare costs than shifting those costs to the taxpayers. The costs \nrelated to a Washington takeover of health care keep going up and up. \nYou would think these huge price tags would convince some folks in \nWashington we ought to call a time out, to back up and come back with a \ndifferent idea. You would think it would cause Senators and Congressmen \nand other leaders here in Washington--the President--to come up with a \nnew approach, to be open to different alternatives where we could \nactually lower costs, not only for the taxpayers but for small \nbusinesses and individual consumers. Instead, we see proposals coming \nout of the White House and the Halls of Congress calling for more \nspending and more debt.\n  Of course, one thing that happens around Washington when people don't \nlike the news being delivered by nonpartisan agencies, such as the \nCongressional Budget Office, is they try to shoot the messenger. Last \nweek, Speaker Pelosi accused the Congressional Budget Office of \nproviding misleading analyses of health care reform bills. I don't \nbelieve that is the case. I actually believe the professionals at the \nCongressional Budget Office are doing very difficult but unpopular \nwork. They are speaking truth to power here in Washington and making \nthe folks who would pass these enormous unfunded bills and impose this \nhuge debt on generations hereafter somewhat unhappy. But I think they \nare doing an important service by telling us the facts.\n  Last week, I commended the Director of the CBO--Dr. Doug Elmendorf--\nfor saying that CBO will ``never adjust our views to make people \nhappy.'' God bless Dr. Doug Elmendorf for his integrity and his \ncommitment to telling the truth. We need to learn how to deal with the \ntruth, not try to remake it or cover it up.\n  The second part of these proposals that causes me grave concern is \nthis notion that we actually need to spend more money in order to be \nable to save money in the end. We need to spend money to save money. I \nknow the distinguished occupant of the Chair had a very successful \nbusiness career, and maybe that is true in the private sector--\nsometimes you have to invest money in order to make money or save money \nlater--but I can't think of a single Federal Government program where \nthat worked--you have to spend more money in order to save money. It \ndoes not happen around here.\n  Let me cite somebody who perhaps is certainly more authoritative than \nI am: Professor Katherine Baicker of the Harvard School of Public \nHealth. She said:\n\n       Universal insurance is likely to increase, not reduce, \n     overall health care spending.\n\n  Professor Baicker predicted months ago what the Congressional Budget \nOffice has recently concluded. The Congressional Budget Office said:\n\n       By themselves, insurance expansions would also cause \n     national spending on health care to increase, in part because \n     insured people generally receive somewhat more medical care \n     than uninsured people.\n\n  The Washington Post recognizes this as well. In an editorial this \nmorning, it said:\n\n       It is quite likely that any legislation that emerges will \n     create a hugely expansive health-care entitlement with no \n     guarantee of the upward cost spiral being slowed.\n\n  The Post also said:\n\n       . . . given a national debt already growing out of control \n     and the risks that health-care costs won't be controlled, you \n     may worry about taking on a large new burden ($1.6 trillion \n     over 10 years . . . ).\n\n  I think that is exactly right. That is what makes people anxious \nabout what they hear coming out of Washington under the name of health \ncare reform.\n  I think it is fair to say that the ``spend more to save more'' \nthinking is what resulted in the wasteful and counterproductive \nstimulus bill that was passed earlier this year--a bill that we got on \nour desks--the conference report--at 11 p.m. on a Thursday night and \nwere required to vote on less than 24 hours later, when virtually no \none had even had a chance to read it. I was comfortable with my vote, \nbecause I voted against it, for many reasons but one of them being I \ndidn't know exactly what was in there.\n  The stimulus bill was a very partisan bill, passed over the nearly \nunanimous opposition of congressional Republicans. But we were told \nsomething along the lines of what we now hear: Spend more to save more. \nWe heard that spending was good, for its own sake, and that borrowing \nand spending was the quickest route to economic recovery. We were told \nwe had to rush through this binge of spending--borrowed money--or else \nunemployment would rise to over 8 percent.\n\n  Well, the results are in, and they are not very good. The national \nunemployment rate is now 9.4 percent--not 8 percent. In many States, it \nis well into double digits. A lot of stimulus money has been simply \nwasted, and the bulk of it is stuck here in Washington.\n  I think what we ought to do is take it and return it to deficit \nreduction, so we can, hopefully, lower the burden we have imposed on \nour children and grandchildren under a ruse, under the pretense that we \nwere actually going to use that money to get the economy back on track. \nIt hasn't happened. While we are seeing some so-called green shoots of \nthe economy beginning to spring up, with improved results on Wall \nStreet, we know unemployment is very high and we are not out of the \nwoods yet.\n  Indeed, we are looking at the prospect of runaway inflation, unless \nthe Fed does a very tricky balancing act as it contracts its balance \nsheet and unwinds a lot of lending it has done in the past. Because one \nresult is that as the economy improves, inflation will be a great risk. \nOf course, the Fed has a tough balancing act to play, because if they \ncrank up interest rates too soon, it may well kill the recovery and we \nwill be back in the position we find ourselves in now.\n  The bottom line is, we can't spend more to save more. It didn't work \nin the stimulus bill, and it is not going to work when it comes to \nhealth care. Proponents of a so-called public plan or government plan--\nwhat I call a government takeover, or Washington takeover of health \ncare--are saying that it works as well as Medicare at keeping costs \nlow. As a matter of fact, that is the model they started out with. They \nsaid: Medicare for all, until they realized that wasn't a very good \nexample because of the fiscal unsustainability of Medicare spending \nthat we see now with tens of trillions of dollars in unfunded \nliabilities and also the fact that a lot of Medicare beneficiaries, \nwhile they have the promise of coverage--of Medicare--they can't find a \ndoctor to see them. Medicare rates are so low that many physicians--for \nexample, where I live, in Travis County, in Austin, TX, only 17 percent \nof physicians will see a new Medicare patient because reimbursements \nrates are so low.\n  We need to fix Medicare, yes, but we don't need to take the current \nbroken system and blow it up and make it the system for 300 million \npeople and consider that we have done our job.\n  I mentioned the $38 trillion in unfunded liabilities. It is estimated \nMedicare will go insolvent in the year 2017 unless we do something \nabout it. In fact, many beneficiaries of Medicare know it is inadequate \nalone, so they buy supplemental policies. Medicare forces many \nproviders, as I mentioned, to limit the number of patients they accept \nbecause reimbursement rates are so low. Here is another part of why \nMedicare is a bad model. The Washington Post estimates that $60 billion \nof taxpayer money is stolen or wasted or lost to fraud in Medicare each \nyear. Surely, we need to fix that problem.\n  Senator Martinez and I have introduced legislation that we believe \nwill cut that figure down dramatically and make sure more of that money \ngoes to treat Medicare beneficiaries rather than being stolen or \ndefrauded by some unscrupulous health care providers.\n  Medicaid only works as well as it does because of cost shifting to \npeople with private insurance.\n  Economists will tell us that cost shifting occurs when a health care \nprovider accepts low government reimbursement rates but can only do so \nif it anticipates collecting higher rates from those with private \ninsurance. This cost shifting acts like a hidden tax on millions of \nAmerican families and small businesses. One respected actuary estimates \nthat cost shifting increases the average American family's health care \npremium by more than 10 percent or $1,500. That means those listening \nwho have private health insurance, their family will pay $1,500 more\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\neach year because of this cost shifting phenomenon because Medicare and \nMedicaid reimburse at below-market rates. So those are hardly a model \nfor what we ought to be doing. Adding another new government plan on \ntop of the ones we have, of course, will only increase the costs. We \nwill never lower health care costs by putting Medicare all in place or \nwhat some might call Medicare on steroids. We need new approaches.\n  Mr. President, there are better alternatives. We have a bill that has \nbeen proposed by Senators Burr and Coburn on our side of the aisle. \nSeveral members on the Finance Committee, including myself, are working \non a proposal that will empower patients and consumers, and not the \ngovernment; that will not get between doctors and patients and will not \nrely on denying or delaying access to care in order to keep costs down. \nWe believe innovation is one of the things that has made health care in \nAmerica among the greatest in the world, and that is why we believe we \nneed to retain, protect and nurture that innovation and that quality \nhealth care: to empower patients to use a market that plays by the \nrules to help lower their costs.\n  I have seen that as recently as a few weeks ago in Austin, TX, when I \nvisited with a number of employees of the Whole Foods Company that is \nheadquartered in Austin--a grocery company--where these workers have \nhealth savings accounts or high deductible insurance. They call them \nwellness accounts. I was told that 80 percent of the employees at Whole \nFoods don't have to pay any money out of pocket for health care. Since \nthey have wellness accounts, or money they control, they have been \nempowered to become good, smarter consumers in health care.\n  So they will call health care providers and say: How much are you \ngoing to charge me for this? They will shop and compare different \nproviders to make sure they are getting the best price for the best \nquality outcome. I think that kind of thing, which imposes market \ndiscipline but which requires transparency, is one way we can hold down \ncosts and empower individuals rather than just turn it all over to \nUncle Sam.\n  Let me say, in conclusion, we keep hearing we must put health care \nreform on the fast track in Washington, DC, although we see the \nschedule slipping because of the sticker shock at the huge numbers \ncoming out of the CBO. I have told folks back in Texas that we know the \ntrain is leaving the station, but we don't yet know whether that train \nwill safely arrive with all of its occupants healthy and alive or \nwhether what we are witnessing is, in essence, a slow-motion train \nwreck in Washington, DC.\n  The more the American people learn about what is in these bills and \nhow much they cost, they will want us to slow down so we can make \nbetter decisions and we can get this right.\n  I think we owe them that. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1023, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1023) to establish a nonprofit corporation to \n     communicate United States entry policies and otherwise \n     promote leisure, business, and scholarly travel to the United \n     States.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Dorgan/Rockefeller) amendment No. 1347, of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 1348 (to amendment No. 1347), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 1349 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 1347), to change the enactment \n     date.\n       Reid amendment No. 1350 (to amendment No. 1349), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid motion to commit the bill to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation, with instructions.\n       Reid amendment No. 1351 (to the instructions on the motion \n     to recommit), to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 1352 (to amendment No. 1351), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 1353 (to amendment No. 1352), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the legislation that is now the business \nof the Senate, on which we will have a cloture vote at 5:30, is \nlegislation that probably demonstrates that agreement is near \nimpossible in this body.\n  If you cannot agree on tourism, what can you agree on? Tourism ought \nnot to be the subject of very substantial controversy. Yet it is.\n  Last week, in an article in Roll Call, it says ``Senate GOP still \nsaying no.'' The quote is:\n\n       When they bring bills up, we are going to extend the debate \n     as long as we can, block everything.\n\n  So this legislation is simple, and it is bipartisan. Republicans and \nDemocrats have both supported this legislation. I was the author of it. \nWe have Republican and Democratic cosponsors. It is the Travel \nPromotion Act. Why should we promote travel?\n  If you watched the U.S. Open Golf Tournament today, you might have \nseen the country of Turkey advertising during that golf tournament. \nThey were running an advertisement saying: Come to Turkey. We want you \nto travel to Turkey and see the wonders of our great country.\n  Why would they do that? Most countries are now aggressively involved \nin trying to attract international destination tourism to their \ncountry. Why is that the case? We know on average that an international \ntraveler spends about $4,500 per trip, and that means they are \npurchasing hotel rooms and car rentals and going to see exhibits and \nparks and all kinds of things. The fact is, it is job creating in a \ncountry where international travelers visit. So most countries are now \nvery active trying to attract people to their countries. Japan is, as \nare Great Britain, Italy, Turkey, France--you name it.\n  I have some charts. Here is an example of what is happening out \nthere. This is an advertisement: ``Sweet secrets from Japan.'' To learn \nabout Japan and its culinary arts and traditions, this is an \nadvertisement saying: Come to Japan. Come and travel in the country of \nJapan.\n  Here is an advertisement from France. Picasso, Normandy Landings. \nCome and see France with the Eiffel Tower.\n  Here is one for Belgium. ``Travel to Belgium where fun is all in \nfashion,'' they say.\n  Brussels, ``Sophisticated simplicity, the capital of cool.''\n  This one says: ``One special reason to visit India in 2009. Any time \nis a good time to visit the land of Taj. But there's no time like \nnow.'' Come to India.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Here is Ireland. ``The Emerald Island. Go where Ireland takes you.'' \nAnd here is a beautiful picture of Ireland saying: Come to our country.\n  Finally, we have Australia. ``Arrive for an experience to remember. \nDepart with an adventure we'll never forget.'' Come to Australia.\n  I describe these and the fact that Turkey advertises on a golf \ntournament because here is what happened to visitors to the United \nStates since 2000: Between 2000 and 2008, we have had a 3-percent \ndecrease in visitors to our country from other countries. Mr. \nPresident, 633,000 fewer people have come to the United States to visit \nper year that existed in 2000. Over 8 years, we have actually lost \nground and had fewer people visit the United States. Contrast that with \nthe number of international visitors around the world, which is up 40 \npercent. The United States is down 3 percent.\n  We have constructed--Republicans and Democrats together--a piece of \nlegislation, which I have brought to the floor, that attempts to get \nour\n\n[[Page S6871]]\n\ncountry into the game to say let's compete with Australia, France, \nItaly, Turkey, and Belgium and ask international visitors and travelers \nto come to our country to see the wonders of our great country. Spend \nsome money here to create jobs here and create economic development \nhere. We are not doing that now. We are not even in the game.\n  So we suggest a private-public partnership we believe could be very \nhelpful in attempting to stimulate international visitors to our \ncountry. The Travel Promotion Act will encourage visitors from all \naround the world. We establish a corporation for travel promotion.\n  We fund it with a very small charge on international visitors coming \nto our country, as most countries do, by the way, a $10 fee on those \nwho are coming from the countries that had the visa waiver provision \nwith our country.\n  Here is what has been said about our country recently, and here is \nperhaps why fewer people are visiting the United States. The Sydney \nMorning Herald said, ``Coming to America is not easy.'' I think there \nwas a feeling around the world post-9/11, we are very interested in \ntrying to keep some people out of here. Obviously we wanted to keep \nterrorists out. But we made it pretty difficult for people to come \nvisit, get a visa, stand in line, wait for months. The Guardian said, \n``America, more hassle than it's worth.'' The Sunday Times in London \nsays: ``Travel to America? No thanks.''\n  So a group of us, a large group, over 50 in the last Congress, put \nlegislation together saying: Let's find a unique way to promote our \ncountry. We put together the Travel Promotion Act. And by the way, \nunlike almost every other piece of legislation that comes to the floor \nof the Senate, that costs money and would increase the deficit if not \npaid for, the Congressional Budget Office says: Enacting this bill \nwould reduce budget deficits by $429 million--that is almost a half a \nbillion dollars--between 2010 and 2019. So this would reduce the budget \ndeficit. We are not talking about something that spends money. This \nreduces the budget deficit over 10 years by nearly $500 million.\n  We fund this, in large part, with a small $10 fee from the visa \nwaiver countries in which visitors are traveling to our country. As I \nhave described, Australia has a $37 departure fee; Guatemala, $30; the \nPhilippines, $15; United Kingdom, $80 to $160. The fact is, this goes \non all around the world. We are proposing a very modest fee on visitors \nfrom visa waiver countries.\n  Newspapers all across this country have supported this. Dallas \nMorning News: The Travel Promotion Act is a sensible first step toward \nputting the welcome mat back on America's doorstep.\n  The Detroit Free Press: Doesn't it make sense to encourage, at no \ncost to taxpayers, foreign visitors to come here and leave us some of \ntheir money? There is no good reason not to pass this bill.\n  The Los Angeles Times: Considering that the U.S. spends hundreds of \nmillions of dollars on public diplomacy with dubious results, and \nnearly nothing promoting tourism, we might do well to invest a little \nmoney in wooing travelers.\n  The Sacramento Bee: This country needs to reclaim its status as a \nglobal magnet for visitors, even in the post-9/11 climate. And Congress \ncould help by passing the Travel Promotion Act by the end of this year.\n  This ought to be something that we bring up and almost pass by \nunanimous consent. Guess what kind of a tortured journey this bill has \nbeen on. First and foremost, the bill is reported to the floor--and you \nhave got to have a motion to proceed. You cannot just bring it to the \nfloor. If someone insists, no, no, you have got to have a debate and \nthen a vote on whether you should even proceed to the bill.\n  So we did. Not because we should have had to do that, just because \nsomeone said: You know what, we are going to decide to be a human set \nof brake pads and slow down everything that happens in the Senate and \nprevent anybody from getting anything done.\n  So on a travel bill, the Travel Promotion Act, that actually reduces \nthe Federal budget deficit and tries to attract international visitors \nto our country, which would be a good thing--there is a lot here to see \nand experience, and almost everyone who leaves after visiting the \nUnited States of America has an unbelievably good opinion of what we \nare about. This is a great country, yes, with a lot of attractions, but \na country whose culture and character is something we need to exhibit \nto everybody in this world to say: Here is who we are. Here is what \nAmerica is about. Here is the grand idea that is the most successful \ndemocracy in history. Come here. Visit here. Become a part of what we \nare experiencing on your international travels.\n  We are not doing that now. But we suggest we should. The bill that is \nbroadly bipartisan to do that is to be brought to the floor of the \nSenate. We are told: No, you cannot do that. First you must have a \ndebate, and then a vote on the motion to proceed.\n  So we have to file what is called a cloture petition, which takes 2 \ndays to ripen. You lose 2 days. Then we have a vote. And the vote is 90 \nto 3 in favor of it. The implication there is we should not have had to \nhave a vote and waste a couple of days. But we did.\n  Then, after the cloture vote, 90 to 3, we were told: No, you cannot \ngo to the bill yet, there is 30 hours postcloture, and we insist on \nburning all 30 hours postcloture.\n  We had 2 days for the cloture petition, then a 90-to-3 vote, then we \nhad 30 hours wasted time postcloture. Why? Because someone insisted \nupon it. And so now all of a sudden we are on the bill.\n  Well, last Thursday and Friday, I worked, Senator Reid worked, and \nmany others worked to see, all right, we are on the bill. Now can we \nfigure out what kind of amendments are going to be offered.\n  We had a discussion over there in the middle of the aisle with \nSenators McConnell, Reid, Martinez, and others. We agreed we would \nbegin with amendments on each side. Perhaps we started with three and \ntwo, then we said five amendments on the Republican side and three \namendments here at least to start the process.\n  Can you give us a list of your amendments? We got a list of the \namendments, five amendments on what is called the TARP program, the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program, having nothing at all to do with this \nbill. We said: That is fine. Okay. You want to have five debates and \nvotes on TARP. Okay.\n  Here are our three amendments, two of which had to do with the \nstudies. The other was an amendment by Senator Sanders that said to the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission that we want them to use all of \nthe authority they now have, plus any emergency authority, use the \nauthority you now have to start finding a way to shine the light on \nthese unbelievable speculators who are running up the price of \ngasoline. Not a very controversial amendment. It does not give the CFTC \nany new authority. It deals with the question of the runup in the price \nof gasoline. It does not give anyone any new authority. But the \nRepublican side said: Nope, we are not going to allow you to offer that \namendment. We are going to tell you which amendments we intend to \noffer. We said, okay, that is fine, whatever amendments you have, God \nbless you, go ahead and offer them.\n  But they say, but you cannot describe to us a set of amendments, \nthree, five to three, and if the three includes an amendment to try to \nsee if you can shut down some of the excess speculation using the \nauthority that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission now has, we are \nnot willing to do that.\n  Most people would listen to all of this and say, it is the same old \nthing. Nobody can agree on anything. But, you know, in every \ncircumstance where there is disagreement, there has to be someone who \nis holding out. Right? We come to the floor today without an agreement \non amendments, so the majority leader had to file a cloture petition. \nWe have a cloture vote at 5:30 today.\n  This Congress cannot even agree on tourism, for God's sake. \nUnbelievable to me. How dysfunctional can a legislative body become? \nYou cannot agree on tourism.\n  But let me at least talk for a minute, before I talk about the \nimportance now of having a cloture vote and requiring to have a cloture \nvote on this, let me talk about what the other side objects\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\nto with an amendment that my colleague wants to offer. I agree that the \namendment does not relate to the bill, but their first five amendments \nhad nothing to do with the bill either. So why should the minority be \ntelling the majority what kind of amendments they can offer?\n  But here is the amendment. People remember when the price of oil went \nfrom about $40 up to $147 a barrel in day trading; went up like a Roman \ncandle, then came right back down. The same hotshots, the same \nspeculators, who made a fortune pushing up the price of oil, made a \nfortune on the upside, the same folks made a fortune on the downside. \nThe victims are the people who drive up to the gas pump having to pay \n$4, $4.50 for gasoline.\n\n  Let me show you what has happened. The Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission--I mean nobody knows what that is much outside of \nWashington, DC, CFTC. We have all of these acronyms. Well, it is a \ngroup of people who have done their level best imitation of a potted \nplant for a long time. They decided to do very little in areas where \nmuch was needed.\n  The oil futures market is a very important market. You need to hedge, \nwe understand that. The futures market is established for a very \nspecific reason, and it is an important market. But speculators have \nbroken the back of that market. Here is what happened. Thirty-seven \npercent of the trades in the oil futures market were by speculators in \n2000. Now it is 80 percent. That is what caused the price of oil to go \nup to $147 a barrel. They were speculating on the way up; they turned \nit and were speculating on the way down and made money on both sides.\n  Before I show what has happened to the price of oil now--by the way, \nit is starting again. Demand is down because of the recession, and the \nsupply of oil is up, and the price is going up.\n  What does that tell you? It tells you the same shenanigans are going \non. And the CFTC, which is supposed to be our agency, that is the \nreferee with the striped shirt and the whistle, supposed to be watching \nwhat is going on and taking action to shut some of it down, once again, \nnot much going on. Senator Sanders says: We ought to ask them, at least \nask them, to use all of their authority to shut it down.\n  We have a government agency called the EIA, Environmental Information \nAdministration. It costs about $100 million a year, actually over $100 \nmillion a year. Their job is to know everything there is to know about \nenergy, and to make the best estimates they can make. I want to show a \nchart that shows the runup to the $147 a barrel for oil.\n  This chart shows 2007-2008. The yellow line is the estimates by our \nagency, the EIA, saying: Here is where we think the price of oil is \ngoing. Each yellow line--this, for example, is January 2008. They said: \nHere is where we think the price of oil is headed. March 2008: Here is \nwhere we think it is headed. Of course, this was the price.\n  One would ask the question, and reasonably so: Who are these best \ninformed people at EIA who are supposed to give us an estimate of what \nis going on? Well, what is going on now? What we see now is an EIA \nprojection made in January of this year, the yellow line.\n  The EIA says: Here is where we think oil is going to go now. But, of \ncourse, anybody who drives a car and has stopped at a gas pump recently \nunderstands what is happening to the price of oil. The price of oil is \nsomething now over $70 a barrel, on the march from $37 a barrel. That \nis happening at a time when demand is down and supply is up.\n  I taught economics in college ever so briefly. But the supply-demand \ncurve is something you can learn the first day. When supply is up and \ndemand is down, price is not supposed to go up. If it is going up, \nthere is something wrong. There is something happening. And that is \nwhat is happening now.\n  Where will it go? Will it go to $90? I notice one of our big \ninvestment banks thought it would go to $90. I would love, if I had \nsubpoena capability, to find the position that investment bank was \nholding in oil futures as they made that announcement. But that is an \naside for another day.\n  The question is: Is it reasonable to have an amendment by Senator \nSanders to say: We want the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to use \nall of their authority to try to understand what is going on? The other \nside says: Absolutely not. We do not intend to allow you to offer that \namendment.\n  I mean, I do not understand why. Whose interests would they be \nsupporting or protecting? The speculators? Big investment banks? Those \nwho are holding oil offshore in ships? Those investment banks that \nactually have bought oil storage for the first time in history to take \noil out of supply and store it, and wait as the price goes up and make \nmoney? Is that whose interests are at stake here?\n  Let me come back to the point I was making. We tried very hard \nThursday and Friday to reach an agreement on amendments on both sides. \nWe said: Absolutely. You want amendments. You want all five amendments \non the TARP program? It has nothing to do with the bill. By all means, \nfeel free. Start offering. We are ready. And the other side said: Well, \nyou give us all we want, but we do not intend to agree to much of \nanything you want, kind of a one-way agreement that they would have \nknown was destined to fail.\n  Again, I do not understand how we have gotten to a point on a piece \nof legislation that should be so noncontroversial, sufficient so that \nwith a 90-to-3 vote on the motion to proceed, it is brought to the \nfloor of the Senate, a bill that had over 50 cosponsors last year here \nin the Senate, a bill that deals with travel and promotion of travel \nand tourism, that we now have this unbelievable impasse.\n  We had to have 2 days with a cloture motion on a motion to proceed \nthat passed 90 to 3 and then have 30 hours postcloture. Then we were \ngoing on this merry-go-round last Thursday and Friday with an absurd \nproposition that the minority wants to decide what amendments the \nmajority can have, despite the fact that the majority says: You can \nhave whatever amendments you want. They must have missed the last \ncouple of elections. They apparently think they run the Senate.\n  What runs the Senate is consensus--consensus by people who care about \ngetting things done on important issues. If you cannot do something on \ntourism, how on Earth are you going to do something on health care and \nenergy and climate change and a lot of things that matter a lot about \nthis country and the future? If you cannot do a tourism bill, what can \nyou do? It is pretty unbelievable to me.\n  I know we can have people come and explain, even until they are \ncompletely out of breath, why they object to everything. I just \ndescribed: Senate GOP still saying no. Democrats need to know when \nbills are coming up, we are going to extend the debate as long as we \ncan--on and on and on.\n  How about just picking out one or two little issues--one or two \nissues--that would advance the country's interests and say: Do you know \nwhat, on this issue we will just park the politics at home. We have to \nleave the politics back in the office. We will come to the floor and \nsay: What is good for the country?\n  I will tell you what is good for the country here on this issue; that \nis, in a very troubled world, where a lot of people have looked askance \nat this country and we have gotten some bad reputation around here and \nthere--and some bad information about America--I will tell you what is \ngood: to have people come to this country and just be around for a bit \nand experience this great country of ours and understand when they hit \nour shores this is a citadel of freedom. You can do everything you \nwant.\n  This is an unbelievable place, and we need people in the world to \nunderstand it and to understand especially this: You are welcome to \ncome here. We want you here. We want you to come and see and sample and \nunderstand what America is about. That is what this bill is. If we \ncannot even agree on that, how on Earth will we agree on the big issues \nof the day?\n  We will have a cloture vote at 5:30. My guess is, the minority will \nsay: We believe this vote needs to be a leadership vote. All of you \nhave to vote against cloture because we haven't offered the first \namendment. Do you know why you have not offered the first amendment? \nBecause you would not agree on anything. We tried Thursday. We tried \nFriday. You would not agree on anything. We agreed on all your \namendments, and you would not agree on a thing. So here we are--I and\n\n[[Page S6873]]\n\nmy Democratic and Republican cosponsors on this bill we have worked on \nnow for 2 years--coming now to a cloture vote in which some will say to \nothers: You can't vote for cloture because we haven't had any \namendments.\n  I hope perhaps between now--10 to 4 o'clock--and 5:30, if there are \nwell-meaning people in this Chamber who really wish to make progress \nfor our country, we could have an agreement on amendments and then just \ngo forward. Let's do that.\n  I was there when Senator Reid said to the minority leader: Look, \nlet's just at least start. We do not have to have a whole list of all \nthe amendments. Let's just start. If you want the first five \namendments--whatever it is you want--bring them on. We will have the \namendments. And we will give you three of ours. Let's just start the \nprocess.\n  We could not even get that done Thursday and Friday.\n  The American people deserve better than that from all of us. They \ndeserve a Senate that works. And if the Senate cannot work on \nbipartisan legislation dealing with tourism, can you name a subject \nwhere it will work?\n  My hope is that in the next hour and a half, perhaps some will come \nto the floor who have the interest and the ability to reach an \nagreement, so we can begin the amendment process and finish the bill \nthis week. We can do that. We should not defeat this cloture motion. In \nfact, we should vitiate the motion--if we could get the leadership of \nthe other side to come to the floor and say: We agree with what you \nproposed last week.\n  Let's start. Let's start now. Let's have some amendments tonight and \nhave some votes. We can do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                     Colombia Free Trade Agreement\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, next week President Uribe of Colombia will be \nmeeting with President Obama at the White House. I hope this meeting \nwill serve as an opportunity to get the Colombia Free Trade Agreement \nback on track.\n  I support the Colombia Free Trade Agreement because of its importance \nto Colombia but also because I think it is important for U.S. firms to \ngain access to the markets of fast-growing developing nations abroad. \nOur economy will revive only if we create jobs. Enacting this Colombia \nFree Trade Agreement will help to do that.\n  America's two-way trade with Colombia reached $18 billion in 2007, \nmaking Colombia our fourth largest trading partner in Latin America and \nour largest export market for U.S. agricultural products in South \nAmerica.\n  Exports are the only major sector of the private economy actually \nmaking positive contributions to U.S. economic growth. In my own State \nof Arizona, nearly 80 percent of all of our manufactured goods were \nexported. On average, net exports added more than 1 percentage point \noverall to our economic growth last year, in part offsetting the \nnegative consequences of the housing downturn. So if U.S. manufacturers \nand farmers were not able to sell their products abroad, the current \neconomic downturn would be much worse.\n  Enacting the Colombia Free Trade Agreement would help more than \n10,000 U.S. companies that export to Colombia, 8,500 of which are small \nand medium-sized firms, by opening a significant new export market.\n  America's market is already open to imports from Colombia. In 2008, \nfor example, over 90 percent of U.S. imports from Colombia entered the \nUnited States duty free under our most-favored-nation tariff rates and \nvarious preference programs, such as the Andean Trade Preference Act \nand the Generalized System of Preferences. However, more than 97 \npercent of U.S. exports to Colombia are subject to duties that range \nfrom 14 to 50 percent. Once the agreement is approved, over 80 percent \nof U.S. consumer and industrial exports to Colombia will enter duty \nfree. So each day Congress does not approve the Colombia free-trade \ndeal, the U.S. exporters pay $2 million in unnecessary tariffs.\n  Let me review very briefly the events of the past 2 years to \nunderstand the current state of affairs.\n  On May 10, 2007, Democrats and Republicans agreed to a framework that \nmodifies future trade agreements to include provisions improving labor \nand environmental standards in order to move the Peru, Colombia, and \nSouth Korea free-trade agreements.\n  After the Peru Trade Promotion Agreement was signed into law in \nDecember 2007, Democrats broke the deal with us in order to extract \nmore concessions. This time, they said that in exchange for passing the \nColombia Free Trade Agreement, the Bush administration would need to \naccept an expansion of TAA benefits by increasing the refundability of \nthe health care tax credit from 65 to 80 percent, expanding the TAA \neligibility to service workers, and doubling the mandatory funding for \nworker retraining from $220 to $440 million.\n  When the Bush administration tried to jump-start the process last \nyear by introducing the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, Speaker Pelosi \nresponded by unilaterally rescinding Colombia's fast-track authority, \nessentially killing any chance of moving the agreement.\n\n  We missed another opportunity to enact the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement on the stimulus bill. Although the majority did find room to \nenact a multibillion-dollar trade adjustment assistance expansion--that \nis what T-A-A stands for--which was considered a prerequisite to any \nadditional free-trade agreement, now that it is the law, we are not \nmoving forward on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.\n  Interestingly, the President's budget would permanently extend trade \nadjustment assistance at a cost of $4.6 billion over 10 years. But it \ndoes not include one dollar to implement any of the pending trade \nagreements such as those with Colombia, Panama, or South Korea.\n  I urge my colleagues to use President Uribe's visit as an opportunity \nto move forward and renew this Nation's commitment to trade not only to \nassist an important American ally that needs our help but to enact a \ntrue stimulus bill that will promote American manufacturing exports and \ncreate badly needed jobs. I ask that we get our staffs to begin working \ntogether to develop a plan to ensure passage of the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement.\n  Finally, let me respond briefly to Democrats' charges that Colombia \nhas not done enough to protect human rights. The Colombian Government \nhas demobilized and brought to justice over 31,000 members from 35 \nparamilitary groups, principally from the AUC or the United Self-\nDefense Forces of Colombia. In addition, more than 10,500 members of \nthe far-left insurgent groups FARC, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \nColombia, and ELN, which is the National Liberation Army, have chosen \nto demobilize, individually leaving their units and turning themselves \nin to Colombian authorities. The Colombian Government is also providing \nprotection to over 10,600 individuals. The largest protection program \nis run by the Ministry of Interior and Justice and provides protection \nto more than 9,400 individuals, including 1,900 trade union members. Of \nthe program's $39.5 million budget, one-third--over $13 million--goes \nto protect trade unionists. As a result, President Uribe has improved \nthe security situation in Colombia dramatically. Kidnappings are down \nby 83 percent, terror attacks are down by 76 percent, homicides have \ndecreased by 40 percent, and homicides against trade unionists have \ndropped by twice as much--over 80 percent.\n  This is important progress by the Government of Colombia. It is an \nimportant ally of the United States. It deserves our support. And, as \nimportantly, exporters in the United States deserve congressional \nsupport, enabling them to export their products without the kinds of \nbarriers that currently exist.\n  The trade agreement is in our best interest, and I hope my colleagues \nwill insist that very soon we get the Colombia Free Trade Agreement \nback on track so this important legislation can pass the Congress, be \nsigned into law, and begin to help our economy generate jobs and \nstimulate economic growth. It is an important agreement that has \nlanguished far too long, and we need to get it moving again.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as the debate over health care reform \ncontinues, a number of different approaches have now emerged. But one \nthing unites us: All of us agree health care reform is needed. The \nquestion is, what kind of reform--a reform that cuts costs and expands \naccess or a so-called reform that leads to a government takeover where \npremiums are increased but health care is delayed, denied, and \nrationed? The American people want reform, but they want reform that \nallows them to keep their current insurance while preserving the \nfreedoms, choices, and quality of care they now enjoy. That is why \nRepublicans have proposed a series of reforms to lower costs and \nimprove access, without--without--destroying what people like about our \ncurrent health care system.\n  As it turns out, President Obama has said he is open to some of the \nideas Republicans have put forward, such as the need to reform our \nmedical liability laws to discourage junk lawsuits and the need to \nencourage wellness and prevention programs that have proven to be \neffective in cutting costs and improving care. In fact, during a speech \nlast week to the American Medical Association, the President discussed \none particular wellness and prevention program at the Safeway \nsupermarket chain, which has dramatically cut that company's health \ncare costs and employee premiums. The President even said he would be \nopen to helping businesses across the Nation adopt wellness and \nprevention programs such as the Safeway plan. Yet the bill the \nDemocrats are trying to rush through the Senate would actually ban this \nprogram from being copied and implemented by other companies. That \nmakes absolutely no sense.\n\n  All last week, we heard eye-popping cost estimates for health care \nproposals coming out of Capitol Hill--proposals that wouldn't even \nsolve the entire problem but would bury us deeper and deeper in debt. \nIf the goal is to decrease costs, why wouldn't Democrats in Congress \nsupport a plan we know has been effective in doing so--especially if \nthe President himself supports it? One would think this would be an \neasy bipartisan feature of any Democratic plan.\n  According to Safeway CEO Steve Burd, Safeway's per capita health care \ncosts have remained flat even as the per capita health care costs of \nmost American companies have increased by nearly 30 percent since \nSafeway implemented its wellness and prevention plan back in 2005.\n  Safeway's plan has also reduced the health care costs for employees \nand their families by offering incentives for workers who adopt \nhealthier lifestyles. Those employees who choose to participate in the \nplan are tested for tobacco usage, for a healthy weight, and for their \nblood pressure and cholesterol levels. Employees who pass these tests \nare given discounts on their premiums.\n  For example, if employees pass all four tests, their annual premiums \nare reduced by $780 for individuals and $1,560 for families. If \nemployees miss their goals the first time, the company provides support \nfor improvement and financial incentives for those who make progress.\n  All of this makes health care more affordable, and it also helps to \nimprove the health and quality of life of Safeway's workers. The \ncompany's obesity and smoking rates are now about 70 percent of the \nnational average, and employees like the plan so much that 76 percent \nof them want more incentives that reward healthy behavior.\n  Safeway executives estimate if the United States had adopted its \napproach in 2005--4 years ago--the country's direct health care bill \nwould be $550 billion less than it is now--if we had simply adopted the \nSafeway approach 4 years ago.\n  The Safeway program has proven so successful that the company wants \nto increase its incentives for rewarding healthy behavior. \nUnfortunately, current laws restrict it from doing so, but instead of \noffering legislation that corrects the problem, the so-called reform \nbill being pushed through the HELP Committee would do the opposite. It \nwould actually prohibit companies from implementing the Safeway \nprogram.\n  Let me repeat that: The bill that is currently being pushed through \nthe HELP Committee doesn't let companies consider an employee's health \nstatus when providing insurance--meaning employers would be banned from \nrewarding healthy behavior as Safeway does and offering lower premiums \nto workers who manage their chronic diseases, eliminate high-risk \nbehaviors such as smoking, or lose weight. In other words, it would \nprohibit companies from implementing programs that have been proven to \ncut health care costs. I thought that was the point of health care \nreform.\n  When it comes to making health care more affordable, we should all \nsupport ideas that work. Americans want health care ideas that cut \ncosts and improve care. The Safeway model is an excellent place to \nstart. The President supports it, Republicans support it, and Safeway's \nexperience has shown that it works. If Democrats in Congress are \nserious about making health care more affordable, they should support \nit too. Instead of the rush-and-spend approach that has led to a \nchaotic process and hugely expensive health care proposals that don't \neven address the whole problem, Democrats should slow down and consider \nideas that have been shown to not only be effective in delivering care \nbut also effective in reducing costs.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in about an hour, we will be asked to \nvote on whether the Senate can continue to do what the Senate is \nsupposed to do and that is to amend and debate. When I ran for the \nSenate, the people of Tennessee sent me up here to represent them. They \nexpected that when I got here, I would have a chance to say what I had \nto say on their behalf, and sometimes what I think may not be so \nimportant but what they think is important. The people of Tennessee \nknow the history of the Senate--as Senator Byrd has so often said--is \ndistinguished only by a couple things. One is virtually an unlimited \nright to amend, and another is a virtually unlimited right to debate.\n  What is going to happen at 5:30 is we are going to be asked to vote \nto cut off amendments and cut off debate. A vote of yes will be a vote \nto obstruct our right to amend, obstruct our right to debate and to \nmake it impossible for me to represent the people of Tennessee, who \nvoted for me with the idea that I might be able to do that.\n  Let me explain a little more what I mean by that. A great many people \nwrite books about America, but unquestionably I think the best regarded \nsuch book is a book by Alexis de Tocqueville, entitled ``Democracy in \nAmerica.'' When the young Frenchman came to this country, he ran across \nDavy Crockett and all sorts of people. When he wrote about what he \nthought might be, in the long term, the greatest danger to the American \ndemocracy, he said he thought it might be the ``tyranny of the \nmajority.'' He was afraid that in our type of system, what might happen \nis that the majority would get control and run over the minority.\n  The Senate was one of the institutions created to avoid that. So when \nwe get a situation where we have only 40 or 41 Republican Senators and \n57 or 58 or 56 or more Democratic Senators, the minority always has a \nright to make sure there is no tyranny of the majority. It has been the \nother way and it will be again; when I first came here the Republicans \nheld the majority, and we had 55 Republicans at one point. So a vote of \nyes at 5:30 is a vote to obstruct the right of Senators to represent \nthe people who hired them to come and offer amendments and speak for \nthem.\n  Ironically, this vote will give the majority the right to suppress a \nmajority view--because what is the issue that is attempting to be \nsuppressed? The issue is whether we ought to get the government in \nWashington out of the automobile business. I think most people in\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\nthe country are thinking we are having too many Washington takeovers. \nThat is not the American way. We know we have had trouble in this \ncountry economically, but taking over banks, insurance companies, \nstudent loans, car companies, and now maybe taking over health care--\nthe American people don't like that.\n  We have a series of amendments to be offered--both Republican and \nsome with bipartisan support--which would say: Let's get the government \nout of the automobile business and put it back in the hands of the \nAmerican people and the free enterprise system of America. That is a \nmajority view in this country.\n  According to an AutoPacific Survey in the Nashville Tennessean, 81 \npercent of Americans polled agree that the faster the government gets \nout of the automotive business the better; 95 percent disagreed that \nthe government is a good overseer of corporations, such as General \nMotors and Chrysler; 93 percent disagree that having the government in \ncharge of General Motors and Chrysler will result in cars and trucks \nAmericans want to buy. Most Americans don't want a car that a United \nStates Senator engineered, designed, and sold. That is not what we are \nhere for. They know better than that.\n  According to a Rasmussen Poll of June 13 and 14, 80 percent of those \npolled believe the government should sell the government stake in the \nauto companies to private investors ``as soon as possible.'' And 71 \npercent of those polled believe the government should sell their stake \nto private investors as soon as possible.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal on June 18, nearly 70 percent of \nthose surveyed said they had concerns about Federal intervention into \nthe economy, including the President's decision to take an ownership \ninterest in General Motors, put limits on executive compensation, and \nthe prospect of more government involvement in health care. We have a \nsituation where the President is calling the mayor of Detroit to get \ninto the question of whether the headquarters of General Motors is \ngoing to be there or in Warren, MI. We have the chairman of the House \nbailout committee--the House Financial Services Committee--calling the \npresident of General Motors saying: Don't close the warehouse in my \ndistrict. And all of us in Congress are saying: Please build a car in \nmy district. We will have some Congressmen saying: Don't buy a battery \nfrom South Korea; buy one made in my district. We have automobile \ncompany executives driving to Washington in their congressionally \napproved hybrid cars to spend 4 hours testifying and then drive home. \nHow many cars do they design, build, and make while doing this? The \nAmerican people know the car companies cannot compete if they have 435 \ncongressional political meddlers, 100 senators, plus a whole \nadministration, trying to tell them how to compete in a very complex \nbusiness.\n  Senator Bennett of Utah and I, cosponsored by the Republican leader, \nSenator Kyl, and others, have a bill called the Auto Stock for Every \nTaxpayer Act. We would like to offer it as an amendment this week and \nget a vote on it. The Auto Stock for every Taxpayer amendment would say \nthat the Treasury can't use any more TARP funds to bail out General \nMotors or Chrysler. Also, while the government owns stock in these \ncompanies, the Secretary of the Treasury, or his designee, has a \nfiduciary responsibility to the taxpayer to maximize returns on that \ninvestment. And most importantly, our amendment says that within a year \nafter General Motors comes out of bankruptcy, the government should \ndistribute its stock to the 120 million Americans who pay taxes on \nApril 15.\n\n  In other words, let's have a big stock distribution, the same way \nProcter & Gamble did when it distributed stock in Clorox or the same \nway other companies do every year. We have a core business, the car \ncompany, that has nothing to do with the owner, the United States \ngovernment, and we should give the car company to the owners--the 120 \nmillion people who pay taxes. That is what we should do. And the \nrationale is: I paid for it, I should own it. That is the first \namendment we want to offer.\n  Senator Corker, with a couple of cosponsors, including Senator Warner \nfrom the other side of the aisle, has another idea, which I am glad to \nsupport. It is a little different approach to the same idea. He would \ncreate a limited-liability corporation to manage the government \nownership stake in companies in which the government owns at least 20 \npercent. By the fall of this year that will probably include AIG, \nCitigroup, and General Motors. The government's assets would be placed \nin a trust and managed by three independent, nonpolitical trustees. The \ntrustees would have to liquidate the government's interest by December \n24, 2011. And there is a waiver process in case the trustees think \nthere is a problem with that deadline.\n  That is a responsible, interesting approach. Why shouldn't Senator \nCorker and Senator Warner have a chance to offer that amendment? That \nis what the majority of people in America would like to see done.\n  Senator Johanns, a distinguished former Governor of Nebraska, has his \nFree Enterprise Act of 2009. He has 29 cosponsors. He would like to \nrequire congressional approval before the Federal Government can use \nTARP funds to acquire ownership of an entity through stock.\n  Senator Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, has the \nGovernment Ownership Exit Plan Act of 2009. He would require the \nTreasury to sell any ownership of a private entity by July 1, 2010, and \nprohibit the government from acquiring any additional ownership stake \nin private companies.\n  Well, I think you can get the drift, Madam President. We have a \nnumber of Senators, mostly from this side but some cosponsored from the \nother side, who say that the American people are tired of Washington \ntakeovers. They know cars aren't going to get better in this country if \nthe government is meddling with them and designing them and building \nthem and making them. I can just imagine what we will have if we \nmeddle. We will have a purple polka dot car that gets 50 miles per \ngallon and will have a windmill on top and a solar panel on the side, \nand it will have this part made in this Congressman's district and that \npart made in that Senator's State, and it probably won't run 5 miles. \nThen we will lower the price to get people to buy it, all the while \nlosing money, losing competition, and putting real competitors out of \nbusiness. And then we will have no American automobile industry left. \nSo we need to get the government out of the car business and stop the \nWashington takeover. And over 80 percent of the American people agree.\n  So what are we doing in the Senate? We are going to vote at 5:30 to \nsay: No, Senators. No, Senator Corker. No, Senator Warner. No, Senator \nAlexander. No, Senator Bennett. We are going to say no to the other \nSenators, you can't continue to debate. You can't continue to offer \nyour amendments. We are going to obstruct your right to do that. We are \ngoing to keep you from representing the people of Tennessee, the people \nof Utah, or the other people you were sent here to represent. We are \ngoing to stop the debate; stop the amendment.\n  That is the tyranny of the majority that Alexis de Tocqueville \nenvisioned. That is not the way the Senate has been running this year. \nThis year in the Senate, Senator Reid has made a good-faith effort, and \nRepublican Senators appreciate that, in saying we are going to have \nsome amendments. That means we are going to have some amendments \noffered on which some of us don't really want to vote. There have been \nsome amendments I really didn't want to vote on, including some offered \nby people on my side of the aisle, but that is what we do in the \nSenate. So why are we doing this? Why are we saying suddenly, no \namendments?\n  So I would hope Senators would agree that at 5:30 we should vote no. \nWe should vote no. And by voting no, we would be saying: Let's continue \nto debate. Let's continue to amend. A vote yes is a vote to obstruct. A \nvote no is to continue to debate and continue to amend. And the issue \nis, shall we take the government ownership of automobile companies and \nput it, as soon as it is practicable, back in the hands of the American \npeople, where it belongs, in our free enterprise system? That is the \nAmerican way.\n  We have at least four different options. We have a whole menu here. \nIf you don't like the Alexander-Bennet\n\n[[Page S6876]]\n\namendment, vote for the Corker amendment. If you don't like that, vote \nfor one of the other amendments. We have four ways to go about it, all \ncarefully thought out, all in front of everybody. Why don't we do that? \nThat is what the Senate does.\n  So I prefer the way the Senate has operated pretty much all the time, \nup to today, which is to say: Senators, offer your amendments, take \nyour votes. Today is an aberration -a change away from the way the \nSenate should function. My old friend, the late Alex Haley, author of \nRoots, used to say: Find the good and praise it. Well, I can find \nplenty of good in the way the majority leader has conducted the Senate \nthis year by allowing debate and amendments. I would consider this an \naberration.\n  I hope we will vote to continue to amend, to continue to debate, and \nget the Senate back to the practice we had most of this year, which is \nto say: If you have an amendment, Senator, bring it on over, call it \nup, and we will vote on it, and then we will go on to the next thing.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article from the American Spectator entitled ``Are There \nObamashares in Your Future?''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Are There Obamashares in Your Future?\n\n                          (By Peter Hannaford)\n\n       As they were steering General Motors into bankruptcy at \n     early this month, the President Goodwrench team arranged for \n     the United Auto Workers' pension fund to get 30 percent of \n     the stock when the ``new'' company comes out at the other \n     end. Bond holders will get 10 percent and the U.S. Government \n     will keep 60 percent for itself.\n       If the ``new'' GM becomes profitable it may eventually pay \n     back the $50 billion the government has advanced to it, but \n     the term ``government ownership'' lacks the ring of \n     legitimacy that ``taxpayer ownership'' has.\n       U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-T) wants to do something \n     about that. He is the lead sponsor for the Auto Stock for \n     Every Taxpayer bill which would distribute the government's \n     stock in GM (and Chrysler, too) to the 120 million Americans \n     who paid income taxes on April 15. He says, ``That is the \n     fastest way to get ownership of the auto companies out of the \n     hands of meddling Washington politicians and back into the \n     hands of Americans in the market place.''\n       This is no voice in the wilderness. A recent AutoPacific \n     poll reports that 81 percent of Americans agreed that ``the \n     faster the government gets out of the automotive business, \n     the better.'' Conversely, 95 percent of those polled \n     disagreed with the statement, ``. . . the government is a \n     good overseer of corporations such as General Motors and \n     Chrysler.'' And 93 percent disagreed that ``having the \n     government in charge [of the two automakers] will result in \n     cars and trucks that Americans will want to buy.'' So much \n     for the flimsy cars with which President Goodwrench wants to \n     fill the market.\n       To make sure his proposal to put automaker stock in the \n     hands of actual taxpayers gets the attention it deserves, \n     Sen. Alexander the other day began a program to draw \n     attention to the downsides of Washington management of auto \n     companies. He introduced on the floor of the Senate his ``Car \n     Czar'' awards. As he put it, ``It's a service to taxpayers \n     from America's new automotive headquarters, Washington, \n     D.C.''\n       The Car Czar awards, he adds, ``. . . will be conferred on \n     Washington meddlers who make it harder for the auto companies \n     your government owns to compete in the world marketplace.'' \n     The first award went to Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) ``for \n     interfering in the operation of General Motors.''\n       Rep. Frank is Chairman of the House Financial Services \n     Committee, well known for his oft-denied roll in pressuring \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to push banks to make risky home \n     loans.\n       Two weeks ago, it turns out, Mr. Frank learned that General \n     Motors, as part of its restructuring plan, would close a \n     parts distribution warehouse in Norton, Massachusetts by \n     year's end. Despite the President Goodwrench team's constant \n     pressing of GM to cut more and more, anything in Barney \n     Frank's district is out of bounds if he has anything to say \n     about it, and he did. He put in a call to GM CEO Frederick \n     ``Fritz'' Henderson and--voila--the Norton warehouse was \n     saved. This warehouse has 90 employees. We can assume that \n     they and their spouses will show their gratitude to Mr. Frank \n     at the polls in November next year. That's 180 votes. He \n     should really think in larger terms. If he were to sponsor a \n     House version of Sen. Alexander's Auto Stock for Every \n     Taxpayer legislation, think of the thousands of grateful \n     citizens in his district who would support him. Indeed, they \n     might even demand that the local federal building be named \n     after him.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. I don't know how the vote will come out at 5:30 today, \nbut I do know it is almost unanimous--perhaps it is unanimous on this \nside and the other side of the aisle--that we all want the auto \nindustry to return wholly to the private sector; that this was an \nextraordinary situation.\n  I represent, as the Senator from Tennessee represents, a lot of \nautoworkers--in his case, union and nonunion alike. I have a good many \nnonunion autoworkers in my State--union and nonunion alike--and I think \nall those companies--certainly GM and Chrysler workers and people in \nthe community--want this industry back on its feet and want it run by \nthe private investors, as it should be.\n\n\n                             Cuyahoga River\n\n  Madam President, today marks the 40th anniversary the Cuyahoga River \nin Cleveland burned. The June 22, 1969, fire wasn't the first or the \nbiggest on the Cuyahoga or in rivers all over the country in those days \nwhen rivers were full of chemicals and all kinds of discharge that \ncould catch fire from a spark from a railroad train passing through or \nfrom something else passing over the river. But 40 years ago, that fire \nin the Cuyahoga River was a catalyst that helped create the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and then the landmark Clean Water Act. \nThe fire helped push the government to recognized its responsibility to \nsafeguard our environment. When the EPA was established in July of \n1970--as I said, in large part the impetus came from that fire on the \nCuyahoga in 1969--it marked a sustained effort by citizens to demand \nthat their government protect our health and sustain our environment. \nLike so many times throughout our Nation's history, citizen activism \nserved as a vehicle for change.\n  Prior to that fire in 1969--I was born in 1952--I remember as a small \nchild and as a teenager going 60 miles north of where I grew up to the \nshores of Lake Erie and seeing dead fish along the lake and seeing what \nwas left of a wonderful living lake--one of the Great Lakes. The \ngreatest natural resources of this country are the five Great Lakes. I \nremember seeing the pollution and the damage that came from the \neffluent that human beings, that individuals and farmers and industry \ndumped into that lake and its rivers over many, many years.\n  Galvanized by Rachel Carson's 1962 ``Silent Spring,'' the \nenvironmental movement engaged the public and educated elected \nofficials and industry leaders about threats to human safety and \nenvironmental sustainability. That citizen call to action spurred \ndecades worth of environmental laws that have improved our quality of \nlife and improved the health of our Nation's streams, lakes, and \nrivers.\n  When the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, only about 30 percent of \nthe Nation's waters were safe for fishing and swimming. Think about \nthat. In 1972, fewer than a third of the Nation's waters were safe for \nfishing and swimming. Two decades later, the EPA reported that 56 \npercent of rivers and lakes meet safety standards--much progress but \nclearly not nearly enough.\n  As a result of the Clean Water Act, thousands of communities around \nthe Nation benefit from wastewater treatment plants, improved habitats, \nincreased fish stocks, and safer recreational waters. Just as the \nhealth of our Nation's water has improved, so too has the river in my \ncommunity--the Cuyahoga River.\n  The Cuyahoga, which is a Native-American word meaning ``crooked \nriver,'' winds through northeast Ohio. In fact, when you land at the \nCleveland airport, you can see the river winding its way right through \ndowntown Cleveland. So there are banks of the river through several \nmiles as it goes into Cuyahoga County. It ultimately flows into Lake \nErie in the city of Cleveland.\n  When scientists began studying the fish populations of the Cuyahoga, \nthey found that only a few species were able to survive in the polluted \nwaters. Many\n\n[[Page S6877]]\n\nof the fish that remained were deformed. But after years of hard work \nby the Cuyahoga River Community Planning Organization, by citizens, by \nindustry leaders, and by government agencies, more than 60 different \nfishes species can now be found in the river.\n  That tells you what the efforts of government can do. It took more \nthan a few activists in the city of Cleveland, it took more than the \nCleveland city health department, it took more than the Cuyahoga County \nhealth department, it took more than the State EPA, it took a strong \nnational government and the Environmental Protection Agency--created, \nif you remember, during the Presidency of Richard Nixon, with a \nDemocratic Congress. Ultimately, the creation of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, giving the Federal Government the ability to come \nin, when necessary, and mandate that local officials and local industry \ndo what is needed to clean the water, to clean the air, is a lesson we \nshould all learn.\n  Today, as one of only 14 American Heritage Rivers, the Cuyahoga flows \nthrough the Cuyahoga National Park where bald eagles now nest. \nThroughout Ohio--something you would never have thought of happening 30 \nyears ago--our clean and abundant water supplies, such as the Cuyahoga, \nare critical to farming, clean energy development, and to regional \neconomic competitiveness. Water-related recreation and tourism provide \njobs and billions of dollars in revenues for communities and cities \nsuch as Lorain, cities in Lake County, cities such as my wife's \nhometown of Ashtabula, and cities such as Toledo.\n  Wildlife depends on clean water and on healthy wetlands. The Cuyahoga \nwill not burn anytime soon, but that doesn't really mean the hard work \nis complete. We must continue to protect our wetlands and our streams, \nto bolster our fisheries, to increase habitat restoration and \nrecreational opportunities throughout the Great Lakes. It will mean the \nFederal Government will need to provide hundreds of millions of dollars \nof assistance for all five of the Great Lakes. It will mean billions of \ndollars of investment around the Great Lakes in recreation and fishing \nand in economic development and in safe drinking water. These efforts \ninclude reducing the number of combined sewage overflows into our \nwaterways and removing the toxic sediments that were dumped in the \nrivers leading to the Great Lakes--the Maumee, the Cuyahoga, the \nAshtabula, and others--before the Clean Water Act.\n  After years of hard work, the continuing restoration of the Cuyahoga \nis a symbol of progress and a symbol of success. The community \nrestoration effort on the Cuyahoga is an indication of the undeniable \nimportance of the EPA and the Clean Water Act. It is a testament to \nwhat can be accomplished when citizens and government join to tackle a \nproblem.\n  In the communities that make up the Cuyahoga River watershed--among \nthem Beachwood, Hudson, Euclid, Akron, and Barberton--2009 is the year \nof the Cuyahoga. But there is no reason we shouldn't dedicate every day \nto cleaner water in a more sustainable environment.\n  I commend the thousands of citizens who for more than 40 years worked \nto make the Cuyahoga a source of pride for our communities. Their \ncollective efforts made their government recognize its role in \nprotecting our health and preserving our environment. I am confident \nthat 40 years from now, my grandchildren and generations of Ohioans \nwill enjoy the clean waters of the Cuyahoga River and of Lake Erie.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today to draw attention to our \nefforts on the Tourism Promotion Act of 2009 and, specifically, to \nfocus on my small State of Delaware.\n  Coming to Delaware, the ``First State,'' one is treated to a myriad \nrange of great tourist attractions from arts and culture, to sports and \ngaming, from marvelous recreation to dozens of fairs and festivals.\n  In the area of arts and culture, Delaware boasts such notable stops \nas the Nemours Gardens and mansion, the home of Alfred I. DuPont and \nthe now world famous DuPont Children's Hospital.\n  Visitors can also tour the beautiful Bellevue State Park, the \nDelaware Art Museum, or even see a show at the DuPont Theater at the \nHotel DuPont in Wilmington.\n  The State of Delaware, the first State to ratify the Constitution, \nalso has significant historical sites for tourists to enjoy.\n  Visitors can view the birthplace of the DuPont Company at Delaware's \nHagley Museum and Gardens. The luxurious, 100-room home of Henry \nFrancis DuPont is also open to the public at Winterthur Museums and \nGardens.\n  Since Delaware was one of the original 13 colonies, we are proud to \nboast several pre-Revolutionary War historical sites. The Amstel House \nand the John Dickinson Mansion and Plantation can offer visitors a rare \ninsight into life before the Revolution.\n  Our Constitution Park offers a tribute to our ratification of the \nConstitution, made even more significant by the fact that Delaware was \nthe first State to do so.\n  Civil War buffs can visit Fort Delaware, where Confederate prisoners \nof war were interned, while those interested in more contemporary \nmilitary history can visit the Dover Air Force Base's Air Mobility \nCommand Museum.\n  Delaware's sports and gaming opportunities are nearly limitless.\n  The Dover Downs Hotel and Casino combines luxury and entertainment \nfor its guests. The Delaware Park Race Track also offers excitement for \nits customers with slots and horse racing.\n  NASCAR fans will love the Dover International Speedway, the famous \n``Monster Mile,'' where official NASCAR races are held several times \neach year.\n  Delaware may not boast any Major League sports teams but we are very \nproud of our Minor League baseball team, the Wilmington Blue Rocks.\n  Our Blue Rocks fans are some of the most loyal in the country and a \nnight out to watch them play promises fun for the entire family. For \ngolf enthusiasts who do not want to lose their skills while on \nvacation, Delaware has excellent golf courses where strokes can be \nrefined and perfected.\n  Delaware's outdoor attractions are also world class. Killen's Pond, a \nState park since 1965, features a beautiful 66-acre millpond where \nvisitors can enjoy boating and fishing.\n  Delaware's greatest strength in the outdoors realm, however, is our \nbeautiful beaches. These beaches stretch for miles and offer ample \nopportunity for fun on the shore and ocean. If you get enough of sand \nand surf, the boardwalk presents a wide variety of shops, restaurants, \nand entertainment to visitors. Some of Delaware's best, and tax-free, \nshopping can be found on the boardwalk.\n  Our various fairs help celebrate who we are as Delawareans and also \noffer entertainment.\n  The Delaware State Fair features concerts, with famous artists \nalongside rising local bands. It also provides a carnival atmosphere \nand numerous agricultural and livestock events.\n  The Saint Anthony's Italian Festival, which Vice President Biden and \nI enjoyed just over a week ago, is a favorite among Delaware residents. \nIts food and entertainment always draws large crowds, and it is \nactually one of the largest ethnic festivals on the east coast.\n  Other ethnic festivals that Delaware celebrates include an African-\nAmerican festival, an Indian festival, and a Greek festival, and many \nmore.\n  In other words, something for just about everyone.\n  Those who enjoy theatrics can come to Delaware's Shakespeare \nFestival, where talented actors show their appreciation for Shakespeare \nby performing various scenes from his many plays.\n  The Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival offers movie lovers a \nchance to view excellent films that they wouldn't get a chance to see \nin theaters.\n  Delaware also boasts six wineries, including the award winning Nassau \nValley, where visitors can enjoy excellent wine in a pleasant \natmosphere.\n  So you can see Delaware is truly a place where folks from all across \nthe country can come for fun and excitement in a ``small but \nplentiful'' tourist haven.\n  And I know that Delaware is not alone. All 50 States, and all the \nterritories, offer something special, and I\n\n[[Page S6878]]\n\nbelieve we should do everything we can to spread that message.\n  That is why I am glad to be a cosponsor of the Tourism Promotion Act. \nObviously, I hope it will help remind people across the world what \nDelaware can offer, but I believe it will help promote travel across \nthe country.\n  We have heard the statistics. International travel is booming, 48 \nmillion more international trips last year than in 2000 but the United \nStates is not sharing in that bounty. In fact, we lost travelers over \nthat same time period.\n  An estimate I saw says that if we had merely kept pace with the \nexpansion of international travel, we would have seen 58 million more \ntravelers since 2000. That would mean nearly 250,000 more jobs.\n  In today's economy, we could sure use that help.\n  However, I cannot leave the floor without commenting on another great \nState for tourism; that is, the State of the Presiding Officer, the \nState of North Carolina. I spent this weekend in North Carolina. I \nencourage North Carolina to anyone who is looking for a wonderful place \nto go for a vacation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, at 5:30 we will be having a cloture \nvote, and the cloture vote deals with the underlying legislation called \nthe Travel Promotion Act. As I said earlier this afternoon, if the \nCongress cannot agree on something such as tourism, what is to become \nof the issues of health care, energy, climate change or so many other \nsignificant controversial issues that come before us?\n  This underlying bill is very simple. It is bipartisan. Over 50 \nMembers of the Senate have cosponsored this bill in the last Congress. \nIt actually reduces the Federal budget deficit by close to a half \nbillion dollars. As I indicated, it should bear no controversy at all. \nIt is simply the development of a public-private partnership that would \nbegin to market our country, as most other countries are doing, in \norder to attract destination international tourism to our country.\n  All the other countries are doing this. If you watched the golf \ntournament today--the U.S. Open--in the middle of the golf tournament, \nthey broke to a commercial. It was the country of Turkey saying: Come \nto Turkey. Come and visit the wonders of Turkey.\n  Well, good for Turkey. They are out trying to promote international \ntourism. But the same is true with France and Italy and Japan and India \nand Great Britain--so many other countries.\n  Why are they doing that? They are doing it because it is unbelievably \njob creating to have international tourism come to your country. On \naverage, an international tourist spends about $4,500 on hotels and \ncars and tourist attractions and food. So it is unbelievably job \ncreating and boosting to the economy of the host country.\n  But even more important than that, our country needs to do this. From \n2000 to 2008, we now have 633,000 fewer visitors per year from overseas \nthan we had 8 years ago.\n  Why is that the case? It is because some people believe we do not \nwant them to visit our country. Quite the opposite is true. So we \nsuggest, rather than to keep losing economic opportunities from \ninternational tourism, let's at least join the discussion and get in \nthe game by promoting tourism to our country as a destination for \ninternational tourism. Let's at least get in the game.\n  So our bill creates this public-private partnership and establishes \nthe capability to begin promoting our country. Why is that important? \nWell, obviously economic development and jobs. But even more important, \nat a time when there has been so much controversy about our country and \nactions abroad, and so on, to invite people to our country and have \nthem come here and visit this country is to have them leave with a \nwonderful impression about the United States of America. There just is \nnot any way to visit our country and leave with a bad attitude about \nwhat the United States is and what it means.\n  This is a great place, the greatest democracy in all of history, with \nunbelievable freedoms that many people in the world do not have. But it \nis a wonderful country, full of natural resources and wonderful people. \nTo come here and visit is to leave and believe very positive things \nabout our country. That, it seems to me, makes a lot of sense these \ndays.\n  Madam President, a colleague was on the floor just a bit ago saying, \nwell, he could not vote for cloture at 5:30 because he was not allowed \nto offer his TARP amendment. Of course, TARP has nothing to do with the \nunderlying bill. We said that he could offer the amendment. The rules \nof the Senate allow somebody to offer a TARP amendment. He says, \nhowever, that the majority--that is us--is saying: We are going to \nobstruct your right to amend the bill.\n  This colleague must not have been around last Thursday and Friday \nwhen we were negotiating to try to get an agreement. Their side would \noffer the first five amendments. We said you can offer your first five \namendments. All of them were so-called TARP amendments--the troubled \nasset relief program. Well, TARP amendments--having nothing to do with \ntourism and travel, but that is fine. We said: OK, you can offer that.\n  So how is it somebody comes to the floor of the Senate now and says \nthey are being obstructed? We said: You can offer them. But then what \nthey said was: Well, we want five TARP amendments, and here are your \nthree amendments. One of your three amendments is one by Senator \nSanders that we will not allow you to offer. We object to that.\n  What was the Sanders amendment? It was pretty simple. The Sanders \namendment would require that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nuse existing authority to begin trying to tackle this question of what \nis happening in the runup of oil prices. The Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission has acted like a potted plant for a long time. Oil prices \nwent to $147 a barrel in mid-2008. Yet, the CFTC was explaining to us: \nWell, that is just supply and demand.\n  That is total nonsense--total nonsense. It had nothing to do with \nsupply and demand. It had to do with speculators breaking that oil \nfutures market. So the CFTC did nothing about it.\n  Right now, the supply of oil is up; demand is down; and the price is \ngoing up. Once again, there is something wrong. So the Senator from \nVermont wanted to offer an amendment. So I included it in the list of \nthe amendments we would offer to the Republicans last Thursday and \nFriday, saying: OK, you want to offer five amendments that have nothing \nto do with the bill. That is fine. You can do that. Here are the three \namendments we propose to start with.\n  They said: No, no, no. You cannot offer the Sanders amendment.\n  Wait a second. The minority is going to decide what the majority can \noffer? We have just said to the minority: You can offer your five TARP \namendments that have nothing to do with this bill. That is fine. So now \nwe have somebody coming to the floor this afternoon saying he has to \nvote against cloture because the majority says: We are going to \nobstruct your right to amend? Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  In fact, the decision by the minority has put us in this position. So \napparently we will have people coming to the floor of the Senate with \nthe belief that somebody obstructed their right to amend the bill. But \nthe TARP amendments they proposed were agreed to by us, that we would \nallow them, they were fine to be offered. Everyone thought that was the \ncase. We will have some people come to the floor apparently deciding to \nvote against cloture on this bill because they say somebody obstructed \ntheir right to amend. That is just totally without foundation. It is \nByzantine to me that here we are in the Senate on a piece of \nlegislation called the Travel Promotion Act, which is designed to \npromote tourism, to create jobs and to promote this country's \ninterests. It is\n\n[[Page S6879]]\n\nwidely bipartisan. It has been around now for 2\\1/2\\ years or so, with \nno great controversy I know of. We have before us a bill for which we \nwere required to file cloture and wait 2 days for a cloture vote just \non the motion to proceed to it. Once we got to the motion to proceed, \nwe had a vote--and guess what. Ninety to three we said: Yes, let's \nproceed to it.\n  Then the minority said: And, oh, by the way, no, you can't proceed \nyet because we are going to insist on the 30 hours post-cloture. So you \nhave to wait 30 more hours. Total, complete, thorough delay.\n  So it does not sit well with me for anybody to come here to say that \nsomebody is being obstructed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that unless a \nmember of the minority comes to claim time, that we be allowed to \ncontinue, I be allowed to continue. If a member of the minority does \ncome to the Senate floor, I certainly would relinquish the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it does not wash at all for somebody to \nsuggest somehow they have to vote against cloture because they are \ndenied their right.\n  Over in that aisle, on Thursday, we had a discussion--Senator Reid, \nSenator McConnell, myself, Senator Martinez--and then back and forth in \nthe cloakrooms. We offered amendments back and forth just to get \nstarted on the bill. It was not a final list of amendments. It was just \na way to try to get started. For all five of the amendments proposed to \nbe offered by the minority, we said: Fine, they have nothing to do with \nthe bill, but that is fine. If you want to offer them, offer them. But \ndon't come to the floor on Monday saying the majority is obstructing \nyour right to offer an amendment, which we said you could offer. How do \nyou explain that contradiction?\n  Again, my point: If this Congress cannot even agree on tourism, how \nis it going to agree on anything. How are we going to make progress on \nhealth care? How are we going to make progress on comprehensive energy \nlegislation or climate change or a range of difficult international \nsituations? How are we going to reach some sort of understanding that \nwe represent one interest in this country, and that ought to be the \npublic interest in the United States of America?\n\n  We all work for the same people. Not everything has to be partisan. \nThere is so much rancid partisanship these days. I was with the \nmajority leader when we stood there. I understood what he was saying. \nHe was saying to the minority: Let's get started. If you want \namendments, fine, offer amendments. There was nothing but agreement by \nour majority leader to say to the Republicans, offer some amendments. \nGive us some amendments you want to offer and then go ahead and offer \nthem.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, first, I thank my friend from North \nDakota for his efforts on the very important issue of tourism but also \nfor consistently standing up for consumers who are sick and tired of \npaying artificially high prices at the gas pumps. I wish to take this \nmoment, if I might, to explain what my amendment is.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, rather than yield for a question, let me \nyield the floor so the Senator from Vermont can explain his amendment, \nand then reclaim the floor if there is not a Member of the minority \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1330\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I thank my friend.\n  Let me begin by saying this amendment enjoys widespread support from \na very diverse coalition of organizations throughout this country that \nshare the common concern that the price of gas and oil is soaring and \nthey do not understand why. What they do know is that it is hurting \nconsumers, especially in rural areas in North Dakota and Vermont and \nthroughout this country, and it is hurting business groups throughout \nthis country. These groups, among others, include the Petroleum \nMarketers Association of America, Public Citizen, the Gasoline and \nAutomotive Service Dealers of America, the United Egg Producers, the \nWestern Peanut Growers, Friends of the Earth, and the New England Fuel \nInstitute. All of these organizations, for different reasons, are \nworried about the impact of rapidly rising oil prices on consumers.\n  All of us took economics 101, and what they told us in economics 101 \nis when supply is low and demand is high, prices go up. When supply is \nbroad and demand is minimal, prices go down. Well, right now, \nunfortunately, it seems we can throw economics 101 right out the \nwindow, because at this moment the supply of oil in the United States \nis as high today as it was 20 years ago and demand for oil in this \ncountry is lower than it was a decade ago. So the question we are \nwrestling with now is: If supply is high and demand is low, why are oil \nprices soaring?\n  Up until today, as a matter of fact, gasoline prices increased for 54 \nstraight days--the longest streak on record dating back to 1996. Today \nthe national average for a gallon of gasoline is $2.69 a gallon--up \nmore than $1 since late last year.\n  There is mounting evidence that the runup in oil and gas prices has \nlittle to do with the fundamentals of supply and demand and has \neverything to do with excessive speculation by some of the same Wall \nStreet firms that received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history \nof the world. They are back again, not having caused enough damage by \ndriving our country and much of the world into a deep recession. Now \nthey are back into their speculation and driving up oil prices which \nare having an enormously negative impact on consumers all over our \ncountry.\n  Clearly, as a Congress, as a Senate, we have a responsibility to do \neverything we can to prevent the manipulation of oil and gas prices so \nthat they reflect the basic economics supply and demand curve, not \nexcessive speculation. This would not only help Americans struggling to \nfill up their gas tanks this summer, but it would have a positive \nimpact, by the way, in expanding the number of international travelers \nvisiting the United States, the fundamental purpose of the Travel \nPromotion Act that our amendment is a part of--would like to be a part \nof.\n  The amendment I am offering or wish to offer would simply require the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission to use its emergency authority to \nprevent the manipulation of oil prices. What is so horrible about that? \nWhat has caused our Republican friends to jump up in fear and say this \namendment can't be offered?\n  Let me mention to my Republican friends that last July the House of \nRepresentatives passed an identical bill by a vote of 402 to 19--the \nsame bill. An overwhelming majority of Republicans in the House voted \nfor that bill, but for some reason our Republican colleagues here do \nnot want to give us the opportunity to vote for it today.\n  I thank Majority Leader Reid and Senator Dorgan for trying to work \nout a compromise with the Republicans that would have enabled a vote on \nthis amendment. Under this agreement, as Senator Dorgan has said, the \nRepublicans would have been able to receive a vote on their top five \nnongermane amendments. They had five and we had one major nongermane \namendment. It is very hard for me to understand--and maybe my friend \nfrom North Dakota has some thoughts on this one--I have a very hard \ntime understanding what their fear is. What are they afraid of, if this \namendment passes? Are they afraid we would be able to take action \nagainst the excessive speculation that is currently taking place on \nWall Street?\n  That is the only answer I can think of, and it is a pretty poor and \nunfortunate answer. The American people are hurting. We are in a \nrecession. People have lost their jobs. People have seen a decline in \ntheir income. The American people are sick and tired of paying \nartificially high prices at the gas pump, and people in New England are \nworried about what happens next winter when they have to heat their \nhomes with oil.\n  I wish to mention in conclusion, interestingly enough, just \nyesterday--just yesterday--the Guardian, a British newspaper, reported:\n\n       Staff at Goldman Sachs can look forward to the biggest \n     bonus payouts in the firm's\n\n[[Page S6880]]\n\n     140-year history after a spectacular first half of the year.\n\n  I don't mean to pick on Goldman Sachs. There are a number of other \nfinancial outfits that may be engaged in excessive oil speculation as \nwell, but Goldman Sachs is the leading trader of oil and gas \nderivatives. So here we are, Goldman Sachs, among others, now paying \nout huge bonuses after having been bailed out by the taxpayers of this \ncountry and they are back at their same old tricks of engaging in \nexcessive speculation, which is what my amendment begins to address.\n  I am amazed our Republican friends would refuse to allow an amendment \nto come to the floor of the Senate that was passed overwhelmingly in \nthe House with very strong Republican support in that body.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, as I have indicated previously, the \nunderlying bill on which we are going to have a cloture vote is \nbipartisan. There were over 50 cosponsors here in the Senate in the \nlast Congress. Republicans and Democrats alike have supported it. We \nare apparently going to have a cloture vote that some--judging by what \none of my colleagues said earlier--will feel they have to vote against. \nThey will vote to stop this bill because they feel their right to amend \nwas obstructed, despite the fact that their right to amend was \nexplicitly agreed to. Working on bad information is not a great way to \nvote, in my judgment.\n  Let me make an important point. I indicated earlier this is one of \nthe few pieces of legislation that will be brought to the floor of the \nSenate that actually reduces the Federal budget deficit by $425 \nmillion. That is pretty unbelievable, but there are two other big \nissues. One is at a time when we are seeing hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans a month losing their jobs, losing their homes, losing hope \nbecause we are in a deep recession, at a time when we have all of this \nunemployment, we should be voting to move forward with a piece of \nlegislation that tries to boost employment by increasing travel to our \ncountry by overseas visitors. These visitors are going to spend a \nsubstantial amount of money--$4,500 per tourist. And we know we now \nhave 633,000 fewer international tourists coming to America than we did \n8 years ago. Why is that the case? The decline in tourism began after \nthe terrible, tragic attack on this country on September 11, 2001. \nFollowing that, we obviously decided we wanted to try to keep \nterrorists out of this country. But we also made it harder for regular \ntourists. It was harder to get a visa. There were longer lines. Then \nthe Iraq war began and a lot of people were upset with our country for \nunilateral actions in Iraq, and so on. We have gone through nearly a \ndecade now in which people are traveling around the world more and more \noften, but they are going to Spain, France, Great Britain, Turkey, \nIndia, and Japan--all of which are advertising aggressively \ninternationally to say, come to our country, be a part of our \nexperience. See the beauty of India or Japan or Australia. But our \ncountry is not involved in that competition, and we should be, because \nthere is no better place on this Earth. I know I am not objective about \nthat, but to come here is to love this country and to understand the \ngreat character and culture that exists here.\n\n  This piece of legislation will create jobs and opportunity in this \ncountry, but even more important, it will create goodwill all across \nthis world from people who visit here and go home and have a better \nunderstanding of what America is about. At a time when we are in a deep \nrecession, do we want to create jobs? I hope so. At a time when we care \nabout what the world thinks about us, do we want to improve our \nstanding in the world? I hope so.\n  We will have a cloture vote in 3 or 4 minutes. I am told now, some \nwho have cosponsored the bill, even, will probably come down and vote \nagainst cloture because they will claim they don't have the right to \noffer amendments. Well, they surely do. We agreed they could offer \ntheir first five amendments last Thursday. It is just that they said we \ncan't offer our amendments because they object, for example, to the \nSanders amendment.\n  We said: You can offer five; we will offer three.\n  They said: That is fine, except we won't allow you to offer the \nSanders amendment. We won't agree to that.\n  Again, my question: If the Senate has come to the point where it \ncan't agree on tourism, what hope is there for big, controversial, and \nimportant issues that we will confront later this year?\n  My hope is that perhaps some will understand the goodwill with which \nthe majority leader and I and others offered the minority the right to \noffer the amendments they chose to offer. It was the minority that \ndecided they didn't want to agree. It would be difficult for me to see \nsome of those who were given the ability to offer the amendments come \nto the floor and vote against a bill they support because they say they \nweren't given an opportunity to offer amendments. It is pretty hard to \nsquare that circle, and my hope is they will understand that before \nthey vote. It will be very nice if perhaps on this one vote, it \nwouldn't be considered a leadership or a partisan vote and it wouldn't \nbe based on misinformation, but instead we decided that this is about \ntourism, it is about promoting jobs and economic opportunity in our \ncountry, and it is about boosting the reputation of this country around \nthe world by having people visit the United States and understanding \nthe full breadth of what the American experience is about.\n  I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order and pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Dorgan \n     amendment, No. 1347, to S. 1023, the Travel Promotion Act of \n     2009.\n         Harry Reid, Byron L. Dorgan, Barbara Boxer, Ron Wyden, \n           Mark Begich, Evan Bayh, Charles Schumer, Max Baucus, \n           Jon Tester, Patty Murray, Jack Reed, Amy Klobuchar, \n           Patrick Leahy, Barbara Mikulski, Robert Menendez, Jeff \n           Bingaman, Joseph Lieberman.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall be waived.\n  The question is: Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 1347 offered by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan, to S. 1023, the Travel Promotion Act of 2009, shall be brought \nto a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule, and the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, let me say a brief word on the cloture \nthat was not invoked on the travel bill. I hope everyone understands \nwhat obstructionism is. This is obstructionism at its best. It goes \nalong with what the Republicans said they wanted to do and that is stop \neverything, as indicated in the Roll Call newspaper last week.\n  This is a bill that saves the government money, almost a half billion \ndollars over 10 years. It would create, in the first year after passage \nof the bill, 40,000 jobs.\n  Republicans killed this over the most fictitious reasoning. They said \nthey were not allowed to offer amendments. That is absolutely false. In \nfact, we had an agreement that they could offer amendments. There were \nno restrictions on what they could offer. They wanted to offer \namendments regarding TARP. They wanted to offer five of those. Fine, I \nsaid, go ahead. We had one amendment we want to offer. They said: No, \nwe just want to offer ours, you can't offer yours.\n  Every State would benefit from this legislation because tourism is so \nimportant and popular in every State, but the Republicans killed this. \nIs there any wonder they have lost, during the last two election \ncycles, by election, 15 Republican Senators? Is it any wonder? They are \nso enthralled with the status quo they want no improvements of \nanything, including they don't want to save the government a half \nbillion dollars, they don't want to improve tourism because this may be \nanother victory for President Obama.\n  I am certainly aware of the work done by the committee. The Commerce \nCommittee works so hard. Senator Rockefeller was ill. He badly injured \nhimself. Senator Dorgan stepped forward to get it out of that committee \nso we could do this. It is good for every State. Tourism is good for \nNew Hampshire, it is good for Nevada, it is good for North Dakota, it \nis good for Wyoming, and it is good for Idaho. The Republicans killed \nour ability to save half a billion dollars. They killed our ability to \ncreate 40,000 new jobs. Tourism is a trillion-dollar industry in this \ncountry. The Republicans killed this legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Last Thursday, the majority leader and I stood in that \naisle. The question was going to be, under what conditions would this \nTravel Promotion Act come to the floor of the Senate? We said: You know \nwhat, tell us what amendments you need. Tell us which amendment you \nwish to offer and we will give you some. So it ended up five amendments \non their side, three on ours, as a start. It was not going to be a \nlimit, but we were going to start with five and three. They showed us \ntheir five. None had anything to do with this bill. We said: Fine, you \ncan offer those five, no problem. They were all about TARP, troubled \nassets and so on. We said fine. Then we showed them the three to be \noffered on this side, and they looked at three of them and said this \none we will not allow to be offered. All of a sudden, the minority was \ndeciding they could offer all of theirs, but they will not allow the \nmajority to offer one amendment that deals with the issue of the price \nof gasoline.\n  The result was we now had a vote against cloture on an issue dealing \nwith travel promotion on a piece of legislation that raises $500 \nmillion and reduces the deficit $500 million in 10 years. It is pretty \nunbelievable to me. I asked the question earlier today, if we can't \nagree on a piece of legislation that in the last Congress was supported \nby over 50 Senators, Republicans and Democrats, dealing with promotion \nof tourism and creating jobs and promoting this country's economic \ninterests by asking international tourists to come to this country, you \nare welcome to come and see America and understand what America is \nabout--if we cannot agree on that, how on Earth will we agree to get \namendments on energy, health care, climate change, and so on? It is so \ndisappointing.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I could respond to my friend, we had, \nthis year, 11 Republican sponsors of this bill. Nine of them voted \nagainst cloture, nine of the eleven. That, to me, is hard to calculate \nas being within the realm of sensibility. What in the world did they \naccomplish, other than maybe they are following the Senate GOP, still \nsaying no?\n  But should they say no to things--maybe they should have a better \nrationale, saying we can't do this, it is a\n\n[[Page S6882]]\n\ngovernment program; we can't do this, it costs money; we can't do this, \nwe don't have time to do it.\n  None of those apply. It does not cost government money. We have time \nto do it. It is not a government program.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me make one additional point. \nUnfortunately, too much of politics these days is there is my team and \nyour team. On this kind of legislation I would have thought this was \nabout our team, all of us working together on a bill that Republicans \nand Democrats had cosponsored, on a bill that is actually going to \nreduce the Federal budget deficit by a half billion dollars and on a \nbill that, at a time when we are in deep recession, promotes tourists \nto come to this country, who would, on average, spend $4,500 in this \ncountry to create new jobs.\n  We have a substantial number, hundreds of thousands--633,000 fewer \nvisitors to the United States from overseas than we had in the year \n2000. Think of that, 633,000 fewer people visited this country from \noverseas than did in the year 2000. Every other country is experiencing \na very substantial increase: France, England, Italy, Yugoslavia--not \nYugoslavia, again, I made the mistake--it is Turkey and Japan and \nIndia, so many other countries--Kosovo; they are all advertising, all \npushing for international tourism, to come to their country because \nthey know it creates jobs and, more importantly, they understand when \nyou go there you leave those countries with a good impression.\n  If ever there were a time when we need people to come to this country \nand leave with an understanding of culture and character of this \ncountry and at the same time create jobs in this country by buying gas, \nrenting hotel rooms, buying airplanes seats, going to the tourist \nattractions, and understanding about America, it is now.\n  My hope is, in the next day or so, we might be able to find a way to \nbring those who voted against cloture to understand we have said, you \nknow what, if you want to offer amendments, offer amendments. There is \nno obstruction anyplace.\n  One of our colleagues came to the floor and said: I am voting against \ncloture because I was obstructed from offering my amendment, and that \nwas a colleague who had an amendment on a list we said explicitly yes \nto. How does one reconcile statements that are not accurate? My hope is \nmaybe we can find agreement in the next day or two.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the problem we have is one of time now. \nThey have stalled and killed so much time on this bipartisan good piece \nof legislation. I think they should hear from their constituents. We \nshould go ahead and invoke cloture. If there are germane amendments, we \ncan do them. But I do not think we will go through the kabuki of having \nTARP amendments and all this.\n  We have tried in good faith to get this piece of legislation \nfinished. If they want to finish this legislation, they should march up \nhere and invoke cloture, which needs to be done. They can still offer \ngermane amendments.\n  They may not like this bill. They may want to offer other amendments \nas they relate to this legislation. Unless I can be convinced \notherwise--and I certainly can be, if I can be proven to be wrong; I am \nhappy to be as reasonable as I can be--I think this is such a revolting \ndevelopment in a body that has pledged to do good things for the \ncountry. We have done a lot of good things this year. We have done it \nwith little help from the Republicans. We have gotten some but not \nmuch. So they are stalling to prevent President Obama from \naccomplishing anything, even on a bill to save this country money.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. If the majority leader would yield for a question, one \nof the things I found out with our hearing that you so kindly testified \nat about tourism--and I am chairing that subcommittee--now is, one, \nthis was bipartisan, as you pointed out. There were Republicans there. \nThey pledged their support for this bill.\n  But the second thing is when we talk about tourism, it is not we are \nnot only talking about the CEOs of airline companies. The jobs, as you \nknow, we are talking about in Nevada, are jobs such as maids or the \npeople who work at the flower shops or the people who work in the \nfrontline in the restaurants or the people, the bellboys. Those are \nreal jobs.\n  One out of eight people employed in this country is employed in the \ntourism industry. What I heard in Nevada was something like 400 \nconventions had been canceled out of Las Vegas. We are just starting to \nsee some improvements in our State. We call Duluth the Las Vegas of \nMinnesota. But we are starting to see improvements with business travel \npicking up, with some hope for consumers.\n  This bill would bring in those key people to spend $4,500 every time \nthey come into this country, and that is the international travelers. \nSo if the majority leader would comment on what this means to real \npeople, the bill the Republicans have now stopped, as we are trying \nevery day to get more jobs in this country.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my father-in-law, may he rest in peace, \nemigrated from Russia and wound up in Duluth, MN. At that time, it was \na booming town, very tough town. I have never been to Duluth. I have \nbeen to Minneapolis a few times, but I never had the opportunity to see \nthe Land of a Thousand Lakes--I think that is what they call it.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Ten thousand.\n  Mr. REID. Ten thousand. Well, in Nevada we do not have many lakes, we \ndo not have five lakes. But I would love to come and spend some time in \nMinnesota. It is a wonderful tourism destination, in the winter as cold \nas it is there, and a lot of things to do there, and in the summer.\n  As Senator Dorgan mentioned, we should be promoting our country so \npeople like my father-in-law from Duluth or Minneapolis or wherever \ncould go visit and have a good time being a tourist.\n  It is the same in Nevada, New Hampshire, Illinois. Every State in the \nUnion is heavily dependent on tourism, and the Republicans do not seem \nto much care.\n  This bill is probably finished for the year, and that means 40,000 \nless jobs. That means this country will go in the red more for not \nhaving the stimulation the economy would get from this bill.\n  I appreciate very much the subcommittee and the committee getting \nthis bill on the floor. We thought we were going to have this love fest \nhere, because this bill helps every State in the Union, helps every \nState in the Union create jobs, as the Senator from Minnesota said so \nrightly, jobs not manufacturing things, which is important; I wish we \ncould do more to help that--not jobs that provide entertainment in the \nsense of the word of going to watch a ball game or something such as \nthat. That is tourism. My son and the pals he runs around with traveled \none summer all around the country watching ball games. That is tourism. \nAnd as the Senator from Minnesota mentioned, the reason tourism jobs in \nNevada are so important, we have one union that has 60,000 members. Who \nare those members? They are maids, they are car valets, they are \nwaiters, waitresses.\n  I think it is a shame that we have, because of the Republicans \nlooking for an excuse to make President Obama look bad--President Obama \nwants this done. This is part of his program, tourism.\n  I appreciate the comments of my friend from Minnesota.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/22/senate-section/article/S6882-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6882-S6883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY OWNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise to discuss a ``Sense \nof the Senate'' resolution I have submitted with several colleagues to \naddress the government's recent move to take significant ownership \nstakes in two icons of American business: Chrysler and General Motors. \nJoining me as cosponsors are Senators Collins, Landrieu, Lieberman, \nKlobuchar and McCaskill.\n  This resolution puts the Senate on record and makes absolutely clear: \nthe Federal Government is a ``temporary\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\nshareholder'' in GM and Chrysler, and it should divest its shareholder \nposition as expeditiously as possible.\n  No one ever wanted the government to be in the car business, but the \nalternative was worse and the turmoil in the auto industry extends far \nbeyond Detroit as most Americans know.\n  Dealerships across my State of Nebraska are feeling the impacts of \ndecisions made by automakers following their bankruptcies. Chrysler has \ndecided to terminate franchise agreements with 9 dealerships in \nNebraska and GM intends to terminate franchise agreements with 21 \ndealerships in Nebraska.\n  These decisions are affecting dealerships and their employees in \ncommunities such as Arapahoe, Hastings, David City, Omaha, Auburn, \nMilford, Lincoln, Scottsbluff, and West Point have already been \nimpacted by the auto bankruptcies. Auto parts manufacturing plants in \ncommunities like Kearney, Cozad, Grand Island, and Seward are also \nfeeling the results of the downturn in the auto industry.\n  According to the Nebraska New Car and Truck Dealers Association, more \nthan 13,600 Nebraskans work in jobs tied to the auto industry in my \nState and account for $267 million in wages for Nebraska individuals \nand families.\n  However, now that an investment has been made, we owe it to the \nAmerican taxpayers to be clear about what will happen with their money.\n  The resolution states that the Federal Government is a temporary \nstakeholder in the American automotive industry and should take all \npossible steps to protect America on taxpayer dollars and divest its \nownership interests in such companies as expeditiously as possible.\n  The government should not be involved in day-to-day operations, and \nas soon as the auto companies have regained their financial footing the \ngovernment must divest. Its involvement should not be open-ended.\n  Further, this resolution calls on the Government Accountability \nOffice and the inspector general for the Troubled Assets Relief \nProgram, or TARP, to continue providing oversight. In addition, the GAO \nand inspector general will report to Congress on automotive companies \nreceiving financial assistance, so that the Federal Government may \ncomplete divestiture without delay.\n\n  This is not a partisan issue. Our deep economic crisis has already \ncost millions of Americans their jobs, and to add a collapse of the \nauto industry could add a devastating blow it would take years from \nwhich to recover.\n  We have had Presidents of both political parties recognize the need \nto address the current downfall of the auto industry and recognized the \nneed to remove government involvement as quickly as possible.\n  On December 19, 2008, President Bush stated: ``The actions I'm \nannouncing today represent a step that we wish were not necessary. But \ngiven the situation, it is the most effective and responsible way to \naddress this challenge facing our nation. By giving the auto companies \na chance to restructure, we will shield the American people from a \nharsh economic blow at a vulnerable time and we will give American \nworkers an opportunity to show the world, once again, they can meet \nchallenges with ingenuity and determination and bounce back from tough \ntimes and emerge stronger than before.''\n  On March 30 this year, President Obama stated: ``We cannot, and must \nnot, and we will not let our auto industry simply vanish. This industry \nis like no other--it's an emblem of the American spirit; a once and \nfuture symbol of America's success. It's what helped build the middle \nclass and sustained it throughout the 20th century. It's a source of \ndeep pride for the generations of American workers whose hard work and \nimagination led to some of the finest cars the world has ever known. \nIt's a pillar of our economy that has held up the dreams of millions of \nour people. . . . These companies--and this industry--must ultimately \nstand on their own, not as wards of the state.''\n  So, to conclude, the government's move is aimed at providing \nstability for the automotive industry and for American workers across \nour great Nation in these uncertain economic times.\n  Our sense-of-the-Senate resolution affirms what the President has \nmade clear: taxpayers should be protected and the government should get \nout of the auto business as soon as possible. Through this resolution, \nthe Senate leaves no question about the government's future role in the \nU.S. auto industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/22/senate-section/article/S6883-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY'S HOPE AWARD WINNER\n\n  Mr. REID.

Incredibly, the rodeo is run by \nonly two full-time staff members and countless volunteers. Since 1986, \nit has donated more than $5 million to various causes, including \ncharities, community partnership grants, and educational scholarships \nto schools including the University of Nevada, Reno. It has also given \ngenerously to literacy, high school rodeo and therapeutic equestrian \nprograms.\n  Nevada is particularly proud of the Exceptional Kids Rodeo, which for \nmore than a quarter-century has given children with special needs the \nopportunity to interact with the rodeo cowboys, animals and the \nexciting rodeo experience.\n  The ``Wildest, Richest Rodeo in the West'' is one of Nevada's oldest \nand proudest cultural institutions, and we wish it many more decades of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/22/senate-section/article/S6883-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6883-S6884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERSHIPS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Madam President, this August, 25 years ago, Capitol \nPolice Sergeant Christopher Sherman Eney died in the line of duty. I \nrise to remember Sergeant Christopher Sherman Eney and the great \nsacrifices of our law enforcement officers.\n  The men and women who make up the Capitol Police protect not only \nMembers of Congress but all the people visiting Capitol Hill, from \nforeign dignitaries to Girl Scout troops. Sergeant Eney was a loyal and \ndedicated member of the U.S. Capitol Police. He served on the force for \ntwelve years.\n  On August 24, 1984, U.S. Capitol Police officers participated in SWAT \ntraining. That evening, the officers wanted to practice a particularly \ndifficult exercise just one more time. During this final activity, Seg. \nEney was accidentally shot and killed.\n  Sergeant Eney's life was cut tragically short. He was 37 years old. \nHe left behind his wife Vivian and their two daughters: Shannen and \nHeather. My thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Eney's family as we \nremember that tragic day.\n  Shortly after Sergeant Eney's passing, Vivian spoke of her husband \nand other fallen officers. She could not have spoken truer words when \nshe said, ``It is not how these officers died that made them heroes, it \nis how they lived.'' Her famous words are forever engraved on the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n  It is up to us to honor Vivian's words. Twenty five years later, we \nremember Sergeant Eney as a man dedicated to risking his life for his \nNation. He was a brave and courageous man. He lived every day \nprotecting his country and the future of his children.\n  I am so proud of every U.S. Capitol Police officer who puts their \nlife on the line. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking them for \ntheir service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/22/senate-section/article/S6884-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Staff Sergeant Edmond Lo\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to express my sympathy over the \nloss of U.S. Army SSG Edmond Lo, a 23-year-old native of Salem, NH. \nStaff Sergeant Lo was killed while attempting to neutralize an \nimprovised explosive device in Samarra City, Iraq, early in the morning \nof June 13, 2009.\n  Staff Sergeant Lo was born and raised in Salem. He attended Salem \nHigh School, where he became a leader of the Air Force Junior ROTC \nprogram before graduating in 2004. Lo was determined to join the Army \nafter graduation, even turning down a host of college acceptance \nletters in order to enlist. He became a member of the Army's 797th \nOrdnance Company--stationed out of Fort Hood, TX--and was on his second \ntour of duty in Iraq.\n  In high school, Edmond Lo earned the nickname ``Mr. Dependable.'' \nThose who knew him described him as kind, hardworking and strong-\nwilled. Even after his first tour of duty, Staff Sergeant Lo kept a \nclose connection to the community where he grew up, returning to Salem \nHigh School to share photographs from his first trip to Iraq.\n  New Hampshire is proud of Staff Sergeant Lo's service to and \nsacrifice for our country. He, and the thousands of brave men and women \nof the U.S. Armed Forces serving today, deserve America's highest honor \nand recognition.\n  Staff Sergeant Lo is survived by his parents David and Rosa, as well \nas two brothers and three sisters. He will be missed dearly by all \nthose who knew him.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring U.S. \nArmy SSG Edmond Lo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/22/senate-section/article/S6884-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6884-S6885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S COMMENCEMENT CEREMONY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the remarks given by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \nat New York University's commencement ceremony in New York City, on May \n13, 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of State\n\n       Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. And does it get \n     any better than this, a graduation ceremony for one of the \n     great universities in the world in the home of New York \n     Yankees? Nothing could be better. And thanks to all of you \n     for cheering a visitor. I didn't realize that was permitted \n     in Yankee Stadium.\n       I am honored to receive this degree. And on behalf of the \n     other honorees, I say thank you. Thank you for giving us this \n     singular privilege of being part of this commencement \n     ceremony. As I look out at this huge crowd of graduates, \n     family, and friends, I can only reflect on what an \n     extraordinary moment in history you are receiving your \n     degrees, a moment in time of our country and the world where \n     your talents and your energy, your passion and commitment is \n     more needed than ever. There is no doubt that you are well \n     prepared for a world that seems somewhat uncertain but which \n     will welcome the education that you have received on behalf \n     of not only of yourselves and your families, but your \n     communities and your country.\n\n\n                        CHALLENGES FOR GRADUATES\n\n       As Secretary of State, I am well aware of the challenges \n     that we face. You, as new graduates, and your generation will \n     be up against those challenges: climate change and hunger, \n     extreme poverty and extreme ideologies, new diseases and \n     nuclear proliferation. But I am absolutely convinced that you \n     and we are up to the task. There is no problem we face here \n     in America or around the world that will not yield to human \n     effort, to cooperation, to positive interdependence that \n     makes clear humanity is going on, our challenges are ones \n     that summon the best of us, and we will make the world better \n     tomorrow than it is today.\n       Now, I know that it is fashionable in commencement speeches \n     to be idealistic, and that may sound so, but at the root of \n     my conviction is a strong sense of reality. Because you see, \n     I don't think we have a choice. We can sit on the sidelines, \n     we can wring our hands, we can retreat into cynicism, and we \n     know what the results will be: We will cede the field to \n     those whose ideologies are absolutely anathema to people of \n     conscience and faith all over the world. So our positive \n     interdependence, which is a fact, will prepare us to meet \n     these challenges. But they can no longer be seen just as \n     government-to-government. There is a time and an opportunity, \n     and with the new technologies available, for us to be citizen \n     diplomats, citizen activists, to solve problems one by one \n     that will give in to hard work, patience, and persistence, \n     and will then aggregate to the solutions we seek. Now, I know \n     we cannot send a special envoy to negotiate with a pandemic, \n     or call a summit with carbon dioxide, or sever relations with \n     the global financial crisis. To confront these threats and to \n     seize the opportunities that they also present, we need to \n     build new partnerships from the bottom up, and to use every \n     tool at our disposal. That is the heart of smart power. But \n     smart\n\n[[Page S6885]]\n\n     power requires smart people, people who have gone the \n     distance for their education, who have opened themselves up \n     to this increasingly complex and interconnected world, and \n     this changing global landscape requires us to expand our \n     concept of diplomacy.\n       Now, when I was graduating so many years ago, diplomacy was \n     the domain of privileged men working behind closed doors. \n     Today, our diplomats are not limited, and our diplomacy is no \n     longer confined to the State Department or our embassies. We \n     are laying the foundation for 21st century statecraft. Where? \n     In the classrooms of NYU, in the board rooms of the \n     businesses of this great city, in the halls of academia, in \n     the operating rooms of our great hospitals. We are looking \n     for those personal commitments and connections, and that is \n     where all of you come in.\n\n\n                 SERVICE AND DIPLOMACY BY YOUNG PEOPLE\n\n       The biggest challenges we face today will be solved by the \n     60 percent of the world's population under the age of 30. And \n     already, young people, like all of you, are using their \n     talents and ingenuity to help fashion their own brand of \n     service and diplomacy.\n       A few examples: In the nation of Colombia, two young \n     college graduates, fed up with the violence in their country, \n     used Facebook to organize 14 million people into the largest \n     antiterrorism demonstrations in the history of the world. In \n     a few short weeks, their peaceful efforts did as much damage \n     to the terrorist networks as years of military action.\n       I know that one of your graduates spent months on the \n     slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro searching for sustainable \n     development models to bring to women and families and help \n     them lift themselves out of poverty. Another of your \n     classmates was studying in China last year when the \n     devastating earthquake struck, and that has led to work ever \n     since to deliver supplies and assistance to villagers in \n     remote areas. International students have gone on to fight \n     for human rights in Rwanda, build civil society in the nation \n     of Georgia, run businesses, and lead governments. And many of \n     you, I know, used social networking platforms to make Barack \n     Obama the President of the United States of America.\n       President Obama and I deeply understand how important it is \n     for the young people of our country, but the young people of \n     every country, to be given the opportunity to translate your \n     beliefs and ideals into service and action, just as John \n     Kennedy did when he created the Peace Corps and as President \n     Bill Clinton did when he created AmeriCorps. This is in the \n     tradition of citizen service.\n       So we need to figure out ways to prepare all of our \n     institutions of government, including and especially the \n     State Department, to harness the efforts of those who do not \n     enter the Foreign Service but still engage in your own type \n     of foreign service. Our State Department personnel are \n     skilled, dedicated, passionate, and effective. And for those \n     of you still looking for jobs, we are hiring a new generation \n     of diplomats.\n       I hope many of you will join our ranks in the Foreign \n     Service and the Civil Service, but I know that not all will \n     choose to become professional diplomats, and I also know that \n     the State Department alone cannot tackle these great \n     problems. So my message to you today is this: Be the special \n     envoys of your ideals; use the communication tools at your \n     disposal to advance the interests of our nation and humanity \n     everywhere; be citizen ambassadors using your personal and \n     professional lives to forge global partnerships, build on a \n     common commitment to solving our planet's common problems. By \n     creating your own networks, you can extend the power of \n     governments to meet the needs of this and future generations. \n     You can help lay the groundwork for the kind of global \n     cooperation that is essential if we wish, in our time, to end \n     hunger and defeat disease, to combat climate change, and to \n     give every child the chance to live up to his or her God-\n     given potential.\n\n\n                         EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES\n\n       This starts with opportunities for educational exchanges, \n     the kind of dorm room and classroom diplomacy that NYU is \n     leading on. I want to commend my friend, your president, the \n     trustees of this great university, for understanding and \n     believing in the importance of educational exchanges.\n       You know, study abroad is like spring training for this \n     century. It helps you develop the fundamentals, the teamwork, \n     and the determination to succeed. And we want more American \n     students to have that opportunity. That's why we are \n     increasing funding for Gilman scholarships by more than 40 \n     percent. More than 400 New Yorkers have used Gilman \n     scholarships to spend a semester abroad, including nine \n     students from NYU last year.\n       Now, of course, study abroad is a two-way street, and we \n     should bring more qualified students from other countries to \n     study here. NYU provides a prime example of what \n     international students can bring to a campus and how they can \n     benefit themselves and their countries. Over 700,000 \n     international students came to the United States last year, \n     and NYU had the second largest number of any school in the \n     country.\n       Now, the benefits from such exchanges are so great that I \n     am committed to streamline the visa process--particularly for \n     science and technology students so that even more qualified \n     students will come to our campuses in the future. We're also \n     doing more to marry technology with global service. That's \n     why today I am pleased to announce that over the next year \n     the State Department will be creating Virtual Student Foreign \n     Service Internships to harness the energy of a rising \n     generation of citizen diplomats. Working from college and \n     university campuses, American students will partner with our \n     embassies abroad to conduct digital diplomacy that reflects \n     the realities of the networked world. And you can learn more \n     about this initiative on the State Department's website.\n       But I know that you don't have to wait for us to create a \n     new program. When you go home today, go online and find the \n     website called Kiva, K-i-v-a, where you can help someone like \n     San Ma, a mother in Vietnam who is seeking a microcredit loan \n     to buy rice seed and fertilizer for her family farm; or log \n     on to Heifer International's site, and for less than the cost \n     of a dinner out, you can donate a flock of geese to a hungry \n     family in Asia or Africa; or help Wangari Mathai's Green Belt \n     movement in planting trees and offsetting carbon emissions \n     and empowering women in Africa.\n\n\n                             GLOBAL SERVICE\n\n       Now, supporting these projects and others like them doesn't \n     require a lot of time or money. But for the people you help \n     and the planet you protect, your participation can be not \n     just a game changer, but a life changer. Global service also \n     means promoting good governance. We need informed citizens, \n     both here at home and around the world, to hold their \n     governments accountable for getting results and finding \n     solutions.\n       And this is not only directed at the graduates today, but \n     there are a lot of proud mothers and fathers and husbands and \n     wives and grandparents and children and others who have seen \n     you to this day. And this is an offer and a challenge to all \n     of us. In the times that we face, we know we don't have a \n     person to waste, we don't have an idea to overlook. In fact, \n     we have to be even more committed to reaching out and \n     crossing the divides that too often separate us. For those \n     who have come to this country to celebrate a child or a \n     friend's graduation, please take home this message: America \n     more than ever wants your help; in fact, needs your help as \n     we build these new partnerships and as we seek solutions to \n     the global crises that cannot be solved by any one people or \n     one government alone.\n       We need each other. We always have. It's just so much more \n     apparent today. A flu starting in one country spreads quickly \n     around the world. An extremist ideology starting with a few \n     people explodes across the internet. A global financial \n     crisis affects farmers and small business people in every \n     corner of the globe. That is a new reality. But equally \n     important is that we also now have the tools to work together \n     to forge this common approach to these common threats.\n       So, Class of 2009, you have an historic opportunity. Every \n     class is told that, and to some extent I suppose it is always \n     true. But just in the course of this commencement ceremony, \n     you've heard several references to the global economic \n     crisis. The times that you are graduating in are, yes, \n     perhaps more difficult and somewhat more daunting. But that's \n     when we really rise together. One of the best lines from one \n     of my favorite baseball movies, A League of Their Own--said \n     it well, ``If it were easy, anybody could do it.''\n       You know, when the Yankees moved in to their old stadium \n     next door in 1923, there was only person on the roster from \n     west of St. Louis. Their team mostly looked the same, talked \n     the same, and came from the same kind of cities and towns and \n     rural areas across America. Think about the team that plays \n     in this new stadium. It includes players from Mexico, Japan, \n     Taiwan, Panama, four other countries. The Dominican Republic \n     alone is home to seven Yankees. In the same way, NYU has \n     evolved as well. The university was founded to serve the City \n     of New York. Today it serves the world.\n\n\n              THE BEST INSURANCE POLICY: AN NYU EDUCATION\n\n       We know that there is much yet ahead that none of us can \n     predict. There is no way to stop change. Change will come. \n     What is unknown is whether it will bring progress or not. But \n     you have done what you needed to do to get the best insurance \n     policy you could, and that is an NYU education. And so armed \n     with that education, I have every confidence that you will \n     not only succeed by the dint of your own hard work and \n     effort, but you will contribute far beyond your own personal \n     needs. This is your moment. You've made it to the big \n     leagues, and you are up to bat. Go out and give us a future \n     worthy of this great university, of this great city, of this \n     great country, and of the world we all wish to create \n     together.\n       Thank you, congratulations, and Godspeed.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Ron is retiring this \nmonth after serving the American Legion of South Dakota for the past \ndecade.\n\n[[Page S6886]]\n\n  Ron served in the U.S. Navy for 27 years. In 1999, Ron and his wife \nMarsha moved to Watertown where Ron joined the American Legion \nDepartment Headquarters Staff as the Department Assistant Adjutant. He \nwas appointed Acting Department Adjutant in July 2000 and Department \nAdjutant at the Mid Winter Conference in February 2001.\n  During his tenure as Department Adjutant, Ron provided important \ncounsel and advice to veterans, family members, VA officials, veterans' \nservice officers, State legislators and congressional members on a \nrange of issues. In particular, under his leadership, the American \nLegion in South Dakota has provided dozens of forums for veterans and \ntheir families in towns all across South Dakota to inform them of their \nbenefits as veterans. I have always appreciated the time he has taken \nto visit with me in Washington, DC, and in South Dakota and update me \non the events and issues important to the members of the American \nLegion.\n  It is with great honor that I share his impressive accomplishments \nwith my colleagues, and I thank him for his service to this Nation and \nits veterans. Ron's consistent dedication to serving his country is \nadmirable. His commitment to both the Navy and the legion reflect Ron's \nstrong character and work ethic. Countless veterans have benefited from \nhis loyalty and devotion. I wish Ron, and his wife Marsha, all the best \nin retirement and thank him for his many years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/22/senate-section/article/S6886-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF BERESFORD, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Many changes have taken place \nsince that first claim shanty in 1884, and the community now includes \nan impressive two-story school building and expanded medical \nfacilities, both highly acclaimed. Britton has also established a \nstrong economic base with over 25 businesses.\n  As the county seat of Marshall County, Britton continues to be a \nthriving community with many recreational opportunities including a \nnine hole golf course, new library, movie theater, bowling alley, \nswimming pool, three city parks and Prayer Rock Museum.\n  One hundred twenty-five years after its founding, the ``Gateway to \nthe Glacial Lakes'' remains a vital community and a great asset to the \nwonderful State of South Dakota.

Clear Lake also had a notable system to \nalert the town to fires, first with a triangle, then a bronze bell that \nis displayed in the town today.\n  Clear Lake is noted for its prosperous farmland and picturesque lake. \nThis thriving town celebrated their achievement of 125 years with a \nweekend celebration filled with music, food and contests.

Known as the \n``Rhubarb Capital of the World'', Leola holds a biannual festival to \ncelebrate and sample the various uses of this unique fruit. The town \nalso has a Threshing Bee in September of every year to honor their \nforefathers' way of life with live demonstrations of antique threshing \nmachines and an antique tractor show.\n  Located near the Ordway Prairie Memorial Preserve, Leola is also an \nexcellent place for nature and history lovers to experience beautiful \nSouth Dakota prairie and its wildlife as the settlers did so many years \nago.\n  The seat of rural McPherson County is a close-knit community infused \nwith hospitality, beauty, and an exceptional quality of life.

The farmer who donated the most land, Mr. McCraney, named the \nnew community after his hometown of Toronto, Canada. The Burlington, \nCedar Rapids and Northern Railroad built a depot which became a popular \nlandmark, providing a gathering place for the citizens. In 1898, \nToronto became the smallest town in the United States to have electric \nlights, with telephone service following 3 years later. This resilient \ntown made it through seven major fires as well as severe bouts of small \npox and Spanish influenza. I have a personal bond to the community as \nmy grandparents Reverend Peder and Anna Ljostveit are buried in the \nToronto Cemetery.\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\n  The citizens will be celebrating this momentous anniversary July 3-5, \n2009, with craft and quilt shows, meals, pageants, and games including \na contest for yard decorations.

A bill to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to modify \nrequirements relating to the location of bank branches on Indian \nreservations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would \nprovide authority for the establishment of branch banking facilities on \nIndian reservations so that the Federally-chartered Native American \nBank could enable access to financial services to Indian tribes and \ntheir citizens.\n  Many years ago, as part of my service as Chairman of the Senate \nIndian Affairs Committee, I met with tribal leaders to discuss the \nchallenges of economic development in Indian country. At that time, I \nsuggested that they might give consideration to a means by which tribal \ngovernments could pool their resources and thereby provide the capital \nthat other tribal governments could employ on a short-term loan basis \nto undertake reservation-based projects that held the potential of \nstimulating economic growth in their tribal communities.\n  The tribal leaders with whom I met were very interested in this idea, \nand in the ensuing years, went forward and established the Native \nAmerican Bank--which is headquartered in Denver--but continues to \nmanage its first affiliated bank on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in \nMontana.\n  As my colleagues know, there are few financial institutions located \neither on or near Indian reservations, and sadly, there is evidence \nthat some financial institutions have found it apparently necessary to \neither charge very high rates that they associate with the risk of \ndoing business in Indian country, or to deny financial assistance \naltogether.\n  The Native American Bank has stepped into that latter void and has \nbeen providing meaningful financial services to tribal governments and \ntheir citizens for a number of years.\n  This bill contains amendments to the McFadden Act that have been \ncarefully sculpted to address only this narrow expansion of capacity on \nthe part of financial institutions serving Indian country, and I am \npleased that Senator Johnson, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, \nhas agreed to join me in co-sponsoring this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/22/senate-section/article/S6889-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 199--RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE \n    RECREATIONAL BOATING COMMUNITY AND THE BOATING INDUSTRY TO THE \n               CONTINUING PROSPERITY OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Burr) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation:\n\n                              S.
