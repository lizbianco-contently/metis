Madam President, I had the opportunity a few years ago to \nride with two police officers. It was a specialized unit that had been \nestablished with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department on drunk \ndrivers. I learned so much. It was a good experience for me. There were \nthings I simply did not know existed. For example, if you see a car \nwith no lights on--it is nighttime--there is a 50-percent chance that \nis a drunk driver. If you see a car making a wide sweep around a corner \nvery slowly, there is a good chance that is a drunk driver. And they \nhave other things they look for.\n  As we patrolled the streets, watching for these drunk drivers and \nresponding to calls that came to these police officers, I was struck by \nhow openly they talked about the dangers they face every day, having \nmyself been a police officer and never talking about dangers because we \ndid not have many. This was something that was an eye opener for me. \nFor modern day police officers, it is an inherent part of their jobs, \nbut a part of their families' lives they will never get used to--these \nfamilies.\n  Every day, in every city and town around the country, brave men and \nwomen--all of whom volunteered to serve their communities--put \nthemselves in danger to protect us--their friends, their neighbors, and \nso many they will never even know existed or meet. They take that risk \nto give us peace of mind in our everyday activities.\n  On Police Week, we recognize those who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice, those who have given their lives in the line of duty. This \nevening, they will be honored at a candlelight vigil not far from here. \nTheir names will be added to the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial. Alongside their families, we will celebrate their dedication \nand remember their sacrifice.\n  Four of those names belong to Las Vegas policemen who were killed \nlast year. This morning, I had the chance to meet with their families \nat an 8:30 breakfast. They, of course, are some of\n\n[[Page S3664]]\n\nthe strongest Nevadans we could ever meet and I ever met.\n  Officer Daniel Leach was a career corrections officer. He began his \nshift last November 21 by driving to Laughlin to pick up prisoners at \nthe Tucker Holding Facility. He was going to take them to the Clark \nCounty Detention Center in Las Vegas.\n  But before he could get to Laughlin--not far from my home in \nSearchlight--he was involved in a vicious two-vehicle accident and was \nkilled instantly. Officer Leach was 49 years old. He had spent the last \n25 years of his life as a Las Vegas police officer. He is survived by \nhis wife, whom I met this morning, two children, his parents, one \nbrother, and one sister.\n  Before Trevor Nettleton was an officer in the Las Vegas Metropolitan \nPolice Department, he proudly held the honored title of United States \nmarine. His 9 years in the Marine Corps included service in the elite \nPresidential Guard unit, where he protected President George W. Bush.\n  Last November 19--2 days before Officer Leach was killed--Officer \nNettleton was shot and killed by three gang members who broke into his \ngarage in an attempt to rob him and his family. Officer Nettleton was \n30 years old. He left behind a wife, two young children, his parents, \nand a brother.\n  Like Officer Nettleton, Officer Milburn Beitel III was also a marine. \nTragically, he also died as a Las Vegas police officer at age 30.\n  ``Milli''--as everyone called him--was on patrol late one Wednesday \nnight last October when a car turned in front of him. Officer Beitel \nswerved to avoid the other car but was thrown from his patrol cruiser \nand died early the next morning. He, of course, was on a call he had \nreceived. He is survived by his parents and brother.\n  Last Friday marked 1 year since Officer James Manor responded to his \nlast call. It was in the same Las Vegas community where he grew up. \nWhile responding to a domestic abuse call, a pickup truck driver failed \nto yield to him in his police vehicle--going as fast as he could to \nrespond to that dispute--the collision occurred, and James Manor was \nkilled.\n\n  He was known as ``Jamie.'' He had 10 brothers and sisters, and even \nmore whom he considered brothers and sisters who served on the police \nforce with him. His siblings, his mother, and his large extended family \nwill tell his young daughter Jay'la--whom I met this morning; a \nbeautiful little 8-year-old girl--they will tell her and the rest of \nthe family about who he was. They will tell Jay'la about how courageous \nher father was, who died at 28 years of age.\n  This memorial wall that will bear these four Nevadans' names is a \nliving reminder of some of our most selfless citizens. This year we \nwill also add to that wall the names of Nevadans whom we recognize \nbelatedly--some very belatedly:\n  Uriah Gregory, a jailer from Virginia Center during its heyday, was \nkilled by two of his prisoners in 1866.\n  Arthur St. Clair, a constable and father of two, and George Requa, a \ndeputy sheriff, were killed in an ambush in Elko in 1920. They were \nboth killed at the same time.\n  Charles Lewis, another deputy sheriff from Elko, was killed by a \nthief in 1925.\n  George Washington Cotant, an Elko constable, died in a car accident \nin 1937.\n  Hugh Gallagher, Sr., a deputy sheriff from Virginia City, died on \nduty in 1948.\n  Ronald Haskell, a narcotics agent in Carson City, died on duty in \n1975.\n  Richard Willson, a sergeant from Hawthorne, NV, died after \napprehending a suspect in 1994.\n  These men were killed a long time ago--one almost 150 years ago, when \nNevada had been a State for only 2 years, but it does not matter the \ntime--and we can never forget their sacrifices.\n  Every day we should thank those who wake up on otherwise unremarkable \nmornings and head out to work with the job simply to keep us safe. \nToday we thank and honor the courageous Nevadans who, one unforgettable \nday, never came home.\n  Madam President, will the Chair report the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/13/senate-section/article/S3664-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3776, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to ask \ncosponsors of the pending amendment who wish to present an argument to \ncome to the floor as early as practical. The pending amendment involves \nreinstating a civil cause of action against aiders and abettors. The \nlaw, up until 1994 with a Supreme Court decision, provided that aiders \nand abettors were liable for damages for those who had been defrauded \nin securities transactions.\n  We all know the massive problems caused by Wall Street operations \nwith many allegations of fraud. In our effort to reform Wall Street, \nthis is a very important provision. Traditionally, people who have been \ninjured, lost money, as a result of fraud have had a civil right of \naction to go into a civil court. The law had been uniform that under \nthe Securities Act those cases could be brought.\n  There have been two Supreme Court decisions which have modified that, \nrequiring this act change the decisions of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States--which we have the authority to do: not decided on \nconstitutional grounds but decided on grounds of statutory \ninterpretations. So Congress has the plenary power to make that \nmodification.\n  I have offered the amendment and argued it briefly. We will discuss \nit further a little later this morning. I offered it on behalf of \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island, Senator Kaufman, Senator Durbin, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Leahy, Senator Levin, Senator Menendez, Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Franken, Senator Feingold, and Senator Merkley, and \nI want to let all of the cosponsors know the matter is now on the \nfloor, and if they care to support the arguments, now would be the time \nto come to the floor.\n\n[[Page S3665]]\n\n  Madam President, I see other colleagues waiting for recognition, so I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I am going to speak for about 5 minutes \non the effort to finally, once and for all, eliminate secret holds in \nthe Senate. Senator Grassley, my partner in this effort for a decade, \nwill also speak. Then, two colleagues on our side who are a part of \nthis large, bipartisan coalition, Senator Whitehouse and Senator \nBennet, and who also have done very good work along with Senator \nGrassley, Senator Inhofe, and Senator Collins, who have been part of a \nbipartisan coalition, will take just a few minutes.\n  Let me also express my appreciation to the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Dodd, Senator Durbin, and others who have been so helpful.\n  This bipartisan amendment will abolish the secret hold in the Senate, \nwhich, in my view, is a violation--an indefensible violation--of the \npublic's right to know. With a secret hold, any Senator can block a \npiece of legislation or a nomination in secret simply by telling the \nleader of their party of their desire. This means that one person, \nwithout any public disclosure whatsoever, can keep the American people \nfrom even getting a peek at what is public business.\n  When asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton said: ``That's where \nthe money is.'' In the Senate, secret holds are where the power is. \nWith a secret hold, one of the most powerful tools a Senator has to \naffect the lives of our people can be exercised anonymously.\n  In 2007, the Senate sought to eliminate secret holds. Since then, big \nloopholes have been developed to keep too much Senate business in the \ndark, unaccountable, and away from the public.\n  This bipartisan amendment closes those loopholes. With this \nbipartisan proposal, every single hold in the Senate will have an owner \nwho is public within 2 days. It is an amendment that will be enforced. \nHere is how it would work: If a Senator puts a hold on a bill or \nnomination, they are required to submit a written notice in the \nCongressional Record within 2 days. When that bill or nomination comes \nto the floor and any Senator objects to its consideration on the \ngrounds of a hold, one of two things will happen: either the Senator \nplacing the secret hold will have their name publicly released or the \nSenator who objects on their behalf will own that hold, and then that \nindividual will have their name published in the Congressional Record. \nFor the first time, there would be both public accountability and peer \npressure on those trying to keep Senate business behind closed doors.\n  The bipartisan proposal includes two additional reforms. First, the \nproposal eliminates the ability a Senator has today to lift a hold \nbefore the current 6-day period expires and never have it disclosed. \nThis has been a huge abuse. It has allowed a Senator to do business in \nsecret and never have it reported.\n  With the new proposal, if a Senator places a hold--even for a day, \neven for a minute--that hold is going to be disclosed. Second, the \nproposal makes it harder for a group of Senators to place revolving \nholds on a nomination or a bill. I particularly thank Senator \nWhitehouse, who has highlighted this issue of revolving holds in his \npast comments on the floor. With the 6-day time period, a group of \nSenators can literally pass a hold from one colleague to another and \nnever have it disclosed. By requiring all holds to be made public, it \nwill be much more difficult to find new Senators to place revolving \nholds.\n  What this comes down to is the question of whether public business \nought to actually be done in public. It seems to me that if it is \nimportant enough for a Senator to say they are making it a priority to \nkeep a bill or nomination from coming to a vote, that ought to be a \npublic matter and not be something that is decided in the shadows, away \nfrom the public and unaccountable.\n  I thank my colleagues. This has been part of a bipartisan coalition. \nNo one has put more time into this cause than my friend from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley. I also thank Senator McCaskill, who has prosecuted \nthis cause of accountability and openness relentlessly, along with \nSenators Warner, Whitehouse, Bennet, Inhofe, and Collins--I could go \non.\n  Finally, there is a desire in the Senate to eliminate secret holds \nonce and for all. I will close with this. I don't think that 1 out of \n100 people in this country have any idea what a secret hold is. Most \npeople probably think it is some kind of hairspray. It is one of the \nmost powerful tools in our democracy that is being used to keep what is \npublic business from the eyes of the American people, and it has to \nchange.\n  I will yield to my colleagues, Senators Grassley, Whitehouse, and \nBennet. I thank Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby for indulging us at \nthis time. It seems to me that when Senator Dodd has done so much good \nin terms of arguing for openness and accountability on Wall Street, \nthis is a perfect time to say we ought to have that in the Senate. That \nis what we are going to do on a bipartisan basis today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I thank Senator Wyden for his \nleadership and for working together with me and other Senators over a \nlong period of time. I think he referred to maybe 10 years that we have \nbeen struggling to get to what we are finally getting to today.\n  In the past, we thought we had victories and they turned out to be \nhollow victories--maybe a little more openness but largely ineffective. \nSo maybe now we will finally be able to accomplish an effective \nopenness in the Senate on one of the most powerful tools a Senator has.\n  I think it gives hope to the fact that if you are right, eventually \nright wins out, even in the Senate. Long struggle does pay. I think we \nare bringing simply common sense to a process in the Senate. It is, as \nmy friend from Oregon said, transparency, and with transparency we have \naccountability.\n  The amendment Senator Wyden and I have offered would restore the \nprohibition on secret holds the Senate voted for overwhelmingly in a \nprevious Congress--the 109th Congress--and make it even more robust. As \nI said, those turned out to be largely not very effective.\n  At that time, in the 109th Congress, our measure passed as an \namendment to the ethics reform bill by a vote of 84 to 13. That bill \nnever became law, but the next Congress passed then what is referred in \nthe title of the legislation as the Honest Leadership and Open \nGovernment Act. Our provision was also originally included in that \nbill.\n  Ironically, as I have alluded to, in a move that reflected neither \nhonest leadership nor open government, our provisions were altered \nsubstantially--I might say too substantially--behind closed doors, \nbefore we had final passage.\n  The current provisions essentially say it is OK to keep a hold \nanonymous until 6 days after someone asks unanimous consent to proceed \nto a bill or a nominee. I am not going to explain how that process \nworks out, but it can be summed up in the words that it is a very \nineffective sort of transparency, hardly doing any good whatsoever.\n  The amendment that is before us says Senators must go public from the \nmoment they place the hold.\n  Perhaps I should take this opportunity to address what a hold is all \nabout. A hold arises out of the right of all Senators to withhold their \nconsent when unanimous consent is asked.\n  It goes without saying that any Senator has a right to object to a \nunanimous consent request that the Senator does not support because it \nis not unanimous unless, obviously, we all support it.\n  In the old days, when Senators conducted much of their daily business \nfrom their desk on the Senate floor, it was a simple matter to stand \nand say, ``I object'' when necessary, and, of course, that Senator was \nimmediately identified. Now, Since most Senators spend so much time off \nthe Senate floor in committee hearings, meeting\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\nwith constituents, and other sorts of obligations that we have, we have \ntended to rely upon the majority and minority leaders to protect our \nrights and prerogatives as individual Senators, asking them to object \non our behalf.\n  Just as any Senator has the right to stand on the Senate floor and \nsay, ``I object,'' it is perfectly legitimate to ask another Senator to \nobject on our behalf if we cannot make it to the floor when consent is \nrequested.\n\n  By that same token, it would be illegitimate, not to mention \nimpossible, for a Senator to stand on the floor and object anonymously. \nSenators have no inherent right to have others object on their behalf \nand keep their identity secret.\n  If a Senator has a legitimate reason to object to proceeding to a \nbill or a nominee, then he or she ought to have the guts to do so \npublicly.\n  I believe this is part of expanding the principle of open government. \nThe public's business ought to be public. Lack of transparency in the \npublic policy process leads to cynicism and distrust of public \nofficials and, quite honestly, less accountability.\n  I maintain that the use of secret holds--with emphasis upon the \nadjective ``secret''--damages public confidence in the institution of \nthe Senate. The public's business ought to be done in public, period.\n  I have made it my practice to put a statement in the Record when I \nhave placed a hold on a nominee or a bill for over a decade. I can tell \nyou that is no burden whatsoever, and it hasn't hurt me in any way \nwhatsoever to let my colleagues and the public know--for the last \ndecade--that Senator Chuck Grassley had a hold on a bill and why I had \nthat hold on a bill or nominee.\n  Our amendment--the one before us--would make it crystal clear that \nholds are to be public. Senators placing a hold must get a statement in \nthe Record within 2 days, and they must give permission to their \nleaders at the time they place the hold to object in their name.\n  Also, if a Senator objects, ostensibly on behalf of another Senator \nbut refuses to name the Senator he is objecting for and that Senator \ndoesn't come forward within those 2 days, the objecting Senator will be \nlisted as having that hold, owning that hold.\n  I wish to make it clear that we do not come to this lightly. We have \ntried other paths to accomplish our goal. I said those other paths have \nturned out to be largely ineffective.\n  We sought the advice and assistance of several majority and minority \nleaders over the last decade, and we twice tried informal policies \nissued jointly by the two leaders, in 1999 and 2003, but those turned \nout to be as flimsy as the sheet of paper on which they were written.\n  So working with two former majority leaders, Senators Lott and Byrd, \nwe crafted the policy I mentioned earlier that the Senate adopted by a \nvote of 84 to 13, which was later gutted.\n  It is this policy, with some improvements--in fact, some very needed \nimprovements--that we are introducing today. It is important the Senate \nhave the opportunity to speak on this issue as a body. I look forward \nto this vote and finally having a true victory against secrecy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                          National Police Week\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, all across the country this week, \nAmericans will honor the law enforcement officers who keep our towns \nand communities safe and pay solemn tribute to those who have lost \ntheir lives in the line of duty. National Police Week is a time to \nthank all those whose service preserves the rule of law, at great risk \nto themselves.\n  I wish to pay special tribute to one of those heroes today, Officer \nBryan J. Durman. Officer Durman was a 27-year-old, decorated, \nLexington, KY, police officer and a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. He \nwas, tragically, the first Lexington police officer to die in the line \nof duty in over 20 years.\n  This past April 29, he was responding to a noise complaint when he \nwas struck by a car and killed. He leaves behind his wife Brandy and \ntheir 4-year-old son Brayden.\n  Bryan Durman went to Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Lexington, \nwhere he was on the wrestling team. After graduation in 2001, he \nenlisted with the Air Force. He rose to the rank of staff sergeant and \nserved in both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nMore important, it was while serving in the Air Force that Bryan met \nBrandy, his wife.\n  Bryan's mother, Margaret Durman, says that from the time her son was \na small boy, she knew he would grow up to be a peacemaker. After \nleaving Air Force service in July 2007, Bryan returned to Lexington to \nkeep the peace here at home and was accepted into the Lexington police \nacademy.\n  In his 3 years of service with the Lexington metro police department, \nBryan earned great respect from his colleagues and the community. ``The \namount of support that we have received speaks volumes about the \ncaliber of person Bryan was and his character,'' says his wife Brandy.\n  For administering lifesaving CPR to a vehicle collision victim and to \na woman in medical emergency in two separate instances, Bryan received \nthe Lifesaving Award and the Exceptional Service Award. His family will \nbe presented with those awards as a small reminder that, as his mother \nputs it, Bryan ``died doing something that he loved.''\n  During this National Police Week, as we remember our peace officers \nand their families, we also remember the loved ones Officer Durman \nleaves behind: his wife, Brandy; his son, Brayden; his mother, Margaret \nDurman; his sisters, Monique Wanner, Michelle Wiesman, and Danielle \nHood; his brothers, John A. Day and David P. Durman II; his brother-in-\nlaw, Robert Fletcher; and many other family members and friends.\n  Brandy will always have a fond memory of a recent Christmas when \nBryan and Brayden received toy dart guns. Father and son spent much of \nthe day playing with their new toys. ``I found about 50 darts in the \nChristmas tree,'' Brandy says. ``They were in the sink, in the \nbathtub.''\n  The day after Officer Durman's death, Lexington police officers wore \nblack bands across their badges as a tribute to their fallen brother. \nThe bands are also a stark reminder of the hazards of the job each and \nevery peace officer in Kentucky and across the country faces every day.\n  The Senate has the deepest admiration and respect for police officers \nin every community in the Nation. We recognize theirs is both an \nhonorable job and a dangerous one. We recognize they bravely risk their \nlives for ours. I appreciate all they do. And America is grateful.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know there are a number of Senators on \nthe floor who wish to speak on unrelated matters. I wish to speak on \nthe underlying bill. I believe Senator Whitehouse and maybe Senator \nMcCaskill and Senator Bennet wish to speak on the hold issue. I merely \nask that we alternate back and forth after the next speaker speaks on \nwhatever subject they do and that I then be allowed to speak on the \nunderlying bill and then go back to the other side of the aisle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, if I may make a suggestion to my friend \nfrom Texas, as I understand, my colleagues are going to speak 2 or 3 \nminutes apiece. So the cumulative time of all three Senators will be \nabout 6 or 8 minutes. I know the Senator from Texas has a longer \nstatement to make on Senator Sessions's amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be glad to defer to them under those circumstances \nand then ask to be recognized following those 6 or 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I make that request.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question? Again, to save \ntime--the Senator from Connecticut has been very gracious to allow an \nopportunity to do this--Senator Whitehouse, Senator McCaskill, and \nSenator Bennet are all going to speak. I think that would allow us to \nset up time later for the vote, and we would have to formally offer the \namendment. Would that be acceptable to the chairman?\n  Mr. DODD. I cannot agree to anything at this point. We can certainly \ntalk with the leadership about that.\n\n[[Page S3667]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. It is acceptable to the leader.\n  Mr. DODD. I am not in a position to give that consent. That is \nsomething that has to go through leadership. Let's get the speeches \ndone so we can get back on the bill.\n  Mr. WYDEN. All right.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I congratulate Senator Wyden and \nSenator Grassley for their long effort to eliminate the secret holds in \nthis body. They thought they had succeeded in 2007 with a mechanism \nthat would scrub secret holds and make them public after 6 days. But it \nturns out that a number of our colleagues on the other side discovered \na loophole in the rule. Whether it is called the old switcheroo or \nrevolving holds or hold laundering, they found a way to defeat the \npurpose of a rule that was voted for by 84 Members of the Senate on a \nstrong bipartisan basis. That is why we are back here today.\n  I want to also add to the role of honor on this subject Claire \nMcCaskill, who has done the lion's share of the work of shepherding in \nsome cases 100 stalled nominees blockaded on the Executive Calendar \nthrough those 2007 year procedures so that we could get to the point of \nproving that there were, in fact, secret holds and that despite the \nrule, hold laundering was taking place and the rule was not being put \ninto effect and holds were being kept secret.\n  I suppose an asterisk on the role of honor should go to Senator \nCoburn, who is the one Senator on the Republican side who had the \ncourage to stand up and disclose his actual holds. Everybody else went \nto some other Senator and said: I don't want my name on this. Would you \nplease take my hold over so I can avoid the rule, keep my hold, and \nhave no accountability.\n  Perhaps there once was a reason for a secret hold, for this kind of \nbusiness to be done in the dark, in the shadows, and anonymously. I \nthink history and common sense tell us that deeds that are done in the \ndark are not usually ones of which we are proud. Certainly, the \nexperience of the last few months has shown that if there ever was a \nlegitimate use for secret holds, that purpose has evaporated. It has \nevaporated under the pressure of blocked nominees numbering, in some \ncases, over 100--a systematic approach, a systematic attempt to disable \nthis administration's ability to govern by systematically opposing \nnominees, irrespective of the merits; opposing nominees who came out of \ncommittee in a bipartisan fashion; opposing nominees who came out of \ncommittee with zero opposing votes; with Senators raising objections to \nnominees they voted for in committee. There is clearly something more \ngoing on than a sincere concern about an individual nominee.\n  Finally, this effort to what I call hold launder and to avoid the \nrule 84 Senators stood up and voted for that does nothing more than put \nyour hold in the plain light of day shows that the 2007 rule, \nunfortunately, has been ineffective and that it is time for a change.\n  I have continuing gratitude for Senator Wyden, Senator Grassley, and \nfor all those who have supported us on this issue and particularly for \nSenator McCaskill for her relentless presence on the floor, making this \nactually happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I join my colleagues in support of the \neffort Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley have led to end the corrosive \npractice of secret holds. This is a reform that is needed and cannot \nwait.\n  I have been in Washington for only about a year, but it did not take \nthat long to realize our government needs to fundamentally change the \nway it does business. Coloradans deserve a government that works for \nthem. They are tired of the petty partisanship in Washington. They want \ntheir elected officials to listen and address their day-to-day \nconcerns. I cannot think of a worse example of this dysfunction than \nthe secret hold. It is undemocratic, and it is hurting our economy.\n  Quite a few of us in the Senate--the chairman and I--have young \ndaughters, young kids who are familiar with the ups and downs of a long \ncar ride heading out on vacation. The first hour always seems to go \npretty well, full of excitement about where everybody is headed. But it \nis not long before that excitement turns to restlessness and that \nrestlessness turns to secretly doing everything they can to bother \ntheir siblings just for the sake of doing it. And every time you turn \naround, they stop and smile and claim their innocence.\n  It never occurred to me that experience would actually prepare me to \ncome to the Senate. Countless nominations and important legislation \nmake their way to the floor. Senators make speeches about the \nimportance of doing the country's business, appearing motivated to get \nthe job done, to get the American people's work done. But when the \ncameras are off, they use the secret hold to bring this progress to a \nstop.\n  Since I have been here, I have seen nominees and bipartisan \nlegislation held up for weeks, only to pass with 97 or 98 votes, all to \nscore political points and waste the American people's time and the \nAmerican people's money.\n  Earlier this year, we spent months working to reform health care. We \nhave spent a lot of time under the chairman's leadership trying to fix \nWall Street. It is past time we fix the way Washington works as well.\n  Congress must stop living under a glass dome. The Wyden-Grassley \namendment is simple. It requires any Senator seeking to hold up the \nNation's business to publicly announce his or her hold. All holds \nshould be in writing, made public for the other 99 of us and, most \nimportantly, for the American people so they can render their own \njudgment.\n  While I support this amendment, I have legislation that would go even \nfurther. My legislation would not only end secret holds, as this \namendment does, but also require that any hold be bipartisan or else it \nexpires after 2 legislative days. All holds, public or private, would \nexpire in 30 days. At that point, the pending business would be ready \nto be considered on the Senate floor.\n  The Senate was designed to be the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. Let's have the debate and put an end to these secretive attempts \nto prevent debate.\n  Once again, I thank Senators Wyden and Grassley for their leadership \nand look forward to the passage of this amendment. I also wish to \nrecognize the great work our colleague from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, \nhas done bringing this legislation to this point.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, first, let me say how grateful I am \nto Senator Cornyn for his patience. I will try to be very brief because \nI know he is waiting to address the underlying bill.\n  I think everything that needs to be said has been said. I will be \ninterested in this vote because there is a group of people right now \nwho voted for a rule that simply said: You have to disclose your secret \nholds if a certain procedure takes place. There are a bunch of people \nwho voted for that who are not doing it. I do not know how that \ncomputes in the mind of a U.S. Senator. I do not know how you vote for \na rule that requires you to disclose and then you knowingly continue to \nkeep a hold secret.\n  I had a colleague tell me the other day they had talked with a \ncolleague across the aisle about a couple of judges they desperately \nwanted to get released from the land of secret holds. This colleague \nvisited with a Republican about it, and the Republican told her: The \nleader says he has to get something for it. You have to get something \nfor it? Have we come to that, that you get to hold on to someone whose \nlife is in limbo to be a U.S. district judge until you get something \nfor it? That is not the way the American people want us to operate \naround here.\n  I know Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden have toiled in this field \nfor a long time. I appreciate their efforts. I thank all my colleagues \nwho have been helpful in us bringing this to the attention of the \nAmerican people. We now have 60 Senators who have signed a letter \nsaying they will never engage in secret holds and they want them \ncompletely abolished. The Wyden-Grassley approach is almost as good as\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\nnever. It is a very limited window, and I pray that it will work. I had \nbeen wildly optimistic it would work right after I voted for the rule \nback in 2007. I thought, this is all it is going to take. I am not as \noptimistic, frankly, right now. Games may still be played. I think we \nhave to get to 67 names on that letter.\n  The American people have to rise with their pitch forks, the way they \nare in so many other ways, and say: Enough already. Stop this \nincredibly bad habit of thinking you can hold up nominations just \nbecause you feel like it and never have to own it.\n  I encourage everyone to vote for the Wyden-Grassley amendment. I \nappreciate Senator Cornyn's patience with us this morning. I look \nforward to a vote on this amendment. I really want to find out who is \nsecretly holding right now, who votes for this amendment, and how they \nreconcile those two things.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to speak on the underlying bill, \nparticularly on the Sessions amendment to the bill, but let me just \nprecede that with some more general comments.\n  I was very concerned when I read in the most recent publication of \nNational Affairs comments from the inspector general of TARP--appointed \nto oversee that program that has now gotten completely out of control. \nMore to the point, he says what has happened since September of 2008 is \nthat we have seen further consolidation of the banking industry. \nActually, he has said what has happened is that things have actually \ngotten worse as a result of the several mergers that have actually made \nbanks larger. The implicit guarantee of moral hazard that we are not \ngoing to let these large institutions fail has contributed to them \nengaging in more and more risky conduct.\n  The problem with too big to fail and these large institutions, \nparticularly large banks with assets of over $100 billion, is that they \ncan actually borrow money cheaper than community banks in Texas or New \nYork or Connecticut or elsewhere, and they actually represent a $34 \nbillion subsidy to the largest 18 banks in America because this bill \ndoes nothing to eliminate the concept of too big to fail. Indeed, in \nmany ways, it makes it worse. It institutionalizes the concept.\n  I want to address specifically the provisions in the Dodd bill--the \nunderlying bill--which have to do with how we deal with these large \nfinancial institutions if they get into trouble. The underlying bill \nempowers the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation--which previously \nhas had no experience dealing with investment banks or other companies \nthat engage in financial transactions, other than depository banks--to \nseize a vast range of financial companies based on nothing more than \ntheir impression that the institution is in ``danger of default.''\n  Of course, we know one of the reasons we have gotten into this mess--\nwhy Wall Street has gotten into the shape it has gotten into--is \nbecause either regulators were too close to the people they were \nsupposed to regulate or they were asleep at the switch. If we empower \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation now to take on this new role \nas megaregulator in the resolution authority, it literally is going to \nhave to run these businesses--something they are not prepared to do, \nsomething they have never done before. It will actually encourage \nmanagement at the institutions that are subject to this new expanded \nauthority of the FDIC to foster stronger relationships with the \nregulators, further entangling the government with the fabric of the \nU.S. private sector.\n  This underlying legislation creates a resolution scheme for large \ncomplex financial institutions that allows the FDIC to serve in \nmultiple capacities at once--as corporate management, as creditor to \nthe corporation, and referee of the liquidation process. There is no \nquestion that in the underlying bill there are going to be enormous \nconflicts of interest on the part of the government agency itself when \nit is required to wear this many hats at the same time.\n  The underlying bill also provides the government--and here \nspecifically the FDIC--the authority to discriminate among creditors of \nthe same class. All we have to do is look at what happened when the \nFederal Government took over General Motors, where we saw the \ngovernment's $15 billion gift to labor unions to the disadvantage of \nthe bond holders. This is the same sort of abuse that is propagated and \ncontinued in the underlying resolution authority in the bill which \nneeds to be fixed. It needs to be changed.\n  This underlying legislation also forces companies that are \nfinancially sound and that have done nothing wrong to contribute to a \nfund to bail out organizations and institutions--I should say \ncompanies--that have been irresponsible and done exactly the wrong \nthing.\n  I must say I really wonder why we are rushing through this \nlegislation so fast when the very commission that Congress has created \nto report back to us--the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission--is not \nsupposed to report until December. So in the very complex and \ncomplicated area such as financial regulatory reform, we are going to \nbe denied the very report that Congress commissioned, which is due in \nDecember, that will tell us, hopefully, how to get this done and get it \ndone right.\n  I think it is a terrible mistake for us to give the FDIC this \nincredible authority and discretion which will just alter the \nrelationship again between the private sector and government. We have \nseen a tendency over the last year and a half to grow government and to \nbasically burden the private sector in ways that cause many people to \nwonder whether we are still committed to a free enterprise system or \nwhether we are going to have one government takeover after another. \nThis legislation--particularly this resolution authority--represents \nsomething that will provide for more government intervention in the \nprivate sector without making sure ``too big to fail' comes to an end.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3832\n\n  I want to talk specifically about the Sessions amendment, as I said, \nbecause the Sessions amendment restores the rule of law to the \nresolution authority that would be granted under this bill. Under \nAmerican bankruptcy law, we have an adversarial process. We have judges \nwho are independent, we have a requirement that when you walk into \nbankruptcy court you actually have to swear under oath, under the \npenalty of perjury, that what you are saying is the truth, the whole \ntruth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.\n  I don't know why we should allow these big financial institutions \nthat are covered by the resolution authority under the underlying bill \na special set of rules. Why shouldn't they be forced to operate under \nthe same rules--bankruptcy rules--that apply to every business that \ngets into financial trouble all across America today? Many scholars and \npolicy analysts have argued convincingly that bankruptcy reform would \nbe the most effective action Congress could take to protect against \nfuture financial panics and bailouts.\n  There is one note I would make of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. As \nthe Chair and my colleagues know, there was a voluminous report written \nby the court-appointed examiner who dissected the Lehman Brothers \nbankruptcy for reasons why Lehman Brothers failed. This is a 2,209-page \nexaminer's report which documents accounting gimmicks that were used to \nhide the extent of Lehman's indebtedness, which was not even known to \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission because the Securities and \nExchange Commission took the position it didn't have jurisdiction to do \nthis very sort of regulation and very sort of oversight that might have \ndetected and prevented the meltdown of Lehman Brothers and all across \nWall Street.\n  Amazingly, Richard Fuld, chief executive of Lehman Brothers, when he \nwas confronted with the examiner's report documenting the various \nmaneuvers, including one known as Repo 105 transactions, said he had no \nknowledge of the accounting maneuvers that were used to take some of \nthe financial obligations of Lehman Brothers off its books.\n  So I would ask my colleagues: Don't we want this sort of transparency \nand accountability that comes only out of a bankruptcy-type resolution \nauthority? Don't we want that kind of information so we can hold the \npeople who were responsible for these huge meltdowns of our financial \nsystem accountable? I would say we must insist on\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\nthat kind of accountability. Unfortunately, under the authority given \nto the FDIC to conduct this resolution in the Dodd bill, there will be \nno sort of report by court-appointed examiners such as the one that \nexposed Lehman Brothers' accounting gimmicks and the complete \nabdication of responsibility of the chief executive officer for not \nknowing what kind of accounting transactions were taking place and \nwhich hid a lot of their liabilities not only from him but also from \nexaminers. We would not have that kind of information.\n  That is another reason I believe bankruptcy provides a far superior \nway of handling this resolution rather than giving the FDIC--a sort of \nFDIC on steroids--the power to make these decisions without the kind of \ntransparency and accountability we need.\n  Recently, in the Wall Street Journal, a couple of professors wrote:\n\n       If there were a silver bullet in financial reform, \n     legislation would have been enacted a long time ago. There \n     isn't, but removing the special treatment of derivatives in \n     bankruptcy comes close. It could provide the basis for a \n     sensible compromise on derivatives regulation while also \n     addressing the bailout problem.\n\n  That is exactly what the Sessions amendment does. With a small tweak \nof bankruptcy law, we could assure that everyone is going to have to \nplay by the same rules, and when any financial institution goes \nbankrupt the automatic stay, which protects the court's jurisdiction to \nbe able to sort out the creditors and debtors, can be used in an \nappropriate way to deal with derivatives contracts. Currently, \nderivatives contracts are exempted from the automatic stay, which \ncreates a very dangerous risk of a run on the bankrupt entity's \nderivatives book. This could lead to a cascade effect, exacerbating \nsystemic risk. The Sessions amendments provides for timely court \nsupervision over any stay on derivatives contracts. Other than that, \nthe Bankruptcy Code would apply as it does every day in bankruptcy \ncourts across this country involving businesses both large and small.\n  So I think the Sessions amendment provides much more transparency, \nmuch greater accountability, much more certainty, and certainly helps \nrestore the rule of law to an otherwise discretionary authority over a \nFederal agency that has never exercised this kind of authority before, \none that has the very real danger of perpetuating the kind of picking \nof winners and losers that we saw in the GM bankruptcy where the \nbondholders, who were supposed to be among the most secure creditors, \nif not the most secure, were forced to take a significant loss in favor \nof unions, which happened to be more active players in the political \nprocess.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to support the Sessions amendment, \nwhich makes bankruptcy a preferable alternative to dealing with future \nfailures of financial institutions.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, we are venturing down a dangerous path \nthat threatens to put the economic future of our country in jeopardy. \nWhen the housing market collapsed, the government stepped in with a \nblank check to bail out the Nation's largest mortgage giants--Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac. When the automakers started to feel the pinch of a \ndownward economic turn, again the government stepped in, taxpayer money \nin hand, and bailed them out. When the giants of the financial market \nstarted to see their bank accounts drop below zero, again the U.S. \nGovernment stepped in to bail them out, allowing them to sidestep the \npain of their financial mismanagement--pain that was then passed on to \nhard-working Americans, many of whom are barely scraping by during \nthese difficult economic times.\n  The pain was certainly not felt by the managers of these institutions \nwhen they received exorbitant bonuses, despite their bad performance.\n  This country has witnessed bailout after bailout after bailout. Yet \nnot one piece of legislation has passed this body that would establish \nprotections for taxpayers to ensure that we do not remain on the hook \nfor bailing out these institutions every single time they mismanage \nthemselves.\n  Unfortunately, this financial reform bill that we have before us \ncontinues this trend. Last week, I offered an amendment that would have \nrestricted the size of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so they would not \ncontinue to be too big to fail. My amendment was defeated, largely \nalong party lines.\n  Senator McCain offered an amendment this week that would have reduced \nthe size of Fannie and Freddie, while moving to let them stand on their \nown so the government gets out of the business of subsidizing \nmortgages. Again, his amendment was defeated, largely along party \nlines.\n  Today, we have another chance to listen to the American people and to \nstop the bailouts of these mismanaged corporations. The amendment \noffered by Senator Sessions, of which I am a cosponsor, will do this by \ntaking away the bailout option, to, instead, force these companies to \ndeclare bankruptcy. This amendment will produce a clear set of rules \nwhich will create certainty in the marketplace, rather than continuing \nthe precedents set during the crisis where the government was allowed \nto pick winners and losers.\n  This is not the first time I fought against these bailouts. In 2008, \nwhen we were debating the bailout of the automakers, I offered an \namendment, along with Senator Shelby, that would have required the big \nthree to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At that time, I argued that this \nwas the best way to ensure the automakers would emerge in the future as \nsuccessful companies. I still believe that. Chapter 11 bankruptcy would \nhave allowed them to restructure their firms and would have protected \nthe employees of these automakers by keeping politics out of the \nprocess by eliminating the need for an auto czar. Unfortunately, the \ngovernment stepped in and, with the exception of Ford, decided to bail \nthem out. I thought this was wrong at that time, and I still believe \nthis was the wrong thing to do.\n  While we cannot erase the decisions of the past that led to the \nbailouts of the automakers, Fannie and Freddie and the financial firms, \nwe can correct course to ensure that the American taxpayers get off the \nhook for bailing out these industries in the future by forcing them to \nfile bankruptcy, should they mismanage their finances again in the \nfuture.\n  The reality is, when Americans mismanage their funds or are unable to \nstay afloat under mounting debt, they file bankruptcy. I am sure many \nwould rather have the government step in and pay off their debt, but \nthis is simply an unsustainable option.\n  The same argument can be made for bailouts of financial firms. \nBailout after bailout footed by the taxpayers will force our already \ndebt-laden country into further debt that we cannot afford to crawl out \nfrom under. We are already rapidly approaching this reality. These \nbailouts do not incentivize these institutions to minimize their risks. \nInstead, they go as far as to privatize the profits while socializing \nthe risks of their losses.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Sessions offers hard-working \nAmericans a reprieve from footing another financial sector bailout. But \nhe also discourages these companies from continuing the irresponsible \npractices that got them into trouble in the first place. Under the \nfinancial bill we are currently debating, the government will continue \nto pick winners and losers and the taxpayer will continue to foot the \nbill, unless we adopt the amendment offered by Senator Sessions. This \namendment would make these companies utilize an enhanced bankruptcy \nprocess, which would ensure that the costs are covered by the financial \ninstitutions and their creditors, not the taxpayer.\n  The amendment creates a new chapter 14 in the Bankruptcy Code that \nwill utilize many of the tenets in chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy \nbut will be for the specific use of the big financial institutions. \nThis addition to the Bankruptcy Code creates a new pathway to limit the \ncascading spread of risk and panic throughout the financial system and \nensures the more orderly wind down of these financial institutions \ninsulated from bailouts and political influence.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Sessions delivers much needed \ntransparency, accountability, stability, and due process through the \nuse of bankruptcy courts and the expertise that we have in bankruptcy \ncourts. Further, to\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\nprotect the taxpayers, it specifically denies the Federal Government \nthe authority to take over firms, dictate the terms of the \nreorganization or liquidation, and support them with Federal bailouts. \nThis amendment guarantees real reform that will result in real \nstability.\n  This is what the American people are asking us to do. They are asking \nus to make sure they are not the ones responsible for bailing out these \nfinancial giants that make poor decisions. The American people are \nworking hard to weather through these tough economic times, and we owe \nthem much more than legislation that will continue to allow the \ngovernment to pick winners and losers and will allow too big to fail to \ncontinue.\n  I hope we adopt the Sessions amendment. Unfortunately, almost every \ngood amendment that has been offered to this Wall Street bill has been \ndefeated, largely along party lines. This is an amendment that will \nactually stop too big to fail. It is a responsible amendment. It is my \nhope that we will finally adopt a good amendment to this bill.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3776\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment \nfurther about the pending amendment to make tortfeasors, under the \nSecurities Act, liable for civil damages; that is, people who engage in \nfraudulent conduct. We have a deep recession. Millions of people have \nlost their jobs. There were enormous financial losses. There were many \ncontentions of fraudulent practices being responsible for that conduct. \nIn this act, we are seeking to reform Wall Street.\n  The practice had been, the law had been, for decades, under the \nSecurities Act, someone who was cheated, defrauded by people who \npractice under the Securities Act could sue them. That would involve \nthose aiders and abettors and people in the chain beyond the principal \nwould be responsible. I have offered an amendment on behalf of myself \nand Senators Reed, Kaufman, Durbin, Harkin, Leahy, Levin, Menendez, \nWhitehouse, Franken, Feingold, and Merkley to reinstate the law prior \nto what it had been prior to the decision of the Supreme Court. The \nSupreme Court has held that aiders and abettors are not liable and that \nthere is a requirement that the defendant must have made the \nrepresentation directly to the person buying or selling the securities, \nwhich is a sharp reversal from what the law had been.\n  It is anomalous, unheard of, to have criminal liability under the \nFederal Criminal Code for aiding and abetting but not to have liability \nunder the civil claims. It is a much higher standard of proof, criminal \nculpability, to put somebody in jail than it is to establish a claim \nfor monetary damages. But that is where we find the law and we find \npeople in urgent need of this kind of standing to recover their damages \nbut also to have this procedure serve as a deterrent to Wall Street \nfraud.\n  The issue was succinctly summarized by a distinguished Federal judge, \nJudge Gerald Lynch, in a case captioned In re Refco Litigation, 609 F. \nSupp. 2d 304 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), to this effect:\n\n       It is perhaps dismaying that participants in a fraudulent \n     scheme who may even have committed criminal acts are not \n     answerable in damages to the victims of fraud. . . . There \n     are accomplices and there are accomplices: after all, in the \n     criminal context, when the Godfather orders a hit, he is only \n     an accomplice to murder--one who ``counsels, commands, \n     induces or procures'' but he is nonetheless liable as a \n     principal for the commission of the crime. Likewise, some \n     civil accomplices are deeply and indispensably implicated in \n     wrongful conduct.\n\n  So that you have aiders and abettors. There have to be people who are \nparticipants in the fraud. It simply is not a one-person operation. \nYesterday, I put into the Record the impact of these civil suits in \nfinancial recoveries compared to the lesser amounts which can be \ncollected by the SEC. Illustrative of that were two cases--Enron, where \nthe SEC recovered $450 million and the private litigants recovered $7.3 \nbillion--14, 15 times more. In the WorldCom case, the SEC recovered \n$750 million, the private litigants recovered $6.85 billion. So there \nis an enormous difference.\n  This is a subject I have had a deep concern about going back to my \nlaw school days, when I wrote a comment for the Yale Law Journal on the \nsubject, about the importance of private prosecutions. Private actions \nhave been very important--treble damages under our antitrust laws, very \nimportant under our securities laws.\n  In 1995, we restricted the scope of discovery. I urged the President, \nat that time, to veto the bill.\n  Just a very brief personal story. I was in my condo one night at \nabout 10:30, quarter of 11, I got a call from the White House. The \nPresident came on the line and said: Do you have a few minutes to let \nme read to you my veto message? Well, I had more than a few minutes. I \nwas very interested in the President's veto message.\n  But the law, nonetheless, notwithstanding the veto, the law was \nmodified.\n  There is other litigation pending to open the scope of pleading. \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure have traditionally been what we call \nnotice pleading; that is, put the defendants on notice as to the claim. \nThen, under the discovery proceedings, the party is then entitled to \nprobe into the records of the defendant because these are all \ntransactions within the sole control and possession of the defendant on \nalmost all circumstances.\n  When the Supreme Court of the United States was considering taking \nthe Stoneridge case, I wrote President Bush a letter, on August 3, \n2007, urging him to allow the Solicitor General to respond to the \nrequest of the Securities and Exchange Commission for the Solicitor \nGeneral to argue the case. The Solicitor General was precluded from \ndoing so. Stoneridge came down with a very restrictive holding that the \npeople responsible had to make direct representations to the person \nbuying or selling the securities--which is an unrealistic and \nunreasonable standard. It backed up the prior decision of the Supreme \nCourt in 1994, in Central Bank of Denver, which eliminated aiders and \nabettors from responsibility.\n  This is a very important bill. I did compliment the distinguished \nchairman for his very effective work on it.\n  I do believe it is fair and accurate to say this is one of the most \nimportant provisions of this bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wanted to note during this discussion \nsome commentary this week about something that is quite extraordinary. \nWe saw news reports this week about a perfect game that was pitched in \nthe Major Leagues recently by a pitcher from the Oakland Athletics \nnamed Braden. In all of the history of baseball, it was the 19th \nperfect game ever pitched. But it is not the only perfect thing that \nhas happened recently.\n  We have news reports now that the four biggest banks in America have \nscored a perfect 61-day run, never having lost money in 61 days. That \nis like a perfect game, batting 1,000. It is all of those things.\n  How is it that the four largest banks in the country could, for the \nfirst quarter of the year, make money every single day? Is the system \nrigged? A columnist named Jonathan Well pointed out that if you managed \na highly leveraged, diversified investment fund and have become so \nskilled at it that you had a 70-percent probability of winning on any \ngiven trading day, the prospect of your winning 63 times in a row would \nbe about 1.75 billion. Even if you had a 95-percent chance of winning \nevery day because you were so skilled at picking all of the right \ninvestments, you would have about a 3.9-percent chance of doing it on \n63 straight trading days. And yet four of the largest banks in America, \nGoldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citi, scored a \nperfect game.\n  How did that happen? Does it happen because the Federal Reserve Board \nloans them money at near-zero interest rate, and then they invest in \n10-year Treasuries at 3.8 percent? That is how you make profits every \nsingle day. Is that a rigged game? Can everyone do\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\nthat? If everyone can do that, I have got a sure-fire way here for \neverybody to make money. You get to borrow from the Federal Reserve \nBoard for near nothing, and then you can invest it in 3.8-percent 10-\nyear Treasury notes.\n  It is interesting this relates to something else we have been trying \nto do for a while. We have been trying to get information about how \nmuch money the Federal Reserve Board is lending those investment banks \nand the biggest banks in America. How much money is the Federal Reserve \nBoard giving them and at what rate? We know it is at a near-zero rate, \nbut we do not know how much and to whom.\n  The Federal Reserve Board has now been told by two Federal courts, \nyou have a responsibility to tell the American people and the Congress \nwho got your money and what the terms were and how much. The Federal \nReserve Board has said, we do not intend to tell everybody. They have \nnow appealed it to a third Federal court.\n  I have led the effort in letters to the Fed Chairman saying, you have \na responsibility here. But now this latest evidence tells us how this \ngame is played. Isn't it interesting, and isn't it pathetic, that at a \ntime when so many people wake up in the morning jobless, so many people \nare still losing money on their homes, on their assets, losing hope and \nlosing confidence in the future of this economy, that at the very top \nof the heap, some of the same firms that caused the problem that threw \nthis country into the deepest recession since the Great Depression now \nannounce they are pitching a perfect game every single day. They are \nbatting 1,000 and pitching perfect games. Why? It appears to me that it \nis not about lending money to help restore America and help firms that \nwant to expand by providing capital. It appears to me that their \nreports suggest they are once again back doing the same things they \nused to do, except this time they understand that they cannot fail.\n  They borrow money from the Fed at near-zero interest rates, and \ninvest it in Fed 10-year notes at 3.8 percent. That is about as close \nto guaranteed income as you can get. But it is not guaranteed income \nfor all of the American people, it is just for the folks at the very \ntop of the chain, the biggest financial firms.\n  Again, let my say as I do every time I come to the floor, I don't \nhave a grief against the biggest financial firms. We need big financial \nfirms. But we do not need them too big to fail. And we certainly do not \nneed to be feeding them with a strategy that says, I tell you what; we \nwill give you a deal no other American has. You get to go to a window \nat the Fed, get money for almost nothing, and then invest it back in \nFed bonds and pay 3.8 percent. We will give you a guaranteed annual \nincome.\n  I just wanted to make note. It is too often little known, and it is \nseldom raising much concern among anybody these days, that all of this \nis happening. I think it is scandalous. It seems to me worth mentioning \nthe only perfect game that is going on around here was not by a pitcher \nnamed Braden, but it is by some of the biggest financial institutions \nin the country that are not only fully recovered but have guaranteed \nincome opportunities every single day, every single day, while a lot of \nthe American people are trying to figure out, how am I going to pay the \nrent? How am I going to find another job?\n  I had come to the floor because I want to indulge--I should not say \nindulge. I wonder if the Senator from Connecticut will indulge me for a \nmoment. I have spoken to the Senator, and I recognize that doing what \nhe is doing is perhaps a cross between a migraine headache and a root \ncanal. This is tough business out here hour after hour after hour and \nday after day.\n  I respect that. I was on the floor with a piece of legislation last \nyear that took forever and it did try my patience. So kudos to my \ncolleague from Connecticut. I respect the difficult job he has.\n  I have had an amendment, along with Senator Kaufman, Senators Levin, \nCantwell, Feingold, Sanders, and so on, a Dorgan amendment No. 4008. I \nwould ask the courtesy of being able to set aside the pending amendment \nand call up this amendment. I do not intend to proceed with it, I just \nwant to get it pending. I would proceed with debate at any time that is \nconvenient. I do not want to inconvenience the Senator and the \nschedules he has. But I wish to ask if he would give me the opportunity \nto at least call it up, get it pending, and then we will proceed at a \npace and at a time that would be convenient to the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say first, I appreciate my colleague from North \nDakota's inquiry. All I am trying to do in this--and, again, everyone \ncan do that. I suppose there are about 60 amendments, and if we can \nhave everyone's amendment called up, we end up with 60 amendments \npending around the place. It adds to the difficulty of sorting it out, \nbecause obviously it takes consent to withdraw amendments, to modify \namendments, do all sorts of things. So while it seems harmless enough \nto do so, it complicates the job, which is to sequence events, because \nobviously then it takes consent to do different things, at which point, \nfor all sorts of different reasons, people can have motivations on why \nnot to give consent, including people who may oppose the amendment, for \nreasons they want the amendment pending. So I will be very candid with \nmy friend from North Dakota, it complicates my job. But, obviously, I \ndo not want to cause anyone discomfort in the process. They all have \namendments they want to bring up, and my job here is to try and \norchestrate in a way so that amendments can be brought up, be discussed \nand debated.\n  My concern is that we end up with sort of this flood. Then everyone \ncomes over, why not give everyone else the same courtesy along the way. \nIf we do, then we end up potentially with chaos, on what happens to be \na pretty good bill, I think at this juncture. More work needs to be \ndone, I will be the first to acknowledge and admit that. But there is \nno guarantee that because we are in a good spot right now and heading, \nI think, toward a good conclusion of this bill--there are those who \nfrankly would like to see it lose. I know that. There are thousands of \nlobbyists who have been hired to oppose this piece of legislation, the \nunderlying bill that is before us. They are here in town and will use \nevery mechanism and vehicle available to them to throw this off track. \nThey are very smart. They do not just get paid well, they are bright, \nand they know how to do this. Many of them, in fact, worked up in these \nbuildings for years. So they know how the place operates. They know a \nconsent to bring up an amendment is, lay it aside, and pending, and \nthey know what unanimous consent means in this body. Any one Member \nhere can object.\n\n  So it does add difficulties to the management of the bill to have an \nunlimited amount of amendments brought up and pending, of which you \nthen try to go through and orchestrate an outcome here that gets us to \na reasonable conclusion where people are given an opportunity to debate \ntheir amendments.\n  So, again, I know what I am in for once this starts. We run the risk, \nI will say--I am very blunt on the Record. If we start this process, \nwhich I am fearful will be the case, we run the risk of losing this \nbill. That is the reality. This is not hyperbole. I have been here for \n30 years, and I have watched what can happen. When you have got this \nmany opponents, the opponents of this bill who are determined to throw \nthis bill off track, to stop too big to fail, consumer protection, from \ngetting the kind of sunlight on derivatives, all of those issues, \nincluding what my colleague from North Dakota wishes to achieve, there \nare people who will use every means available to destroy this piece of \nlegislation.\n  We only have a couple of days left, maybe, and then we are going to \nmove on to other bills. I urge my colleagues here--Senator Shelby and I \nare doing our best to try and accommodate all of our colleagues. We \nhave had no tabling motions, we have had no filibusters on this bill, \nwe have dealt with literally I do not know many amendments, I think \nsome 20 or 30 amendments already. So we are moving through it and we \nare getting to everyone who is along the way.\n  So, again, if my colleagues want to go this route, I understand it, \nbut I would be less than honest if I said, does it help or hurt the \neffort. Candidly, having everyone come over and demanding they be in \nline hurts.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me say, my purpose here is not to \nadd\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\nto the burdens of the Senator from Connecticut, who is trying to get a \nbill through the Congress and signed by the President. I understand \nthat.\n  I think I tried to in my opening comments be pretty complimentary of \nthe work and understanding of the work. I agree there are times when \nthere is a straw that breaks the camel's back. I also think this camel \ncan carry a bit more. What I wish is, I think the Senator from \nConnecticut would agree that I have been to this floor a fair number of \ntimes, spoken with some passion and some vigor on things that I care a \nlot about. It is not as though I came out of a closet someplace here in \nthe cloakroom and started talking about the issue that I intend to \noffer an amendment.\n  What I wish to do, with the consent of the Senator from Connecticut, \nis ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and to \ncall up amendment No. 4008.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I will make the case again. \nThere are unlimited Members who wish to be in line. I understand that. \nI warn my colleagues, no amendment, in my view, is more important than \nthe underlying bill. Understand that if we go this route, and I end up \nwith every Member coming over and making that request--and there are \nmany more who want to do that here--once this starts, then my ability \nto get us to the conclusion of a good bill is at risk. So I am going to \nobject.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say that unfortunately when I, last evening, saw \nthe note on the desk in front of us that said ``no further rollcall \nvotes'' I had another event, and so I left the Chamber, because there \nwere no further votes, and I went to the other event.\n  I discovered later that even as I was leaving the Chamber, I \nunderstood that there were three amendments at that point made in \norder. There were, I believe, two Republican amendments and one \nDemocratic amendment that were noticed, and I think the chairman \nindicated they would be the next amendments. That is the basis on which \nI left this Chamber.\n  When I came back this morning, I understand that a fair number of \nother amendments had been called up, the pending amendment had been set \naside, and other amendments had been called up. I do not know how many. \nI think four or six amendments, perhaps, beyond the three. I was \nunaware that opportunities such as that would have existed last \nevening. I think as one Member of the Senate who has spent a \nconsiderable amount of time on this floor on this issue, had I been \naware last evening that the gate was open a bit to be able to get an \namendment pending that I have talked about many times on this floor, I \nwould have been here last evening.\n  I was not aware of that, and that is the basis on which I came this \nmorning at 11 o'clock. I hope the Senator from Connecticut would not \nobject. I would hope he would rethink that. He has every right as \nchairman to decide to manage this bill as he wishes. We cannot have 100 \nmanagers for this bill. The chairman has done a lot of work to bring \nthe bill to the floor.\n  On the other hand, this issue is not some ordinary issue. The country \nwill live with the consequences of this bill perhaps for a decade, \nperhaps more, perhaps less than a decade if we do not do the right \nthings and we suffer another economic near collapse. We will have \nanother bill on the floor for those who are here in 2 years or 5 years.\n  What I want is financial reform to be done, done well, done right. I \nwas going to say to the Senator from Connecticut, the amendment I have \noffered is an amendment that I think is very important.\n  I don't have any idea whether we have the votes for it. But I do \nthink it is one of those pieces that is essential--critical, in fact--\nin order to address financial difficulties going forward. If we don't \npierce this unbelievable building bubble of speculation that has caused \na significant part of our problem, then we will not have addressed the \nreal issues of financial reform. The issue of what are called naked \ncredit default swaps, those are newly created instruments by which \npeople make wagers with one another with no insurable interest on any \nside of the security. If we don't put a dagger in the heart of that \nkind of activity--and that is not shutting down, as my colleague from \nGeorgia said yesterday, the use of credit default swaps. It is shutting \ndown one portion of them, the largest portion that is just a flatout \ngambling device.\n  I hope we can address these issues. I think I have been respectful to \nthe chairman of the committee. I say to the chairman if I am allowed to \nset this amendment aside and offer amendment No. 4008, I will certainly \nbe willing to have a reasonably short time period for debate. That kind \nof cooperation is also important in the construct of trying to get this \nbill done. It is an amendment that should have a lengthier debate.\n  When I left the floor yesterday, the Senator from Georgia had an \namendment. I think it was 2\\1/2\\ hours later that we had a vote. This \namendment is much more consequential than that. I am willing, if we can \nat least get it pending, when the Senator from Connecticut believes it \nis appropriate to debate it, to engage in an agreement on a short \ntimeframe.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me say to my colleague, I have any \nnumber of colleagues who would like to be doing the same thing. All of \nthem believe strongly in their amendments. I am not arguing about the \nsubstance of the amendment. At the conclusion of last evening, we tried \nto establish a sequence. I have no problem putting my colleague's \namendment in the next tranche. My problem is, what do I say to the next \ncolleague who wants to do the same thing? At what point do I say: I \ncan't manage this if we are going to do it this way. Anyone can make a \nrequest, and I am trying to deal with these requests as they come \nforward and put it together in a way that allows us to go forward.\n  We will vote shortly on the Sessions amendment, a Franken amendment. \nSenator Durbin has an amendment I would like to have called up. Trying \nto get time agreements is the art of management of legislation. I do \nnot want to deprive anyone of offering an amendment. But at some \npoint--what is the point of having someone sit in this chair if we just \nall come over and offer amendments and get in line somehow and then we \nhave 60 amendments? Taking unanimous consent at some point to drop that \ncreates a problem in terms of managerial capacity.\n  My colleague will get, to the best of my ability, a chance to have \nhis amendment come up and, hopefully, an adequate amount of time to \ndebate it. I respectfully ask him to give me a chance so I don't end up \nopening the door to the next Senator making a similar passionate \nrequest. At some point we have to put a stop to this so I can manage \nthe bill and go forward. That is all I am saying.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am not unsympathetic to what the Senator is doing. It \nis the case that I, certainly as one Senator, see amendments being \noffered again and again by Senators from the Banking Committee, and \nthey had a pretty good shot at this for a good long while before it \ncame to the floor. Those of us who don't serve on that committee just \nwant an opportunity to get amendments pending and up and so on.\n  Mr. DODD. The next three amendments--those of Senators Durbin, \nSpecter, and Franken--are not offered by members of the committee.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am speaking about amendments that have been offered. If \nthe Senator objects, he has the right, but I will be back. If I am in \nthe next tranche the Senator from Connecticut announces, that is fine. \nI will be able to offer an amendment. But between now and then, I guess \nI would like to understand how the system is going to work because I \nwill continue to come and ask consent to offer this amendment. Then \nwhen we do debate it, I will have a real debate. This is the heart and \nsoul of trying to shut down a system that creates unbelievable \nspeculation in the economy and poses great danger.\n  I might point out, we should not always assume that we are in safe \nterritory on all of these issues. Colleagues probably saw the news this \nmorning. Last month's Federal budget deficit is $83 billion. Take a \nlook at what the trade deficit is. As I mentioned, in the midst of all \nthis, the biggest financial institutions in the country are batting a \nthousand. Every single day they make a profit with what I think looks \nlike a rigged system.\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\n  This bill is very important. I want the Senator from Connecticut to \nsucceed. If we don't pass a financial reform bill, the American people \nhave a right to look at the Congress and say: What on Earth are you \nthere for? What are you doing? But not just any bill, a bill that \nactually addresses the heart of the issues that caused the near \neconomic collapse of this country. That is what we need to have \naccomplished at the end of this process. That is what brings me to the \nSenate floor. I am sorry I can't get this pending at the moment. But as \nGovernor Schwarzenegger said in a previous life: I will be back, and \nsoon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3832\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of the Sessions \nbankruptcy amendment. This is critical to the current financial debate \nbecause one of the big issues in whether we treat some companies and \nsome banks differently. The current bankruptcy laws create a \npredictable rule of law. There is no arbitrary or political \ndecisionmaking. When a company can't pay its bills, it can ask for \nbankruptcy protection to restructure or liquidate in some kind of \ncontrolled fashion. This is what is meant by ``justice is blind.'' Our \ncourts, our legal system and political systems do not get involved with \ndeciding which companies have to be liquidated, go through bankruptcy. \nDuring our current financial meltdown, the government decided to pick \nwinners and losers, to bail out some companies, some banks, and not \nothers.\n  The underlying financial regulation bill makes that system permanent, \nessentially throwing out the rule of law and allowing the political \nsystem, the bureaucratic system to decide which companies need to be \ntreated differently while others have to go through the bankruptcy \nprocess. The Sessions amendment would treat all companies the same and \nallow an orderly restructuring or liquidation of banks, regardless of \nhow big they are.\n  The underlying bill abandons the rule of law. It suspends free market \nprinciples, and it perpetuates the idea that there are some companies \nthat are too big to fail and have to be treated differently. It even \nexpands that arbitrary system by giving the FDIC the ability to pick \ncompanies they think might fail and to seize them if they are not \nmeeting certain criteria. The market does not decide which company is \nfailing anymore. This becomes a political system which sets up \ncorruption and political meddling as part of the financial system.\n  There is no reason we can't have special bankruptcy courts to deal \nwith large banking institutions so their failure does not take down the \nwhole financial system. This idea that some people in Washington are \ngoing to look at Wall Street or anywhere in the country and decide \nwhich company is too big to fail, has to be treated differently, while \nthis company goes through a traditional bankruptcy process--that puts \nus right back where we are now, where people in the government can \narbitrarily take taxpayer money and bail out one company. Maybe it is \ntheir political friends and supporters--or maybe they don't bail out \nthe companies that are their political enemies. It makes no sense to \nmake bold promises to the American people that we are going to end too \nbig to fail when this bill actually makes it permanent.\n  I encourage my colleagues to consider the Sessions amendment. It \nwould take us back to a rule-of-law that is predictable, that let's \nevery company, every bank know if they can't pay their bills, they have \nto go through a predetermined system, not one that is decided by \nbureaucrats at the last minute based on criteria that could change at \nany moment.\n  Let's get this one right. The underlying bill will not do what we \npromise. The Sessions amendment will move us in the right direction to \nkeep our promises to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3991\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, let me say how thankful I am that \nSenator Dodd has worked with us to get my amendment to a vote. I know \nhow hard he has been working on this bill and how precious floor time \nis during this debate.\n  Last week I proposed an amendment with Senator Schumer and Senator \nBill Nelson to reform our Nation's credit rating industry. Today I am \nthrilled to announce that Senators Grassley, Kaufman, Durbin, Harkin, \nKlobuchar, Levin, Wyden, and Begich have joined as cosponsors. Senator \nGrassley, of course, is the ranking member of the Finance Committee and \na senior member of the Budget Committee. Senator Levin led the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations which revealed some of the \ncredit rating industry's worst abuses. Senator Kaufman has also been a \nleading critic of the rating agencies, pointing out how these agencies \nkept AAA ratings ``rolling off the assembly,'' despite consistent and \nincreasing indications that they were totally unwarranted. Senators \nDurbin, Harkin, and Klobuchar have long established themselves as \nstrong voices on behalf of consumers.\n  Over 20 of my colleagues have now cosponsored my amendment, including \nsenior members of the Senate Finance and Banking Committees. Since I \nhave filed this amendment, I have come to the floor several times to \nexplain the different aspects of it. Now that this amendment will be up \nfor a vote, I wish to step back and summarize. To underscore the scope \nof this problem, I want to explain how this amendment is a simple \ninvestor-based solution to the problem. Here it is in a nutshell.\n  There is a staggering conflict of interest affecting the credit \nrating industry. The way it works now, issuers of securities are paying \nfor the credit ratings. They shop around for their ratings, selecting \nthose agencies that tend to offer them the best ratings and threatening \nto stay away from rating agencies that are too tough on them. Because \nof this, the credit rating agencies are issuing ratings that are orders \nof magnitude higher than they should be. We know this from the record. \nWe know from the PSI release of e-mails that this was the case. This \nconflict of interest has cost American investors and pensioners \nbillions of dollars because supposedly risk-free investments have \nfailed or been downgraded to junk status.\n  My amendment will correct that conflict of interest by having an \nindependent third party assign the credit rating agency that conducts \nthe initial rating for newly issued complex financial problems. My \namendment puts investors in charge, not the government.\n  Let's take this from the top. Right now, when a bank issues a \nproduct, it gets a credit rating--it gets a couple credit ratings \nbefore they will sell their product. But the problem is, they don't get \ntheir rating from an independent agency. They don't get it from someone \nwho has a real interest in being accurate. Rather, issuing banks \ncurrently get their credit ratings from rating agencies they hire, and \nthey pay them upwards of $1 million per transaction.\n  Now, you do not have to be Adam Smith to guess what has happened. As \nwith any other financial transaction, the issuers--the buyers of credit \nratings--shopped around for ratings. When they would go to a credit \nrating agency, and the credit rating agency did not give them the \nrating they wanted, they would not hire them the next time. So the \ncredit rating agencies responded in kind. They changed their algorithms \nfor rating the products when the ratings they produced were too low, \nand, thus, they repeatedly overrated terrible securities.\n  This is not a hypothetical. The Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, Senator Levin's committee, uncovered pages upon pages \nof e-mails confirming this is exactly what happens. But I think the \nnumbers explain it the best, and we know this. Of all the subprime \nmortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 and 2007 that received a AAA \nrating, over 90 percent have since been downgraded to junk status.\n  Credit rating agencies will counter that the downgrading of AAA bonds \nto junk status occurred because of the unpredictable collapse of the \nhousing market. Two points here: The e-mails that were released in the \ninvestigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations showed \nthat the credit rating agency knew what was happening. Here is an e-\nmail from 2006. This is from one of the Standard & Poor's executives:\n\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\n\n       [T]his is like another banking crisis potentially looming!!\n\n  There was an executive who said they wished they could go public with \nthe loss figures they were seeing--this is in 2006--but that ``may be \ntoo much of a powder keg.'' And there are e-mails where they were \nsaying: We better increase the ratings so we keep getting business.\n  These were the guys who got it. Admittedly, there were guys who did \nnot get it in the credit rating agencies. But there is an old Upton \nSinclair quote, which is: You can't get a man to understand something \nthat his salary depends on him not understanding.\n  So there is this inherent conflict of interest, which is, if I give a \ngood rating to these subprime mortgage-backed securities, I am going to \nmake a lot of money; there is a lot of money here; my salary depends on \nmy not getting what is happening. That all emanates from the conflict \nof interest. That is what I am going after. That is why they either \nignored what they were seeing in 2006, or, if they got it, they did not \nsay anything about it. So some were maybe less than completely getting \nit, and others who got it were corrupt. It was all for the same reason: \nbecause of this conflict of interest.\n  These downgrades did not just result in major losses to Wall Street. \nThey resulted in multibillion-dollar losses to millions of Americans, \nespecially pension holders. CalPERS, which 1\\1/2\\ million Californians \nrely on for their pensions and health benefits, lost $1 billion. \nPensioners in Ohio lost $\\1/2\\ billion. The same story is repeated all \nacross the country.\n  This was people's retirement money. This was not people buying \nyachts. This was not people staying a night at the Waldorf. This was \ntheir retirement money. So this was the problem, the conflict of \ninterest.\n  Let me tell you how our amendment addresses this problem. My \namendment would call for a new clearinghouse, regulated by the SEC, to \nassign issuers to a credit rating agency that will give them their \nfirst rating on complex financial products. They would be assigned. \nThat means an issuer will no longer be able to shop around for a \nrating. They will not be able to pressure a rating agency into giving a \ngood score in exchange for future business. Over time, the \nclearinghouse will monitor the ratings these agencies give out and \nrefine its method of assignments. It can reward agencies that are more \naccurate and give fewer assignments to those that are less accurate. It \nwill incentivize accuracy. Imagine that. In doing so, it will give \nsmaller agencies a chance to get into the action.\n  Standard & Poor's and Moody's and Fitch do about, what, 94 percent of \nthe business. The other agencies will get a chance because what will be \nrewarded is accuracy.\n  By making these simple changes--and it is a very simple change; it is \na third party--the amendment will eliminate the fundamental conflict of \ninterest at the core--at the core--of this problem.\n  Some people are going to tell you this is a government takeover of \nthe credit rating industry. That is patently, 100 percent false. The \nclearinghouse will not issue a single rating. The clearinghouse is not \ngoing to tell credit rating agencies how to determine their ratings. In \nfact, every single rating an agency gives after being assigned a \nsecurity will have a disclaimer that says, ``This is not a government-\napproved rating.''\n  Moreover, the clearinghouse will be run by investors such as managers \nof pension funds and managers of university endowments. OK. There is \nnot a single seat on this board that would be reserved for a government \nofficial. Moreover, while the initial board members are to be named by \nthe SEC, after the initial appointments, the board itself will choose \nits future members. There will be a representative from the rating \nagencies, there will be a representative from the banks, but a majority \nwill be investors. This makes sense. We will be putting people in \ncharge who are the people who are actually buying the securities, and \nwho pay the price when the securities prove to be significantly \noverrated.\n  So let me repeat that. We are putting the buyers of securities--not \nthe government--in charge. OK.\n  The clearinghouse will be an independent, self-regulatory \norganization that operates with oversight from the SEC, just like the \nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority or FINRA.\n  Finally, this board will not act as an intermediary for every credit \nrating issued. It will only assign an agency to do the initial rating--\nthe first rating an issuer receives. The issuer is then free to seek as \nmany other credit ratings as it wants from whomever it wants, as most \nissuers currently do.\n  I am merely proposing that at least one rating--the initial rating--\nfrom an issuer be free from the conflicts of interest inherent in an \nissuer-pays system. This initial rating will then serve as a check \nagainst any possible inflation in subsequent ratings.\n  You may also have heard there are alternative proposals that would \neliminate any requirement of reliance upon a credit rating issued by an \nNRSRO. Senator LeMieux, my good colleague from Florida, will be \noffering a side-by-side to this amendment. Now, my only problem with \nthis is, this approach ignores the reality that ratings will, by \nnecessity, continue and will always play a role in our economy. \nInvestors will still rely on them even if the statutes do not mandate \nit.\n  I believe Senator LeMieux's approach does absolutely nothing to \ntackle the conflicts of interest or address the current oligopoly, both \nof which would surely persist under this approach, especially the \nconflicts of interest.\n  There is nothing in Senator LeMieux's approach that I understand is \ncontradictory at all to what I am doing. So if a Member would like to \nvote for Senator LeMieux's side-by-side, it would be fine. You have to \ndetermine for yourself the value of that. I am just saying it does not \nget at the heart of the matter, which is the conflict of interest: the \nissuer actually paying the rating agency for the rating.\n  With the help of Senators Schumer and Nelson, I have crafted a \nmeasure that is not liberal or conservative. It is not moderate. It is \nnot on any spectrum. It just makes sense. It is common sense. This is \nlike the solving of forum shopping in courts. It is an elegant \nsolution. I can say that because I did not think of it. Some professors \nin academia thought of it, and I guess the chief economist at Patton \nBoggs. It is just a simple, elegant idea. So it is not conservative; it \nis not liberal. It is just common sense.\n  That is why Senator Wicker has embraced this amendment. Senator \nGrassley has embraced this amendment. It is just plain common sense. \nThat is why Senators Levin, Johnson, Murray, Durbin, Whitehouse, Brown, \nMerkley, Bingaman, Lautenberg, Shaheen, Casey, Sanders, Kaufman, \nHarkin, Klobuchar, Wyden, and Begich also support the amendment.\n  That is why Americans for Financial Reform support it. That is why \nthe Consumers Union supports it; the Teamsters, the National \nAssociation of Consumer Advocates, Public Citizen, SEIU, and a number \nof other national organizations stand behind this amendment.\n  That is why, as I said, leading economists in academia and private \nindustry support this amendment. In fact, as I was saying, the chief \neconomist at Patton Boggs, Dr. David Raboy, who first developed a \nsimilar proposal, is squarely behind this amendment. Of course he would \nbe; he developed it.\n  That is why independent, smaller rating agencies have come out in \nsupport of this amendment. That is why this amendment cannot wait.\n  I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this \namendment.\n  I thank you, Madam President.\n  I believe my good colleague from Florida has a side-by-side which, as \nI say, in no way conflicts--I do not believe--with this amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3774, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthis important issue my friend from Minnesota has brought forth, and I \ncongratulate him on the work he has done. We know one of the main \nreasons we had our financial debacle in 2008 was that credit agencies \nfailed to do their job. They put AAA stamps of approval on products \nthat deserved no such stamp. The investing world relied upon the fact \nthat rating agencies were supposed to do their job, and they failed to \ndo their job.\n  So just as when you read Consumer Reports, and you believe they are \ngiving objective information and a good accounting of how a product is \nor is not safe, the investing world thought Fitch and Moody's and S \nand these others had done their job and had done the due diligence. So \nI congratulate, again, my friend from Minnesota. He has focused on one \nof the main reasons we had our financial debacle.\n  Unfortunately, much of what is in this 1,409-page bill does not go \nafter what caused the debacle in 2008. We do not deal with Fannie and \nFreddie. We did not pass significant underwriting standards yesterday \nin the Corker amendment. We have a chance to address the issue of the \nrating agencies, because, but for their failure to do their job, we may \nnot have had this debacle that destroyed, as some estimate, $600 \ntrillion worth of wealth.\n\n  Where I differ with my friend from Minnesota is that I don't think he \nhas gone far enough. I appreciate his efforts to go after conflicts of \ninterest. I believe there are conflicts of interest. We cannot have the \npeople whose products they rate pay them. He is right about that, but I \nwould go further. My amendment writes these organizations out of law. \nWhy should we reward them and allow them to continue to have what, in \neffect, is a government-sponsored monopoly? Federal law says \ncreditworthiness will be determined by these rating agencies. Why \nshould we reward them by allowing them to continue in any fashion to \nhave the sanction and permission and basically a monopoly granted by \nFederal law? That doesn't make any sense to me.\n  So the amendment I am proposing, again, is not, as my friend from \nMinnesota said, inconsistent with his amendment, and I believe there \nwill be Members who will vote for his amendment and my amendment. I am \nglad we are both focused on addressing this issue.\n  What my amendment will do is take away this sanctioned monopoly that \nholds out these rating agencies as the entities that determine what is \ncreditworthy. Certainly, rating agencies will still exist, but there \nwill be more rating agencies involved, plus banks themselves will have \nto do the due diligence to convince the FDIC or whoever the regulator \nis that the bonds they hold on their books are creditworthy. In a way, \nwe are saying that the astrology we relied upon in the past didn't \nwork. Let's have some new and better astrology.\n  The rating agencies don't work. Did they not work because they had a \nconflict of interest? Perhaps. Did they not work because they are \nincompetent independent of that conflict of interest? Perhaps. I hope \nwhat my amendment does will achieve both goals. They will not be paid \nby these same investment banks if they are no longer written into law, \nI believe. Plus, if they are no longer written into law, there will \nhave to be something in the marketplace that people can rely upon\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\nwhen they have to make their case to your Federal regulator that these \ninstruments are creditworthy. Someone is going to have to do their \nhomework.\n  My friend from Minnesota is exactly right that the damage done in the \nmarketplace was done in large part because of our reliance upon these \nrating agencies. The Wall Street Journal on April 21 said:\n\n       When the government ordains--\n\n  And that is an important word--\n\n     Moody's and Standard & Poor's as official arbiters of risk, \n     the damage can be catastrophic because so many people rely \n     upon them.\n\n  So let's stop ordaining them. Why are we going to reward bad \nbehavior?\n  My friend from Minnesota, who has gotten his language from professors \nand others, the language we have worked on--it is not a conservative \nidea; it is not a Democratic idea. In fact, it is exactly the same as \nthe language Barney Frank put forward on the House side. So we have a \nliberal Democrat and a conservative Republican working to the same end. \nSo let's not just go halfway. Let's go all the way. Let's make sure \nthese rating agencies don't get rewarded for bad behavior.\n  This will take some time to implement. It needs time for the market \nto adjust. There is a 2-year period in this amendment for this to take \neffect. That is important so that banks can beef up their staff to make \nsure they can do the due diligence, do the homework, to prove \ncreditworthiness. It is good for the market to settle, which it will \nneed to do, from relying upon just these three big rating agencies.\n  I believe the solution has to go the full measure. While I \ncongratulate my friend from Minnesota for tackling this issue and while \nI also don't think our two measures are inconsistent, I believe the \namendment I am proposing, which is almost exactly--similar to the \nlanguage of Barney Frank on the House side--is the right answer to \nreally get us off this ordination of these rating agencies.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Franken \namendment.\n  First, I wish to praise my colleague from Minnesota for the great job \nhe has done on this amendment. This is going to make a huge difference. \nIt strengthens the section that is already in Senator Dodd's fine bill, \non which Senator Jack Reed did great work, and now it goes a little \nfurther.\n  In particular, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for really getting \nat the heart of the conflicts of interest. We can vote around the \nconflict of interest, we can shine a mirror of light on the conflict of \ninterest, but unless we get to the heart of it, we are not going to \nundo the problem. The Senator from Minnesota does that, and I praise \nhim for his fine work. I think that if this amendment passes, it is \ngoing to be one of the lasting contributions and one of the most \nsignificant contributions to prevent a future crisis from happening.\n  Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz said:\n\n       I view the rating agencies as one of the key culprits . . . \n     They were the party that performed the alchemy that converted \n     the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not \n     have done what they did without the complicity of the rating \n     agencies.\n\n  Credit rating agencies played an important role--an unfortunate and \nimportant role--in what led up to the financial crisis. They adopted \nquestionable practices intended to win over clients and capture greater \nmarket share, ignoring the true credit quality of the complex \nsecurities at the heart of the market meltdown. They neglected their \nown internal controls and developed a coziness with clients. And \nbecause rating the complicated structured finance products brought in \nmore money to these agencies, they raced each other to the bottom, \ncompeting for clients by inflating ratings. Because the clients had an \nincentive to sell products with the highest ratings to investors, the \nrating agencies would give them advice on how to structure their \nproducts to score AAA. This race to the bottom is the easiest, \nquickest, and least disputatious. Giving an AAA rating is one of the \nmajor culprits of the financial crisis we are seeing.\n  The conflict of interest-ridden industry helped bring our economy to \nits knees. To provide one example, 93 percent of AAA-rated subprime \nmortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 have been downgraded to junk \nstatus. Is that incredible? Ninety-three percent went from AAA to junk \nstatus. That is not an accident and, frankly, that doesn't just happen \nbecause people make mistakes. There was something more pernicious at \nwork, which was conflict of interest. That is the fundamental problem. \nAgain, 93 percent of the securities the rating agencies concluded were \nof the highest quality, least risky investments, in just 2 years they \nbecame worthless. Many people lost money. Some were big investors, some \nwere small investors, some were large banks and institutions, and some \nwere pension funds that had the savings of millions of hard-working \nAmericans. Everyone suffered because of what the credit rating agencies \ndid. This bill we are debating this week makes important strides in \nholding the rating agencies accountable to their credit quality \nassessments.\n  Once again, I commend Senator Dodd, our able chairman, and Senator \nJack Reed, our able chairman of the securities subcommittee, for the \nimmense work they did in this area. Requiring the creation of a new \nOffice of Credit Rating Agencies at the SEC; disclosures of rating \nmethodologies; prohibiting compliance officers from working on ratings \nmethodologies or sales; a new liability provision; and requiring rating \nanalysts to pass qualifying exams all helps.\n\n  As I said, the provision Senator Franken is offering and I am proud \nto cosponsor goes to the heart of the conflict of interest. It doesn't \ngo around the edges of the conflict of interest but is a dagger at the \nheart. This amendment breaks that inherent conflict by having a third \nparty, a neutral third party, step in-between. Issuers will no longer \nbe able to choose a rating agency and directly influence what kind of \nratings they get.\n  The amendment establishes a board of highly knowledgeable and \nexperienced people, a majority of whom will be from the investor \nindustry, including pension funds, municipalities, and retail investors \nwho got clobbered in this financial crisis because the rating agencies \nwere getting paid by the issuer and had an incentive to issue the best \nrating possible.\n  How the heck--this is a little digression--how the heck no-doc loans \ngot AAA ratings over and over, packages of no-doc loans--what does that \nmean to the average person? It means they never asked you if you could \nafford to pay the mortgage, and they got AAA credit ratings. What was \ngoing on, and why didn't anyone catch it? Well, the Dodd part and the \nReed part of the amendment will catch it, but the Franken part of the \namendment will prevent it by having a noninterested party make a \nrating.\n  The Franken amendment establishes a board of highly knowledgeable and \nexperienced people, as I said. They have to submit their products to be \nrated to the board and, like a wheel, the board will choose a rating \nagency for each product. When I say a wheel, it is like a wheel; it \ncomes up randomly. Where did Senator Franken--and I have spoken with \nhim about this, so I know--where did he come up with this idea? This is \nhow we prevent forum shopping, bias of judges. When you go to the \nSouthern District of New York and you have a case, it is a wheel and \nyou get a judge randomly. In the past, we have found there were even \nconflicts of interest in the judiciary because you got to choose your \nown judge, just as the issuer now gets to choose its own credit rating \nagency. The wheel makes it random. You don't choose it. That is a big, \nhuge step forward.\n  The board will also monitor the performance of these ratings and \nensure the rating agencies are qualified to rate the products. This \nmodel will motivate rating agencies to develop and gain the right \nexpertise and methodologies so they can become eligible to rate \ndifferent classes of structured finance products, and the smaller \nrating agencies and investor-paid agencies will have a level playing \nfield to compete against the big three.\n  This proposal has a broad range of bipartisan support. I greatly \nappreciate not only Senator Franken's outstanding work on this issue \nbut the cosponsorship of Senators Nelson, Whitehouse, Brown, Murray,\n\n[[Page S3677]]\n\nMerkley, Bingaman, Lautenberg, Shaheen, Casey, Sanders, Johnson, \nKaufman, Durbin, Harkin, and--thank you to our Republican friends--\nSenators Wicker and Grassley.\n  So I hope we will get unanimous support for this amendment. I hope we \nwon't leave out any major provisions. I hope we won't modify it or \nweaken it. Let's stick to this amendment. It is modest and thoughtful \nand goes to the heart of what helped cause the financial crisis--the \ninherent conflict of interest in the way credit rating agencies worked.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I was going to address the underlying \nquestion here, but I know my colleague from Maine wishes to be heard on \na different amendment.\n  Let me say briefly that I appreciate the comments and I appreciate \nthe efforts of Senator Franken in this regard. Forty pages of our bill \nare exclusively dedicated to rating agencies. We spent an inordinate \namount of time on the rating agency question. This is a complex issue \nand the source of a lot of discomfort. There is a headline in one of \nthe national newspapers this morning that talks about the rating \nagencies and the problems they have posed in giving ratings to products \nthat were worth vastly less than their claims.\n  Very briefly, on the underlying bill, the SEC will have a new office \nof credit ratings to regulate and promote accuracy in ratings, staffed \nwith experts in structured, corporate, and municipal debt finance. The \noffice's own examination staff will conduct annual inspections, and the \nessential findings will be available to the public. The SEC will have \nexpanded authority to suspend the registration of agencies that \nconsistently produce ratings without integrity. It will have more \nauthority to sanction ratings agencies that violate the law, including \npenalties for management for failure to supervise employees who break \nthe law.\n  The bill imposes tough new requirements on credit rating agencies. \nRatings agency boards are subject to new rules for independence. \nRatings analysts must be separated from those who sell the firm's \nservices. Agencies must publicly disclose when they materially change \ntheir procedures or methodologies or make significant errors and update \ntheir credit ratings accordingly. Agencies must establish strong \ninternal controls for following procedures and methodologies and have \nthese attested to by their CEO to the SEC. The agencies must establish \nhotlines for whistleblowers and complaints, retain complaints about the \nfirm's work for regulators to examine.\n  Compliance officers must submit annual compliance reports to the SEC. \nThey are required to consider credible information they received from \nsources other than the issuers in making the ratings, rather than \nrelying on the--basing ratings only on the issuer's representations.\n  Investors are empowered. The agencies must disclose more about their \nratings assumptions, limitations, risks, accuracy, and factors that \nmight lead to change in ratings. Agencies must disclose their track \nrecord of ratings in a way that is in compliance so that users can \ncompare ratings for accuracy across different agencies.\n  It also will have the benefit of having new pleading standards so \nwhen private suits are brought, they will be able to have actions \nbrought against these rating agencies.\n  The issuer or underwriters of any asset-backed security shall make \navailable any due diligence reports, and on and on.\n  The point I want to make is we have spent a lot of time on this \nissue. A lot of work went into this issue. My colleague from Minnesota \nhas what I think is a good and sound idea. Here is my concern as \nchairman of the committee. I do not know what the implications are \nbecause we have had no real examination of having the wheel about which \nmy friend from New York talked. Not all rating agencies are equal. \nThere ought to be more of them. There are smaller ones out there that \nought to be able to grow in their competency and do things. But there \nare companies of different sizes and needs, and merely changing a \nrating agency based on an arbitrary choice without considering whether \nthe rating agency can do the job is my concern.\n  I like the idea because what it does do is get away from the conflict \nof interest. That is as it presently exists. Here is the quandary we \nhave: Right now, the company that seeks the rating agency pays the \nrating agency. Obviously, on its face, you have a problem. If I am \nbuying a service from you--and by the way, I would like to get a AAA \nrating--I have a pretty good chance of getting it whether I deserve it \nor not. The alternative idea, somebody said, is why don't you have the \nbuyers of the rating agency? There is a similar problem. They might \nlike to have a DDD rating to lower the value. So you have a conflict on \neither side of this question that is difficult and difficult to \nresolve.\n  Compound the problem with the fact that the rating agencies, as \npresently construed, prior to our language in this bill, basically rely \non the information from the very purchase of the rating agency to \ndetermine whether it is a good product. There is no due diligence done \nby the rating agency. Our bill changes all of that.\n  It is with a great deal of reluctance--as I said to my colleague from \nMinnesota, I was prepared to take a good study of this; in fact, \nlanguage that would recommend the SEC and others--the SEC has authority \nunder existing law to deal with conflicts of interest. They have the \npower to do it. Whether they do it is another matter. That is always \nthe issue with a regulator.\n  I am concerned what this means. I say that respectfully to the \nauthor. He has worked hard on this amendment. There are a lot of good \nideas in it. I am just uneasy about what the implications can be. I \nwould be remiss if I did not express that as chairman of the committee \nhaving spent hours listening to the debate back and forth.\n  On the amendment offered by our colleague from Florida, there is a \ndifferent set of issues I have, but I also have to express my \nopposition to that amendment. The reason is because very simply we know \nthat credit ratings are far from the perfect measure. We know that. We \nwrestled with this.\n  I agree that the markets may place too much reliance on credit \nratings. But the way to address the problem is not to simply repeal the \nsafety and soundness provisions of the law. That is what he is asking \nus to do.\n  While I have problems with the present system and we made major \ninroads on how to address that in ways we thought made some sense, the \nidea of the Senator from Florida that because we are not happy with the \npresent structure--although I think the bill before us does an awful \nlot in 40 pages to deal with how this is to be accomplished--he repeals \nall of it. Someone may have a better idea out there, but to get rid of \nwhat we have, leaving a vacant space, in a sense, is not my view of the \nway this ought to be addressed. Congress could not simply repeal safety \nand soundness laws without careful prior study of the impact on the \nmarkets. That is what we are doing with the LeMieux amendment.\n  Our bill sets out a process by which overreliance on these rating \nagencies can be reduced without creating risk throughout the financial \nsystem. That is my concern. Stripping everything out of safety and \nsoundness in this area does not get you safety and soundness.\n  With regard to both amendments, I am more attracted to the amendment \noffered by Senator Franken, and I like the idea of where he is going. I \njust do not know whether it is sound. Again, it is the kind of thing I \nwish to see examined--and that is not to suggest he has not done that--\nwhere you take the time and go through the process.\n  It is with some reluctance that I express my opposition to both \namendments and urge my colleagues to review, if they care to, the 40 \npages of effort we have made in our bill.\n  Jack Reed of Rhode Island deserves a lot of credit for having worked \nparticularly hard on the rating issue in our committee and the \nsubcommittee dealing with securities. We think we have a strong bill in \nthese areas. I would be the first to say it is far from perfect, but we \ndid our best to find a way to get far greater responsibility and \naccountability out of the credit rating agencies. There is a great \nconcern here that accountability and responsibility needs to be taken \ninto consideration.\n  As I said, our bill has 40 pages of safeguards to strengthen the SEC, \nempower investors, and to make rating\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\nagencies far more responsible and accountable.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3883\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise to speak today on amendment No. \n3883, which is pending, which I have offered with my good friend and \ncolleague from Arkansas, Senator Pryor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Pryor be able to follow my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How long does the Senator expect to take?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator from Maine know how long Senator Pryor \nwill take?\n  Ms. SNOWE. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, the amendment that is pending that we \nhave offered--and I add that also has been cosponsored by Senator \nGraham and Senator Menendez--would ensure that small businesses are \nconsidered in the federal rulemaking process by the Bureau of Consumer \nFinancial Protection that would be created in this bill.\n  The more attentive we are with respect to small businesses and the \nissues incorporated in this legislation, the better small businesses \nwill be in their ability to create jobs and to survive what is a very \ndifficult and tragic economic environment.\n  This amendment would ensure that when the newly created bureau \npromulgates rules and regulations, it fully considers the economic \nimpact those rules and regulations would impose on our Nation's more \nthan 30 million small businesses that have created 64 percent of all \nnew jobs over the past 15 years and no question will drive our Nation's \neconomic recovery. Indeed, we are depending on these small businesses \nto lead us out of this jobless recovery.\n  We know a jobless recovery is not a true recovery. We have more than \n15 million Americans who are unemployed or underemployed. Clearly, it \nis going to be small businesses that pave the way toward employment.\n\n  Plain and simple, onerous regulations are crushing the \nentrepreneurial spirit of America's small businesses. In 2009 alone, \nthere were close to 70,000 pages in the Federal Register, and the \nannual cost of Federal regulations now totals more than $1.1 trillion. \nFurthermore, according to the research by the Small Business \nAdministration's Office of Advocacy, small firms--and this is no \nsurprise--bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 45 \npercent more per employee in annual regulation compliance than larger \nfirms.\n  The amendment we are offering today would ensure small business \nfairness and regulatory transparency by first designating the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau as a ``covered agency'' under the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act so that small business review panel \nprovisions would apply to the bureau's rulemaking. These advisory small \nbusiness panels currently apply to EPA and OSHA and have been extremely \nsuccessful in helping to shape more workable regulations at these \nagencies for small businesses across America.\n  Since 1996, when these small business panel provisions were passed \nunanimously in the Senate and signed into law by then-President \nClinton, the EPA has convened 35 panels and OSHA has convened 9 panels. \nThe findings of the panel reports have helped EPA and OSHA improve \ndraft proposals by tailoring regulatory approaches to the unique \nsituations of small businesses.\n  I know there are some who will argue that my amendment will undermine \nthe rulemaking capacity of the bureau. This simply is not the case. \nAccording to the SBA Office of Advocacy report, ``The panel process \ndoes not replace, but enhances, the regular notice-and-comment \nprocess.''\n  The Office of Advocacy has also found that these small business \nreview panels have facilitated ``revisions or adjustments to be made to \nan agency draft rule that mitigated its potentially adverse effects on \nsmall entities, but did not compromise the rule's public policy \nobjective.''\n  Others have expressed concern that these small business advocacy \nreview panels should not apply to the bureau because they apply to no \nother financial regulatory authority. Unfortunately, there is continued \nfrustration by leaders in the small business community toward \ngovernment agencies and one-size-fits-all regulation. Independent \nagencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, and \nits approach to regulation under Sarbanes-Oxley, and the Federal \nCommunications Commission, the FCC, and its rulemaking governing \ntelecommunications practices are too often cited as failing to \nadequately consider their impact on small business prior to issuing new \nregulatory mandates. This is why it is vital that small business \nrequirements apply to the new independent agency that is created in the \nunderlying legislation.\n  Still others will argue that our amendment is unnecessary because my \nearlier amendment to this legislation provides for an exemption for \nsmall businesses from the regulatory requirements of the bureau. \nHowever, we must go further to ensure that rules that the bureau \npromulgates do not unintentionally impact small firms' job creation \ncapacity. That is why our amendment would also specify during the \nrulemaking process the bureau must consider the economic effects its \nrule would have on the cost of credit for small businesses.\n  According to a recent National Federation of Independent Business, \nNFIB, survey--and that is the foremost organization that speaks for \nsmall businesses--42 percent of small business owners use a personal \ncredit card for business purposes. It is imperative that small business \ninterests are fully considered when the bureau issues regulations on \nconsumer credit cards, so that however well-intentioned, the bureau \ndoes not inadvertently cut off vital small business credit sources, \nespecially during these tenuous economic times when a recent Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation survey noted that banks posted their \nsharpest decline in lending since 1942.\n  That is a big issue right now because lending is not occurring to \nsmall businesses. That is one of the issues we must address in any \nsmall business tax relief package. Those discussions are ongoing right \nnow with the Treasury Department and the Administrator of the Small \nBusiness Administration, Karen Mills, with Chairman Landrieu of the \nSmall Business Committee, myself, and key staff from the Finance \nCommittee, and the leadership of both the Republican and Democratic \nsides because it is so critical. If we cannot get access to lending to \nsmall businesses, jobs cannot be created.\n  We do not want to compound the problem with the creation of this \nbureau that ignores the implications when it comes to applications for \ncredit from small businesses. After all, all the entities under this \nlegislation--even the smaller institutions--all the entities will be \ncovered under this bureau with respect to regulations. We must make \nsure that the smallest financial institutions' voices are heard because \nthey are the ones that primarily provide access to small businesses, \nnot to mention the credit card companies that also will certainly be \nregulated under this bureau.\n  We want to make sure we are not just having the big institutions' \nvoices heard but not the small financial institutions and not how it \nwill affect small businesses throughout the country.\n  To give an understanding of how strongly regarded and supported this \nlegislation is, we have a broad cross-section of stakeholders who \nsupport this amendment, more than 23 organizations that represent \nmillions and millions of small business owners. I am going to list them \nnow because they are so important, given the support they are providing \nthis amendment and how critical they think it is to the functioning of \nthis bureau and being cognizant of the regulations that are issued, \nthat they do not adversely affect the well-being of small businesses \nduring these tumultuous economic times. You have the Associated \nBuilders and Contractors, the Association of Kentucky Fried Chicken \nFranchisees,\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\nthe Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association, Hispanic Leadership Fund, \nIndependent Electrical Contractors, Institute for Liberty, \nInternational Franchise Association, the National Association for the \nSelf-Employed, the National Federation of Independent Business, the \nNational Lumber and Building Material Dealers Association, the National \nRestaurant Association, the National Roofing Contractors Association, \nthe National Small Business Association, the Printing Industries of \nAmerica, the S Corporation Association, Small Business & \nEntrepreneurship Council, Society of American Florists, the Society of \nChemical Manufacturers & Affiliates, the Tire Industry Association, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Black Chamber of Commerce, the \nUnited States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and the Women Impacting \nPublic Policy.\n\n  As you can see, a broad array of stakeholders are so concerned about \nthe pending legislation with respect to this bureau that they support \nthis amendment.\n  These groups have sent a letter as well to both the chairman and the \nranking member of the Banking Committee as well as the majority and \nminority leadership because they are so concerned about the underlying \nlegislation, the creation of this Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nand how it will affect small businesses. I wish to quote from their \nletter. It says that our amendment is:\n\n     . . . an effort to prevent unintended consequences by a new \n     agency that could harm the small business sector . . . and \n     provides assurance that small business access to credit is a \n     top consideration by Bureau officials as they take on the \n     important task of overseeing our financial sector.\n\n  Just to give you another indication of how supportive and how \nimportant these advisory panels are--the ones that would be created in \norder to review the regulations that would be issued by this bureau--\nthis would be before they issue the proposed rule that these advisory \npanels would be created--this has occurred under EPA as well as OSHA \nsince 1996. To give an illustration of the rules that have been \nreviewed through these advisory panels that are created--within a 60-\nday period, I might add, they would be required to report to the bureau \non their assessment of any particular rule before they propose and \nissue that rule so we can understand the ramifications. The EPA has \nissued rules that created an advisory panel on groundwater, radon and \ndrinking water, arsenic and drinking water, and diesel fuel \nrequirements, just to give an illustration.\n  Since 1996, these advisory panels, as the SBA Office of Advocacy has \nindicated in their materials, has provided extremely valuable \ninformation on the real-world impact--and that is important to \nunderstand, the real-world impact, when a small business has to digest \nand to live by and to implement any rules and regulations issued by \nthis bureau and the compliance costs of these agency proposals. So, \nclearly, this will have enormous benefits to small businesses because \nwe will have a chance to review, in advance, through these advisory \npanels that would be comprised of the rulemaking agency--in this \ninstance it would be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--\nrepresentatives of the small business community, as well as the Office \nof Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory \nAffairs. So there would be a broad array of voices including small \nbusiness concerns to examine these rules before they are proposed for \nthe rulemaking process.\n  Doesn't that make sense? Isn't it important to understand the \nramifications before we issue these regulations that could have adverse \nconsequences for small businesses as they attempt to survive during \nthese tenuous economic times?\n  The SBA Office of Advocacy has indicated in their materials with \nrespect to how these panels work--and, again, they are required under \nlaw within 60 days to make a proposal to the bureau in terms of the \nramifications or the effects or other considerations that ought to be \nincorporated as they issue their proposed rule.\n  The purpose of the panel process is threefold, and this is from the \nSBA Office of Advocacy. First, the panel process ensures that small \nentities that would be affected by a regulatory proposal are consulted \nabout the pending action and offered an opportunity to provide \ninformation on its potential effect. Second, a panel can develop, \nconsider and recommend less burdensome alternatives to a regulatory \nproposal when warranted. Finally, the rulemaking agency has the benefit \nof input from both real-world small entities and the panel's report and \nanalysis prior to publication.\n  Doesn't it make sense? It saves everybody a lot of aggravation, a lot \nof money, a lot of energy that would have to be devoted in the \nrulemaking process after they issue the proposal rather than before \nthey issue the proposal for the rulemaking process.\n  It clearly does make sense and that is why it has worked so well for \nEPA and OSHA and that is why it will work well under this circumstance \nand most especially during these times when we are creating this bureau \nthat will have a wide-ranging effect on financial institutions all \nacross this country that ultimately will affect the more than 30 \nmillion small businesses, because 42 percent of them depend on personal \ncredit cards for credit. We want to make sure we are considering the \nconsequences of anything that is done.\n  Also, the downstream effect of bank regulations would be considered \nas well as a potential effect of a regulation by this bureau. When \nbanking practices are restricted, they do not just affect consumers, \nthey also affect small businesses--higher capital requirements tighten \nthe availability of credit for small businesses. That is another \nexample of a potential rule that would come out of this bureau that \ncould directly affect small businesses. So it is not only consumers, it \nis also small businesses.\n  The regulation of angel investors--a very important fact. In fact, \nNFIB has written on this question because there will be subsequent \namendments to address this issue as well. But the regulation of angel \ninvestors also affects the economic well-being of small businesses \nbecause they use them as a source of capital. I know that NFIB is \nconcerned about the reduced pool, as they have indicated in their \nletter, with respect to angel investors. Many small businesses depend \non these individuals who invest to provide that kind of startup capital \nin their businesses. There are other significant small entities in the \nfinancial products industry who are likely to be overlooked in the \nbureau's rulemaking process. The panel requirement will benefit these \nbusinesses and will benefit the bureau's consideration of how their \nrules should be tailored to minimize the impact on these businesses \nwhile maximizing the intended benefits overall for small businesses.\n  This is not anything unique to what we don't already know about how \nimportant the Regulatory Flexibility Act is overall. Every agency is \nrequired to consider the effect of any rule or law and how it is going \nto have implications on small businesses and two agencies--the EPA and \nOSHA--are required to establish advisory panels when it is determined \nrules are going to be issued that have consequences on small businesses \nand that gives them the opportunity to have input into the process \nbefore this bureau issues those rules.\n  I think it makes a great deal of sense. It is reasonable, it is \nlogical, and it averts any unintended consequences in the onset of the \nprocess rather than waiting to see how well it takes effect, and then \nwe discover that, in fact, it depresses the ability of small businesses \nto create jobs or to survive.\n  So I hope we can get very strong support for this legislation. I am \nvery appreciative of the work of my colleague, Senator Pryor, with whom \nI work on the Small Business Committee. He does a great job and has \nprovided a great deal of input into the drafting of this legislation, \nand I appreciate his leadership. I appreciate the fact that it is done \non a bipartisan basis because I think we all recognize the pivotal role \nsmall businesses play in today's economy and will certainly depend on \nplaying a critical role in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a report \nregarding the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\n\n\n                                TABLE A.4--SBREFA PANELS THROUGH FISCAL YEAR

Register.\n2 Proposed rule was withdrawn August 18, 1999. EPA does not plan to issue a final rule.\n3 Proposed rule was withdrawn on April 26, 2004. EPA issued a new proposal November 28, 2008.\n4 Proposed rule was withdrawn on December 31, 2003. OSHA does not plan to issue a final rule.\n ** In process.\n\n                     Chapter 41--Regulatory Panels\n\n       In 1996, SBREFA amended the RFA to include a number of \n     important provisions. One of those was section 609, which \n     requires, among other things, that certain agencies conduct \n     special outreach efforts to ensure that small entity views \n     are carefully considered prior to the issuance of a proposed \n     rule. This outreach is accomplished through the work of small \n     business advocacy review panels, often referred to as SBREFA \n     panels.\n\n\n                      who must hold SBREFA panels?\n\n       The statute requires that the Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration (OSHA) evaluate their regulatory proposals to \n     determine whether SBREFA panels should be convened. The \n     requirement for SBREFA panels may appear to impose additional \n     steps for EPA and OSHA in their rulemaking processes. \n     However, the panel process only formalizes the outreach \n     requirements and analyses that the Administrative Procedure \n     Act and the RFA already mandate for all new rules that affect \n     small businesses. Any additional work that may be needed in \n     this special early outreach effort should be offset by time \n     saved at the other end of the regulatory process. When \n     problems are resolved before a proposed rule is published, \n     objections from the public are reduced. Experience has shown \n     that the panel process results in better rules, better \n     compliance and reduced litigation. In at least one instance, \n     EPA withdrew a regulatory proposal based on work performed in \n     connection with the panel process.\n\n\n            how is the decision to hold a SBREFA panel made?\n\n       For each proposed rule, the RFA requires that an agency \n     either certify that the proposal has no significant economic \n     impact on a substantial number of small entities, or prepare \n     an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) on the \n     proposal. Whenever EPA or OSHA determines that a regulatory \n     proposal may have a significant economic impact on a \n     substantial number of small entities, the law further \n     requires that the agency convene a SBREFA panel. This SBREFA \n     panel outreach must take place before the publication of the \n     proposed rule. SBREFA panels are required for all EPA and \n     OSHA rules for which an IRFA is required. However, the Chief \n     Counsel for Advocacy may waive the panel requirement upon the \n     request of EPA or OSHA under certain conditions. To waive the \n     panel requirement, the Chief Counsel must find that convening \n     a panel would not advance the effective participation of \n     small entities in the rulemaking process. Section 609(e) of \n     the RFA lays out several factors in making this \n     determination, including consideration of whether small \n     entities have already been consulted in the rulemaking \n     process and whether special circumstances warrant the prompt \n     issuance of a rule.\n\n\n                     how does a SBREFA panel work?\n\n       A SBREFA panel consists of a representative or \n     representatives from the rulemaking agency, the Office of \n     Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory \n     Affairs (OIRA) and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy.\n       The panel solicits information and advice from small entity \n     representatives (SERs), who are individuals that represent \n     small entities affected by the proposal SERs help the panel \n     better understand the ramifications of the proposed rule. \n     Invariably, the participation of SERs provides extremely \n     valuable information on the real-world impacts and compliance \n     costs of agency proposals.\n       The law requires that a SBREFA panel be convened and \n     complete its report with recommendations within a 60-day \n     period. The formal panel process begins with the convening of \n     the panel by the rulemaking agency. The date is normally \n     fixed after consultation with both Advocacy and OIRA. Before \n     convening, the three agencies usually work together to \n     discuss regulatory alternatives and their advantages and \n     disadvantages. The rulemaking agency usually has preliminary \n     discussions with small entities about its draft proposal \n     before the panel is formally convened. These preparations \n     ensure that the panel process can be completed during the \n     statutorily specified 60-day period.\n       The product of a SBREFA panel's work is its panel report on \n     the regulatory proposal under review. The panel completes its \n     final report, including its recommendations, early in a \n     rule's developmental stages, so that the agency has the \n     benefit of the report's findings prior to publication of a \n     proposed rule. The panel report also becomes part of the \n     official docket for the proposed rule.\n       The purpose of the panel process is threefold. First the \n     panel process ensures that small entities that would be \n     affected by a regulatory proposal are consulted about the \n     pending action and offered an opportunity to\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\n     provide information on its potential effects. Second, a panel \n     can develop, consider, and recommend less burdensome \n     alternatives to a regulatory proposal when warranted. \n     Finally, the rulemaking agency has the benefit of input from \n     both real-world small entities and the panel's report and \n     analysis prior to publication.\n\n\n                    suggested SBREFA panel timeline\n\n       The RFA provides that the formal panel process must be \n     concluded within 60 days from the formal convening of the \n     panel to the completion of its report. Experience has shown \n     that the panel process works best if agencies and panel \n     members accomplish as much preliminary work as possible \n     before the formal convening of the panel. A suggested \n     timeline follows, although panel members have flexibility to \n     adjust their pre-panel work schedules to ensure the best \n     outcome for each individual rule.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I yield the floor and now also yield to \nthe Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, at this point I wish to thank my \ncolleague from the State of Maine. She has been a great leader in small \nbusiness matters. She and I serve on the Small Business Committee \ntogether, and we have been working for, I guess, 3 years now on the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act and other related efforts to try to make \nsure the proper environment exists in America for small businesses to \nthrive and for entrepreneurs to be successful.\n  This amendment would make certain that key provisions of the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, which require that Federal agencies fully \nconsider during the rulemaking process the economic impact on small \nfirms, would apply to the CFPB created in the bill offered by Senator \nDodd. This amendment would ensure that the newly created CFPB, when it \nis promulgating its rules and regulations, fully consider the economic \nimpact those rules and regs would impose on our Nation's almost 30 \nmillion small firms, which have created 64 percent of all the new jobs \nin this country over the last 15 years and, undoubtedly, will drive \nthis Nation's economic recovery.\n  The last point I wish to make before I make a few closing comments is \nthe fact that we, as the Senate and as the House, should be aware and \nshould address the fact that onerous regulations can crush \nentrepreneurial spirit for America's small businesses. In 2009 alone--\nlast year--during a recession, there were close to 70,000 pages added \nto the Federal Register of new regulations. The annual cost of \ncomplying with Federal regulations totals about $1.1 trillion.\n  I am not saying we should end all regulation. I think most of these--\nor at least a lot of these--make a lot of sense and there are good \nreasons for a lot of them. But we have to be careful and we have to \nunderstand the impact that these regulations have on small businesses. \nWe want our small businesses to thrive. We want our small businesses to \nbe successful. If we are not careful, an agency such as the CFPB--and \nthere are many other Federal agencies--can create rules and relations \nthat actually choke off business opportunities for entrepreneurs and \nfor small businesses.\n  So I am proud to join my friend and colleague from Maine on this \namendment, and I would encourage other colleagues to look at this \namendment, look at the text of the amendment. I have enjoyed working \nwith the Senator from Maine, over the last few years, when it comes to \ntrying to help small businesses.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3808\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I come to the floor to support the \namendment of the Senator Franken, amendment No. 3808, along with his \ncosponsors. This will address a major unresolved cause of the financial \nmeltdown.\n  The cause which this amendment focuses on is the flawed and \ninaccurate credit ratings that labeled poor-quality mortgage-backed \nsecurities and high-risk collateralized debt obligations as AAA \ninvestments. AAA means they were on par, in the view of these rating \nagencies, with U.S. Treasurys. Investors from pension funds, to \nuniversities, municipalities, insurance companies, and more lost \nhundreds of billions of dollars, in part, because of these ratings.\n  How did the credit rating agencies get it so wrong? A big part of the \nanswer--one that would be remedied by the Franken amendment--is the \ninherent conflict of interest that now permeates the credit rating \nindustry. I am going to read from a few e-mails we uncovered and \ndisclosed at our hearings. We had long hearings. We have been \ninvestigating this economic meltdown that we had--the financial \nmeltdown--for about a year and a half. One of the four hearings we had \nwas looking at the credit rating agencies--looking at Standard & \nPoor's, looking at Moody's--and looking through their documents, which \nwe subpoenaed, literally, by the millions.\n  Listen to some of these e-mails, and we want to focus on what this \nconflict of interest is. If you want to get a feel for how it is that \nthe credit rating agencies are being paid by the very people whose \nfinancial instruments they are doing the ratings of, listen to just a \nfew of these e-mails which we got.\n  One Standard & Poor's analyst wrote that a ratings model that could \nhave been released months before wasn't because we had to massage the \nsubprime numbers; if ``we didn't have to massage the sub-prime . . . \nnumbers to preserve market share.''\n  Inside Standard & Poor's you have their analysts saying we had to \nmassage the numbers on this financial document. Why? Not because the \nrating required it or because the merits required it, but in order to \npreserve their market share they were massaging the subprime numbers.\n  Here is an e-mail from a UBS banker warning Standard & Poor's not to \nmake it harder to get high credit ratings. This is a UBS banker, \ntalking to the credit rating agency:\n\n       Heard you guys are revising your residential [mortgage \n     backed security] rating methodology. . . . Heard your ratings \n     could be 5 notches back of mo[o]dy's equivalent. This is \n     going to kill your [residential business]. It may force us \n     [UBS] to do moodyfitch only cdos.\n\n  The Standard & Poors manager who received the e-mail asked a \ncolleague, ``[A]ny truth to this?'' The response:\n\n       We put out some criteria a couple of weeks ago that we will \n     begin to use for deals closing in July. . . . We certainly \n     did not intend to do anything to bump us off a significant \n     amount of deals.\n\n  They are worried about their deals. They are worried about their \nbottom line. The country worries about whether those AAA ratings are \nreal.\n  Here is another example, called Vertical ABS. A major bank asks \nStandard & Poor's and Moody's to rate one of these financial \ninstruments. The bank refused to cooperate with the analysts--so the \nbank is not working with the analysts at Standard & Poor's and Moody's \nto rate a CDO. One analyst now is complaining to another, inside of \nthis credit rating agency.\n\n       Don't see why we have to tolerate lack of cooperation. \n     Deals likely not to perform.\n\n  ``Deals likely not to perform,'' one analyst inside to another. That \nis Exhibit 94b, by the way, if anyone wants to look it up.\n  Despite the analyst's judgment that financial instrument, that CDO, \nwas unlikely to perform, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's rated it, \ngiving AAA ratings to the four top levels of that particular CDO. What \nhappened? Six months later both agencies downgraded that financial \ninstrument and it later collapsed.\n  One more example. In June 2007, a Moody's analyst sent an email to a \nMerrill Lynch banker stating that he could not finalize a rating until \nthe issue of fees was resolved. The Merrill Lynch banker responded: \n``We are okay with the revised fee schedule for this transaction. We \nare agreeing to this under the assumption that this will not be a \nprecedent for any future deals and that you will work with us further \non this transaction to try to get to some middle ground with respect to \nthe ratings.'' Moody's assured the Merrill analyst that its deal \nanalysis was independent from its fees, but it is clear as glass what \nis going on here. That is Exhibit 23 from our hearing.\n  It is past time to tackle the conflicts problem. This bill is the \nright legislation, and the Franken amendment takes the problem head on. \nIt would direct the SEC to create a self-regulatory organization, a \nclearinghouse or SRO, to develop a method of assigning credit rating \nagencies to provide initial ratings to structured finance products. The \nentity would have the discretion to develop its own methodology for \nassignment--it could use a rotating system or a formula, just as long \nas the\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\nissuer doesn't get to choose the rater. It wouldn't set prices or issue \nratings, it would just act as an intermediary between issuers and \nraters. In addition, it could increase the number of assignments to a \nparticular credit rating agency, based on that agency's past \nperformance, or decrease assignments in the case of poor performance, \ncreating a key incentive for accurate ratings.\n  The amendment would also permit issuers to go to whichever credit \nrating agency they wanted for second or third ratings.\n  I commend Senator Franken for this far-sighted effort to correct the \nconflicts problem. If we don't fix it now, we are going to be right \nback here with another financial crisis fueled by inaccurate, \nconflicts-ridden credit ratings.\n  I want to note that, while this amendment attacks the most important \nproblem with CRAs, there are a number of other problems that also need \nto be addressed in the credit rating agency area. To me, the most \nimportant remaining problem is eliminating the current statutory ban \nthat prevents real SEC oversight. This is what current law says right \nnow in 15 U.S.C. section 78o-7(c)(2):\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the \n     Commission nor any State (or political subdivision thereof) \n     may regulate the substance of credit ratings or the \n     procedures and methodologies by which any nationally \n     recognized statistical rating organization determines credit \n     ratings.\n\n  To me, that statutory ban against looking at the substance of a \nrating or the procedures or methodologies used to produce that rating \nis absurd. It ought to be eliminated. We can't give the SEC the \nresponsibility for overseeing credit rating agencies and then prevent \nthem from looking at the substance of a rating or the procedures or \nmethodologies used to produce that rating.\n  I have introduced an amendment with Senator Kaufman that would \neliminate that statutory provision and direct the SEC to set standards \nand exercise oversight of credit rating agency procedures and \nmethodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data and models, \nto ensure that the ratings have a reasonable basis in fact and \nanalysis. Given the overwhelming evidence at our hearing about basic \nflaws in the rating models, how the models were tweaked to help \nclients, and how the models were ignored when agencies wanted to \ninflate ratings, it defies common sense to prohibit the SEC from \nlooking at the models and the procedures.\n  The Levin-Kaufman amendment would also preclude the credit rating \nagencies from relying on due diligence that they had reason to believe \nwas wrong. Our investigation showed that the credit rating agencies \nknew that they were relying on bad information because of the rampant \nfraud and weak underwriting standards, and this led to bad ratings. \nAgain, this is a commonsense fix, that we hope to offer later or have \nincorporated into a managers amendment.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the much-\nneeded Franken amendment to eliminate the inherent conflicts of \ninterest that now infest the credit rating industry.\n  I know the leader is trying to get on with votes, but I want to alert \ncolleagues that our hearings, based on a 1\\1/2\\ year investigation, \nlooked at one of the major causes of this collapse. One of the major \ncauses was because our credit rating agencies were interested in their \nbottom lines instead of getting accurate ratings for the financial \ninstruments, which our universities, our pension funds were buying.\n  The Franken amendment corrects it. It requires that this conflict of \ninterest be ended. It does not just study it, it requires an end to the \nconflict of interest by allowing the Securities and Exchange Commission \nto identify an independent intermediary who will put a process in place \nto end this conflict of interest. I commend Senator Franken for his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate my friend from Michigan \nyielding the floor. I appreciate the statement. I appreciate the work \nthe Subcommittee on Investigations has done and I appreciate the work \nhis Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has done. They have done \nremarkably good work.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed to vote in relation to \nthe following amendments in the order listed; that no amendments be in \norder to any of the amendments covered in this agreement: Franken \namendment No. 3991; LeMieux amendment No. 3774, as modified, and as a \nside-by-side to No. 3991; provided further that after the first vote in \nthe sequence, the remaining vote be limited to 10 minutes; and that \nthere be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled prior to \nthe second vote; further, that at the conclusion of these votes, \nSenator Kaufman be recognized for a period of 5 minutes as in morning \nbusiness; that at the conclusion of his remarks, the Senate then stand \nin recess until 2 p.m.; that at 2 p.m. there be a period of morning \nbusiness, in which Senators Menendez, Lautenberg, and Nelson of Florida \nbe permitted to speak on the subject of S. 3305 and make a unanimous \nconsent request upon the subject; that immediately thereafter the \nSenate resume the consideration of S. 3217 and there be 5 minutes \ndebate remaining in order to the Sessions amendment No. 3832, with the \ntime equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that upon the \nuse or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to \nthe Sessions amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this Chamber just supported and voted for \nthe Franken amendment. My measure goes further. My measure says we are \ngoing to write these rating agencies out of the law. We should not \nreward bad behavior. There are other ways to determine \ncreditworthiness. There will be a 2-year period to figure that out. \nThere is a better way to solve this problem. These rating agencies were \nresponsible for this debacle.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague, Senator Cantwell.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this language was also offered in the \nHouse by our colleague, Barney Frank. It is appropriate that we don't \nrequire Federal agencies to just rely on these rating agencies. It is \ncritical that agencies such as the FDIC and the Comptroller of the \nCurrency use their discretion to come up with appropriate standards of \ncreditworthiness and not rely on the monopoly of rating agencies. I \nhope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Briefly, my concern with this amendment is we are replacing \nthe rating agencies without having anything in their place. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to mark National Stuttering \nAwareness Week.\n  Most of us take for granted the ability to speak comfortably and \nfluently. All we have to do is think of words, and they come out \nclearly. Introducing ourselves in meetings, holding conversations over \nthe phone, ordering meals in restaurants--all of these are situations \navoided by many people who stutter as a result of being self-conscious.\n  Approximately 3 million Americans stutter. Since President Ronald \nReagan's proclamation in 1988, the second week in May has been observed \nas National Stuttering Awareness Week. It provides an opportunity for \nall of us--for all of us--to learn more about stuttering and ways to \nhelp those who stutter.\n  We have all encountered people who stutter. Contrary to popular \nmisconception, stuttering is not a result of nervousness or emotional \nproblems. It is not the fault of those who do it or of their families \nand friends. Stuttering is a speech disorder that is neurological and \nphysiological. The cause to this day remains unknown, but a recent \nstudy indicates the likelihood that stuttering may be genetic.\n  While there is currently no cure, there are many treatment options \navailable. Children usually begin stuttering between the ages of 2 and \n5, and parents should not wait to seek treatment from a doctor or \nspeech language pathologist. Early therapies have been shown to help \nreduce stuttering.\n  Those who continue to stutter in adulthood often face social and \neconomic difficulties. Unfortunately, according to a 2009 study by the \nNational Stuttering Association, 40 percent--40 percent--of adults and \nteenagers who stutter said they were denied a job or denied a promotion \nor denied a school opportunity as a result. Furthermore, 8 out of 10 \nchildren who stutter have reported being bullied and teased.\n  I am not just speaking about stuttering today because it is an \nimportant issue for so many Americans, and I am not just speaking about \nit because my friend and predecessor, Joe Biden, the Vice President, \nhas shared his story--his incredible story--of overcoming stuttering. \nThis is a personal issue for me because stuttering runs in my wife's \nfamily, and I have been around people who stutter for many years.\n  When my wife Lynne was a child, her parents took her to a therapist \nfor her stuttering, who recommended immobilizing her right arm with a \nsolid tube. At that time, the theory was that if she were forced to \nlearn to write using her left hand instead of her right, she could \nsomehow be distracted from her stuttering. Suffice it to say, the tube \ndid not work. She is just one example of what stutterers have \nhistorically had to endure. Thankfully, today there are great treatment \noptions available from licensed professionals.\n  I am glad--very, very glad--there are great organizations, such as \nthe National Stuttering Association and others, that are raising \nawareness on this important issue. There are important steps all of us \ncan take to help those who stutter feel more confident and comfortable \nspeaking. I hope people will go out and learn more about what they can \ndo themselves, especially if they know someone who stutters.\n  In recognition of National Stuttering Awareness Week, I have \nsubmitted a resolution to mark this observance. I am proud to say I am \njoined by 27 of my colleagues in sponsoring this resolution supporting \nthe goals and ideals of National Stuttering Awareness Week 2010, and I \nthank them for their support. They include Senators Barrasso, Sherrod \nBrown, Burris, Cardin, Carper, Cantwell, Casey, Cornyn, Durbin, Enzi, \nGregg, Hagan, Isakson, LeMieux, Levin, Mikulski, Pryor, Reed, Risch, \nSessions, Shaheen, Snowe, Stabenow, Tester, Warner, Whitehouse, and Tom \nUdall.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 524, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 524) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of National Stuttering Awareness Week 2010.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements related to the resolution be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 524) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\n                              S.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3305\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to discuss legislation I have \noffered with some of my colleagues here: The Big Oil Bailout Prevention \nAct. It is legislation that would make absolutely certain big oil \npolluters pay for oilspills and the consequences of those spills, and \nnot the American taxpayer, not small business owners, not States or the \nFederal Government.\n  For some time now we have been told by big oil companies that what is \nhappening in the gulf simply couldn't happen; that it was impossible; \nthat multiple redundant safety systems were in place to prevent it. \nWell, we have learned there is no such thing as too safe not to spill. \nSupposedly, the unthinkable has happened, and not only that, but it has \nhappened before.\n  Last year in Australia, the Montara oilspill began on August 21. By \nsome estimates, the spill sent over 80,000 gallons of oil a day into \nthe waters off the coast of Australia. It was months before they could \nstaunch the flow of oil, and it resulted in one of the largest \nenvironmental disasters in Australian history. We should have learned \nfrom that experience. But, no; we now have the challenge before the \nNation today. In comparison, the deepwater well that is leaking in the \ngulf is sending nearly 210,000 gallons of oil a day into the gulf; over \ntwice the flow from the Australian spill; several million gallons \nalready; and just like the Australian spill, it could take months to \ndrill the relief well. Two disasters in 1 year, yet big oil companies \nsay over and over again that the technology was simply so safe, a spill \nsuch as this could never happen.\n  The reality is much different than industry claims. There simply is \nno safety system too safe to fail and no rig that is too safe not to \nspill. There is no doubt the damages that will be caused by this spill \nwill be enormous. Unfortunately, Federal law sets a $75 million limit \non how much an oil company has to pay for damages--not the cleanup; \nthat, they are clearly going to have to pay--but for the damages. So BP \nwould not have to pay more than a total of $75 million to small \nbusinesses from lost revenues for fishing, tourism, damage to the \nenvironment, the coastline, or the lost tax revenues of State and local \ngovernments.\n  That is why, along with Senators Nelson and Lautenberg, I have \nintroduced the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act to raise the liability \ncap for offshore oil well spills from $75 million to $10 billion. That \nwill make sure that taxpayers, small business owners, States, and local \nand Federal governments will not bail out big oil polluters for this \nspill or any other.\n  This spill should serve as a rallying cry for holding big oil \naccountable for the damages of this disaster and any future one, but it \nshould also be a rallying cry to rethink expanding offshore drilling in \nplaces that are not already open to offshore drilling, such as my home \nState of New Jersey. Instead of expanding drilling and doubling down on \n19th century fuels, we should be investing in a new 21st century green \neconomy that will create thousands of new jobs, billions in new wealth, \nand help protect our oil and water from pollution.\n  We will revisit that debate soon enough, but for now I think we all \nshould be able to agree that when an oil company causes damage by \nspilling oil into American waters, the oil company bears the \nresponsibility to pay for the damage it caused. My mom taught me \ngrowing up that when you mess up, you clean up, and you are responsible \nfor it. Oil companies should get that message as well. This will help \nmake gulf communities whole and it will provide a stronger safety net \nfor our communities along places such as the New Jersey shore who are \nlooking warily at future plans for drilling along the east coast.\n  With that, Mr. President, I plan to ask unanimous consent on this \nissue, but first I wish to yield to my other colleagues who wish to \nspeak on this issue as well. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Lautenberg \nand then 5 minutes to Senator Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague for \ninitiation of this bill. It will protect the American taxpayers and say \nto big oil: You did it, you pay for it; that is the way it goes.\n  I was lucky. I had two lifetime experiences that have stayed with me. \nOne was growing up in a blue-collar family where we worried almost \ndaily about how we would pay our bills. My father was sick for 13 \nmonths before he died at age 43 and we owed everybody--the pharmacist, \nthe hospitals, the doctors. No insurance. No protection for the average \nperson. Then I was fortunate enough to be able to be engaged in a \nbusiness with two other fellows who had success beyond our wildest \ndreams. The company we started with nothing now has 46,000 employees in \n26 countries, headquartered in New Jersey, of course.\n  I learned something in those experiences. I learned that if you \nfouled up, you were responsible for cleaning up, as mentioned by \nSenator Menendez.\n  The American people want those responsible for doing dirt to clean up \nthat mess, just as families do in their own lives. But the oil \nexecutives and\n\n[[Page S3685]]\n\ntheir lobbyists don't see things that way. They want to continue \ngouging the public whom they have by the tank and by the throat. They \nwant to continue to accrue billion dollar profit gains year after year \nand leave the American family, the average American family, stretching \ndaily to pay their bills.\n  Look at this. The profits of the big oil companies in the last \nquarter alone are so astounding they are almost unimaginable. BP had a \n$5.6 billion profit quarter, a gain of $3.2 billion over last year when \nAmerica was still in some significant economic problems. Exxon, by way \nof example, had a $6.3 billion profit quarter. It goes beyond, again, \nthe wildest imagination.\n  We have to draw the line. Our Big Bailout Prevention Act would raise \nthe damage cap for all oilspills from a measly, a pittance, $75 \nmillion. My colleagues heard me. We compared it to a $5.2 billion \nquarter--not a year, a quarter--and they want to hide behind a $75 \nmillion cap on damages. Well, fortunately, we are here to say to the \naverage working family: No, we are not going to let them get away with \nyour money. We are not going to let them get away with walking away \nfrom this, hiding behind that ridiculous cap. It could be called in the \nvernacular a spit in the ocean, $75 million. So we can't afford to let \nthose companies bail out, especially when workers' lives are at stake, \nthe gulf environment hangs in the balance, and coastal communities are \nat risk.\n  I challenge my colleagues, especially those who on the other side of \nthe aisle have had a habit of saying no. If you want to say no to the \ntaxpayers, say it out loud. Say it out loud. But don't try to protect \nthe oil companies that are stuffing profits so much that they are \ngorging themselves on it. They are like pigs at the trough.\n  The United States has seen too many oil spills, more than any other \ncountry in the world. It is time to end the special favors for big oil, \nget on the side of the American people, and make sure that when a \ncatastrophe occurs, the American taxpayers don't get the bill for the \noil companies' carelessness and recklessness.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if this gusher continues--and \nwe hope and pray that by some miracle there is going to be some capping \nat the seabed of this well that is spewing at least 5,000 barrels of \noil a day--but if this thing continues and it doesn't stop until they \nget the relief well, which is another 3 months--one coming from one \nside, one coming from the other side, another 3 months--it is going to \ncover up the gulf coast. Then, as soon as the winds shift from the \nnorth coming south, it is going to take that big spill about 90 miles \nto the south where the loop current is, which is a current that comes \nup the west side of the Gulf of Mexico off the Yucatan Peninsula, into \nthe northern Gulf of Mexico, and because of the rotation of the Earth, \nit causes it to come around to the east and then flows south. That loop \ncurrent comes right around the Florida Keys and becomes the gulf \nstream. It hugs the Florida Keys and the southeast coast of Florida--\nand when I say hug it, I mean right off the coast--all the way up to \nthe middle of the peninsula of Florida at Fort Pierce. There it leaves \nthe coast a little bit, but follows the coast all the way up to Cape \nHatteras, NC, where it leaves the coast of the United States and goes \nacross the Atlantic to Scotland. It is the old gulf stream that the \nSpanish galleons used to catch going back to Europe from their \ndiscoveries in the New World.\n  Come back to the wind shifting. The wind shift from the north coming \nsouth brings that spill down to the loop current. Last weekend, I had \ntestimony by ocean specialists from the University of Miami who said \nthat once that oil gets in the loop current, it will be at the Florida \nKeys in 10 days. Eighty-five percent of the live coral reefs of the \nUnited States are in the Florida Keys. The gulf stream goes right by \nthose delicate coral reefs. The gulf stream comes up and goes right by \nMiami, Key Biscayne, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, and as far north \nas Fort Pierce, which is only about 10 miles offshore. Can my \ncolleagues imagine what this is going to do in economic damages?\n  We have been fortunate thus far that the winds have been from the \neast to the west--fortunate for Florida, unfortunate for Louisiana--\nbecause that oil is off all of those delicate bays and estuaries where \nso much of the Gulf of Mexico marine life is spawned. Sooner or later \nthe winds are going to shift, and they are going to go from the west to \nthe east. It is going to take that oil down there off the world's most \nbeautiful beaches and those bays and estuaries where so much of marine \nlife is spawned that happens to be off of Florida.\n\n  Let me tell you what the President of the Hotel and Restaurant \nAssociation told me 2 days ago. This is the Hotel and Restaurant \nAssociation of Florida. He said he had called a number of the hotels on \nthe northwest gulf coast of Florida. This is the beginning of their \nseason. He said normally they would be 85 percent occupied now. Their \noccupancy is 18 percent. Can you imagine the economic impact of this \noilspill?\n  What about the economic impact of the lost sales tax to the State and \nlocal governments, the counties, and the cities that if they do not \nhave all these tourists coming to the beach, they are not buying \nthings, and there is less revenue coming into the States.\n  We start to see the picture of the enormous economic damage, well \nover and above the cost of the cleanup. That is why an artificial \nfigure of--$75 million cap is so artificially low. I am not sure $10 \nbillion is going to be enough as a cap, but it was a target. Let's hope \nit never gets to that. Thus far, nothing has worked because those \nbackoff safety systems did not work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, in view of the fierce urgency of now, \nthere is harm already being levied upon these communities, commercial \nfishermen, tourism, and others, and because $75 million is less than 1 \nday of BP profits, I ask unanimous consent that the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. \n3305, the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Liability Act of 2010, and that \nthe Senate proceed to its consideration; that the bill be read three \ntimes, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I do reserve the right to object, and I \nwould like to take a few minutes this afternoon to explain why I will \nbe objecting to this unanimous consent request.\n  I sat and listened to my three colleagues. I have great empathy for \nthe concern they share. I share it as well. I represent a State that \nwas devastated a little more than 20 years ago when the Exxon Valdez \nhit the rocks. We lived with oil on our beaches. We know the economic \nimpact. We know the social impact that a spill can cause. We want to \nall be working together to ensure that whether it is the devastation we \nsee in the hotels in Florida or whether it is the loss to the \nfishermen, that we ensure those who are responsible pay for the \neconomic loss, for the damages that are incurred. We are with my \ncolleagues on this issue.\n  The reason I stand and object at this point in time is I do not \nbelieve that taking the amount of the liability cap from $75 million, \nwhere it is currently, to $10 billion in strict liability, 133 times \nthe size of the current strict liability limit, is where we need to be \nright now.\n  I am not just the only one who suggests that maybe we need to \nunderstand a little bit better as to how much we might need to look at \nraising the limit. The administration, just yesterday in their oilspill \nlegislative package, has proposed an effort. Their proposal, would \nraise the caps on liability for the responsible parties. ``The \nadministration looks forward to working with Congress to develop levels \nfor the various caps that provide for substantial and proportional \nincreases.''\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. If the Senator will allow me to conclude, I will be \nhappy to yield.\n  I do think we need to look at the liability cap and consider raising \nit, but\n\n[[Page S3686]]\n\nI think we need to be careful about unintended consequences of picking \na number, $10 billion.\n  Let me outline what I am talking about when I say ``unintended \nconsequences.'' This has been named the Big Oil Bailout Prevention \nLiability Act. I think we have some irony in that what this would do is \ngive all of America's offshore oil resources to the biggest of big oil. \nIt would be impossible, or perhaps close to impossible, for any energy \ncompany that is smaller than the supermajors, smaller than the national \noil companies, to operate in the OCS. Mr. President, $10 billion in \nstrict liability would preclude their ability to obtain financing, to \nobtain the bonds or insurance for any exploration.\n  Look at who is producing in the offshore. It is the independents. \nThey produce two-thirds of the natural gas, one-third of the oil. If we \nmove forward in raising this liability cap to $10 billion, the only \ncompanies that are going to be able to self-insure against this level \nof strict liability are the national oil companies, the supermajors. \nAnd we all know who they are. There is the Saudi Aramco. There is \nExxon. There is the Chinese National Oil Company and, of course, \nBritish Petroleum.\n  It has been mentioned a couple different times now that we need to \nensure that BP, as the responsible party, pays. The comment has been \nmade that $75 million is not going to be sufficient.\n  What people need to remember is that the cap on the strict liability \nonly applies to what the responsible parties have to pay back in the \ncontext of OPA, the Oil Pollution Act. The law expressly--expressly--\nallows for unlimited damages in State courts where compensatory and \npunitive damages are already being sought. As we speak, there have been \nnumerous claims filed. Back on April 28, the Louisiana shrimpers filed \na class action lawsuit against BP, Transocean, Halliburton, and Cameron \nfor their economic losses, alleging negligence and seeking both \neconomic and punitive damages.\n  The State of Florida on May 10 announced it had assembled a legal \nteam to file suit against BP. Then just 2 days after that, on May 12, \nthe fishermen filed another such lawsuit in Mississippi, recognizing \nthat, again, they have the ability to go after unlimited damages in \nthose forums.\n  Again, I am open to raising the liability cap, but we have both a \ndirective from the White House and the American people who, I believe, \nstill support offshore drilling. We need to adjust these liability caps \nin a way that does not give the biggest oil companies a monopoly over \nthe entire OCS.\n  Mr. President, I object to the unanimous consent request at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are now supposed to turn to the Sessions \namendment.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Is that by order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is by order.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Is debate on the Sessions amendment now available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes of debate in order on the \nSessions amendment, followed by a vote.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--I think this \nhas been discussed on both sides--that we have up to 30 minutes equally \ndivided on this amendment before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, and I am not inclined to \nobject, what is the request? Thirty minutes instead of five minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes equally divided.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama will yield for a moment, since I chose not to object, would he \nallow me to take 2 minutes of our time just to follow the sequence of \nthe previous discussion so I will not interrupt the essence of his \namendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have no objection.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank my distinguished colleague. I appreciate what \nmy colleague from Alaska had to say. Here are a couple of problems with \nit. First of all, when we call these companies ``independent \ndrillers,'' some of these independent drillers who are portrayed as \nsmall mom-and-pop, some of them are like $20 billion companies. So they \nare not quite the mom-and-pop view we have of small mom-and-pop \nbusinesses, No. 1.\n  If you drill, you need to be able to pay for the damages because \notherwise, imagine if this particular spill had been done by a ``small \ncompany.'' Then who would be responsible just because they were too \nsmall? The risk is what has to be calculated.\n  Also I simply say, I have a problem saying the administration did not \nsay $10 billion is not the right figure by any stretch of the \nimagination. Quite the contrary. They said they are for lifting the \nliability cap. When BP makes $5.6 billion in 3 months, when the top \nfive companies make $25 billion in 3 months, $10 billion is a drop in \nthe bucket.\n  Finally, the suggestion that those who are harmed--the fishermen, the \ncommercial fishermen, the tourism companies, and others--ultimately \nwill be in a position to make claims in State court, I know my \ndistinguished colleague from Alaska knows what happened in the Exxon \nValdez case. That took 20 years for claimants to try to get their just \nresponse. Some of them fell off the way because they just could not \nkeep hanging in there, and they lost everything.\n  I do not want Americans to have to wait 20 years to get their \nresponse to what an oil company did. Lifting the liability caps takes \ncare of that circumstance so you do not have to litigate in State \ncourts and then go all the way to the Supreme Court and get turned down \nat the end of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3832\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of those who \nhave worked on this financial responsibility bill. I wish to say, \nhowever, that I do not believe they have reached a successful \nconclusion, one that is principled and lawful in describing and \nmandating how a company that cannot pay the bills should be dissolved.\n  Throughout America, hundreds of thousands of businesses every day \nthat are unable to pay their bills seek protection, as they often call \nit, in bankruptcy. All the claims against the company are stayed. A \nbankruptcy judge, skilled in these matters, in an open, public hearing, \nwith witnesses under oath, determines whether the company has a \nrealistic chance to survive and help structure the bankruptcy \nreorganization so it can survive, or it determines that the company is \nunable to survive, that it is unlikely they could pay off their \ncreditors and most likely would only add to the debt, and they close \nthe company down.\n  This is and has been the law in America since virtually the founding \nof the Republic. It is something that is principled, well settled as to \nhow it occurs.\n  This legislation is the exact opposite, in a sense, it \ninstitutionalizes the TARP process. Only now, they will not have to \ncome to Congress, as they did this last time, over how to dissolve some \nbig company. They will have too much power, in my view, in a sealed \nproceeding--not public, not under oath--too much like the last time \nwhen the Secretary of the Treasury meets in private meetings with \nbankers and doles out billions and billions of dollars, puts $100 \nbillion, $80 billion in an insurance company, AIG, all without any \naccountability, all without any oversight, all without the kind of \nintegrity that is the essence of the American legal system.\n  I am concerned about it. My amendment would make bankruptcy more \nusable for large, complex cases that have derivatives in it. It would \nallow the cases to be brought in large bankruptcy court areas so that \nthere is sufficient expertise and personnel to handle it, and it would \ndeal with the problem of derivatives that some have raised and gives \nthe courts more flexibility to do that. I think it is the better \napproach. It is our historic, fair approach. The American people will \nknow the same judgment that falls on them and their small businesses \nwill fall on the big boys.\n\n  I appreciate the opportunity to make these brief remarks. I see \nSenator Corker and Senator Kyl are here, and I will yield.\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for the \nwork he has done in trying to craft a bankruptcy title that more fully \nsuits financial institutions.\n  This body is an interesting body because you don't have the chance to \ndo anything but vote yes or no on particular pieces of legislation. \nJust last week, the Republicans--all Republicans--had a filibuster \nwhile they waited for the leaders on each side of the Banking Committee \nto reach a compromise, and it was supported, I think, 94 or 96 to 1. \nThat compromise was on title II, the orderly liquidation title. So here \nwe have an amendment that basically is to strike something this body, \nin essence, adopted 96 to 0.\n  I spent a lot of time on that title myself working with Mark Warner. \nI appreciate greatly the partnership we had working on a resolution \ntitle. I thank Senator Shelby and Senator Dodd for the work they did to \ntry to improve that title, and we held out on this side until that \noccurred. So now we have a vote, the Sessions vote, that would strike \nthat.\n  I wish to say, I am at the point in this bill where I am under no \nillusion that the bill is going to get any better. I know there are a \nlot of messaging amendments that will begin to take place, and many of \nus will have the opportunity, through our votes, to express how we may \nfeel about certain aspects of this bill. When Senator Warner and I were \nworking on the resolution, it was with the intent that bankruptcy be \nthe default. That would be the place where almost every financial \ninstitution would go. There may be that rare instance--that rare \ninstance--when resolution was necessary, but it would be due to some \nsystemic risk. It was our hope the Judiciary Committee would actually \ndevelop a title that would allow that to happen, but it did not take \nplace.\n  As a matter of fact, many of the judicial reviews that Senator Warner \nand I wanted to see take place in the resolution title did not occur. \nThere is no judicial review overpayments by the FDIC or those kind of \nthings that we would like to see as part of the rule of law in this \ncountry. Well, let me not speak for him--that I would like to see.\n  What has happened is, we have developed a resolution title that was \nto be used only very rarely because we had hoped a bankruptcy title \nwould be developed that financial companies would go into. That hasn't \nhappened. So what does that mean? That means it is far more likely--far \nmore likely--the resolution title would actually be used instead of \nbankruptcy.\n  The fact is, I am under no illusion that Senator Sessions' amendment \nis going to pass. As a matter of fact, I doubt seriously the amendment \nis going to pass. My intent, in voting for the Sessions amendment, is \nnot to say I disavow the work Senator Shelby and Senator Dodd did. It \nis not to disavow the work Senator Warner and I spent a great deal of \ntime working on. It is to say I do believe, as part of this bill, we \nshould have done the work necessary to make sure there was a bankruptcy \ntitle that would work for financial institutions. That has not been \ndone.\n  I wish to thank Senator Sessions for giving us the opportunity to \nvoice the fact that we believe the Bankruptcy Code in this country \nshould be made so it works far better for financial institutions. I \nwould like for this to have been melded in a little differently than \nthe way the Senator is putting it forth, but I wish to thank him for \nhis work and to signify my intent to support his amendment on the basis \nof the fact that the bill, the way it has been crafted, should have \nrespected judicial review more than it has been; and secondly, the fact \nthat we should have, as part of this thoughtful process, done something \nin this bill to greatly expand the ability of the judicial system to \ndeal with a large, highly complex financial company.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to briefly echo the sentiments of both \nSenators Sessions and Corker. They have both given a great deal of \nthought to the problems here.\n  These are not political issues that capture the imagination of either \nthe news media or the American people, but they are very important, and \nthey are both working to solve a difficult problem in a very reasonable \nway that recognizes the importance of the rule of law.\n  One of the great distinguishing characteristics of the United States \nversus some other countries, many other countries in the world, is that \nwe follow a rule of law. It makes commercial dealings, and therefore \nexpansion of our economy, so much easier when everyone knows what the \nrules are and they can plan based upon those rules.\n  One of the bodies of law that is most contributory to that is our \nBankruptcy Code. For over a couple centuries, we have had a process and \na set of rules that governs what happens when businesses can't pay \ntheir debts and have to go out of business or be reorganized. Those \nrules, in effect, set the rules of the road--the things people can \ncount on both at the time a business gets into trouble but also far \nbefore that, when people are making decisions on whether to lend to or \ninvest in a business.\n  They know, for example, if they are going to be a secured creditor of \na business that, in the event something goes wrong, they will be quite \nhigh on the list of businesses that get paid. If they are an unsecured \ncreditor, they are going to be lower on that list. They will probably \nget more for their lending because they are unsecured, but they will be \nlower on the list. So people can calibrate the kind of equity \ninvestment or lending they want to engage in based upon what they know \nthe rules will be in the event something goes wrong.\n  If you do away with that and just say that in the event something \ngoes wrong, a government bureaucracy--and I don't use that word \npejoratively--a group of government employees in an agency are going to \ndecide that something needs to be done and decide what that is and it \nis basically unconstrained by any set of rules and practices such as \nthe Bankruptcy Code has provided, that is scary to folks. It is going \nto mean we will have less lending and capital formation for businesses \nbecause they are going to be uncertain about the rules of the road. \nSecondly, it is going to create the potential for unfairness and, \nfrankly, poor decisions if companies do have to get unwound.\n  So what we are giving up by not adopting an amendment such as the \nSessions amendment is certainty, predictability, and decades of \nunderstanding of what the law is in the event something such as this \noccurs.\n  What Senator Corker has said is also true; that these financial \ninstitutions may present some very unique circumstances, and some of \nthem may be so large and so potentially affecting of other institutions \nthat it may be that the relatively slow pace of bankruptcy--and I don't \nmean to suggest it is very slow--may mean that we need something more \nquickly to intervene and ensure that whatever happens with this \nparticular business, it doesn't adversely affect others or that there \nmay be other reasons to have a more immediate infusion of some \nintervention. I will put it that way.\n  It was for that reason that all of us supported the Dodd-Shelby \ncompromise. Our view was, as Senator Corker said, it is better than the \nunderlying bill, although I don't think it satisfied at least the three \nof us that it went far enough in creating these rules of \npredictability. The Sessions amendment, as has been described, does \nthat.\n  I think Senator Corker has it exactly right; we are under no illusion \nthis will replace the Dodd-Shelby compromise. In that respect, we have \nto just hope, in the further process of legislating on this bill, that \ncompromise can be informed by additional debate and discussion and \nmaybe improved. By supporting the bankruptcy-related amendment of \nSenator Sessions, what we are trying to do is to send the message that \nwe compliment Senators Dodd and Shelby for what they did, but a little \nmore dose of the predictability and certainty and judicial process of \nbankruptcy would be very welcomed in this process.\n  Therefore, to the extent that we can have a good vote on this \namendment, perhaps they and others will look to other ways in which \nthey can continue to modify this language for the very best result we \ncan achieve. This is a very important issue. It deserves our very best \nattention.\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\n  I wished to compliment again both Senator Sessions and Senator \nCorker, two of the very thoughtful Members of this body, for the way \nthey have approached this issue, without any political consideration \nbut simply to try to make this process better, fairer, more predictable \nand, therefore, better for the businesses involved and for the economy \nof the United States.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute fifty-five seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share a few things briefly \nbefore we move into the vote. William Kristol today raised a \nfundamental question in a blog site regarding the way this bill is \nwritten when he said:\n\n       This is a giant power grab for the FDIC and Treasury, who \n     could use their new powers to tug the strings of our \n     country's largest financial institutions like a puppeteer.\n\n  I would also refer to a letter of April 12, from the Judicial \nConference of the United States. This is a thoughtful letter in \nresponse to an inquiry from Patrick Leahy, the Judiciary Committee \nchairman, in which they express grave concerns about the legislation. \nAmong other things, the Judicial Conference says:\n\n       The legislation does not envision objection, participation, \n     or input from the bankruptcy creditors (whose rights will be \n     affected) in the course of appointing the FDIC as receiver. \n     Indeed, the legislation proposes to deal with this petition \n     in a sealed manner, only the Secretary and the affected \n     financial firm would be noticed and given the opportunity of \n     a hearing.\n\n  I think that is insufficient.\n  Finally, I received a letter today from a number of superb and well-\nknown economists, legal scholars and leaders--Darrell Duffie, Dean \nWitter Distinguished Professor at the Graduate School of Business, \nStanford University; Tom Jackson, Distinguished University Professor, \nUniversity of Rochester; Kenneth Scott, Parsons Professor Emeritus of \nLaw and Business, Stanford Law School, George P. Shultz, Distinguished \nFellow, Hoover Institution, David Skeel, Professor of Corporate Law, \nUniversity of Pennsylvania and John B. Taylor, Professor of Economics, \nStanford University.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, these individuals put forth in detail \ntheir concerns about this procedure, and they point out why bankruptcy \nis necessary, because the rule of law applies and the process is more \ndefined in this appropriate way. They tell us, with much care, why my \namendment would be the best way to solve this problem. They say, in \npart, the following:\n\n       Despite the best intentions by the sponsors of Title II, \n     our view is that it will increase rather than decrease the \n     likelihood of financial crises . . . It might be preferable \n     for the Congress [to] wait until the Financial Crisis Inquiry \n     Commission completes its report . . . In the meantime, \n     however, proposed amendment No. 3832, which has been filed by \n     Ranking Member Sessions of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     takes a bankruptcy route . . . Amending Title II along these \n     lines would be a big step toward the bankruptcy approach we \n     favor, and we urge you to move in this direction.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe three items I have just quoted from.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Weekly Standard, May 13, 2010]\n\n                     Bailout Nation v. Rule of Law\n\n                          (By William Kristol)\n\n       Financial regulatory ``reform'' has been wending its \n     desultory way through Congress for quite a while, and one can \n     lose track of where things stand and what's important.\n       But there's a vote scheduled for the Senate floor today \n     that matters. It will be on an amendment--offered by Sen. \n     Sessions--that would strike the entire Orderly Liquidation \n     Authority (OLA) from the Dodd bill. It would instead make \n     needed adjustments to a few provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy \n     Code to make it more flexible to deal with the failure of \n     large financial firms (such as Lehman). The bankruptcy code \n     amendment is clearly a superior alternative to OLA, which \n     scraps the Code, the primary vehicle to reorganize companies \n     for over a century, and replaces it with a wholly untested \n     process to seize firms that are merely in danger of default. \n     It replaces the Code's strict adherence to the rule of law \n     with a system governed by the FDIC, which is given incredibly \n     broad discretion to treat creditors as it wishes. This is a \n     giant power grab for the FDIC and Treasury, who could use \n     their new powers to tug the strings of our country's largest \n     financial institutions like a puppeteer.\n       It's increasingly clear in the age of Obama that two very \n     different visions of the relation of the private sector to \n     the state are competing to shape the future of this country. \n     With respect to financial reform, this amendment, more \n     perhaps than any other, clarifies and signifies what's at \n     stake in this debate. Whether or not the amendment passes, if \n     Republicans unite behind it, they will show voters the choice \n     in 2010 and 2012--not the status quo vs. reform, but \n     ``reform'' that would further increase the arbitrary power \n     and scope of government vs. real reform that would safeguard \n     the financial system in accord with limited government and \n     the rule of law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Judicial Conference\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                  Washington, DC., April 12, 2010.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in response to your letter \n     of March 25, 2010, seeking the views of the Judiciary with \n     regard to provisions relating to bankruptcy that are \n     contained in the financial regulation bill recently approved \n     by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs. We appreciate your soliciting the views of the \n     courts on this matter. You identified several of the issues \n     that are of concern to the courts, and I will address each of \n     those.\n       As you noted, Title II would create an ``Orderly \n     Liquidation Authority Panel'' within the Bankruptcy Court for \n     the District of Delaware for the limited purpose of ruling on \n     petitions from the Secretary of the Treasury for \n     authorization to appoint the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver for a failing financial \n     firm. This is a substantial change to bankruptcy law because \n     it would create a new structure within the bankruptcy courts \n     and remove a class of cases from the jurisdiction of the \n     Bankruptcy Code. The legislation, by assigning to the FDIC \n     the responsibility for resolving the affairs of an insolvent \n     firm, appears to provide a substitute for a bankruptcy \n     proceeding. The Judicial Conference has not adopted a \n     position with regard to the removal from bankruptcy court \n     jurisdiction of the class of financial firms identified in \n     this legislation.\n       We note, however, that the legislation will result in the \n     transition of at least some bankruptcy cases to FDIC \n     receivership in situations where a firm is already in \n     bankruptcy, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Section \n     203(c)(4)(A) provides that a pending bankruptcy case would be \n     evidence of a firm's financial status for purposes of \n     triggering the Treasury Secretary's authority to seek to \n     appoint the FDIC as receiver. The bill does not specify how \n     the transition from a bankruptcy proceeding to an \n     administrative proceeding would be effected. Further, the \n     bill does not specify the effect of the transfer on prior \n     rulings of the court. For example, would any stays or other \n     rulings continue in effect or be dissolved upon the transfer \n     to the FDIC? This could be especially problematic if \n     creditors have changed position based upon rulings in the \n     course of the bankruptcy proceeding. The legislation does not \n     envision objection, participation, or input from the \n     bankruptcy creditors (whose rights will be affected) in the \n     course of appointing the FDIC as receiver. Indeed, the \n     legislation proposes to deal with this petition in a sealed \n     manner; only the Secretary and the affected financial firm \n     would be noticed and given the opportunity of a hearing. The \n     financial position of affected creditors may have been \n     changed within the context of the firm's bankruptcy case in \n     such a way that the creditors' rights might have changed \n     dramatically. Any resulting due process challenges would \n     impose a significant burden on the courts to resolve novel \n     issues, for which the bill provides no guidance.\n       In addition, we note that petitions under this title \n     involving financial firms would be filed in a single judicial \n     district. The Judicial Conference favors distribution of \n     cases to ensure that court facilities are reasonably \n     accessible to litigants and other participants in the \n     judicial process. Although we are aware that a large number \n     of companies are incorporated in Delaware, it is not clear \n     that Delaware would necessarily be a convenient location for \n     many of the affected companies, nor indeed the proper venue \n     for that petition, absent changes to title 28, United States \n     Code.\n       We also note that the legislation requires the designation \n     of more bankruptcy judges for the panel than are permanently \n     authorized for Delaware under existing law. The District of \n     Delaware is authorized one permanent bankruptcy judge and \n     five temporary judgeships. If Congress were to choose not to \n     extend these judgeships or convert them to permanent status, \n     it would be impossible to implement section 202's requirement \n     to appoint three judges to the Orderly Liquidation Authority \n     Panel from the District of Delaware.\n       With respect to the limited review to be conducted by the \n     panel created in section 202, we note that the authority may \n     exceed what is constitutionally permitted to a non-Article \n     III entity. A previous statute was held unconstitutional \n     because it conferred on the bankruptcy courts the authority \n     to decide matters that are reserved for Article\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\n     III courts. Northern Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipe \n     Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982). The review of the Secretary's \n     decision in this instance appears to resemble more closely \n     appeals of agency decisions under the Administrative \n     Procedure Act than a bankruptcy petition and, therefore, \n     appears more appropriate for an Article III court. Moreover, \n     the affirmation of the Secretary's petition to designate the \n     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as a receiver \n     effectively removes a case from the application of bankruptcy \n     law. Accordingly, it seems anomalous to subject this petition \n     to review by a bankruptcy court.\n       Your letter particularly questioned whether the time limit \n     of 24 hours for a decision by the panel would be sufficient \n     or realistic. The Judicial Conference has consistently \n     opposed the imposition of time limits for judicial decisions \n     beyond those already set forth in the Speedy Trial Act or \n     section 1657 of title 28. We appreciate that a matter \n     affecting the operation of the national economy warrants a \n     prompt resolution. We note that the courts, recognizing this \n     concern, have already demonstrated an ability to move swiftly \n     in resolving bankruptcy petitions involving large \n     corporations with broad impact on the national economy. In \n     each of these instances, the initial determinations were \n     made by a single judge. The resulting appeals in some \n     cases were also adjudicated on an expedited basis without \n     a statutory requirement to do so.\n       Requiring a panel of three judges to assemble, conduct a \n     hearing, and craft a written opinion within 24 hours presents \n     practical difficulties that may be insurmountable. Although \n     Sec. 202(b)(l)(A)(iii) could be read to limit the court's \n     review to the question of whether the covered financial \n     company is in default or danger of default, the Secretary is \n     required to submit to the panel ``all relevant findings and \n     the recommendation made pursuant to section 203(a),'' which \n     specifies consideration of multiple factors (repeated in \n     subsection (b) of that section as the basis for the \n     Secretary's petition). Even with the full cooperation of the \n     financial firm affected by the proceeding, which is not a \n     predicate for the consideration of a petition, it would \n     appear difficult to hear and consider the evidence and \n     prepare a well-reasoned opinion addressing each reason \n     supporting the decision of the panel within 24 hours. Even \n     assuming that factors other than the solvency of the firm \n     would be excluded from this special panel's review, it may \n     well be that the subject financial firm or one of its \n     creditors would seek judicial review of one of the prior \n     administrative evaluations of the statutory factors, either \n     in the course of the hearing conducted by the Orderly \n     Liquidation Authority Panel or in another court. Such \n     challenges would also make it difficult to meet the proposed \n     timeline. It is possible that the facts of a particular case \n     may be so clear that a decision could be rendered within 24 \n     hours, but the statutory requirement of such speed seems \n     inconsistent with the thoughtful deliberation that would be \n     appropriate for a decision of such great significance.\n       Although it is to be hoped that only a small number of \n     large financial firms would ever become subject to this \n     legislation, each of the petitions would involve large \n     volumes of evidence regarding complex financial arrangements. \n     Thus, the legislation could result in a large proportion of \n     the judicial resources of a single bankruptcy court being \n     devoted exclusively to review of the Secretary's petitions. \n     Further, the bill provides that the Secretary may re-file a \n     petition to correct deficiencies in response to an initial \n     decision, thus extending the time in which the court's \n     resources would be diverted from other judicial business. The \n     District of Delaware is one of the busiest bankruptcy courts \n     in the nation; to draw the court's limited judicial resources \n     away from the fair and timely adjudication of those \n     bankruptcy cases to process petitions under this bill would \n     be inequitable and unjust to the debtors and creditors in \n     those pending cases. If, as seems possible given recent \n     economic developments, the failure of one firm weakens other \n     firms in the financial services sector, the demand could \n     exceed the court's resources. This consideration alone \n     counsels against the assignment of all such cases to a single \n     court.\n       Finally, we note that both the Administrative Office of the \n     United States Courts (AO) and the Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO) are directed to conduct studies which will \n     evaluate:\n       (i) the effectiveness of Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 of the \n     Bankruptcy Code in facilitating the orderly liquidation or \n     reorganization of financial companies;\n       (ii) ways to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of \n     the Panel; and\n       (iii) ways to make the orderly liquidation process under \n     the Bankruptcy Code for financial companies more effective.\n       With respect to those firms that are to be treated under \n     Chapters 7 and 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, the vagueness of, \n     and/or lack of criteria for determining ``effectiveness'' \n     will hamper the ability of the AO and GAO to produce \n     meaningful reports. Some would regard rapid payment of even \n     small portions of claims as an effective resolution, while \n     others would prefer a delayed payment of a greater share of a \n     claim. There would also be significant disagreements between \n     creditors holding different types of secured or unsecured \n     claims as to the most effective resolution of an insolvent \n     firm. Some would argue that effectiveness should be measured \n     by the impact of the resolution on the larger economy, \n     regardless of the impact on the creditors of the particular \n     firm. Without clearer guidance for the studies, both agencies \n     will be required repeatedly to expend resources on the \n     development of reports that may not provide the information \n     Congress is seeking.\n       Thank you for seeking the views of the Judiciary regarding \n     this legislation and for your consideration of them.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee Banking, Housing, and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, Chairman Dodd, \n     Ranking Member Shelby: We are writing to you regarding Title \n     II ``Orderly Liquidation Authority'' of the ``Restoring \n     American Financial Stability Act of 2010.'' Despite the best \n     of intentions by the sponsors of Title II, our view is that \n     it will increase rather than decrease the likelihood of \n     financial crises. Our view is based on experiences during the \n     financial crisis, especially the events surrounding the \n     disruptive failures of such firms as Bear Stearns, Lehman, \n     and AIG. In order to avoid such harmful disruptions in the \n     future, any failure of a large and complex financial firm \n     must be made more orderly and predictable so that market \n     participants can anticipate the process and adjust their \n     positions more smoothly and gradually without chaotic \n     spillover effects to the financial system and the economy.\n       However, in our view the new discretionary powers given to \n     government officials and agencies under Title II will not \n     result in a more orderly and predictable process. Indeed, it \n     is likely to have the opposite effect. The legislation would \n     give authority to officials at the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation (FDIC) to take over and dismantle any large \n     complex financial services business which appears to be \n     failing. We doubt the ability of the FDIC to dismantle such \n     complex financial institutions in a smooth and orderly way. \n     There would be great uncertainty about who will lose and who \n     will gain. The decisions will be made by government officials \n     without knowledge of the circumstances underlying different \n     claims, rather than by the rule of law. The unpredictability \n     of the discretionary process would increase the likelihood of \n     runs: whenever there is rumor of a government official or \n     agency thinking of a takeover, creditors will take their \n     money and run. There are also technical problems with Title \n     II which would cause financial instability. For example, the \n     nature of the delay in applying the exemption from the \n     automatic stay for qualified financial products will lead to \n     more runs.\n       Fortunately a more orderly and predictable approach is \n     available. All that is required is an adjustment to the \n     bankruptcy law to make it apply to nonbank financial firms in \n     a clear way which the firms, their counterparties, and their \n     creditors can understand and count on. With these changes, \n     bankruptcy would be the mechanism to deal with financial \n     institutions, and thus provisions for a government agency \n     resolution process to override bankruptcy could be \n     eliminated. If these changes had been in effect at the time \n     of the Lehman bankruptcy, it would have been far smoother and \n     less disruptive than what happened in September 2008.\n       The main advantage of bankruptcy is that the rule of law \n     applies and the process is thus much more defined. The mere \n     existence of an orderly Chapter 11 process will greatly \n     reduce the likelihood of bailouts. There are alternative ways \n     to change the bankruptcy law to make it apply to nonbank \n     financial firms. Some of us and others have proposed such \n     changes and work is continuing. For example, one change could \n     involve creating a team of experts knowledgeable about the \n     bankruptcy law and about financial markets and institutions, \n     which would be ready to go in a financial emergency. Another \n     change is to allow regulators to initiate a petition as \n     prescribed by the law. The government could also file a \n     reorganization plan with the bankruptcy court. The new law \n     could also give a right of relief from the automatic stay \n     upon petition by a counterparty seeking to sell collateral in \n     the possession of the debtor to the extent the collateral \n     consists of highly-marketable securities or other cash-like \n     collateral.\n       To be sure the issues are complex and amending legislation \n     on the Senate floor rather than in committee or conference is \n     difficult. It might be preferable for the Congress to wait \n     until the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission completes its \n     report, which will provide additional information and a \n     better understanding of the issues which bear on this \n     legislation. In the meantime, however, proposed amendment No.\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\n     3832, which has been filed by Ranking Member Sessions of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, takes a bankruptcy route. The \n     amendment is called ``The Bankruptcy Integrity and \n     Accountability Act'' and would replace the currently proposed \n     Title II. Amending Title II along these lines would be a big \n     step toward the bankruptcy approach we favor, and we urge you \n     to move in this direction. We would be happy to provide more \n     details about these issues to you or your staffs.\n       In sum we urge you to replace Title II, reinstate the rule \n     of law, reduce the likelihood of future financial crises, and \n     prevent bailouts by instituting an orderly and predictable \n     bankruptcy regime for large nonbank financial firms.\n           Sincerely,\n     Darrell Duffie,\n       Dean Witter Distinguished Professor at the Graduate School \n     of Business, Stanford University.\n     Tom H.

Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes fifty seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I will not use all of 12 minutes. I will take a few \nminutes.\n  I spoke last evening about my friend's amendment, and it wasn't to a \npacked Chamber, I can tell you, at 8 o'clock last night. But I am sure \nthe Senators all received copies of it or listened to it intently as \nyou were dozing off last evening.\n  Let me, first of all, thank Jeff Sessions. He is a good pal and \nfriend, and we have worked together on a number of issues. Senator \nCorker, who is on the floor as well, in many ways--both Bob Corker and \nMark Warner of Virginia--is as much the coauthor of the very section we \nare talking about as anyone in this Chamber. He spent a lot of hours \ntrying to put this together.\n  But here is the quandary with the Sessions amendment. One of the \nthings we have tried to avoid is, of course, getting back to too big to \nfail. The presumption of our bill is bankruptcy. Clearly, we want to \nget people into bankruptcy, if they deserve to be there. If they \ndeserve to fail, they should fail. The problem is, when you end up \npushing some large, highly complex entity into bankruptcy, it can have \nthe unintended collateral damage effect of affecting otherwise solvent, \ngood companies that are well managed, well run, and who employ a lot of \npeople and are doing a good job. When these highly complex entities are \nshoved into bankruptcy, there can be collateral damage and other \ncompanies can suffer.\n  I am shorthanding this, in a way. So the idea was, on some rare \noccasions, and hopefully they are very rare, when that possibility \noccurs and you have to go through a number of hoops to get to that \nconclusion, that we would have a mechanism for a resolution, a winding \ndown of that entity, to avoid the kind of collateral damage that could \ncause if bankruptcy were the only option for those complex entities.\n  What you are faced with, if the Sessions amendment is adopted, is \nright back where we were in the fall of 2008 where the choices are \nbankruptcy or bailout, in a sense, where bankruptcy would pose, as \nLehman Brothers potentially did, as we saw, a lot of collateral damage \nbecause there was not a wind-down resolution mechanism. Whether it \nshould have been used in that particular fact situation, I don't want \nto try to make that case. That is not my point, not making my case. But \nlet's say it is a Lehman Brothers-like situation where we would all \nagree that company ought to be put out of its misery, but to go through \ntraditional bankruptcy would have the collateral effect of taking a lot \nof other people with it in the process who do not deserve to go down, \nnot to mention the jobs and the impact on the economy.\n  Senator Corker, Senator Warner, and others obviously working with it, \ncame up with this. They listened to a lot of people. Again, no one ever \nknows if you have this exactly right. We talked about all the things. \nWe had exactly right what we want to do. We know what we want the \noutcome to be. Whether we did it right so it will work exactly as we \nplanned we will never know until the first case pops up and determines \nwhether what we put in place achieves its goal. But in the absence of \nthat, we are right back where we were.\n  If someone said to me: What is the most critical part of this bill--\nthat is a hard thing to ask someone who has been involved in a lot of \nit, but if you said: We are only going to let you keep one section of \nthis bill; you are going to have to get rid of everything else; which \nsection would you keep, Senator, this is what I would keep because this \nis what exposed the American taxpayer to that $700 billion check they \nhad to write because we didn't have an alternative in place to deal \nwith moments like that. Hopefully, they rarely come.\n  There were a lot of events that led up to it that we tried to deal \nwith in this bill as well, including the underwriting standards and all \nsorts of things to minimize ever getting to that point where you have \nto make that decision. But we have all been around long enough to know \nthey can happen, and when they happen again, what will be our answer? \nWe had an option out there, but we got rid of it.\n  America, you have to make a choice. A lot of other people are going \nto suffer unnecessarily, but bankruptcy is the only choice to go. We \nwould look back and say: Why didn't we put in place some alternative \nmechanism in those most rare occasions where some alternative other \nthan bankruptcy should be in place?\n  That is the shorthand version of a lot of conversation, a lot of talk \nover a lot of months to this point.\n  Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, opposes the \namendment. Other members of the committee may agree with Senator \nSessions. I don't want to suggest this is necessarily broad dissent, \none side or the other. But this is as critical as it gets on this bill.\n  I say to my colleagues, there are a lot of amendments being offered, \nand frankly I might be against them or for them. If they are excluded \nor included, I might be disappointed one way or the other. If we get \nrid of this, I don't know how in good conscience you can walk out of \nthe Chamber and look the American taxpayer in the eye and say again: We \nhave now protected you against too big to fail.\n  For those reasons, I urge the rejection of the Sessions amendment, \nand I say that respectfully of a good friend.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I have to ask for the yeas and nays under the order, don't \nI?\n  Mr. CORKER. Will the Senator yield for a couple of minutes over here? \nI know we are under time anyway.\n  Mr. DODD. I will be glad to yield. Instead of yielding my time, let \nme yield 2 minutes to my friend from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator. I know I spent a great deal of time \non the floor.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut. First, I thank him for the work \nhe did to make the resolution title better. I know that after he and \nSenator Shelby finished, I came down and thanked him but expressed \nconcerns about the fact that many of the judicial reviews that I \nbelieved were important were not included. Yet the bill was better, and \nI thank the Senator for that.\n  I realize that in this body, as I said that day on the floor, nothing \never works out exactly as you wish. This bill is not going to be \nexactly the way the Senator would wish.\n  We are going to pass a bill that, to me, is incomplete. One of the \nthings I think all of us, including the Senator from Connecticut, had \nhoped would occur is that the Judiciary Committee would actually work \non a title that\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\nwould make the resolution title much less necessary because it would \nenhance the ability to deal with these complex financial companies. \nThat has not happened. I know we have not dealt with Freddie and Fannie \nin this bill. I know you would have liked to have dealt with that. I \nhope you would have liked to. We are not going to deal with it.\n  You are going to be leaving this body after a distinguished career \nhere. But I think what we are trying to say is that, look, we still \nhave work to do. The Judiciary Committee has to develop a better \nbankruptcy title for financial companies, and I think all scholars have \nsaid that is the case. There is no question that we have to deal with \nFannie and Freddie. We will do that soon, I hope.\n  I know the outcome of this, and the Senator knows what the outcome of \nthis is going to be. I think there are numbers of us who would just \nlike to see us really focus on this bankruptcy title to do--what you \njust said is exactly right, and that is that resolution is only used \nrarely. But right now, the way the Bankruptcy Code is, it is going to \nbe used in every case one of these large companies fails because we \nhaven't done the work we need to do to make the Bankruptcy Code work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I will take 30 more seconds.\n  Here is the concern. With smaller entities, I can see the case where \nthey should go to bankruptcy, and that may happen. We are talking about \nvery complex, interconnected ones.\n  My colleague is correct, by the way. I should have made note of this. \nWe did try. And, again, it is not the fault of the Judiciary Committee. \nThey have been overwhelmed with judicial nominations and everything \nelse.\n  The present bankruptcy process does pose an issue with large, complex \nentities for the very reason I outlined, and therefore you need some \nmechanism because then the alternative is bailout, I presume, rather \nthan having a lot of innocent companies fail, with a lot of \nunemployment occurring and damage to the economy. There is a step that \nwill have to be worked on.\n  I don't disagree on GSEs. I care deeply about that, and it is an area \nthat needs to be reformed. But at this juncture, to strip this out is \nto throw us right back. My concern is not what else needs to be done \ndown the road, but if you strip this out at this juncture, we leave \nourselves very vulnerable.\n  With the Shelby-Dodd amendment that passed 93 to 5, I think it was--\nwe tried to fill in a lot of gaps people have. We got rid of that \nprepayment issue that people had a lot concerns about, and it is a \npostpayment system. All of the issues we tried to resolve.\n  I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Tennessee.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 42, nays 58, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 148 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--42\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--58\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 3832) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent for 8 minutes equally divided \nbetween myself and Senator Cantwell in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          National Police Week\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commemorate \nand celebrate the lives of seven police officers from my home State of \nWashington who lost their lives in service to their communities last \nyear.\n  I am proud to join today with Senator Cantwell during National Police \nWeek to introduce the Washington State Law Enforcement Memorial \nresolution to extend the condolences of the Senate to the families, \nloved ones, and communities of our State's fallen heroes.\n  This week tens of thousands of people from across the country are \ngoing to be gathering at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial \nin Washington, DC--friends and families of fallen officers, ordinary \ncitizens, elected officials, and fellow police officers. They will be \njoining together in the heart of our city in a tree-lined park splashed \nwith daffodils and lined with two curving blue-gray marble walls. On \nthose walls--the ``Pathways of Remembrance''--are engraved the names of \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement officers who have made the \nultimate sacrifice for the safety and protection of our Nation and its \npeople--18,600 of them, dating back to the 18th century.\n  Among those crowds at that memorial this week will be men and women \nfrom the State of Washington who have flown all the way across the \ncountry to be here as seven new names are unveiled and carved into the \nmarble and preserved for our Nation to honor.\n  The seven officers from Washington State who lost their lives last \nyear in the line of duty are: Deputy Sheriff Stephen Michael Gallagher, \nJr. of the Lewis County Sheriff's office; Officer Timothy Brenton of \nthe Seattle Police Department; Officer Tina Griswold of the Lakewood \nPolice Department; Officer Ronald Wilbur Owens II of the Lakewood \nPolice Department; Sergeant Mark Joseph Renninger of the Lakewood \nPolice Department; Officer Gregory James Richards of the Lakewood \nPolice Department; and Deputy Sheriff Walter Kent Mundell, Jr. of the \nPierce County Sheriff's Department.\n  These seven remarkable and selfless officers represented the best of \ntheir communities. They were seven heroes who served proudly as a brave \nboundary between civil society and the worst elements of lawlessness \nand unrest; seven husbands, wives, fathers, and mothers whose losses \nhave devastated families and torn apart communities and whose deaths \nhave weighed heavily on every member of our State's law enforcement \ncommunity. Each of these tragedies sheds new light on the enormity of \nthe sacrifice police officers make every day in Washington State and \nacross the country. I know our officers feel this weight, but I have no \ndoubt they will never let it stop them from continuing to put \nthemselves in harm's way in order to serve our communities. That is a \ntestament to the commitment they make to serve and protect us. It is an \noath they honor each day, and it is a reminder to all of us that these \nbrave men and women deserve every ounce of support we can provide to \nkeep them safe.\n  It is with great pride that I introduce the Washington State Law \nEnforcement Memorial resolution to commemorate and celebrate the lives \nof those seven officers. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with \ntheir families, and I join their communities, Washington State, and the \nentire Nation in gratitude for their service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for her leadership \nin having this resolution on the floor today. She is always focused on \nthose who are on the front line of defense in our country and, clearly, \nin Washington State. I appreciate her leadership in honoring the fallen \nofficers from Washington State.\n  This week does mark National Police Week where officers from across \nthe\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\nNation will travel here to honor fallen comrades. Because we in \nWashington State have done so much of this lately, we understand how \nimportant this type of activity is for remembering the men and women \nwho serve us. During this week, we reflect on the brave men and women \nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice to our community.\n  Mr. President, 2009 was one of the deadliest years in Washington \nState in more than 70 years. Seven officers were killed in the line of \nduty. These heroes put their lives at risk for our safety. They will be \nmissed, but they will not be forgotten. The men and women in blue keep \nour communities safe, and they do so at tremendous sacrifices.\n  Deputy Mike Gallagher from Lewis County Sheriff's Office was killed \nafter his car was struck on his way back from responding to a domestic \nviolence incident. Timothy Brenton from Seattle was shot while sitting \nin his car on Halloween in Seattle. We thought those two incidents were \nenough to rock our community. But then, in one of the most heinous \nmurders in the State of Washington history, four Lakewood police \nofficers were shot and killed while on duty in Parkland: Sergeant Mark \nRenninger, Officer Ronald Owens, Officer Tina Griswold, and Officer \nGreg Richards. It was a short time later that Deputy Kent Mundell, Jr. \nof the Pierce County Sheriff's office died from wounds sustained in \nresponding to a domestic violence call.\n  We have seen in Washington State the sacrifice of these men and \nwomen, all they do to keep us safe and all that their families go \nthrough when those who are in the line of duty pay the ultimate \nsacrifice.\n  I hope my colleagues will remember law enforcement across the country \nand in their individual States. I hope they will take time, as they see \nofficers here in the Capitol and throughout the Washington, DC area, to \nthank them for their service. Let's commemorate the activities of those \nwho have fallen and also remember those who are still working to \nprotect us every single day.\n  I thank my colleague from Washington for this resolution, and I hope \nfor its urgent passage today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Celebrating the Life of Lena Horne\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, in 1933, a 16-year-old girl named Lena \nHorne joined the chorus at a famous nightclub in Harlem known as the \nCotton Club.\n  This young woman was passionate about performing so she jumped in \nwith both feet.\n  And she never looked back.\n  The following year, Lena Horne made her debut on Broadway. And not \nlong after, she became the first African American performer to sign a \nlong-term contract with a big Hollywood studio, MGM.\n  She blazed a trail. She knew that her talent could outshine the \nugliness of racial prejudice so, in the 1940s, she became a major movie \nstar.\n  But despite her success, Lena Horne never forgot her roots or the \nplight of those who were subjected to hatred and bigotry on a daily \nbasis.\n  She knew that she was a role model and an authority figure--and she \nused her fame as a platform to raise these issues, and to fight against \nintolerance.\n  She partnered with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to pass anti-lynching \nlegislation. After the Second World War, she worked with Japanese \nAmericans who had suffered internment and discrimination.\n  And all the while, her star was on the rise.\n  In 1957, she recorded ``Lena Horne at the Waldorf-Astoria'' a record \nthat would become the best-selling album by a female singer in the \nhistory of RCA.\n  During the civil rights movement, she stood with leaders like Dr. \nKing at the famous march on Washington.\n  She spoke out for racial equality, and became involved with the NAACP \nand other groups.\n  And she never stopped doing what she loved: performing.\n  In 1981, she returned to Broadway in a one-woman show, which won a \nTony Award, two Grammies, and endless critical acclaim.\n  And she kept creating original material well into the next decade.\n  Mr. President, Lena Horne departed this life only a few days ago on \nMay 9 at the age of 92.\n  As a performer, her legacy is unsurpassed.\n  She rose to become one of the most successful entertainers of the \nlast century, and blazed a trail for countless other minority \nperformers to follow.\n  Her personal legacy is no less remarkable. She consistently lived out \nher values, and did not shy away from opportunities to stand up for \nwhat she believed in.\n  She embraced every chance to make a positive difference in the lives \nof others and that, more than anything, is what she will be remembered \nfor.\n  Lena Horne left an indelible mark on this Nation. And that is why I \nam proud to join Senator Gillibrand in sponsoring a resolution in her \nhonor.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with us in celebrating the life of this \nremarkable woman--a trailblazer who achieved great success in the face \nof tall odds, and then used that success to better the lives of others.\n  Lena Horne is gone.\n  But in her classic recordings--in the lives she touched, the movies \nshe made, and the change she helped to bring about she will always be \nwith us.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, in recent days, since the Chamber opened \ndebate on Chairman Dodd's financial reform bill, we have all heard a \nlot of talk about the irresponsible behavior on Wall Street. We have \nheard about the recklessness that cost this country trillions of \ndollars in lost savings, not to mention 8 million American jobs. We \nhave heard about the consumers, especially minority populations and the \nelderly, who have suffered a great deal as a result of this economic \ncrisis.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for joining in the \ndebate about how to address these issues, and I am confident we can \nreach and find common ground.\n  Just yesterday, I came to the floor to voice my strong support for \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that would be created under \nChairman Dodd's bill. I believe this bureau should be at the heart of \nany reform legislation--to end abusive practices, serve as an advocate \nfor ordinary Americans, and make sure everybody can get a fair deal. It \nwould even help to prevent a similar financial crisis from taking place \nin the future.\n  But we need to make sure our bill is about more than prevention. We \nneed to be proactive about finding solutions for millions of \nAmericans--especially minority individuals--who are hurting right now. \nWe need to start by expanding access to credit.\n  Under the Dodd bill, the Secretary of the Treasury will be authorized \nto establish a multiyear program of cooperative agreements, financial \nagency agreements, and grants--all designed to make credit more \navailable to low- and middle-income Americans. For the first time in \nyears, our legislation would give ordinary consumers access to \nmainstream financial institutions and provide alternatives to those \npayday loan operations. It would help defray the costs of programs that \nmake small loans so folks could find it easier to get the resources \nthey need without incurring unnecessary risks.\n  Our Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would also play a \nsignificant role in making credit more available. Currently, 16 percent \nof minority households do not have bank accounts, compared with only 4 \npercent of White households. As a result, African Americans and other \nminorities are more likely to use payday lending services, some of \nwhich are questionable practices, to take advantage of their customers.\n  That is why our Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would have the \nauthority to supervise large, nonbank financial companies to cut down \non abusive tactics. It would also help enforce fair credit card laws, \nrein in automatic overdraft programs, and clarify the complex web of \nrate charges.\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\n  In short, this legislation would reduce or eliminate many of the \nfactors that keep people away from banks. It would help raise financial \nliteracy and establish reasonable terms and conditions for loans. At \nits core, it would significantly expand access to credit--especially \namong those who continue to feel the worst effects of this economic \ncrisis.\n  That is why I am proud to support the Wall Street reform bill that \nhas been introduced by my good friend, the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, Chairman Dodd. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 4019 and 3987 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may call up Senator Wyden's amendment \nNo. 4019 and Senator Thune's amendment No. 3987.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for Mr. Wyden, for \n     himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Bennett, Ms. Collins, \n     Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Brown of Ohio, and Mr. Merkley, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4019 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To establish as a standing order of the Senate that a Senator \n  publicly disclose a notice of intent to objecting to any measure or \n                                matter)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I ask the senior Senator from Oregon, does \nhe want to be heard on his amendment?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4019\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Let me particularly express my appreciation to the chairman of the \nfull committee, Senator Dodd. He has been extraordinarily patient, and \nespecially with the large bipartisan coalition that has come together \nbehind this amendment to ensure that finally the secret hold in the \nSenate--one of the most powerful tools a Senator has in the Senate--is \nno longer.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, you have done very good work on this \nissue, along with a number of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. \nThe reason we feel so strongly is because the secret hold in the Senate \nis an indefensible violation of the public's right to know.\n  We all understand every time we are home in our States how frustrated \npeople are with the way business is done in Washington, DC. One way to \nsend a message we are going to start doing business differently is to \nthrow open the doors of government and to make sure nominations and \nlegislation that is important gets debated in public, and people \nactually get to see the give-and-take of colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle--Democrats and Republicans--that is essential to making good \npolicy.\n  Most Americans have no idea what a secret hold is, and I have said on \nmany occasions that my guess is a lot of them think this is some kind \nof hair spray or something. But the fact is, this is an extraordinary \ntool that Senators have to effect the lives of our people, and it ought \nto be something that is exposed to public scrutiny and public \naccountability.\n  When asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton said: That is where the \nmoney is. In the Senate, secret holds are where the power is.\n  What our bipartisan group has said is, it is wrong for a Senator to \nblock a piece of legislation or a nomination in secret by simply \ntelling the leader of their party of their desire. What this has \nmeant--and there have been scores and scores of these secret holds in \nrecent years--is that one person, without any public disclosure \nwhatsoever, can keep the American people from even getting a small peek \nat what is public business. That is not right, and it is time to \neliminate secret holds.\n  In 2007, Senators on both sides of the aisle sought to finally bring \nsome sunlight to this practice. Senator Grassley, the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, and I have worked on this for over a decade. \nUnfortunately, a number of loopholes have been developed since that \nprovision was accepted, and today too much Senate business is done in \nthe dark, unaccountable, and away from public scrutiny and public \nexposure.\n  This amendment closes the loopholes, and it is going to be enforced.\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\nWith this approach, every hold--every single hold--is going to have a \npublic owner within 2 days.\n  I want to close by just briefly describing how this would work. Under \nthis proposal, if a Senator puts a hold on a bill or a nomination, they \nare required to submit a written notice in the Congressional Record \nwithin 2 days. When that bill or nomination comes to the floor, and any \nSenator objects to its consideration on the grounds of a hold, one of \ntwo things is going to happen: either the Senator placing the secret \nhold is going to have their name publicly released, or the Senator who \nobjected on their behalf is going to own that hold. That Senator will \nown it. Their name is going to be published in the congressional \ncalendar.\n  So for the first time--after all of these months and months of debate \nabout secret holds in the Senate--there is going to be public pressure \nand peer pressure on those who try to do Senate business behind closed \ndoors.\n  Two last points with respect to reforms included in this amendment: \nThe proposal eliminates the ability that a Senator now has to lift a \nhold before the current 6-day period expires and never have it \ndisclosed.\n  The Presiding Officer and I have talked a bit about this matter of \nrevolving holds in a 6-day period. This has been a huge abuse. It has \nallowed a Senator to do business in secret and never have it recorded. \nWith this new bipartisan proposal, if a Senator places a hold, even for \na day, even for a minute, the hold is going to be disclosed.\n  Finally, the proposal makes it harder for a group of Senators to \nreplace revolving holds on a nomination or bill. With the 6-day time \nperiod, a group of Senators can pass a hold from one colleague to \nanother and never have it discussed. By requiring all holds to be made \npublic, it will be much more difficult to find new Senators to place \nrevolving holds.\n  The last point: It seems to me, in addition to taking a step the \ncountry feels very strongly about, which is doing more public business \nin public, this is being done in a bipartisan way. This is being done \nin a way that can bring Democrats and Republicans together, in a way \nthat doesn't involve a lot of fingerpointing. I wish to mention a \nnumber of colleagues: the Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia, has been very constructive and has had many \nconversations with me about this; Senator Inhofe, Senator Collins, and \nSenator Grassley. Senator Inhofe has been talking about this issue with \nme and others for almost a decade as well. Senator Bennet, Senator \nMerkley, Senator Whitehouse, all of these Senators, a large, bipartisan \ngroup come together to urge the passage of this amendment. I want to \nsingle out too, though, for particular commendation, Mrs. McCaskill, \nthe Senator from Missouri, because we wouldn't be on this floor today \nhad not the Senator from Missouri prosecuted this cause relentlessly. \nShe has brought to light the number of holds. When we have talked about \nit, she has made the point that this has gone on on both sides of the \naisle. She deserves great credit for this reform being made today.\n  Let me also thank Senator Coburn--Dr. Coburn--of Oklahoma. He has \nbeen very involved in reform issues for many years. We are looking \nforward to an additional reform he is going to be advancing that I look \nforward to sponsoring.\n  I wrap up only by way of trying to highlight that after the Senate \nhas spent a lot of time discussing secret holds over the last few \nmonths, on a bipartisan basis, the Senate comes together today with an \napproach that has actually brought Senators together and is going to \nensure that every single secret hold is going to have an owner. That is \ngoing to be a big change. It is high time. The public deserves to have \npublic business actually done in public, and with the adoption of this \namendment, that will be done.\n  The chairman of the full committee has been very gracious to me. I \nwish to ask for the yeas and nays at this time, and I wish to engage \nthe chairman of the full committee in a colloquy. The chairman has been \nvery helpful with respect to scheduling this.\n  Is it the pleasure of the chairman of the committee that now, having \ndebated this, we set it aside for a vote later in the day?\n  Mr. DODD. My pleasure is we have the vote on the Wyden-Grassley \namendment. So whenever that can occur, I am for it. We can do it right \nnow. I am for it now.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am ready to go to the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw that request. I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. DODD. It is not my sole decision, of course.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The chairman of the full committee has been very patient \nwith us. He has done an extraordinary amount of work. Let us, with that \nrequest, hold off on the yeas and nays, and I ask the chairman that it \nbe scheduled with the next group of votes.\n  Mr. DODD. I can say to my colleague from Oregon that I expect \nmomentarily we will work out some time agreements and we will schedule \na vote fairly quickly.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3987\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I understand amendment No. 3987 has been \ncalled up by the manager of the bill, and I think it has been made \npending, so I wish to speak to it. I hope at the appropriate time we \nwill be able to get an agreement for a vote on it, and I will ask for \nthe yeas and nays following my remarks.\n  This amendment is a very simple, straightforward one. It is one \nparagraph long. It is not complicated. What it essentially does is it \nsets a sunset date for the newly created bureau of consumer protection, \nallowing Congress to reevaluate the bureau after 4 years.\n  I think most Americans, if they knew we were creating a big new \nbureaucracy here in Washington, DC, would want us to have some \noversight. They would want some accountability. They would want to make \nsure their tax dollars are being spent wisely and well.\n  This new consumer protection bureau will have lots of new Federal \nemployees here in Washington, DC. It will spend hundreds of millions of \ndollars every single year. Yet Congress has literally no oversight or \nauthority with regard to this new bureau.\n  It seems to me, at least, that when we have a fiscal situation as we \nhave today in this country where we are running trillion dollar \ndeficits literally every year, where our debts are continuing to pile \nup to the tune of doubling our Federal debt, publicly held debt in 5 \nyears, tripling it in 10 years, we would want to do something to make \nsure that any new expenditure of taxpayer dollars is spent efficiently, \neffectively, and that we are being as frugal as we possibly can.\n  I, for one, would not like to see us go down this path. I don't think \ncreating a huge new bureaucracy here in Washington, DC, is necessary. I \nthink we can address the issue of consumer protection through existing \nagencies and authorities. Frankly, I wish to see this particular title \nin this legislation go away entirely, but it doesn't look as though \nthat is going to happen. We offered an amendment earlier this week that \nwould have been a substitute for this consumer protection title in the \nbill and addressed it in what we think is a more reasonable way, but \nthat was voted down.\n  My amendment simply says that 4 years from now, once this bureau has \nbeen created, let's have it sunset, and then, if necessary, Congress \ncan come back and reauthorize it. Congress then would have an \nopportunity to fine-tune it, perhaps. Congress would have an \nopportunity to look and see if it is performing the function it was \nintended to perform; whether it is doing it in an efficient and cost-\neffective way. Clearly, we have a responsibility to the American \ntaxpayer to have some accountability with this new bureaucracy we are \ngoing to create as a result of this legislation.\n  It is straightforward. We have other agencies of government that we \ndo this with--that we sunset, that we reauthorize. We just did that \nwith the CFTC, which is an agency that was reauthorized during the farm \nbill last year. When we did that, we were able to fine-tune its \nmission. It also gives\n\n[[Page S3695]]\n\nthe opportunity to reorganize an agency, if it has to go through a \nreauthorization process and a sunset process. I don't think it is \nasking too much, when we are talking about literally hundreds of \nmillions of dollars annually and what would appear to be thousands of \nnew Federal employees in this new agency, and what would also appear to \nbe incredibly broad and vast new powers and authorities that will be \nunchecked because there isn't any accountability to the Congress--\nCongress is not going to appropriate annually as we do with most \nagencies the power of the purse. This is all going to be run through \nthe Federal Reserve. Yet it is taxpayer dollars that are at risk here. \nIt is taxpayer dollars that are being used to finance this new \nbureaucracy.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will be able to find their way to support this \namendment. I think it is a reasonable approach. Again, I don't think it \nis asking too much. The American taxpayers are paying the bills every \nyear for this government and are having to deal with the burden of debt \nwe are piling on them because of the spending going on in Washington. \nOf course, if you look at what we are spending this year and what we \nspent last year in the Federal Government, much of it was borrowed. Out \nof all the spending last year, about 43 cents out of every dollar was \nborrowed. This year it is about 39 cents out of every dollar. When we \nare running those kinds of deficits and piling up that kind of debt \nwith this kind of spending going on in Washington and the fiscal \nproblems we have as a Nation, it makes perfect sense to me. I think it \nmakes perfect sense to the American taxpayer. If we are going to create \na huge new bureaucracy--which I said I don't believe is necessary, but, \nnonetheless, if it is going to happen in this legislation--let's take a \nlook at this again 4 years from now. Let's allow it to sunset and allow \nus to go through a process where we reauthorize, reevaluate and review \nand see if it is functioning the way it is intended, and whether these \nauthorities and powers created by this new bureaucracy is what the \nAmerican people want to see happen.\n  One final point I will make. There are lots of entities out there \nother than banks that are worried about this particular title of the \nbill because of the rulemaking authority that exists. We have auto \ndealers, jewelry businesses, furniture stores, orthodontists, and lots \nof small businesses that are concerned they are going to be covered by \nthe reach of this new agency with these broad new authorities with very \nlittle accountability and oversight by the Congress. That is a concern \nto a lot of small businesses to whom we look to create the jobs and, \nhopefully, initiate an economic recovery in this country and get the \neconomy growing and back on track. This, in fact, could put lots of new \nburdens, lots of new bandaid, lots of new costs on many of these small \nbusinesses. That is yet another reason why I believe this is a bad idea \nin the first place, but at a minimum we ought to allow it to sunset so \nwe have an opportunity to review it and reevaluate it and make some \ndecisions with regard to its future 4 years from now.\n  It is very straightforward. It is one paragraph long. Sunset the \nBureau of Consumer Financial Protection and allow Congress to \nreevaluate that bureau after 4 years.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. I ask for the yeas \nand nays and would hope at the appropriate time to be able to have a \nrecorded vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3989 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am hoping that later this afternoon \nthere will be a unanimous consent request that relates to an amendment \nI have introduced, amendment No. 3989, and I wish to take a few minutes \nnow since there is no one else seeking recognition on the floor to \ndescribe this amendment in the hopes that when it comes up later, we \ncan move to it and to a vote very quickly.\n  I have spoken on the floor of the Senate several times about the \namendment because it is complicated in one respect. This amendment \nrelates to the fees charged by credit card companies such as Visa and \nMasterCard to the retailers and businesses that accept the credit \ncards. So if you are a customer of a shop and you purchase something, \nyou present a credit card. There are then two transactions taking \nplace, at least. One transaction is between you and your credit card \ncompany, because you put the credit card out there and you have to pay \nthe bill later on. The other transaction relates to the business, the \nshop that accepts your credit card. By accepting your credit card, they \nalso accept an obligation to pay the credit card company or the bank \nissuing the credit card. It is called an interchange fee. There is \nanother one called a swipe fee. So the credit card company is getting \npaid both ways. They get paid by the customers who pay interest on \noutstanding balances on their credit cards, and they get paid by the \nretail establishments that accept the credit cards. The credit card \ncompanies have a lucrative business going on both sides of the \ntransaction.\n  This amendment I am speaking about relates not to you as a customer \nowning a credit card, but rather to the shop or retail establishment \nthat accepts the credit card. What is a reasonable amount for them to \npay?\n  There are two major types of credit cards. One is a credit card and \nthe other is a debit card. A credit card is basically that. You are \nbuying on credit with the promise to pay when your monthly bill comes \naround. The debit card is different because it takes the money directly \nout of your checking account and gives it to the shopowner. They are \ndifferent in that, No. 1, there is more risk, because people may not \npay their credit card balance at the end of the month, so risk is \nassociated with it; and in the other there is very little, if any, \nrisk. If there is no money in the checking account, then it isn't going \nto be paid to the shopowner. It is a very simple transaction much like \nwriting a check and the bank honoring the check.\n  My amendment addresses the interchange fee. That is the amount paid \nby the retail establishment to the credit card company when a customer \npresents a credit card.\n  The two major credit cards in America are Visa and MasterCard. They \naccount for over 80 percent of the credit and debit card business in \nthe United States. They are the giants in America. There are others--\nDiscover, American Express, and others. But the two, Visa and \nMasterCard, are the two big kids on the block. They have established \nlegal arrangements with the businesses that accept their credit cards. \nIt is those legal arrangements we are questioning with this amendment \nwhich I am going to propose later in the day.\n  This amendment will help small businesses, merchants, and consumers \nby providing relief from high interchange fees for debit card \ntransactions. We are focusing on debit card transactions because those \nare the ones that have much less, if any, risk involved to them.\n  On the floor of the Senate, we are working on a bill to prevent the \nbig banks from basically rigging the financial system in a way that \nhelps Wall Street and hurts the shops on Main Street. If we are going \nto look at the rigged financial systems that hurt small businesses, we \nhave to include the credit and debit card industries.\n  Credit and debit cards are rapidly replacing cash and checks in the \nAmerican economy. There are over 1 billion credit and debit cards in \nAmerica. Think of that: 300 million people and 1 billion credit and \ndebit cards. That gives you an idea of the number of cards people own.\n  Last year, Americans conducted $1.7 trillion in transactions on \ncredit cards and $1.6 trillion on debit cards, which are becoming more \nand more popular. Credit and debit cards are now used in more than half \nthe retail sales in the United States of America. Yes, being able to \npay with plastic is a great convenience, but there is another reality. \nThe shift from cash and checks to credit and debit means that the way \nwe do business in America is increasingly falling under the control of \nthese two giants of the credit and debit card industry--Visa and \nMasterCard.\n  These card networks dominate the credit and debit industries, as I \nmentioned earlier. They are used in 80 percent of all such \ntransactions. Unfortunately, these two companies are looking for \nprofits, and they are not always looking out for the best interests of \nthe merchants, the small businesses, the\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\nretail businesses or the consumers. Interchange fees are a classic \nexample.\n  A lot of people in Congress do not want me to bring up this issue. \nThey have told me this is the wrong bill to talk about it. I think not. \nI tried to bring it up under credit card reform and they said: No, \nSenator Durbin, that is the wrong bill. Now I want to bring it up on \nthe Financial Stability Act, and they say: No, it is the wrong bill. I \ndo not think it is. I do not think there is a right bill with an issue \nthat is this controversial and complex. But it is an important enough \nissue that we should address it and we should vote on it.\n  Visa and MasterCard require interchange fees every time someone uses \na debit or credit card. The fees range from 1 percent to 3 percent of \nthe amount of the transaction. It is a convoluted system. Visa and \nMasterCard charge interchange fees to the merchants, but instead of \nkeeping the money, they pass the money to the banks that issue the Visa \nand MasterCard. Why do they do this? Some of it is to help the banks \ncover the cost of conducting the transaction. Most of it is to induce \nbanks to issue more Visa and MasterCard credit cards.\n  Around $50 billion in interchange fees were collected in 2008, with \nabout 80 percent of that money going to 10 of the largest banks in \nAmerica--80 percent of it. The card-issuing banks use this interchange \nrevenue to pay for ads, to offer rewards, to issue more cards. Not \nsurprisingly, the revenue also helps banks make large profits and give \nbonuses to their CEOs. Banks love the money, and they love the current \ninterchange system.\n  As interchange fees go up, it means banks get more money to issue \nmore cards and increase their profits. Rising interchange fees also \nbenefit Visa and MasterCard because it means more cards will be issued, \nand with each card comes another fee, called a network fee, every time \nthe card is used.\n  What a great system--as long as interchange fees are increasing, both \nthe card networks and the banks could not be happier.\n  The troubling thing about interchange fees is they are deducted from \nevery transaction left for the seller. This is very different from cash \nand check systems. When a business makes a cash sale, it gets full \npayment in hand, and the Federal Reserve requires the checks clear at \ntheir full face value. So a $100 sale by cash or check is a $100 sale. \nBut when a business makes a $100 sale by credit or debit card, the \nbanks and their card networks take a cut. The business may end up with \nonly $98 out of $100 that is on the debit card, maybe less. The \nbusiness is getting shortchanged the actual face value of the \ntransaction.\n  To make up for interchange fees, businesses are forced to raise their \nprices, cut back on expenses or something such as that. They may even \ncut back on employees to keep up with these interchange fees. In a \nnormal market, you see banks competing with one another to do business \nwith the restaurants, shops, and the merchants. With that competition, \nthings would be a lot better. But, in fact, the real world of credit \ncards with the two giants, Visa and MasterCard, is a world where there \nis little or no competition.\n  The credit and debit card markets are not normal. Visa and MasterCard \nunilaterally set interchange fee rates that apply to all banks within \ntheir card networks. There is no negotiation between the banks and \nmerchants over reducing interchange rates. Individual businesses in New \nHampshire, Illinois, New York, and all across America have no \nbargaining power with these giant credit card companies. They set the \nrules, they fix the fees, take it or leave it.\n  Visa and MasterCard have every incentive to continue to raise \ninterchange fees because that additional revenue makes it more likely \nbanks will issue more cards.\n  What can businesses do to stop these rising interchange fees? Almost \nnothing. Some--very rarely--businesses say they do not accept credit or \ndebit cards, but the vast overwhelming number of businesses do. They \nhave to. It is part of doing business in America.\n  Visa and MasterCard have 80 percent of the credit and debit market. \nMerchants have to use them. They tell the merchants: If you want to \ntake our card, you live with the fees we charge. That is not a \ncompetitive situation at all.\n  This current system is not sustainable. If left alone, it is going to \nget worse for small businesses that face higher fees, for consumers who \nface higher prices, and for everyone but the banks and credit card \nnetworks.\n  Here is the most unbelievable part. Businesses in every other country \nin the world get a better interchange deal from Visa and MasterCard \nthan businesses in the United States of America. I told that to \nsomeone, and they said: It sounds like pharmaceutical drugs, where you \ncan buy the U.S. pharmaceutical drug more cheaply in Canada, Mexico, \nand Europe. It is the American consumers paying more.\n  The same thing is true when it comes to Visa and MasterCard. They \ncharge American businesses higher interchange fees than they charge \nbusinesses around the world. Visa and MasterCard already charge the \nhighest interchange rates in the world to American businesses, and the \nrates keep going up.\n  There was a GAO report last year. It found that Visa and MasterCard--\nlisten to this--had voluntarily reduced the interchange fees on \nbusinesses in other countries. Just last month, Visa voluntarily \nlowered many of its European debit rates by 60 percent--unilaterally \nlowered them by 60 percent. What happened in the United States? They \nraised the fees by 30 percent on American businesses trying to fight \ntheir way out of this recession.\n  These huge credit card companies had some sympathy for Europe but not \nfor America. That is unacceptable, and we need to do something about \nit. That is why I offer this amendment.\n\n  The amendment requires that debit card interchange fees be reasonable \nand proportional. I do not pick a number. I do not set a fee. We want \nto make sure they are proportional and reasonable to the cost incurred \nin processing the transaction.\n  Debit card transactions are fundamentally different from credit card \ntransactions. All that happens in a debit card transaction is you \ndeduct money from your bank account. It is akin to writing a check. \nThat is why debit cards are advertised as check cards.\n  Right now in the United States, there are zero transaction fees \ndeducted when you use a check. The Federal Reserve does not allow \ntransaction fees to be charged for checks. But when it comes to debit \ncards, Visa and MasterCard charge high interchange fees just as they do \nfor credit. Why? Because they can get away with it. There is no \nregulation, there is no law, there is no one holding them accountable.\n  An estimated $20 billion was collected from businesses and consumers \nacross America in debit interchange fees last year--$20 billion. That \nmoney comes from the bottom line of every small business in every town \nin America that accepts payments by debit card.\n  My amendment will bring some reasonableness to the system. It tells \nthe Federal Reserve to ensure that debit fees are reasonable and \nproportional to cost and not just a way of generating huge profits at \nthe expense of small businesses. If we can reduce debit interchange \nfees to a reasonable level, it would be similar to a tax break on every \ndebit card sale a merchant makes. Think how much that would help small \nbusinesses on Main Street.\n  One of my colleagues said: Even if the businesses save money and do \nnot have to pay more to the credit card companies, what makes you think \nthey are going to give the consumers a break with it? They may take it \nin profits. They can. There is no way to police that.\n  I just had a press conference with the National Association of \nConvenience Stores. We know them as the small shop on the corner that \nhas some groceries and maybe candy bars, slurpies--whatever you want to \nstop and buy. It also turns out these convenience stores sell 82 \npercent of the gasoline sold in America. They are part of the same \nassociation.\n  I said to the man who ran the association: What guarantee do we have, \nif we reduce the amount you have to pay the credit card companies, that \nthe consumers will feel it? He said: We are the only business that \nposts prices right out on the sidewalk for all the motorists to see of \nour most popular\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\nitem, our gasoline. We fight over pennies. If we can reduce it a penny \nor two a gallon, we are going to attract more customers. If we can save \nmoney when it comes to these interchange fees, it puts us in a more \ncompetitive position to bring in more customers to buy gasoline. That \nis one side of the argument that could inure to the benefit of the \nconsumers. There are no guarantees.\n  In the world I am talking about, you get to shop around. As the \ncustomer, you pick the convenience store, you pick the grocery store, \nyou pick the prices. When it comes to the owners of the store using \ncredit cards, they do not get to shop. They get a ``take it or leave \nit'' from MasterCard and Visa and have no bargaining power whatsoever.\n  Many Senators are worried about community banks that also issue \ncredit cards. One thing I hear over and over from my colleagues is we \ndo not want to hurt smalltown banks, regional banks, banks that are not \nthe big boys on Wall Street that issue credit cards. That is why I \namended my amendment and said we will exempt all banks with less than \n$10 billion in assets. If you have more than $10 billion in assets, it \nwould be hard to call you a community bank. You are a much bigger \noperation.\n  Under my amendment, Visa and MasterCard could continue to set the \nsame debit interchange rates they do today for small banks and credit \nunions. Ninety-nine percent of banks, 99 percent of credit unions have \nassets of less than $10 billion. Of all the credit unions in the United \nStates, only three have assets over $10 billion.\n  One of my colleagues said: I am very close to the credit unions. I \nsay to my colleague: I am sure you are also close to the small \nbusinesses in your State, and in this situation, 99 percent of the \ncredit unions, virtually every credit union in your State would be \nexempt from this law, but your small businesses may benefit from it \nbecause the largest banks have the largest impact on credit card \ninterchange fees.\n  My amendment would subject the biggest banks in America, the ones \nthat issue the vast majority of debit cards and get the vast majority \nof interchange fees, to a reasonable fee requirement.\n  I hear the so-called independent community banks of America oppose my \namendment. I could not understand it. If I exempted banks with less \nthan $10 billion, that would exempt 99.8 percent of all of the so-\ncalled community banks in America. Why do they still oppose it? I have \nlearned why. The Independent Community Bank Association is a major \nissuer of credit and debit cards. They are one of the top 25 credit \ncard issuers in the United States and are the 23rd largest debit card \nissuers. They make a lot of money off interchange fees. They do not \nhave clean hands in this debate. They are, in fact, conflicted in this \ndebate. They are not arguing on behalf of small banks. Sadly, they are \narguing on behalf of their own trade association credit cards and the \nfact they receive these generous interchange fees.\n  ICBA, so-called Independent Community Bankers Association, profits \nfrom the unfair swipe-fee system just like the biggest banks in America \ntoday. That is a conflict of interest.\n  Is this Washington trade association truly representing small banks \nthat will get higher interchange fees than the big banks under my \namendment or is it just interested in protecting its own revenue \nstream? I called back to some of my friends in downstate Illinois, \nwhere I come from--small town, small city America--and I talked to them \nabout this. I said: I am exempting banks with assets of less than $10 \nbillion.\n\n  They said to me: Well, that is perfectly reasonable. It won't touch \nany community banks you know in downstate Illinois.\n  That is an indication to me that this trade association out here is \nnot speaking--really speaking--for community banks when they say they \noppose this amendment as amended.\n  My amendment also aims to make sure Visa and MasterCard can't block \nmerchants from offering discounts to their customers. For example, Visa \nhas a provision in its contract with all of the businesses that accept \nit that the business cannot offer a customer a discount to use a \ncompeting credit card, such as a MasterCard. MasterCard has a similar \nprovision. So they are protecting one another. You can't say, for \nexample, that your shop prefers Visa cards because the Visa card \ncharges you less as a business. They prohibit that back and forth.\n  Some people say: Well, maybe that is okay. Would it be okay if we \ntake it to the next example: It is like Coca Cola saying that a store \ncan sell Coke but only if it agrees not to sell Pepsi at a lower price, \nand it is like Pepsi saying the same thing. Who loses in that deal? I \ncan tell you who loses--the customer, because there is no competition \nand the business because it does not attract the customers with \ncompetition and lower prices. Translate that into credit cards, and \nthat is what Visa and MasterCard are doing today. My amendment strips \nthese provisions from Visa and MasterCard contracts so merchants can \noffer discounts without penalty.\n  My amendment would also allow merchants to offer discounts for \ncustomers who pay by cash, check, or debit card as opposed to credit \ncards. Sometimes, Visa and MasterCard threaten to fine merchants who \noffer discounts for these cheaper forms of payment. My amendment would \nend those threats once and for all. This type of effort to promote \nnoncompetitive practices should not be allowed, and my amendment would \nbring it to an end.\n  Nothing in my amendment would allow merchants to discriminate against \ncards issued by small banks and credit unions. That was another \ncomment. They said, well, listen, Durbin, if your amendment passes, \nthey will say: This establishment will not accept credit cards from a \nsmall bank that issues these cards. We make it express in the amendment \nthat we are offering that you cannot discriminate against the issuer, \nthat is, the bank, of the credit card. You can only say you prefer one \nnetwork over another because the interchange fees on your business \nhappen to be lower, but you can't pick out banks. You may say: We \nprefer Visa or MasterCard, but you cannot pick them out by banks.\n  Interchange fees have real-life consequences on businesses across \nAmerica. I have been receiving calls and letters from small business \nowners all over the State asking Congress to fix this rigged \ninterchange system. Last week, my office received petitions signed by \n92,000 Illinois consumers seeking to reform credit and debit \ninterchange fees. The amendment has also been endorsed by 203 national \nand State trade associations representing every type of business you \ncan think of, and it has been endorsed by Americans for Financial \nReform, a coalition of over 250 consumer, civil rights, labor, retiree, \nand business groups.\n  If you talk to Visa, MasterCard, and the biggest banks, all you will \nhear is how well the current system is working and how we ought to keep \nour hands off it. But if you talk to the local grocery store owner or \nthe person who owns the local restaurant in your hometown or the man \nwho owns the gas station or the family who runs a local diner--small \nbusinesses and merchants across America--they will tell you stories \nabout dealing with Visa and MasterCard and what it has meant to them in \ntheir business.\n  This afternoon, Art Potash, who owns some grocery stores in Chicago, \ncame by my office. We had a little press conference. He talked about \nthe competitiveness of the grocery business, where the return is \nusually 1 or 2 percent and he ends up paying 2 to 3 percent back to the \ncredit card companies for people who use credit and debit cards. He is \nstuck because if he doesn't accept credit and debit cards, he is really \ntrying to fight the tide. More and more people are using them. But he \nis paying a fee, which is cutting right into the bottom line. With this \ninterchange fee at a more reasonable level, he would be able to expand \nhis business and hire more people. Wouldn't that be a good outcome in \nan economy where we are desperate to deal with unemployment?\n  Let's put Main Street above the big banks and credit card companies. \nI ask my colleagues to help me in passing this amendment.\n  Madam President, I have received letters and comments from merchants \nand businesses across the State of Illinois supporting my amendment for \ninterchange reform. I have received them from James Phillip of \nPhillip's\n\n[[Page S3698]]\n\nFlower Shops in Westmont, IL; Robert Jones, president of American Sale \npatio store in Tinley Park, IL; George LeDonne, owner of LeDonne \nHardware in Berkeley, IL; Russ Peters, owner of Mobile Print in Mount \nProspect, IL; Jim Dames, owner of Snackers Cafe in Western Springs; \nGeorge Preckwinkle, a friend of mine and president of Bishop Hardware \nand Supply, with 10 locations in central Illinois; Paul Taylor, owner \nof Taylor's Gifts and Bonsai; Rattanaporn Deeudomchan, owner of the \nKing and I Thai Restaurant in Oak Park; Yvonne Francois, who owns \nQueenie's Court, a restaurant in the food court at the Ford City Mall \nin Chicago; and John Gaudette, director of the Illinois Main Street \nAlliance, representing 450 small businesses across the State.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this stage \nof the debate some of the comments and letters which have been sent to \nme.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Americans for Financial Reform,\n\n                                    Washington, DC., May 13, 2010.\n     Senator Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: We write on behalf of Americans for \n     Financial Reform, an unprecedented coalition of over 250 \n     national, state and local groups who have come together to \n     reform the financial industry. Members of our coalition \n     include consumer, civil rights, investor, retiree, community, \n     labor, religious and business groups as well as Nobel Prize-\n     winning economists. We support a strong Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau and oppose weakening amendments to the \n     Restoring American Financial Stability Act, S. 3217.\n       Durbin Amendment #3989 is a move towards helping Main \n     Street.\n       Americans for Financial Reform supports the Durbin \n     Reasonable Fees and Rules for Payment Card Transactions \n     Amendment #3989 because it is good for merchants and good for \n     consumers. The bank payment networks, Visa and MC, impose \n     high, nonnegotiable interchange fees for accepting credit and \n     debit cards and use other unfair contractual practices that \n     mean all consumers pay more at the store and more at the \n     pump, whether they pay with cash or plastic. The bulk of the \n     $48 billion estimated yearly take from interchange fees flows \n     to the largest Goliath banks. Giving merchants more \n     flexibility against unfair bank and card network practices \n     will result in more payment choices for consumers and lower \n     merchant costs.\n       For information, please contact Ed Mierzwinski.\n           Sincerely,\n     Americans for Financial Reform.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 12, 2010.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The undersigned \n     organizations, representing a diverse array of interests \n     including small business, state, organizations, dentists, \n     retailers, restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores \n     and others, write in strong support of S. Amdt. 3989, \n     sponsored by Senator Richard Durbin, regarding interchange \n     fee reforms to S. 3217, the Restoring American Financial \n     Stability Act of 2010 now before the Senate. Unless relief is \n     granted, interchange ``swipe fees,'' which amounted to $48 \n     billion in 2008, will continue to rise as card companies and \n     issuing banks seek even higher profits, primarily on the \n     backs of our organizations' members. This comes at a time \n     when businesses, state agencies and charities--all of whom \n     pay interchange fees--are struggling to help the economy grow \n     again and when consumers can least afford pricing increases.\n       Despite Congress' efforts to reign in abusive practices, \n     credit card companies continue to take advantage of a major \n     loophole in financial regulation. In fact, they announced \n     interchange rate increases just months after the passage of \n     the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure \n     Act of 2009 (Credit CARD Act), effectively circumventing many \n     of the reforms instituted by Congress. More recently, Visa \n     Europe announced last month that it was voluntarily dropping \n     debit card interchange fees to 0.2% in Europe, a decrease of \n     60%, while earlier in the month Visa increased rates on \n     similar transactions in the United States by some 30%. Quite \n     literally, at a rate of approximately 2.0% on debit card \n     interchange fees, which is 10 times higher in the United \n     States, American businesses are subsidizing European \n     transactions.\n       Simple, common-sense reforms are needed to correct this \n     market imbalance, which would give our organizations' members \n     additional tools to manage our costs related to interchange \n     fees. First, the amendment would give the Federal Reserve the \n     authority to conduct an open and fair rulemaking--without \n     prescribing an outcome--in order to develop regulations to \n     ensure that interchange fees imposed on debit card \n     transactions be ``reasonable and proportional'' to the cost \n     incurred in processing the transaction. Debit transactions \n     are not an extension of credit and are directly drawn from a \n     consumer's checking account, yet the interchange rate on \n     debit transactions continues to increase. Small banks, credit \n     unions and thrifts with assets of under $10 billion would be \n     carved-out from these rules, meaning that 99% of all banks, \n     99% of all credit unions, and 97% of all thrifts would be \n     exempt, allowing them to continue to receive the same \n     interchange fees they receive today.\n       Second, the amendment would prohibit anti-competitive \n     restrictions on discounts and the setting of minimum \n     transaction levels, providing entities with the freedom to \n     choose their preferred method of payment. Under current \n     rules, any business, charity or government agency that \n     accepts credit or debit cards is prohibited from setting a \n     minimum transaction level, such as $3, even though the entity \n     may actually lose money on the transaction because of slim \n     profit margins. Visa and MasterCard can and do impose fines \n     on small businesses up to $5,000 per day for such offenses, \n     which has the effect of ensuring that the card companies and \n     big banks turn a profit even if the small business loses \n     money on the transaction. In addition, the amendment allows \n     businesses to incentivize the use of one card network over \n     another (e.g., a discount may be provided for Discover cards \n     if they carry a lower interchange rate) and allows businesses \n     to offer discounts on certain forms of payment (e.g., a \n     discount may be offered for cash, check, PIN debit, etc., all \n     of which carry lower rates than credit cards). This amendment \n     would not enable merchants to discriminate against debit \n     cards issued by small banks and credit unions. Visa and \n     MasterCard require merchants to accept all cards within their \n     networks, and this amendment does not change that \n     requirement.\n       By providing these and other important reforms, the \n     Congress will send a strong message that it supports \n     modernizing and updating our financial payments systems while \n     providing relief to businesses owners who have seen their \n     interchange credit card assessments skyrocket--for many \n     businesses exceeding the cost of providing health care \n     benefits to their employees.\n       In closing, we are very concerned about the unintended \n     consequences of not addressing interchange fees will have on \n     our industries as the card companies and big banks continue \n     to seek higher profits as a direct result of financial \n     regulatory reform legislation, and other failing portfolios, \n     through ever increasing interchange fees. We ask that you \n     support S. Amdt. 3989, sponsored by Senator Durbin, to the \n     Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 when it \n     comes up for a vote in order to ensure that financial \n     regulation reform is comprehensive and complete. We look \n     forward to working with you and your staff to incorporate \n     these meaningful, common-sense reforms as part of the \n     financial regulatory reform legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      National Trade Associations.\n       American Apparel & Footwear Association, American \n     Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, American \n     Beverage Licensees, American Booksellers Association, \n     American Dental Association, American Home Furnishings \n     Alliance, American Hotel & Lodging Association, American \n     Nursery & Landscape Association . . .\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I see one of my colleagues on the Senate \nfloor, so I am going to yield. And I say to my colleagues, I am hoping \nthis amendment comes up this afternoon. I will take less time to \ndescribe it then, but I wanted to use this time to put my full \nstatement in the Record. I will just say to my colleagues that there \nwon't be another amendment that we will consider this week or in the \nnear future of such importance to small businesses across America. \nLet's stand up for these small businesses and give them a fighting \nchance against giants in the credit card industry. It is only fair, and \nit is a good way to revive this economy and put people back to work.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest, proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to speak about amendment No. \n3788, an amendment essential to protecting consumers. As we work to \nrein in the excesses of Wall Street and shore up our economy, we must \ndo all that we can to ensure consumers can get discount prices from \nretail stores at the very time when they need them the most.\n  My amendment will restore the nearly century old rule that made it \nillegal under antitrust law for a manufacturer to set a price below \nwhich a retailer could not sell a product--a practice known as ``resale \nprice maintenance'' or ``vertical price fixing.'' This rule was \noverturned in June 2007 by a narrow 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court \nin the Leegin case. My amendment is\n\n[[Page S3699]]\n\nidentical to the Discount Pricing Consumer Act--a bill which has 10 \ncosponsors and passed the Judiciary Committee last month. Our bill has \nbeen endorsed by 39 State attorneys general, the leading consumer \ngroups, as well as numerous antitrust experts, including former FTC \nChairman Pitofsky.\n  For 96 years until the Leegin decision the rules were clear. \nManufacturers could not set a retail price, and retailers could not be \nprevented from discounting. Millions of consumers saw the benefits of \ndiscount prices every day. Thousands of retailers all across the \ncountry were able to discount their products and sell their goods at \nthe most competitive prices. Many credit the ban on vertical price \nfixing with the rise of today's low price, discount retail giants--\nstores like Target, Best Buy, Walmart, and the Internet sites Amazon \nand EBay, which offer consumers a wide array of highly desired products \nat discount prices.\n  But the consequences of the Leegin decision should worry all of us. \nAllowing manufacturers to set retail prices threatens the very \nexistence of discounting and discount stores, and leads to higher \nprices for consumers. In his dissenting opinion in Leegin, Justice \nBreyer cited economic studies that estimated that if only 10 percent of \nmanufacturers engaged in vertical price fixing, retail bills would \naverage $750 to $1,000 higher for the average family of four every \nyear.\n  And the experience of the last 3 years since the Leegin decision is \nbeginning to confirm our fears regarding the dangers of permitting \nvertical price fixing. The Wall Street Journal has reported that more \nthan 5,000 companies have implemented minimum pricing policies. \nInternet monitors scour the Web at the behest of manufacturers to \nprevent discounting. And there have been many reports of everything \nfrom consumer electronics and video games to baby products and toys, \nrental cars and bathtubs being subject to minimum retail pricing \npolicies.\n  My amendment is quite simple and direct--it merely returns us to the \nstate of the law the day before Leegin was decided. It would simply add \none sentence to section 1 of the Sherman Act--a statement that any \nagreement with a retailer, wholesaler or distributor setting a price \nbelow which a product or service cannot be sold violates the law. No \nbalancing or protracted legal proceedings will be necessary. Should a \nmanufacturer enter into such an agreement it will unquestionably \nviolate antitrust law. Instead of the complexity of the ``rule of \nreason'' announced by Leegin, we will once again have a simple and \nclear legal rule banning vertical price fixing--a legal rule that will \npromote low prices and discount competition to the benefit of consumers \nevery day.\n  In the last 50 years, millions of consumers have benefited from an \nexplosion of retail competition from new large discounters in virtually \nevery product, from clothing to electronics to groceries, in both ``big \nbox'' stores and on the Internet. My amendment will correct the Supreme \nCourt's abrupt change to antitrust law, and will ensure that today's \nvibrant competitive retail marketplace and the savings gained by \nAmerican consumers from discounting will not be jeopardized by the \nabolition of the ban on vertical price fixing. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Schumer \nand Levin be added as original cosponsors to amendment No. 4016.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank them for their support. I also want to \nfirst thank Senators Lugar and Bond for the efforts they brought forth, \nalong with those on our side, for this important amendment.\n  This amendment will make it a fact of life that individual Americans \ncan more easily access their credit score. I have come to the floor of \nthe Senate on a number of occasions over the last week to push for an \nimportant change in the world of credit bureaus and credit reports and \nnow credit scores.\n  A credit score impacts consumers' interest rates, monthly payments on \nhome loans, and can even affect a consumer's ability to buy a car, rent \nan apartment, and get phone or Internet service. I have been working \nwith Chairman Dodd, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and \nother colleagues in the Senate to reach a compromise that will help us \nachieve those objectives I just outlined.\n  I am very pleased to say I think at this fairly late hour on a \nThursday that we have agreed to an approach that will give millions of \nAmericans unsolicited access to their genuine credit score. I have \ntalked about the difference between the score and the report. The \nreport is a valuable tool, but unless people have their score they do \nnot know where they stand.\n  Our bipartisan amendment will build upon existing law and require \ndisclosure of credit scores to consumers whenever their credit score is \nused against them. So under our amendment, if they are turned down for \ncredit because of their credit score, which is not an unusual \noccurrence, frankly, they have the right to see the credit score that \nwas used against them.\n  Under this amendment, if they are charged a higher interest rate or \nget less favorable terms on a loan because of their score, they will \nalso receive notification of that score.\n  So this amendment, again, for which we have bipartisan support, \ncorrects one of the inequities in our financial system which keeps \nAmericans from accessing this very important tool that, frankly, I \nthink is as important as their health statistics: their blood pressure, \nheart rate, and so on. But people have not been able to access that \ncredit score.\n  So there is a fundamental principle that is at stake. If their credit \nscore is being used against them, they ought to have the right to at \nleast see it. This Wall Street accountability package we are \nconsidering, at the heart of it--I think the Senator from New Hampshire \nknows this--we want to give Americans more tools so they are more \nfinancially literate. They can take control of their financial future.\n  So the best part of this amendment is that consumers will receive \nnotification of their score without any red tape. This is good \ngovernment. It is pure transparency reform that will empower Americans, \nas I have said, with critical information about their financial health. \nThis makes common sense.\n  Let's put Americans in charge of their financial future. So as I \nclose, I thank, in turn, Chairman Dodd, Senator Lugar, Senators Levin, \nBond, Schumer, Begich, Lautenberg, and all of the 20-plus additional \nSenators who helped push for this important reform.\n  I especially thank Senator Pryor who has worked with us to find \nsomething everyone can agree on. I look forward to this amendment being \ncalled up later, and I urge all colleagues to support this commonsense \nreform that will give Americans control over their financial futures.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3852 to Amendment No. 4019\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I call for the regular order with \nrespect to the Wyden amendment No. 4019 and call up my amendment No. \n3852 as a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint], for himself \n     and Mr. Vitter, proposes an amendment numbered 3852 to \n     amendment No. 4019.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Tribute to Cathleen Berrick and Cynthia Bascetta\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak once more about \nour Nation's great Federal employees.\n  Henry Clay once said:\n\n       Government is a trust, and the officers of the government \n     are trustees; and both the trust and trustees are created for \n     the benefit of the people.\n\n  Every dollar of the taxpayers' money that we in Congress spend on \ntheir behalf must be accounted for and every program rigorously audited \nto prevent waste and fraud. That job belongs to the tireless and \npersistent employees of the Government Accountability Office.\n  Since its founding in 1921, the GAO has been called ``the taxpayers' \nbest friend.'' It is the people's watchdog, the home of over 3,000 \nFederal employees whose main task is to save the American people money \nby analyzing how public funds are spent. They make recommendations to \nCongress on how best to eliminate waste and make programs more \nefficient. If our elected officials have been entrusted to guard over \npublic business, surely it is the men and women of the GAO who, in the \nwords of the ancient adage, ``watch over the guardians.''\n  Today, I want to highlight the achievements of two outstanding \nemployees of the GAO.\n  Cathleen Berrick has spent her whole career as a public servant. \nFirst in the Office of the Inspector General at the Pentagon and with \nthe Air Force Audit Agency, and later with the Postal Service's \nInspector General and the GAO, Cathleen has been at the forefront of \nensuring the accountability of government for many years.\n  As a Managing Director at the GAO for Homeland Security and Justice, \nshe has led comprehensive analyses of potential security \nvulnerabilities at the Transportation Security Agency and suggested key \nimprovements.\n  In 2008, when assigned to review the plan for the TSA's Secure Flight \nProgram, which screens air passengers against terrorist watch lists, \nCathleen identified flaws and offered sound recommendations. She also \nconducted studies and authored reports recommending more oversight in \nhow we secure our Nation's mass-transit systems and passenger rail.\n  Cathleen has testified before congressional committees over 20 times \nand has proven to be an expert resource for policymakers.\n  The second person whose story I will share is Cynthia Bascetta. \nCynthia had worked for the GAO for 30 years when she was set to retire. \nHowever, the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina caused her to \ndelay her retirement, and she decided to remain in public service.\n  As the GAO's Director for Health Care, Cynthia leads two major \nreviews of public health care infrastructure in New Orleans to ensure \nrecovery funds are being spent wisely and for the greatest benefit. In \nher three decades of service at the GAO, she has fought to improve \nFederal disability policies, urged making HIV treatment and prevention \na national priority, and recommended changes to Social Security that \nhelped beneficiaries return to work without losing health care \nbenefits.\n  One of the areas of focus throughout Cynthia's career has been \nimproving care for our wounded veterans. She testified at the first \ncongressional hearing to investigate the conditions at Walter Reed \nMedical Center, and her reviews were critical in understanding where \nchanges needed to be made.\n  Since we passed the Recovery Act last year, the GAO has been \npreparing reports every 60 days on how funds are being used. Cynthia \nhas been working recently as the GAO's State lead for Illinois, \ncarefully reviewing every dollar from the Recovery Act being spent \nthere.\n  Madam President, employees of the GAO continue to ensure government \nprograms work for the American people. They remain ever-vigilant to \nensure all of our public funds are spent wisely and carefully.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Cathleen Berrick, \nCynthia Bascetta, and all of the outstanding public servants at the \nGovernment Accountability Office for their service to our Nation. They \nare all truly great Federal employees.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before our colleague from Delaware leaves \nthe floor--I said this once before, but I want to repeat it. Our \ncolleague from Delaware has only been here a few months, I guess--a \nlittle over a year now; it goes by very quickly--having stepped in \nafter our colleague, Joe Biden, became Vice President, and I do not \nknow how well noticed it goes, but Senator Kaufman, I believe almost on \na daily basis or something like that----\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Weekly.\n  Mr. DODD. On a weekly basis--takes a few minutes to recognize people \nwhose names and faces I am sure most Americans have never known or \nseen. Their families and neighbors are familiar with them. But he \nchooses three or four people who have worked on behalf of all of us, in \nmany cases for years, without ever getting the kind of notoriety and \ncelebration people in elective office receive. I wish to thank him for \ndoing it. It is not a piece of legislation. It is not an amendment to a \nbill. It is not some ordinance or some treaty this Senate has an \nobligation to engage in; it is merely taking a little time to recognize \nsome very fine Americans. We all hear about the ones who mess up and do \nthings that are wrong. They get the headlines. But every day, there are \nliterally thousands of people in this country who go to work on behalf \nof the American public who do their jobs diligently and serve us all \ntremendously well. The fact that one Member in this body every week \ntakes a few minutes to say thank you is something I deeply appreciate, \nand I thank him.\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I \nthank him for what he does, and I wish to say to all the world, he is \ntruly one of the great Federal employees. So I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3701]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3776\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to speak about Specter amendment \nNo. 3776, which has already been debated by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, but I wish to bring up the other side because it is a \nvery technical, legal issue which crosses professional fields of \naccounting, tax preparation, and legal counsel. However, to understand \nwhere Senator Specter would take this amendment, I wish to explain \nwhere we have been.\n  In 1995, Congress rightly decided that the Securities and Exchange \nCommission--the SEC--should have sole authority and ability to \nprosecute criminals violating securities laws. The decision was made \nbecause we knew private securities lawsuits would be driven by the \nwrong factors. At that time, we saw how just a handful of law firms \nwere using class action lawsuits to clog up the courts and to tie up \ncompanies in litigation for years for mere fluctuations in company \nstock prices. Private lawsuits would have negative impacts on the \neconomy, and private securities lawsuits would potentially open small \nbusinesses to unwarranted liabilities just as these small businesses \nare struggling to make a comeback and hope to hire more workers to \nstimulate our economy.\n  Fifteen years later, in 2010, Senator Specter has introduced an \namendment which would run contrary to Congress's decision. Senator \nSpecter's amendment would create what is called a ``private right to \naction,'' meaning trial lawyers are going to have a field day with \nthis. What is worse, though, is this legal standard included in this \namendment doesn't hold water. The standard for ``aiding and abetting'' \nin this amendment has been adjusted three times in 2 weeks, and it \nstill isn't right. The standard in this amendment requires ``actual \nknowledge of the improper conduct underlying the violation'' and of \n``the role of the person assisting in such conduct.'' Now, this \nstandard is only slightly better than the first two proposals discussed \nearlier in the debate.\n  At first glance, this standard may seem as though it is all that is \nneeded to show that someone has aided another in the act of committing \na crime. It would seem that if a person has knowledge of improper \nconduct and knows they are helping that person, it would be a simple \nlegal matter. However, that is absolutely not the case, and I will \nexplain why in just a minute.\n  I am not a legal mind debating legal standards or case law. However, \nI am a businessman and an accountant by trade, and I can see what this \npoor legal definition will do not only to the business of accounting \nbut to our domestic securities industry as well. Tinkering with the \nlanguage of this amendment doesn't conceal the fact that the real-world \nimpact of this provision has not changed.\n  I need to point out the legal standard this amendment would set has \nholes. Using the language laid out in the Specter amendment, here is \nanother example: You notice this person running through the park. \nHaving seen the person, you now have knowledge that person was running. \nAs a passerby, you got out of the way so they could continue on their \nrun. If we were to apply the Specter standard, even if you never met \nthis person, you would have knowledge of that person's action--you knew \nhe was running--and you got out of the way so he could use the \nsidewalk. That is aiding. If this person just robbed a bank, under this \nstandard you could now arguably be considered a secondary accomplice.\n  In another hypothetical example, if a lawyer reviews a client's \nstatement to their investors, approves what has been written, and the \nclient falsified those statements, the lawyer is completely liable, \ndespite not knowing that the client's disclosures were false.\n  Although changes from the first draft of this amendment to what is \nbefore us now are somewhat better, this amendment is still \nunacceptable. This amendment does not require that the person in \nquestion has knowledge the primary violator has broken the law. It is a \nvery important part of this. You may have seen him, you may have moved \naside for him, but you didn't know he was breaking the law. That is a \nvery important requirement.\n  The Specter amendment just requires the person is aware of the \nconduct itself, not whether it is illegal. In other words, one doesn't \nhave to know they are helping someone violate the law, which is what \naiding and abetting is. One just has to know that the conduct happened.\n  I will say that again. This standard only requires that one knows of \nthe ``improper conduct,'' not that he ``knows that the conduct is \nimproper.'' This is a critical and unacceptable difference. To be \nclear, the standard does not even meet what is used by the SEC to \nprosecute criminal aiding and abetting charges. The SEC standard is \nsignificantly higher. Because the standard in this amendment is so \nflawed, we would be opening thousands of innocent small businesses to \nsecondary charges of fraud.\n  Again, we are not talking about criminal charges. These charges would \nbe strictly considered in a civil court. Keeping this standard would \ngive profit-motivated trial lawyers a vague statutory standard to work \nfrom--not a good combination. They would be able to cast a wide net for \ndefendants, and this opens professionals in their company to the costs \nof discovery and trial, in addition to potential liability for damages \nawarded in the rest of the criminal case.\n  Let's not forget we are talking about accountants, tax preparers, and \nattorneys who aid everyday companies. This means these professionals \nwould be faced with a standard of evidence they cannot refute or argue, \nand they could likely be facing unfounded charges.\n  An accountant looks at the books, has knowledge of it, but that \ndoesn't mean he knows it was improper. Most of the accounting audits \nare not of every single transaction. For a big corporation, an audit of \nevery single transaction might take 3 or 4 years to cover 1 year's \nworth of transactions. It can't be done. But under that circumstance, \nthe accountant might have knowledge, and because he signs off on the \npapers, he might be aiding them under this definition.\n  Their options under this standard would be pleading out for millions \nof dollars, even if innocent, or losing even more in the long process \nof discovery and trial in order to defend themselves and their work. \nAll this for someone who may not even know the criminal or have known \nthat the person's actions were criminal. Is this how our country's \nlegal system is supposed to work? Are we going to incentivize frivolous \nlawsuits? The Specter amendment standard may even go so far as to hold \nthese professionals liable for not finding fraud.\n  I also wish to note that this proposed amendment also goes beyond \njust the actions of some accountants and lawyers involved in the \nsecurities industry. Senator Chuck Schumer and Mayor Michael Bloomberg \nfrom New York City commissioned a report which found that meritless \nsecurities lawsuits are driving up the cost of doing business in \nsecurities and driving away foreign investors, making the United States \nless competitive worldwide. Having a standard like the Specter \namendment proposal means foreign trading partners may be reluctant to \nbring business here right when our country needs the investment the \nmost.\n  Foreign investors will not want to bring business here if doing so \nexposes them to the private liability standard that Specter's amendment \nwould create.\n  As an accountant and former small business owner, and for each of the \nreasons I have outlined, I urge my colleagues to oppose this ill-\nconceived amendment.\n  I would be happy to answer questions of any of my colleagues if they \nhave any. Again, I ask them to just ask their accountant what they \nthink about this particular standard which could lead to lawsuits, \ndiscovery, a lot of costs--and needlessly. We are trying to pass a law \nthat would take care of 1 percent of the problem and penalize the other \n99 percent. So I hope we will reject the Specter amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to speak on an amendment that\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\nI have offered, amendment No. 3939. I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenator Snowe as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, this amendment is cosponsored also \nby Senators Levin and Cantwell. The Dodd-Lincoln bill, as currently \ndrafted, takes major steps to reform the $600 trillion derivatives \nmarket. I don't think people understand how big this market is. It \nwould require every trade to be reported in real time to the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission. It would require that all cleared contracts \nbe traded on an exchange or on a swap execution facility, therefore, \nguaranteeing transparency. It would require that speculative position \nlimits be set in aggregate for each commodity instead of contract by \ncontract--to assure effectiveness. It would require foreign boards of \ntrade to adhere to minimum standards comparable to those in the United \nStates, including reporting requirements. The provision is designed to \naddress the underlying problem of the so-called London loophole.\n  I very much support these positions. However, I am very concerned \nthat the bill doesn't go far enough to address the London loophole. \nThis loophole has allowed for the trading of United States energy \ncommodities, such as crude oil, on foreign exchanges, without oversight \nfrom the United States regulators. This means there is no cop on the \nbeat to shield U.S. oil prices from manipulation or excessive \nspeculation when they are traded in foreign markets, such as \ncommodities exchanges in London, Dubai, or Shanghai.\n  The amendment I am proposing along with my colleagues would allow the \nCFTC to require foreign boards of trade to register with the CFTC, \nwhich would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the \nenforcement authority it needs. It is supported by the chairman of the \nCFTC, Gary Gensler. This provision was in President Obama's original \nproposed financial reform bill, and I think it is critical to pass in \nthis bill.\n  Let me explain what has become known as the London loophole. In the \nwake of the California energy crisis, we learned that most energy \ntrading had been exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act of 2000, at the urging of a company by the name of \nEnron. Using the Enron loophole, this notorious firm pioneered over-\nthe-counter energy derivatives trading. It set up EnronOnline, an \nelectronic market for trading physical and derivatives energy \ncontracts. It was a marketplace with no transparency, no paper trail \nthat could be audited, no speculative position limits, and absolutely \nno government oversight to prevent fraud, manipulation, or protect the \npublic interest. Enron was a participant in every trade, and only Enron \nknew the prices. It used EnronOnline and other trading forums to fleece \nCalifornia consumers for $40 billion over 2 years of increased energy \nprices.\n  Shockingly, much of what Enron had set up was legal because Congress \nhad stripped the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of its \nenforcement power. Terrible.\n  From 2002 on, I worked with Senators Snowe, Cantwell, Levin, and many \nothers to restore regulatory oversight to energy derivatives. We tried \nin 2002 on this floor, and in 2003 and 2004 to regulate energy \nderivatives, but we were stopped and stymied. Opponents, such as Alan \nGreenspan, have since said their opposition was mistaken.\n  Finally, in 2008--6 years after we started--we were able to close \nthis notorious Enron loophole in an amendment to the farm bill, of all \nthings. The amendment imposed meaningful regulation, including \nspeculative position limits and market oversight. So the CFTC began \nmonitoring these markets for fraud and manipulation for the first time \nin 10 years.\n  But as Congress took steps to establish regulatory oversight of \ndomestic energy derivatives markets, Wall Street traders moved to avoid \nU.S. regulation. They began to turn to offshore markets.\n  The successor to EnronOnline, the Intercontinental Exchange in \nAtlanta, bought a London exchange, converted it into an electronic \nexchange, and began listing American oil futures abroad. That is a way \nspeculators could go right around American regulation and avoid it.\n\n  West Texas Intermediate crude has been one of the highest volume \ncontracts on this London exchange since 2006. This contract has what is \ncalled a price discovery impact because it is commonly referenced as \nthe standard market price of oil. This new regulatory loophole has thus \nbecome known as the London loophole. But firms also listed American \nenergy commodity derivatives in Dubai and Singapore and opened their \nelectronic platforms to American traders.\n  This new electronically traded marketplace allows American traders, \nsimply put, to evade American market oversight and speculation limits. \nThe practical implication of this is that U.S. traders can use offshore \nelectronic exchanges to artificially drive up prices of U.S. \ncommodities without any consequences from our Nation's market \nregulators. This is a big problem.\n  In 2008, a CFTC report found that traders using this London exchange \nto trade U.S. crude oil futures held positions far larger than would be \nallowed by American regulators. In fact, from 2006 to 2008, at least \none trader position exceeded United States speculation limits every \nsingle week on the London exchange, and British regulators have done \nnothing about it. The good news is that some steps have been taken \nadministratively to address this loophole.\n  In 2008, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission negotiated an \nagreement with British regulators to bring greater oversight to \nAmerican commodities contracts traded in London. The agreement called \nfor speculation limits for the electronic trading of U.S. energy \ncommodities, such as crude oil on foreign exchanges, and required \nrecordkeeping and an audit trail so you can look at them for fraud or \nmanipulation. Without an audit trail, it is all in the dark. But CFTC--\nand here is the cruncher--has limited legal authority to enforce this \nagreement.\n  Bottom line: We need to make sure the CFTC can oversee trading of \nAmerican commodities, whether it happens through a computer server \nlocated on Wall Street or in Singapore.\n  The Dodd-Lincoln bill currently before us includes some important \nprovisions to help close the London loophole. As drafted, the bill will \nrequire foreign boards of trade that provide access to American traders \nto comply with comparable rules enforced by a foreign regulator, to \npublish trading information daily, to supply data to the CFTC, and to \nenforce position limits. However, the CFTC is unable to force a foreign \nboard of trade to comply with those requirements. And that is just \nfact. This is because the CFTC's current method of overseeing foreign \nexchanges has tenuous legal underpinnings due to a Commodity Exchange \nAct provision forbidding the CFTC from regulating foreign boards of \ntrade. In many instances, our regulatory body, the CFTC, can take \naction against a U.S. trader trading a U.S. commodity on a foreign \nexchange to prevent manipulation or excessive speculation only with the \ncooperation and consent of the foreign regulator.\n  The other more controversial option is for the CFTC to completely ban \nthe foreign exchange from all U.S. operations. Not surprisingly, they \nshy away from enforcement in the face of these regulatory obstacles.\n  We have a bill that still does not provide strong regulation. It \nstill allows American derivatives traders to avoid American regulations \nby trading on a foreign electronic platform in Dubai, London, and other \nplaces as well. That is why we--Senator Snowe, Senator Levin, Senator \nCantwell, and I--are offering a proposal to allow the CFTC to require \nforeign boards of trade to register with the CFTC, which would give it \nthe enforcement authority it needs.\n  Quickly, here are the benefits of the amendment.\n  First, the registration process itself would give CFTC the authority \nto impose regulatory requirements as a condition of registration.\n  Second, a formal registration process would assure that foreign \nboards of trade all follow the same set of rules.\n  And third, the registration process would provide a much clearer \nbasis for CFTC decisions to refuse or withdraw permission to foreign \nboards of trade wishing to allow American traders on their exchange.\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\n  Finally, and most important, all of CFTC's existing enforcement \nauthorities apply to registered entities under the Commodity Exchange \nAct. This amendment would allow the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission to enforce its own statute with regard to foreign exchanges \noperating in the United States. This is a moderate, practical amendment \nto assure that we give our regulator the authority to enforce the \nstatutory provisions already in the legislation.\n  There are powerful interests out there that are opposed to this. They \nwant to be able to avoid our law. They want to be able to trade over \nthe London exchange. We negotiated with them to close the Enron \nloophole. We had ICE in our office. They agreed to it. It took 6 months \nof negotiation. Do you know what they did? They then went offshore, \nbought the London exchange, changed it to an electronic trading \nplatform to avoid the very agreement they agreed with, that we \nlegislated and enacted. That is fact. Guess what. It burns me up. And I \ndo not intend to quit because I do not like to be duped that way, \nwhether it is Goldman Sachs and ICE or anybody else. If you give your \nword, you make an agreement. You do not go offshore to avoid that \nagreement.\n  Now that I have cooled down, this is a moderate, practical amendment \nto assure that we give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the \nauthority to enforce the statutory provisions already in the proposed \nlegislation. Why would we want legislation which cannot be enforced? \nWhy would we want legislation that ties their hands? Why would we want \nlegislation that allows somebody simply to avoid this law by trading \nwhat amounts to $600 trillion of derivatives in Dubai or in London or \nin Shanghai or anywhere else?\n  Guess what. These electronic exchanges will be set up everywhere to \navoid this bill. That is why we have to give the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission the authority to see that these foreign exchanges \nregister with them and agree to abide by the laws of the United States \nof America.\n  I think it is important that we do this, and I do not intend to quit \none way or another, if it takes me 6 years to get it done, as it did \nthe last one. I have no respect for traders who look to go around U.S. \nlaw.\n  As we crack down on traders in our markets, we must be ever vigilant \nto assure that traders sitting on Wall Street do not avoid our \nregulations by trading on electronic exchanges with computer servers in \nLondon or Dubai or Singapore.\n  This amendment is an improvement of the London loophole provisions in \nthe Dodd-Lincoln bill by making these provisions easily enforceable. It \nis the final piece to go in, to close the London loophole, which should \nnever have been opened in the first place, and to ensure that our \ngovernment has what it needs to protect American markets from \nmanipulation and excessive speculation, no matter where U.S. energy \ncommodities are traded.\n  I expect the big boys to speak out against it. But I will tell you \nsomething: Everybody in the West who knows how they were fleeced back \nin 1999 and 2000 by Enron clearly will understand the value of being \nable to enforce the law of this country. We should ask for no less.\n  I know I cannot call up the amendment at the present time, but I hope \nI will have that opportunity to do so later.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4019, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the pending question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Do I have the right to object?\n  Can you do a quorum for a second?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I couldn't hear. What is the situation we \nare in?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am reserving the right to object and asking the Senator \nif he can put us in a quorum for a minute or two so we can clear this \nissue on our side.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of the above-mentioned amendments, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Collins amendment No. 3879 and that the amendment \nbe considered and agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nbe the next first-degree amendments in order: Rockefeller-Hutchison, \nthe FTC amendment; Senator Crapo, the GSE on budget amendment; Senator \nMark Udall of Colorado, No. 4016 regarding credit scores; Senator \nShelby's amendment No. 4010 re: the consumer bureau; Senator \nWhitehouse's State usury laws; Senator Vitter, No. 4003, the \nmanufacturing amendment; Senator Cantwell and Senator McCain's Glass-\nSteagall amendment; and Senator Cornyn, No. 3986 regarding the IMF.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there will be 10 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to inform me when I have 1 \nminute of my 5 minutes remaining.\n  I think this is an amendment that is well known to my colleagues. I \nhave spoken on the floor several times. It is about the interchange \nfees charged to small businesses across America for the use of credit \ncards.\n  This amendment does the following things: It directs the Federal \nReserve to ensure that debit fees on debit cards are reasonable and \nproportional to processing costs; it stops Visa and MasterCard from \nimposing any competitive restrictions; it ends prohibitions on \ndiscounts for use of different network cards; it ends prohibitions on \ndiscounts for cash, debit, or credit; and it ends prohibitions on \nminimum purchase levels for paying with a credit card.\n  It does not affect credit card interchange rates. We do not establish \na rate. That is left entirely to the Federal Reserve to review. We do \nnot allow discrimination against small banks or credit unions. The \nmodification specifically prohibits any discrimination against the \nissuer of a credit card. A merchant may decide to favor one network \nover another but cannot favor one bank over another that issues a card. \nSo there can be no discrimination against a credit union, community \nbank, or a large bank, for that matter. It doesn't set interchange \nprices.\n  By putting a $10 billion threshold in terms of the banks issuing the \ncards, we literally exempt 99 percent of all banks and credit unions \nfrom the application of this law. Still, just going for the largest \nbanks in America--86 banks in America--we will cover 65 percent of all \nthe credit and debit transactions in this country. So it is a \nsignificant amendment, and it protects the community banks and the \ncredit unions.\n  I will tell you that I am very concerned and disappointed by the so-\ncalled Independent Community Banks Association, which continues to \noppose this amendment despite my best efforts to exempt virtually all \nof their members from being covered. I understand they have a conflict \nof interest because they are in the top 25 issuers of credit and debit \ncards in the United States. They make a lot of money under the current \nsituation. They may not want to change it, but it is not fair to small \nbanks in Illinois and across the Nation for them to speak to this issue \nwhen they have this conflict of interest.\n  The second thing I want to say to the credit unions is that there are \n8,200 credit unions in America, and all but 3 are exempt from this \nlaw--99.999 percent of credit unions are exempt from this law. For them \nto be opposing it because of three of the biggest credit unions in \nAmerica is unfair to the rest of their members and certainly unfair to \nthe merchants who do business with them every day.\n  This is the single most important amendment for small business and \nretail business in America that we will consider on this bill. In a \ntime of recession, when we need small businesses to step up and create \njobs, this is a way to move forward.\n  Members have heard from all across the country, from small businesses \nand retail merchants who are asking for some fairness, some justice \nwhen it comes to these major credits cards that literally dictate the \nterms of their agreements with these small businesses. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am going to reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no time is yielded, the time will be charged to both sides \nequally.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute, 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Republican side, if there is opposition to \nthe amendment.\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as far as I know, there is no one else on our \nside wishing to speak; therefore, we can yield back time of the \nminority.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my colleagues, I know this is a complex and in \nsome ways a controversial amendment. But I can't think of a better way \nfor us to establish a reasonable standard that debit cards, which are \nnow becoming more common and are equivalent to a check, are going to be \ncharged against the merchant that honors the card only in a reasonable \nand proportional way by the same agency we used under the consumer \ncredit card reform bill of just last year.\n  I urge my colleagues, if they are listening to small businesses \nacross America, struggling to survive, trying to add new employees, \ngive them a helping hand by voting for the Durbin amendment so they can \nhave reasonable charges for the use of credit cards and debit cards at \ntheir establishment. I urge the passage of this amendment and I yield \nthe remainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  If all time is yielded back, the question is on agreeing to the \nDurbin amendment, No. 3989, as modified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

There are Democratic amendments we think the Republicans will \nagree to; there are Republican amendments that we will agree to.\n  We are moving toward wrapping up this bill. There will be a number of \nvotes on Monday night starting at 5:30. Everyone should be aware of \nthat. Tonight the managers are here. They are going to try to work \nthrough a couple of amendments. We have one more vote. After that, \nthere will not be any more votes until Monday night.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3987\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to Amendment No. 3987 offered by the Senator from South \nDakota.\n  The yeas and nays have previously been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Secret Holds\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, the American people are \nfurious at the way business is done in Washington, DC. Today, on the \nfloor of the Senate, we saw a pretty good reason why.\n  For many months, a large group of Senators on both sides of the \naisle--Senator Grassley, Senator Inhofe, Senator Collins, and Senator \nBennett, among the Republicans; a host of my colleagues on our side of \nthe aisle, led by Senator McCaskill--have been working to try to \neliminate the secret hold in the Senate, which is, in my view, one of \nthe most pernicious, most antidemocratic practices in government.\n  What the secret hold allows is for just one Senator--just one--to \nanonymously keep the American people from getting any sense of a \nparticular piece of legislation, someone who has been nominated for an \nappointment--any sense of some of the most important business that is \nbefore the Senate.\n  The Senator from Missouri, who is in the Chamber, has noted that at \ntimes there are scores and scores of these secret holds. I have pointed \nout this has happened for years on both sides of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S3706]]\n\n  So this has been an opportunity, when the country is crying out for \nbipartisanship, for Democrats and Republicans to together--as our large \ngroup has done--fix this, to open our government, to ensure that \ndemocracy is accountable, and that public business is actually done in \npublic.\n  Until about an hour or so ago, I thought we would win a dramatic \nvictory for the cause of open government. We had a good debate this \nmorning on the measure. Colleagues on both sides of the aisle talked \nabout it.\n  Not one Senator objected, not one was willing to say in public they \nwere in favor of secret holds. Quite the opposite: We talked for some \ntime, and no one objected at all. We were under the impression that the \nmatter would be scheduled for a vote this afternoon.\n  Given that, I was flabbergasted that right before it was time to \nvote, one Senator--just one--without any notice whatever--no notice to \nme, no notice to any of the other sponsors, sponsors on the other side \nof the aisle--one Senator sought to attach to our amendment, which \nwould have received a resounding vote because Senators are not going to \nvote in favor of secrecy when they are on the record--one Senator \nattached a completely unrelated matter, a very controversial matter.\n  I say to the Chair, I say to all my colleagues, I never, ever would \nhave done that to another colleague. I have felt for many years now \nthat the great challenge in the Senate is to have colleagues work \ntogether, to have colleagues come together on both sides, because that \nis going to help us advance the cause of open government, it is going \nto help us get the best possible policy.\n  So if I had been in our colleague's shoes, and I was interested in \nadvancing this other issue, I would have come to that particular \nSenator and said: How can we work this out? That did not happen. So all \nof us, at the last minute, when we were looking forward to celebrating \nwhat, in my view, would have been a historic vote for open government, \nafter all these months of Democrats and Republicans debating secrecy in \ngovernment, we now sit here on Thursday evening, with secrecy having \nwon once more, doing government in the shadows winning once more, \ndenying the American people the accountability this institution is all \nabout winning once again.\n  I think the American people deserve better. We spent a lot of time \ntoday bringing all sides together. The chairman of the committee, \nSenator Dodd, is here with us. The whole essence of the Wall Street \nlegislation has been to ensure more openness and more accountability in \nthese essential financial transactions. Chairman Dodd has done a superb \njob in advancing that case.\n  What Senators on both sides of the aisle sought to do, until there \nwas an objection from one Senator at the last minute--with no notice--\nwhat we sought to do was to say: If we are going to open our system of \nfinancial transactions so there would be more transparency and more \naccountability, let's also open the way we do business in the Senate so \nthe American people are not kept in the dark any longer about major \njudgments with respect to legislation or nominations. One Senator--just \none--without notice, kept us from bringing that new accountability and \nopenness to the Senate.\n  I know colleagues want to bring up other matters. I simply wish to \nsay--I think I have been in this body now for a little over a decade--I \ncannot recall another instance where the cause of open government took \na beating, took a blindsiding, like the cause of open government took \nthis afternoon.\n  I wish to tell my colleagues, I intend to come back to my post here \nagain and again and again until we abolish the secret hold, until we \nensure that the American people see that government is being brought \nout of the shadows and debates are out in the open, where they ought to \nbe.\n  We did not win this afternoon because I think we got kneecapped. I do \nnot know how to describe it any other way. But I do not think, at this \ntime in American history, where the American people are this angry--\nthis angry--at the way Washington, DC, does business, that those who \nadvocate secrecy are on the right side of history. I do not think they \nare going to be able to defend in broad daylight opposing a bipartisan \ncoalition.\n  Senator Grassley has worked with me on this for a decade. He has, \nagain and again, championed the cause of transparency and openness in \ngovernment, not just on this question of abolishing secret holds but on \ninspectors general and a variety of other practices.\n  So these are colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--who want to show \nthe American people they are going to stand for open government, and \nthey are going to do it in a way where the American people will say: \nThose folks finally get it. Instead of spending their time in these \npetty food fights, they are a group of Democrats and Republicans who \nacted like adults and got together and solved a major problem--a major \nproblem--by eliminating secrecy and making government more open.\n  So it is my intent to come back, if possible, day in and day out \nuntil this changes. I think this is unconscionable. I can tell you, I \nhave never seen anything like this in my time in the Senate: one \nSenator coming in, at the last moment, with no notice, trying to derail \nthe cause of open government.\n  I am not going to stand for it. I do not think the American people \nare going to stand for it. We will be back here for as long as it takes \nto bring some real sunshine to this cause of the Senate doing its \nbusiness in public rather than in the shadows.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I know someone is going to be able to \nuse the figleaf and stand behind the argument that the amendment that \nwas offered at the very last moment this afternoon was about something \nthey cared about and something we need to vote on. It is a subject \nmatter we care about that we need to work on. But really? It is pretty \ntransparent what is going on here: that at the very last moment, when \nall of a sudden we were this close for everyone having to go on record \nabout secret holds, that someone shot it out of the sky like a clay \npigeon. That is what this amendment did.\n  So the argument is: Well, the Wyden-Grassley amendment on secret \nholds is not really about the financial reform bill. Why does it get a \nchance to be voted on? It is very simple. The reason the Wyden-Grassley \namendment should be considered germane to every bill we debate in this \nbody is because it is about the way we do business. Every day that goes \nby that we do not try to reform this nasty habit of secret holds, we \ndiminish the shine and the glory that is our democracy. We diminish \nwhat this body should stand for and what our priorities should be. \nEvery day we allow the secret hold process to continue to take root and \ngrow and flourish, we are failing in our job as Senators who are here \nto do the public's business.\n\n  We are not here to go in back rooms and get something for our secret \nhold. We are not here to go in back rooms and leverage our secret hold \nfor something else we want. We are not here to go in back rooms and \nhave secret holds to keep this administration from succeeding or \nfilling the jobs that need to be filled. We are here to be accountable.\n  Of all the amendments out there that can be second degreed, this \namendment that would reform our process is selected to slow it down and \nobviously, hopefully, kill it. Well, I have bad news for my friends \nacross the aisle who want to kill the longstanding attempts of Senators \nWyden and Grassley at reform, and my recent attempts, along with \nSenator Bennet, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Udall, Senator Warner, and \nothers who have come to the floor and spoken on secret holds: We are \nnot going anywhere. It is probably a fault I have, but I am pretty darn \nstubborn. In fact, I am probably stubborn to a fault. I think this is \nsomething we all ought to be stubborn about.\n  We have different kinds of Senators. We have some who are kind of \nfeeling as though they are being marched to the gallows as they \ngrudgingly support cleaning up secret holds. We have others who want to \npound their chests and shout from the rooftops about trying\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\nto get rid of secret holds. And we have others who are hiding in the \ncrevices, the little, bitty, tiny dark places, who are trying to keep \nsecret holds without anybody knowing who they are.\n  I will say this. One can make the assumption that whoever offered \nthis amendment to try to kill this amendment probably is a big fan of \nsecret holds. Because it seems to me if they wanted this amendment to \npass, they would have at least talked to the sponsors before they \noffered the second-degree amendment. That is the common courtesy around \nhere; they would have at least given everyone some notice. But they saw \nthis amendment speeding toward the finish line. They realized they were \ngoing to be called for the yeas and nays on reforming the Senate, and \nthey decided to take the path of least resistance and that is try to \nkill the bill another way.\n  But along with my colleague and mentor on this subject, Senator \nWyden, and Senator Grassley, whom I have met with a number of times \nover the last week, we are going to stay with it. I know I speak for my \ncolleagues who have been here 4 years or less, the freshmen and \nsophomores in this body. I know how strongly we feel about this.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues, if I am wrong about you, if you are \nagainst secret holds, the letter is still open. We have 60 Members who \nhave signed the letter. Sixty Members of this body, all of the \nDemocrats but one, both of the Independents, and now two Republicans \nhave signed the letter saying we will not exercise a secret hold and we \nwant to abolish secret holds. I look forward to seeing my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, more Republicans joining in the signing of \nthis letter. It is available. I hope they will contact us. Senator \nWarner, Senator Whitehouse, and I are the lead signators on this \nletter. But it is time for everyone--by the way, if we get to 67 \nsignatures, guess what we can do. We can amend the standing rules of \nthis place. We could say that an objection will not be in order if it \nis anonymous. We could do that with 67 votes. What a great day that \nwould be. Wouldn't that be a wake-up call to the American people that \nmaybe we get it. Maybe we get why our approval ratings of Congress are \nnear historic lows for all the nonsense, ridiculous games that get \nplayed around here.\n  Let's do the public's business and let's do it in public and let's \nend the secret holds, the nasty habit we can no longer afford.\n  I will look forward to visiting with my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle and see if we can prevail upon them to withdraw their \nsecond-degree amendment so we can go forward or find some other way \nforward. But make no mistake, we will find a way forward and we will \nend the secret hold. I am confident it will happen. So you can fight as \nlong and as hard as you want, but we are not going to give up.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes. I have \nbeen here a smaller amount of time than anybody who is on this floor. \nThe chairman has been here longer than I have been here; Senator Wyden, \nSenator McCaskill, and others. I have been here about 15 months. What I \ncan tell my colleagues is that this place doesn't operate like any \nother place in the universe. This secret hold business we are talking \nabout right now, so people understand, allows a Senator to be able to \nhold up a nomination or a piece of legislation without having to tell \nanybody who they are. I spent half my career in business. No business I \nhave would have ever tolerated a rule such as that. I have worked in \nlocal government. No local government I have ever been part of would \nhave tolerated a rule such as that. There are city councils and State \ngovernments, county governments all over this country right now--by the \nway, they are probably still at work, unlike us, trying to figure out \nhow to balance their budgets in the most savage economy since the Great \nDepression. They are not using secret holds to stop their ability to \nrespond to the American people, and we shouldn't either.\n  One of the things I want to say is that Senator Wyden should be \ncongratulated, because this is not a partisan piece of legislation. The \nNo. 1 question I hear from people when I go home is, Why can't you guys \nwork together? We lack confidence in what you are doing. There are \nDemocrats, Republicans, unaffiliated voters who say, Why can't you work \ntogether? It looks like a partisan food fight back here because it is, \nbut it is a little more complicated than that. In this case, we have a \nbipartisan piece of legislation that has broad support in this Chamber, \nas do the nominees who are being held up whom we have brought forward. \nWe haven't brought forward nominees who got just Democratic votes; they \nare nominees who were passed out of the relevant committee of \njurisdiction on a bipartisan basis, and somebody has decided that they \nwant to hold these people up for reasons that have nothing to do with \nthe quality of the nominees or because they were passed out on a \npartisan way, which they weren't. They are bipartisan.\n  So this isn't about everybody on the other side of the aisle holding \nup this legislation. This is bipartisan legislation. We should be here \ntonight. It is only 7:30. We should be here tonight debating this \namendment, allowing people to come together in a bipartisan way to \nsupport the amendment, just as we should allow people to come together \nin a bipartisan way to support the nominees who have come forward and \npassed out of committee. There is no difference. The difference is that \nthis rule allows some individuals to bring it to a grinding halt, to \ncreate more division rather than less division which, at least in my \nview, is what we need as a country.\n  In my State, no matter where I am--in blue parts of the State, in red \nparts of the State--my sense is that people have a pretty common set of \naspirations for our State, for our country, for their kids, for our \ngrandkids. They expect us to act on those aspirations rather than on \nthe divisions that are so easy to create for just political gain. That \nis what has been happening when it comes to these secret holds. There \nare other issues as well that relate to the rules of this place that \nneed to be changed, but this is one that is indefensible.\n  I came to the floor this morning and I said it reminds me a little \nbit of a car trip with my three little girls who are 10, 9, and 5. It \nhappens every single time we are in the car: The first hour goes great; \neverybody is fine. But then they start to fret with each other, they \nget frustrated with each other. You can hear it. Any parent knows, the \nhair on the back of your neck starts to rise, and you know something \nbad is about to happen, and it does. Usually somebody slugs somebody \nelse, and then you look behind you and no one will admit what they have \ndone. No one will take responsibility for their bad act. We don't \ntolerate that in my household, by the way. We try hard to get to the \nbottom and the truth. We don't always, but we usually do.\n  This is the same thing. I am not saying people shouldn't be able to \nhold things up on the merits, but they ought to have to come to the \nfloor and tell the American people who they are and why they are \nholding it up. They may have good arguments to make. That is what this \nis about. It is about debate, and that is what we need more of in this \ncountry because we are wasting the American people's time. We are \nwasting the American people's money, and we can't even get a debate on \na lot of the issues this country faces.\n  I am going to try hard to do everything I can to contribute to a \ncivil debate rather than an uncivil debate, and I think getting rid of \nthese holds is going to be one of the ways forward. It is not the only \nthing we need to do.\n  I wish to thank Senator Wyden for all of his good work on this issue, \nand Senator Whitehouse for his good work, and the chairman's indulgence \nfor letting us have this conversation tonight. Thanks for everything \nyou have done to advance Wall Street reform this week.\n  By the way, on that, the American people should know that this bill, \nthe Wall Street reform bill, is a very good bill. Unlike some other \nwork we have done recently, it actually has the benefit of being worked \non in a very bipartisan way, with a lot of amendments from Democrats \nand Republicans which I think have improved the legislation. I can't \npredict the future, but my guess is that it is going to pass with broad \nbipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S3708]]\n\n  I congratulate Chairman Dodd on his leadership and getting that done \nin a way that gives the American people confidence that we are actually \ndoing their business.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues in \nexpressing our support for Senator Wyden's continued efforts to get \nthis rule changed.\n  The circumstances in which these secret holds take place are quite \nremarkable. Over and over again we see a committee vote clearing a \nnominee for the floor, often unanimously, or by heavy, huge bipartisan \nmajorities; clearly qualified candidates; clearly candidates who enjoy \nbipartisan support and, in many cases, candidates who are unanimously \nsupported. Even in this contentious and cantankerous time in this body, \nthey come through the committee with that kind of support.\n  Then they come through on the floor in some cases 98 to 0, 100 to 0. \nBut between that unanimous committee vote and the unanimous floor vote \nis an endless, endless, endless delay. Many of them stack up and never \nget that floor vote. We have had as many as 100 stacked up, waiting for \nthat floor vote on the Executive calendar.\n  What is happening between a unanimous committee vote and a unanimous \nfloor vote that creates all this hassle and delay and leaves people in \nlimbo for months and months, 100 at a time on the Executive calendar, \nall of whom are in responsible positions in our Federal Government that \nwe need to have staffed? It is the secret hold. It is the secret hold \nwhere you don't have to disclose who you are so you don't have to \ndisclose why you are holding. Because you don't have to disclose who \nyou are or why you are holding, you don't have to have a good reason. \nYou could have a downright nefarious reason and you could still use the \nhold. It is pretty widely known that deeds that are done in the dark \nare not the deeds we are proud of, and this is a deed that is by \ndefinition always done in the dark. Senator Wyden and Senator \nGrassley's long efforts to get rid of it are very commendable. We are \ngoing to work very hard to make sure we have their back on this rule.\n  In this particular circumstance, Senator Wyden has been here 14 \nyears. He has never seen a stunt like this one. I have only been here 3 \nyears; I can't say that. But 14 years of service in the Senate and he \nhas never seen a stunt like this particular one.\n  The idea that this is on the merits, the idea that this is about \ntrying to get a vote on that second-degree amendment, seems mighty \nimprobable. Of all of the amendments on this bill, of all of the \namendments we have voted on, of all the amendments that are pending, of \nall the amendments people are arguing for to get on the floor, which is \nthe one amendment that somebody chose to drop this second-degree \namendment on and jam up its passage through this body?\n  Which is the one? It is the secret hold. In kind of a perverse way, \nit is actually sort of appropriate that a procedural vehicle, the \nsecret hold, that has such an odor of mischief around it--that the \nreform of that should itself be blockaded by a procedural trick that \nalso has that same odor of mischief about it.\n  But what we want to do is get through that mischief so that the \nbusiness of this body no longer wreaks of the odor of mischief and \ninstead gives off the healthy air of open debate and public process and \ntransparency. I thank Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley, who is not on \nthe floor. We will continue to push on this.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3746 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  If I could change to a different piece of business, I will take this \nopportunity to call up amendment No. 3746. I thank Senator Dodd and I \nwill say a few words about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse], for \n     himself, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Levin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3746 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To restore to the States the right to protect consumers from \n                           usurious lenders)\n\n       On page 1320, strike line 23 and all that follows through \n     the end of the undesignated matter on page 1321 between lines \n     17 and 18 and insert the following:\n       ``(g) Transparency of OCC Preemption Determinations.--The \n     Comptroller of the Currency shall publish and update not less \n     frequently than quarterly, a list of preemption \n     determinations by the Comptroller of the Currency then in \n     effect that identifies the activities and practices covered \n     by each determination and the requirements and constraints \n     determined to be preempted.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     one of title LXII of the Revised Statutes of the United \n     States is amended by inserting after the item relating to \n     section 5136B the following new item:\n\n``Sec. 5136C. State law preemption standards for national banks and \n              subsidiaries clarified.''.\n       (c) Usurious Lenders.--Chapter 2 of the Truth in Lending \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 1631 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 141. LIMITS ON ANNUAL PERCENTAGES RATES.\n\n       ``Effective 12 months after the date of enactment of this \n     section, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     interest applicable to any consumer credit transaction (other \n     than a transaction that is secured by real property), \n     including any fees, points, or time-price differential \n     associated with such a transaction, may not exceed the \n     maximum permitted by any law of the State in which the \n     consumer resides. Nothing in this section may be construed to \n     preempt an otherwise applicable provision of State law \n     governing the interest in connection with a consumer credit \n     transaction that is secured by real property.''.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I don't want to speak long. I want to, first, join \nSenator Bennet's appreciation of Senator Dodd for the long and \nsuccessful way in which he has managed this bill. It has not gone \nunnoticed by the American people how contentious and cantankerous the \nenvironment is around the Senate. Notwithstanding that inhospitable \nenvironment, he has done an extraordinary job of bringing this \nlegislation forward and continuing through the deliberative process, \nwhere people are getting amendments and votes are being taken. There \nare no motions to table so far. Only one vote has required 60 votes. It \nhas been going by the regular order of the Senate and not the usual \nprocedures that often have been forced by the recent obstructionism we \nhave seen. I commend him and thank him for allowing this amendment to \nbe called up and to go forward.\n  I want to add a sponsor, Senator Tom Udall, of New Mexico. I ask \nunanimous consent that he be added as the amendment's 15th cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I very much hope this can go with bipartisan support. \nSenator Cochran on the Republican side is a cosponsor as well. It is a \nbipartisan amendment. This is a situation that the Congress never voted \non, the situation that is here to cure. We never made a decision that \nan out-of-State bank should be able to come into your State and violate \nyour State's law about interest rates. We could have. That is within \nCongress's power to say. But we never did. We are in that circumstance, \nhowever, for an unusual reason--because many years ago, 30 years ago, \nthe Supreme Court made a technical decision about the National Banking \nAct, determining that when you have a transaction between a bank in one \nState and a consumer in another, where is the transaction located for \nregulatory purposes? They decided to locate it where the bank is. They \nhad to pick one or the other.\n  That didn't seem very systemically important at the time. But the big \nbanks--the Wall Street banks--have very crafty lawyers. The very crafty \nlawyers saw the loophole that this innocent technical decision opened. \nSo they started moving their credit card businesses, their divisions, \ninto States that had the worst consumer protection laws--the ones where \nyou could charge any interest rate you wanted, where there was the \nworst protection for the consumer. From that base of the worst consumer \nprotection in the country, they could move out and sell their products \nand do business in all of the other States, whose laws were still on \nthe books, whose laws still protected their citizens, whose laws had \nstood since the founding of the Republic, since the establishment of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\nStates, and they could get around those laws because of this loophole \nthat the Supreme Court decision opened.\n  It is way past time that we close this loophole. In Illinois, \nConnecticut, and Rhode Island, over and over and over we hear from \npeople who are suffering because they were late with a payment or they \nfell into one of the tricks and traps in the credit card contract or \nfor no reason at all, just because they can do it, the credit card \ncompany jacked the interest rate up to or over 30 percent. Suddenly, \nboom, they are in what one expert called the ``sweat box.'' They cannot \npay what they owe. It is all they can do to stay even all the time. The \nbig company milked them and charged an interest rate that would be \nillegal under the laws of that State. Before 1978, the solicitation for \nthat credit card that had the tricks and traps, and that hidden 30-\npercent penalty rate, would have been a matter for the authorities. Now \nit is the way they do business.\n  This amendment will put that back. For 202 years of this Republic, \nthat was the way things were. States could protect their own citizens \nfrom unfair and excessive interest rates. That is the way it should be. \nThat is what federalism is all about. That is what States rights are \nall about. So I hope that my amendment will go forward.\n  People believe in history--the more than two centuries of history of \nthe States protecting their consumers, and a tradition of protection \nagainst abusive rates that goes back before the founding of our \ncountry, back to ancient Roman law, and all of the world's major \nreligions. This is a longstanding tradition with a very strange little \nloophole that created a peculiar historic anomaly that allows these big \ncorporations to take terrible advantage of ordinary Americans. Not only \nare Americans being taken advantage of, but local banks suffer as well \nbecause they have to play by the rules. If you haven't played that \nstunt of headquartering your bank in another State so you can work your \nway back and market in that same State, but under the nonexistent \nconsumer protections of the home State, then you are stuck, and it is \nnot fair.\n  I ask my colleagues to protect consumers in your home States and be \ntrue to history and States rights, protect your local banks have to \nfollow local State laws. Let's put this brief moment in history into \nthe ash heap of history, where it belongs as an anomaly where \nAmericans, for the first time, had no protection from giant \ncorporations gouging them with 30 percent and higher interest rates. \nThat is not the way America was founded. That is not what we stood for \nfor centuries. It is only because of this peculiar loophole that we \nhave this situation. We have it within our power to change that. We \nhave it within our power to go back to our home States and say to the \npeople in our home States: We have done you a real good deed. We have \nallowed your State government, your Governor and legislature in the \nhome State, to protect its own citizens against abusive out-of-State \ninterest rates.\n  A lot of this bill is very technical. It is preventive medicine to \nrebuild the Glass-Steagall firewall, to regulate collateralized debt \nobligations, to enhance leverage requirements--things that are hard for \npeople to grasp if they have not been steeped in these technicalities \nfor these many weeks. It is important stuff, but if you want a clear, \ndeliverable way to explain about this bill when you go back to your \nhome State--when Senator Cochran, my cosponsor, goes back to \nMississippi, if this amendment passes, he will be able to say to his \nfellow Mississippians: Ladies and gentlemen, the State of Mississippi \nis empowered to protect you now. An out-of-State company can no longer \ntake your interest rates, and for a lousy reason, or for no reason at \nall, suddenly jack them up to 30 percent or more. It is simply wrong to \nleave ordinary Americans subject to that kind of abuse, to all the \ncrafty, heavily lawyered, carefully designed, socially engineered \ntricks and traps they have built into these complicated, complex, \ntricky credit card agreements.\n  Now 50 States can stand against it. Attorneys general can proceed to \ndefend these laws. It puts the government of this country back where it \nshould be--in the hands of the people. Some people here would rather \nhave the big corporations rule over the States. I believe that the \nStates should trump even the big corporations when it comes to matters \nof protecting their citizens. That is the way it should be. That is the \nway the country was founded and, if this amendment passes, that is the \nway it will be again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for \nhis very generous comments. We have worked closely together. He hasn't \nbeen here a great deal of time, but he was an invaluable asset last \nyear about this time when we were spending an awful lot of time \ntogether. I had become sort of the acting chairman of the HELP \nCommittee when my dearest friend in this Chamber became terribly ill, \nSenator Kennedy. He asked me to take over that committee for him. We \nwere charged with the responsibility of putting together a sizable \nportion of the health care proposal. The Senator from Rhode Island was \nan invaluable asset in that process. We had some critical moments, \nwhich I will not go into now, but in those critical moments, he played \na remarkably important role. Some day, I will have time to spend more \ntime going back and writing or talking about those days. I can point to \nseveral moments when, in the absence of Senator Whitehouse's \ninvolvement, I am not sure we would have ever concluded the process as \nsuccessfully as we did. I am eternally grateful to him for that. He has \nsince then moved off that committee and he is doing other things. He is \nterribly interested in this subject matter, financial reform. I commend \nhim for his passion and determination to have these issues raised.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, if I may reply. As a new Senator in \nthis body, who had not had legislative experience--I came out of an \nexecutive and law enforcement background--I have enjoyed the privilege \nof serving on that committee under the Senator's leadership. And now to \nhave had the privilege of seeing him work this bill on the floor, for a \nnew Senator, it has been a master class in leadership and legislation. \nI will never forget it. I feel very privileged to have had that \nexperience. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to be very brief. Our staff has \nbeen very patient all week. You only get to see them when the cameras \npull back and we are in a quorum call. The wonderful floor staff people \ndo a remarkable job. Our reporters of debates here do a terrific job \nreporting the words of every Senator who has spoken. I am grateful to \nthem.\n  I briefly say, Mr. President, we have now, I think, done some 30, 35 \namendments on this bill. We have been at this for a couple of weeks. \nThe legislative days, I think, are 6 working days--maybe 7, which \ndoesn't seem like much, but it is an awful lot. Important amendments \nhave been debated, accepted, and rejected on both sides of the aisle.\n  I was determined at the outset to prove not only that we can pass \nimportant legislation, but that we can do it with a strong dose of \ncivility in the process, and that while we have strong views and we \nspeak, as I do from time to time, with some degree of emotion and \npassion about things I care deeply about, that should in no way be a \nreflection of my feelings for my colleagues. We have allowed a lack of \ncivility in recent years, which makes it more difficult to get our jobs \ndone. We didn't get elected here to let those emotions dominate our \njobs on behalf of the people who sent us here.\n  In the last couple of weeks, we have produced a good bill, a stronger \nbill, but in a way the American people can take pride in how their \nSenate is operating. I am grateful to all my colleagues and the staffs \nand others who make it possible for us to do this. These people are \nknowledgeable about what needs to be done to work out language that \nallows us to move forward. They don't get mentioned or talked about, \nand they don't give speeches, but they play an integral and important \nrole in how this institution works.\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\n                Amendment No. 3758 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the amendment \nthat Senator Murray and I have been working on together that would \nexpand the Financial Stability Oversight Council established in S. 3217 \nto include as nonvoting members a State insurance commissioner, a State \nbanking supervisor, and a State securities commissioner. Concomitantly, \nI seek to remove the independent voting member position having \ninsurance expertise, as that would create a duplicative position.\n  It is critically important that the Council incorporate State \nregulators. State banking, insurance, and securities regulators are on \nthe front lines of financial regulation and therefore have information \nand perspectives that are necessary components of an effective \nregulatory structure. State regulators could act as ``first \nresponders'' to the Council, in that they see trends developing at the \nState level. They could serve as an early warning system, identifying \npractices and risk-related trends that are substantial contributing \nfactors to systemic risk.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the joint letter from the Conference \nof State Bank Supervisors, the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners, and the North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation supporting this amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                      Insurance Commissioners,\n\n                                                     May 13, 2010.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Murray and Collins: The Conference of State \n     Bank Supervisors (CSBS), the National Association of \n     Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and the North American \n     Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) are writing in \n     support of your amendments providing for non-voting \n     membership for state banking, insurance and securities \n     regulators on the Financial Stability Oversight Council \n     (FSOC).\n       Including state regulators on the FSOC is both necessary \n     and appropriate. State banking, insurance, and securities \n     regulators are on the front lines of financial regulation and \n     bring information and perspectives that are necessary \n     components of an effective regulatory structure. In all \n     financial sectors, state regulators gather and act upon large \n     amounts of information from industry participants and from \n     investors. State regulators would bring to the FSOC the \n     insights of a team of ``first responders'' who see trends \n     developing at the state level, which have the potential to \n     impact the larger financial system. Consequently, they serve \n     as an early warning system identifying practices and risk-\n     related trends that are substantial contributing factors to \n     systemic risk.\n       Matters of financial stability and systemic risk have far-\n     reaching implications and benefit from a diversity of \n     regulatory perspectives. By including state regulators in the \n     FSOC, your amendments create a more comprehensive and \n     efficient approach that will benefit from access to all \n     relevant information regarding the accumulation of risk in \n     our financial system.\n       Thank you for your efforts and we look forward to working \n     with you to secure passage of your amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph A. Smith, Jr.,\n       Commissioner of Banks, North Carolina, Chairman, Conference \n     of State Bank Supervisors.\n     Denise Voigt Crawford,\n       Texas Securities Commissioner, NASAA President.\n     Jane Cline;\n       West Virginia Insurance Commissioner, NAIC President.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I also wish to speak briefly on my \namendment, No. 3879, which would help raise capital and risk standards \nfor banks, bank holding companies, and nonbank financial institutions.\n  It is not my intent that this amendment affect the treatment of small\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\nbank holding companies as provided under the Federal Reserve's Small \nBank Holding Company Policy Statement, nor do I intend that the \namendment apply to Federal Home Loan Banks. Likewise, I would like the \nrecord to reflect that the effective date for bank holding companies \nowned by foreign banking organizations that obtained an exemption from \ncapital requirements pursuant to the Federal Reserve's Supervision and \nRegulation Letter SR-01-1 should be 5 years after enactment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this \nintent is properly reflected in the final language of this reform bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today with a sad heart, because on \nMonday, May 10, the city of Las Vegas and our Nation lost a voice for \ntruth and justice. On that day, Reverend Jesse Scott passed away.\n  Reverend Jesse Scott committed many of his 90 years to creating a \nmore just world. With a commanding voice he argued for basic principles \nof fairness that will reverberate long into the future. His \nperseverance inspired us all and we continue his legacy of building a \ncommunity that sees all its members as equals.\n  Reverend Scott's career was devoted to social justice. As an \norganizer, president and executive director of the NAACP in California \nand Nevada, he brought communities together to create better living and \nworking conditions for minority workers. Because of his dedication, \nReverend Scott was later selected to be the executive director of the \nNevada Equal Rights Commission, where he served with dedication and \ndistinction.\n  Until his death, Reverend Scott was assistant pastor at Second \nBaptist Church of Las Vegas and was the former pastor of Second \nChristian Church in Las Vegas. Even in his final days, he practiced his \nlife's mission of social advocacy by working with Nevada's nonviolent \nex-offenders and by promoting education to help Nevada students go to \ncollege.\n  The U.S. Senate will also miss an opportunity to hear Reverend \nScott's words of faith; he was scheduled to serve as the guest Chaplain \nand deliver the opening prayer on the Senate floor on Thursday, May 20.\n  Mr. President, Reverend Jesse Scott was a trailblazer for civil \nrights and a man of deep faith in God and humanity. My thoughts are \nwith Reverend Scott's family during this difficult time.\n  Our State has lost a giant, but I am proud to have worked alongside \nsuch a great Nevadan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/13/senate-section/article/S3711-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

In March \nof this year, he was deployed to Afghanistan's Helmand Province, an \nopium-producing region at the epicenter of the war on terror. He served \nwith valor and distinction, earning numerous awards, including the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal.\n  Lance Corporal Penny was an ``all-American'' man, an all-conference \ndefensive tackle for Greenland High School's football team, and voted \n``class favorite'' by his peers. He loved to hunt and fish and drive \nbackroads in his four-wheel-drive pickup he called ``Skeeter.'' Those \nwho knew him described him as ``tough as nails,'' and said the word \n``quit'' was not part of his vocabulary.\n  Greenland police officer Michael Huber perhaps best described Lance \nCorporal Penny's life and the impact he had on others when he said to a \nlocal TV station: ``Here in our town, there are people we look up to. \nRichard Penny was one of those. He'll still be somebody we can look up \nto. Because he paid the ultimate sacrifice on the altar of freedom.''\n  Today I join all Arkansans in lifting up Lance Corporal Penny's \nfamily, friends, and all those who loved him during these challenging \ntimes.

Mr. President, on May 24, 2010, Mountain Home Air \nForce Base, in my home State of Idaho, will bid farewell to COL John D. \nBird, his wife Megan, and their children Blake and Cole. Colonel Bird \nhas been the commander of the 366th Fighter Wing at Mountain Home Air \nForce Base since February 11, 2009. Colonel Bird is a command pilot \nwith more than 1,700 flight hours in the F-15C, T-37, and T-38. He has \nbeen awarded the Legion of Merit, the Defense Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Meritorious Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the \nAir Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster, \nand the Air Force Achievement Medal. Colonel Bird has given a lifetime \nof service to his country, to the benefit of us all.\n  The 366th Fighter Wing consists of over 4,800 United States and \nRepublic of Singapore personnel, with 22 squadrons, comprised of a \nfleet of 86 F-15 aircraft, and under Colonel Bird's command, it \nexcelled in its mission. He oversaw the deployment of 5,286 personnel \nand 1,507 tons of cargo to 18 different locations around the world, \nwith his squadrons surpassing all theater commander objectives in each \nlocation. During Colonel Bird's time as commander, and due to his \nleadership, the Wing was recognized with 19 individual awards and 9 \nprogram awards at the Air Combat Command level and 10 awards at the \nHeadquarters Air Force level. While under his command, the Mountain \nHome Air Force Base thrived. He oversaw the expansion and enhancement \nof the Mountain Home Range Complex, with new urban target construction \nand an increase in training airspace capacity; a family housing \ndemolition project, 3 years ahead of\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\nschedule, saving $2.2 million; the construction of 300 new military \nfamily housing units; a temporary lodging facility; and a new main gate \ncomplex.\n  Colonel Bird's outstanding leadership abilities inspired excellence \nand achievement in others, and his comprehensive view of the wing's \nmission within the context of the broader mission of the Air Force and \nthe U.S. military made him a particularly outstanding commander. My \nstaff and I have enjoyed an extremely positive working relationship \nwith Colonel Bird and his staff, which helps to ensure that Mountain \nHome AFB not only retains critical missions, but is considered for \nothers as it possesses one of the top training ranges in the Nation and \nhas the strong support of the local community and the State.\n  Colonel and Mrs. Bird have been exemplary representatives of the Air \nForce and good friends to Idaho. They will be greatly missed. On behalf \nof the State of Idaho, I wish them well as they move back to \nWashington, DC, where Colonel Bird will work as Chief of the Force \nApplication Division at the Pentagon, and I thank them for their \ncontinued service to our Nation and for their time as gunfighters in \nthe great State of Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/13/senate-section/article/S3712-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO B.M. ``MACK'' RANKIN, JR.\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about a \ndear friend whose contributions to the great State of Texas and our \nNation are most notable.\n  B.M. Rankin, Jr., known by his friends as ``Mack,'' is a pioneer in \nthe oil and gas industry. More than three decades ago, Rankin and two \npartners, W.K. McWilliams, Jr. and James R. Moffett, founded McMoRan \nExploration Co., an independent public company engaged in the \nexploration, development and production of oil and natural gas offshore \nin the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in the gulf coast area. Today Rankin \nis the vice chairman of both McMoRan Exploration Co., NYSE, and \nFreeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., NYSE, the world's third-largest \ncopper deposit and the single largest gold deposit in the world.\n  Rankin's expertise and knowledge of America's energy resources, \ncoupled with his leadership and vision for our country's energy needs, \nhave transformed public policy in this area.\n  For the past 2 years, he has served as the chairman of the U.S. Oil \nand Gas Association. Under his guidance, the association has provided \nthe industry with representation in legislative, regulatory and public \naffairs, and it serves as a resource on technical matters. Membership \nin the association represents all segments of the industry, including \nmajor oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas producers, \nrefineries, natural gas and petroleum products transportation and \ndistribution companies, natural gas generation companies, and other \nfirms and individuals involved in the industry.\n  Throughout his career Rankin has been a strong advocate for clarity \nand practicality in the ongoing debate to formulate a responsible \nnational energy policy. Because of his steadfast efforts, the oil and \ngas industry plays a leading role in these policy debates and \ndeliberations.\n  A native of Dallas, Rankin is an active member and generous \nbenefactor of a number of local charitable foundations. He has served \non the Board of Visitors of the University Cancer Foundation of the \nUniversity of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital Cancer Center and as \nchairman for the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, CLL, Global Research \nFoundation.\n  On May 13, 2010, Rankin will step down as chairman of the U.S. Oil \nand Gas Association. On this special occasion I want not only to \ncommend Rankin for his lifelong dedication to energy policy but also to \nthank him for his tremendous commitment to our State and \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/13/senate-section/article/S3712-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GOVERNOR'S WORK-LIFE BALANCE AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, today I recognize Black Dinah \nChocolatiers, a rare treasure of a company found on the tiny, remote \nMaine island of Isle au Haut in Penobscot Bay. While this small \nbusiness may be nestled on a small island, it is no secret to the \nworld. Featured in Martha Stewart Living and various other \npublications, chocolate lovers travel from near and far to take the 45-\nminute ride by mail boat or ferry from the mainland to indulge in the \nrich, delightful taste of Black Dinah's specialty handcrafted \nchocolates.\n  The history behind this tasty small business is a tale of adventure \nand creativity. Black Dinah Chocolatiers' founders Kate and Steve \nShaffer fell in love with the small fishing and lobstering community of \nIsle au Haut after moving there in 2004. Not seeking employment in the \nisland's traditional trades of lobstering and carpentry, Kate and Steve \ndesigned an alternative business plan that consisted of a product that \ncould be marketed and shipped off the island year-round to compensate \nfor cold Maine winters and a sparsely populated customer base on the \nisland. Their solution was chocolate.\n  With Kate's years of experience in the restaurant industry, Steve's \nexperience in the computer repair business, and some assistance from \none of Maine's exceptional women's business centers, the Shaffers \nlaunched Black Dinah Chocolatiers in July of 2007. Today, thousands of \nchocolates are shipped off the island to every State during holidays \nsuch as Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentine's Day, and Mothers Day. In \naddition to an active mail order business, the Shaffers supply their \nartisan chocolates to Maine gourmet food stores, wine shops, and \nflorists. They also run an organic bakery and coffeehouse from May \nthrough September for tourists and locals alike. This small business \nhas a tremendous impact on the island's community--not only through its \nsatisfying contribution of extraordinary chocolate but as a profitable \nventure that is helping to sustain its local economy through sales that \nhave doubled each year since its inception.\n  Black Dinah Chocolatier further assists the regional economy through \nits\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\nuse of local Maine produce. Kate turns out dozens of handmade \nVenezuelan, Belgian, and rare Peruvian-style chocolates, including \ntruffles and caramels, all of them flavored with natural ingredients--\norganic herbs, flowers, fruits, and even cheeses cultivated by the \nregion's farmers. In fact, each season's flavored chocolates are \ndictated by what is at the nearby Stonington farmers market on the \nmainland. Every chocolate features at least one ingredient from a Maine \nfarmer located within 50 miles of the company's base.\n  The Shaffers understand how critical it is for their business to \nestablish and maintain local relationships, especially on an island the \nsize of Isle au Haut. In a truly Maine example of how neighbors help \neach other to this day, Kate told Martha Stewart Living Magazine, \n``It's not as though you can go to the store when you run out of \nbutter. If I run out of butter I'll go to Diana, the innkeeper. For \ncream cheese, I call Brenda, a lobsterman's wife, who makes lots of \ncrab dip. And of course, if anyone needs sugar or chocolate, they come \nto me.''\n  A true sweet spot in the heart of an island community as well as the \nhearts of chocolate lovers worldwide, Black Dinah Chocolatiers is a \nprime example of a Maine small business that seeks to be a profitable \nventure and a good neighbor. I commend its founders, Kate and Steve \nShaffer, for their ingenuity in creating this thriving and viable \nbusiness, as well as for their commitment and dedication to helping \ngrow their local economy, and I wish them the sweetest success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/13/senate-section/article/S3713-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MIKE BARKER\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this week in Bend, OR, the community \nwill be honoring one of the great advocates for Oregon's veterans, Mike \n``Rocky'' Barker. Mike has been an incredible partner to me and my \nstaff as we have worked to improve health and other services for \ncentral Oregon's military veterans.\n  Mike's incredible service to our Nation began with 8 years in the \nU.S. Air Force as an air traffic controller. He went on to a career \nwith the FAA at the Butte, MT, Flight Service Station and then moved to \ncentral Oregon where he ran the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program. In \nthat post he became nationally recognized as the VA's top service \nofficer for 1999, and shortly thereafter he received similar national \nrecognition from the VFW.\n  Always looking for ways to help veterans in need, Mike ran the \nincarcerated vet program for a number of years. During his leadership, \nmore than 95 percent of the veterans who came through his program \nstayed out of prison.\n  He retired in 2003, and the hallmark of his career from 1970 to the \npresent--whether as a professional or as a volunteer--has been his \ninsight and leadership on issues that matter to military veterans.\n  When I was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, Mike immediately \nrolled up his shirt sleeves to work with me and our staff to open up \nthe VA's Central Oregon Community Based Outreach Clinic--the first of \nits kind to open up east of the Cascades. Before this clinic got off \nthe ground, central Oregon veterans had to drive to the Portland VA \nMedical Center for the medical services our Nation promised them--a 6-\nhour round trip. That hardship is now a thing of the past for Oregon's \nveterans. Today, the clinic is such a success that we are now in the \nprocess of expanding it.\n  Throughout all of his work on veterans' issues, Mike had a particular \nfeel for the challenges his fellow servicemembers faced with post \ntraumatic stress disorder, PTSD. He had started working with people \ndealing with illness during the Vietnam era, and continues to this day. \nThree years ago, Mike brought together a diverse group of veterans' \nleaders and formed the Central Oregon Vet Center Task Force to find \nways to support veterans in their community. Mike led the group's \nmonthly meetings, as they brainstormed strategies to persuade the VA \nhow important it was to create a vet center in eastern Oregon. Almost a \nyear ago we finally achieved that goal, and the Central Oregon Vet \nCenter is now open for service. It is a place where combat veterans can \nget counseling and, just as importantly, find a community of people who \nhave a common experience as warriors for the United States.\n  Thank you, Mike, for your friendship, your dedication, and your \nservice to our veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/13/senate-section/article/S3713-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/13/senate-section/article/S3713-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/13/senate-section/article/S3713-4", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1067.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Burris, \n        Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 3364. A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nestablish the Office of Energy and Renewable Energy as the lead Federal \nagency for coordinating Federal, State, and local assistance provided \nto promote the energy retrofitting of schools; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing a \nbipartisan bill along with my colleague Senator Collins entitled the \nStreamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2010. This bill is \ndesigned to streamline the Federal Government's efforts to improve the \nhealth and efficiency of our schools, while creating much-needed jobs \nin the process.\n  I am pleased that Senators Burris, Merkley and Murray are also \njoining us as original cosponsors of this bill.\n  For the past year I have been travelling across Colorado as part of a \nwork force tour to talk directly to Coloradans and hear their \ninnovative policy ideas to create jobs. These ongoing efforts help me \nidentify ways the Federal Government can help or is not as effective as \nit can be in supporting economic development and meeting our national \nenergy goals. The Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of \n2010 comes directly from visiting with Coloradans. This bill is just \none of several job-creation proposals developed after I hosted an \nEnergy Jobs Summit in February in Colorado.\n  There are numerous Federal programs and funds already available to \nschools to help them become more energy efficient. However, schools \nface a morass of programs and agency offices across the government and \nit is challenging for schools to take full advantage of them. This \nbipartisan bill will force the government to coordinate their efforts \nso that schools are less confused and they can better navigate the \nexisting federal programs and financing options available to them. Put \nsimply, it will streamline the Federal Government while still leaving \ndecisions to the states, school boards and local officials to determine \nwhat is best for their schools.\n  I have had a longstanding interest in energy efficiency technologies. \nThese technologies further our national goals of broad-based economic \ngrowth, environmental protection, national security, and economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  I have also been a long-time champion of energy efficiency in our \nschools, introducing and co-sponsoring many bills over the years in the \nHouse of Representatives that promoted the efficient use of energy by \nour schools.\n  I have seen these energy efficient buildings first hand when \ntraveling in Colorado. It is good to see that there are schools in my \nstate that are already incorporating this technology into their \nbuildings. For example, the Cherry Creek School District in Greenwood \nVillage, CO, has incorporated day lighting techniques and ice storage \nto cool the buildings during the day. Because of these innovative \nimprovements, the school district has enjoyed significant cost savings. \nThis is good news not just for Colorado students, but also for Colorado \ntaxpayers.\n  In another example, Colorado's Poudre School District in Fort \nCollins, CO, actively promotes sustainable design guidelines, calling \nit their ``Ethic of Sustainability.'' This program includes an \nelementary school in Fort Collins that actually uses recycled blue \njeans as insulation for the school buildings. This school has a ``Truth \nWall,'' an exposed cross-section where kids can see the denim at work, \nlook at pipes and electrical systems, and check school energy use.\n  I hope that in passing this bill we will see more examples of these \nsuccessful and creative projects across the country--projects that will \nincrease the efficiency of our schools and teach our students about the \nimportance of saving energy.\n  Through effective use of existing Federal Government programs and \nfinancing options, schools can reduce costs and create jobs at the same \ntime becoming more energy efficient. Though it is often overlooked, \nenergy efficiency is a huge job creator. Not only does it create jobs \nthrough the purchase and installation of efficient materials, it frees \nup scarce school finances to retain teachers and important programs.\n  What excites me most about this bill is that it will create jobs for \nAmericans in every neighborhood where schools improve their energy \nefficiency. Right now, creating jobs is priority one for all of us.\n  But additionally, this bill helps reduce barriers to schools wishing \nto incorporate innovative energy efficiency measures, and creates a \nsimple, streamlined structure to allow schools\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\nto more effectively use existing Federal funds and programs--at a low \ncost. These cutting edge actions--which we are all seeing across our \nstates--are making government more efficient and saving taxpayer \ndollars, a goal we all share. I urge my colleagues--of both parties--to \njoin me in supporting this bipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3367. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase \nthe rate of pension for disabled veterans who are married to one \nanother and both of whom require regular aid and attendance, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I introduce legislation today to correct an inequity \nwhich affects a small number of couples where both the husband and wife \nare wartime veterans and each meets the criteria for VA pension with \nadditional aid and attendance benefits. Currently these couples receive \nannual benefits of $30,480. Under my bill, the annual amount would be \nincreased by $825 to $31,305.\n  This measure would correct a mistake which occurred in 1998 with the \nenactment of Public Law 105-178. Section 8206 of that law increased the \naid and attendance rates for veterans in receipt of VA pension who were \nin need of aid and attendance. Due to a drafting error, this increase \nwas not provided to couples where both members were pension receipients \nin need of aid and attendence. This bill would correct that mistake by \nbringing the pension of a wartime veteran couple eligible for pension \nand aid and attendance into conformity with what their peers receive.\n  This is an appropriate result. Both members of such couples served \nour Nation with honor. In their time of need, they should not be short-\nchanged by this mistake. Although only a small number of veterans \nqualify for this benefit, those who do so often pay large amounts of \nmoney to receive care in nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, or \nat home. My bill would increase the amounts paid so that each member of \nthe couple would have their service taken into account in determining \nthe benefit level.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this bill so that all veterans who \nserved during wartime and are eligible for VA pension receive the same \nbenefit payments and no member of a wartime veteran couple is \nshortchanged.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3367\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCREASE IN RATE OF PENSION FOR DISABLED VETERANS \n                   MARRIED TO ONE ANOTHER AND BOTH OF WHOM REQUIRE \n                   REGULAR AID AND ATTENDANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1521(f)(2) of title 38, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking ``$8,911'' and inserting \n     ``$31,305''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3368. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \ncertain individuals to sign claims filed with the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs on behalf of claimants, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I introduce legislation today that would give the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs the same authority as the Social \nSecurity Administration with respect to claimants who are unable to \ncomplete applications for benefits without requiring assistance.\n  Occasionally, claimants for VA benefits are so disabled as to be \nincapable of understanding the information on the application form. VA \nlacks authority to authorize a court appointee or caregiver to sign an \napplication form allowing the adjudication of the claim to proceed. \nWithout a signed application, the claim cannot proceed.\n  The Social Security Administration has specific authority under the \nSocial Security Act that permit an certain individuals, such as court \nappointed representatives, to sign a claim form on behalf of \nindividuals unable to sign a claim form.\n  My bill would extend the same authority to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and would allow court appointed representatives and caregivers \nof applicants for VA benefits and services, including institutional \nrepresentatives, to sign application forms. This bill does not alter \nthe responsibility of VA to evaluate and appoint a fiduciary in cases \nwhere the beneficiary is determined to be incompetent to manage his or \nher benefits.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this bill so that unnecessary delays \nin the adjudication of these claims will be avoided.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3368\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS TO SIGN CLAIMS \n                   FILED WITH SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ON \n                   BEHALF OF CLAIMANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 5101 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by striking ``A specific'' and inserting ``(1) A \n     specific''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) If an individual has not attained the age of 18 \n     years, is mentally incompetent, or is physically unable to \n     sign a form, a form filed under paragraph (1) for the \n     individual may be signed by a court appointed representative \n     or a person who is responsible for the care of the \n     individual, including a spouse or other relative. If the \n     individual is in the care of an institution, the manager or \n     principal officer of the institution may sign the form.'';\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) by inserting ``, signs a form on behalf of a person to \n     apply for,'' after ``who applies for''; and\n       (ii) by inserting ``, or TIN in the case that the person is \n     not an individual,'' after ``of such person''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``or TIN'' after \n     ``social security number'' each place it appears; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(d) In this section:\n       ``(1) The term `mentally incompetent' with respect to an \n     individual means that the individual lacks the mental \n     capacity--\n       ``(A) to provide substantially accurate information needed \n     to complete a form; or\n       ``(B) to certify that the statements made on a form are \n     true and complete.\n       ``(2) The term `TIN' has the meaning given the term in \n     section 7701(a)(41) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply with respect to claims filed on or after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Cornyn, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Durbin, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 3376. A bill to authorize to be appropriated $950,000,000 for each \nof the fiscal years 2012 through 2015 to carry out the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, the SCAAP \nReauthorization Act, on behalf of myself and Mr. Kyl, to assist with \nalleviating the costs of illegal immigration to State and local \ngovernments by reauthorizing the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram, SCAAP, though 2015.\n  We are pleased to be joined today by Senators Schumer, Cornyn, Boxer, \nHutchison, Bingaman, McCain, Durbin, and Crapo.\n  I believe that immigration policy and control of our borders is \nexclusively a Federal responsibility. Yet many undocumented criminal \naliens are housed in our State prisons and our county jails at a cost \nthat rises into the hundred of millions of dollars.\n  Understanding the expenses that States and localities bear, Congress \nenacted the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, (SCAAP), in 1994 \nas part of the Violent Crime Control Act. The program was designed to \nhelp reimburse States and localities for the costs of incarcerating \nundocumented criminal aliens. Under this program, States can be \nreimbursed for costs for housing undocumented aliens who are convicted \nof a felony or two or more misdemeanors in violation of State or\n\n[[Page S3721]]\n\nlocal law and incarcerated for at least 4 consecutive days.\n  Over the years, Senator Kyl and I have worked to increase \nCongressional funding of SCAAP. Last year, Congress appropriated 393 \nmillion dollars to SCAAP. While this is only a fraction of the costs \nthat States and localities bear for housing undocumented criminal \naliens, even this level of funding is critical.\n  In 2009, undocumented aliens comprised approximately 11 percent of \nthe inmates in California's State prison system. This year, the State \nof California is expected to spend 970.3 million dollars from the \ngeneral fund on the incarceration of undocumented criminal aliens. \nHowever, it is expected that California will only receive reimbursement \nfor 10 percent of its total costs. The State of California and its \ncounties simply cannot afford to take on these costs, which stretch \nalready thin budgets.\n  When the Federal Government does not reimburse States and localities \nfor the cost of incarcerating criminal aliens, it is at the expense of \nour local educators, social services, and law enforcement. Insufficient \nSCAAP funding forces localities to engage in the ``early release'' of \nprisoners with misdemeanors as a cost saving measure and make cuts to \nother necessary public safety services. American communities simply \ncannot afford to shoulder the weight of our immigration policies.\n  I believe this legislation will reaffirm the Federal government's \ncommitment to working with States and localities to address their \nfinancial concerns.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3376\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 524\n\n       Whereas an estimated 3,000,000 Americans are affected by \n     stuttering;\n       Whereas stuttering is a communication disorder experienced \n     by children and adults alike;\n       Whereas individuals who stutter frequently experience \n     embarrassment, anxiety about speaking, and physical tension \n     in their speech muscles;\n       Whereas many different types of stuttering exist, and the \n     symptoms of stuttering can range from mild to severe;\n       Whereas the cause of stuttering is unknown, but research \n     suggests stuttering may be genetic;\n       Whereas stuttering commonly begins in children between the \n     ages of 2 and 5;\n       Whereas parents are encouraged to consult with \n     pediatricians or qualified speech-language pathologists as \n     soon as stuttering becomes apparent in a child in order to \n     take advantage of early-intervention therapies;\n       Whereas it is known that stuttering is not--\n       (1) a nervous disorder;\n       (2) the result of emotional problems; or\n       (3) the fault of the individual who stutters or the family \n     of that individual;\n       Whereas a 2009 survey by the National Stuttering \n     Association found that--\n       (1) 40 percent of adults and teenagers who stutter feel \n     that they have been denied a job, a promotion, or a school \n     opportunity as a result of stuttering; and\n       (2) 8 out of 10 children who stutter report being bullied \n     or teased;\n       Whereas many individuals who stutter do not have access to \n     qualified speech-language pathologists or helpful resources;\n       Whereas several treatments for stuttering exist that can \n     help individuals who stutter learn to speak more easily and \n     gain confidence in themselves and their ability to \n     communicate effectively;\n       Whereas organizations like the National Stuttering \n     Association have been working for many years to raise \n     awareness about stuttering, the effect stuttering has on the \n     lives of individuals who stutter, available treatment \n     options, and research being conducted to investigate the \n     causes of stuttering;\n       Whereas, on April 13, 1988, the President of the United \n     States signed a proclamation designating the week of May 9 \n     through 16 of that year as National Stuttering Awareness \n     Week;\n       Whereas since 1988, individuals who stutter and the \n     families and friends of those individuals, as well as medical \n     practitioners, speech language pathologists, researchers, and \n     others have marked the second week of May as National \n     Stuttering Awareness Week; and\n       Whereas the goals of the National Stuttering Awareness Week \n     2010 include increasing awareness among the people of the \n     United States about stuttering and educating the people of \n     the United States about ways to improve the lives of those \n     who stutter: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Stuttering \n     Awareness Week 2010; and\n       (2) encourages all of the people of the United States to \n     learn more about stuttering and ways to help individuals who \n     stutter feel more confident and comfortable speaking with \n     others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/13/senate-section/article/S3721-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 525--EXPRESSING SYMPATHY TO THE FAMILIES OF THOSE \n   KILLED IN THE SINKING OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA SHIP CHEONAN, AND \n SOLIDARITY WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS TRAGIC \n                                INCIDENT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. McCain, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \nLugar) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I thank all Senators for joining me in \nsupport of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act Improvements Act of \n2010. Passage of this legislation demonstrates the Senate's strong \nbipartisan support of all the men and women who serve in law \nenforcement roles in the United States. I thank the Judiciary \nCommittee's Ranking Member Senator Sessions, Senator Kyl, and Senator \nConrad for joining me as cosponsors of this legislation.\n  In March, for the third time since 2007, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee favorably reported legislation making needed improvements to \nthe Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004, which allows qualified \nactive and retired law enforcement officers to obtain certification to \ncarry firearms across State lines. I am very pleased the Senate has at \nlast given its approval to these important improvements to the original \nlaw.\n  In 2004, Congress passed the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act. I \nworked with Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and 68 other Senators to \nshow our strong support for the Nation's law enforcement community. \nSince enactment, however, many retired officers have experienced \nsubstantial difficulty in gaining the benefits the law was intended to \nconfer. I listened carefully to the feedback and advice from those in \nthe law enforcement community to make the existing law stronger and \nmore workable in a responsible and measured way. I especially thank the \nFraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, and the National Association of Police Organizations for \ntheir strong support.\n  The amendments we pass today will make the original law's operation \nmore efficient while maintaining the rigorous standards that apply to \nthose who seek its benefits. It will ensure that law enforcement \nofficers who have served honorably and who are now retired will have \nflexibility in achieving the law's benefits and privileges which \nCongress determined they deserve.\n  It is especially appropriate that we pass this legislation this week \nat a time when tens of thousands of law enforcement officers are in the \nNation's Capital to honor and remember their fellow officers who have \nlost their lives in the line of duty. As I do each year, and in \nrecognition of the ceremonies in Washington, I introduced a resolution \nto officially recognize May 15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. \nThe Senate unanimously adopted that resolution. All of the men and \nwomen who serve and who are in Washington to remember and celebrate \ntheir fallen fellow officers should know that the Senate recognizes the \nextraordinary work they do on behalf of all Americans.\n  I thank all Senators who supported this measure and express my deep \nappreciation for the sacrifices and service of all of the men and women \nwho give so much in the service of their fellow citizens.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1132), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/13/senate-section/article/S3763-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3763-S3766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. DODD.

The Protocol is an integral part of \nthe Treaty and contains three Annexes. I also transmit, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report of the Department of State and \nthree unilateral statements associated with the Treaty. These \nunilateral statements are not legally binding and are not integral \nparts of the Treaty. The Department of State report includes a detailed \narticle-by-article analysis of the Treaty, as well as an analysis of \nthe unilateral statements.\n  The Treaty will enhance the national security of the United States. \nIt mandates mutual reductions and limitations on the world's two \nlargest nuclear arsenals. The Treaty will promote transparency and \npredictability in the strategic relationship between the United States \nand the Russian Federation and will enable each Party to verify that \nthe other Party is complying with its obligations through a regime that \nincludes on-site inspections, notifications, a comprehensive and \ncontinuing exchange of data regarding strategic offensive arms, and \nprovisions for the use of national technical means of verification. The \nTreaty further includes detailed procedures for the conversion or \nelimination of Treaty-accountable items, and provides for the exchange \nof certain telemetric information on selected ballistic missile \nlaunches for increased transparency.\n  Additionally, the Treaty creates a Bilateral Consultative Commission \nthat will meet regularly to promote effective implementation of the \nTreaty regime. This Commission will provide an important channel for \ncommunication between the United States and the Russian Federation \nregarding the Treaty's implementation.\n  The United States will continue to maintain a strong nuclear \ndeterrent under this Treaty, as validated by the Department of Defense \nthrough rigorous analysis in the Nuclear Posture Review. The Treaty \npreserves our ability to determine for ourselves the composition and \nstructure of our strategic forces within the Treaty's overall limits, \nand to modernize those forces. The Treaty does not contain any \nconstraints on testing, development, or deployment of current or \nplanned U.S. missile defense programs or current or planned U.S. long-\nrange conventional strike capabilities.\n  The Treaty, upon its entry into force, will supersede the Treaty \nBetween the United States of America and the Russian Federation on \nStrategic Offensive Reductions, signed in Moscow on May 24, 2002.\n  I urge the Senate to give early and favorable consideration to the \nTreaty, including its Protocol, and to give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n                                                        Barack Obama,  \nThe White House, May 13, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/13/senate-section/article/S3767-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
