But the \ngood news as far as Louisville goes, from my perspective, is a young \ncoach from UNLV, a soccer coach. There was some turmoil in the athletic \ndepartment, and they didn't support him very well at all. So on a lark \nhe went to Louisville. Louisville has never had any quality soccer \nteams, and this young man took this team and they played in the \nnational finals yesterday. They lost 1 to nothing.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, over the past few years, the American \npeople have been engaged in a great national debate about the proper \nrole of government. This debate is as old as our Nation itself, but it \nhas reemerged with new intensity amidst a prolonged economic downturn \nthat continues to affect millions of Americans.\n  On the one side are those who argue the solution to our present \ntroubles lies in giving more to Washington. They say if only Washington \nhad more power, we could have averted these challenges altogether; and \nthe only way to get us out of this and to put us on stronger economic \nfooting is to hand over more of our freedoms--and more of our \npaychecks--to Washington.\n  On the other side of this debate are those who say in order for \nindividuals to prosper and move up the economic ladder, they must be \nfree to take risks. They must be free to fail. They argue for \ngovernment limits and restraint and for making as many decisions as \npossible close to home.\n  Now, it is no secret most Americans fall into the second group. \nWhenever asked, most Americans say they will take a system of free \nenterprise and limited government over the alternative any day. But, \noccasionally, people find the first group's message appealing, too, \nespecially in times of distress. That is why 2 years ago, Americans \nchose what they viewed as the safer route. Yet since then many have \ncome to regret that decision.\n  We have all seen the deep discontent with Washington spread over the \nlast year and a half as lawmakers here assumed more and more authority \nand spent more and more taxpayer money on wasteful projects and dubious \nlong-term programs which couldn't possibly deliver what Democratic \nleaders said they would. Early last month, we watched as Americans told \nDemocratic leaders in Washington they had had enough of their 2-year \nexperiment in big government. On election day, our debate about \ngovernment took yet another turn, and the bipartisan compromise the \nWhite House agreed to last week on taxes is a clear sign that it has \nhad an impact.\n\n  In some ways, it has shifted the debate entirely. Here is how: For 2 \nyears, Democrats in Washington have argued that the solution to our \nNation's economic problems is to give bureaucrats in Washington \ntrillions of dollars and then have them spend it for us. But with this \nbipartisan compromise, we are taking a different approach. We are \ntelling the American people to keep money that is rightfully theirs so \nthey can spend it and invest it as they please. This is an important \nshift, and the White House should be applauded for agreeing to it.\n  There are parts of this agreement I don't like such as the Democrats' \ninsistence that we borrow the money we need to pay for a further \nextension of unemployment insurance. In my view, if both parties agree \nthe debt is a serious problem, we shouldn't be writing checks we don't \nhave the money to cover.\n  Yet, in another way, this bipartisan compromise represents an \nessential first step in tackling the debt because in keeping taxes \nwhere they are, we are officially cutting off that spigot. Taxes are \ngoing to stay right where they are for the next 2 years, and until we \ndid that, Democrats in Washington were never going to be serious about \ncutting spending or debt. As long as more revenue was coming in, they \nwould always have an excuse to spend more. With this agreement, Members \nof Congress no longer have that excuse.\n  History is very clear on that point. From World War II through 2009, \nevery dollar of new tax revenue that the government has collected has \nbeen associated with $1.17 in new spending. This means for decades, \nlawmakers in both parties have spent every dime of revenue that came in \nfrom taxpayers, then borrowed a little bit more on top of it to set a \nhigher baseline for the next year.\n  But the American people have caught on to the game and they have had \nit. They know the root of our problem lies not in the fact that \nWashington taxes too little but that it spends too much. They want the \nwasteful spending to stop.\n  Mark my words, if Republicans had gone along with the Democratic plan \non taxes, they would have done the same thing they have always done. \nThey would have spent it all, and then some. They had no intention of \nusing any new tax revenue to pay down the\n\n[[Page S8839]]\n\ndebt. The President has already said he has better ways to spend the \ntaxpayers' money than they do.\n  Nobody expected the same Democrats who more than tripled the deficit \nto suddenly get serious about cutting it if they expected more tax \nrevenue to come in next year as a result of higher taxes. So it never \nmade sense to take money from job creators in order to hand it over to \npoliticians who would only waste it. Nobody ever created a job by \npunishing a job creator, and we simply had to turn off the spigot--not \nfrom some but from everyone--to remove the temptation to spend it.\n  For the past 2 years, Democrats in Washington worked hand in hand \nwith the White House spending trillions we didn't have on programs \nAmericans didn't want. They wrote future budgets presuming Americans \nwould agree to a tax hike to pay for it all. They cashed the checks \nbefore Americans had even written them like an employee who demands a \nraise on the grounds that he and his wife had already budgeted for a \nspeed boat and a three-car garage. But the American people have \nrebelled against this way of doing business, and now we are going to \nmove in another direction.\n  Some may continue to deny that Washington has a spending problem. \nThose are the people who are still out there arguing for a tax hike. \nBut the only argument they appear to be making is that it is only fair \nfor certain people to be punished with higher taxes.\n  I have heard a lot of Democrats in recent days say this group or that \ngroup doesn't ``deserve'' to have their current tax rates extended. \nBut, of course, that has always been a losing argument in America. You \ncan count me among those who want everybody in this country to succeed, \nand I suspect most Americans agree with that.\n  There may be some in Washington who are only satisfied if somebody or \nsome group loses out, which either means they think there is a finite \namount of success to be had out there, which is nonsense, or they are \nlooking for an excuse to spend more money on turtle tunnels or \nresearching the drug preferences of monkeys. But either way, Americans \naren't interested in that point of view.\n  Americans aren't interested in scapegoats. They are interested in \nregaining our prosperity. They have lost faith in government's ability \nto get us through with more and more government spending. With this \nbipartisan compromise, we are finally giving these people a voice in \nthis debate.\n  So today's vote is a step in the right direction. But it is only a \nfirst step. Unless we use it to pivot to the deficit and the debt, we \nwill have only pushed the larger problem down the road, and no one sent \nus here to do that. It is time to come together to cut the debt in the \nsame way we have come together to prevent a tax hike. It won't be easy, \nbut we have laid the groundwork. I will vote in favor of this \nbipartisan compromise, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate and in \nthe House to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/13/senate-section/article/S8839-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8839-S8840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                              Bob Bennett\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are losing through retirement a \nnumber of our most distinguished Members. None of them have I been \ncloser to than the Senator from Utah, Senator Bennett, and I am pleased \nhe is here on the floor today. He made his farewell speech last week, \nand now I wish to speak about his farewell myself.\n  Over the last 18 years, I have come to rely on Bob's counsel, and \ntoday I wish to thank him publicly and personally for being so generous \nwith his candid advice and unfailing good judgment. I simply would not \nbe where I am today without the benefit of Bob's wisdom and friendship, \nand I am deeply grateful for it.\n  Bob has always been a pretty low-key guy, and he has always preferred \nworking quietly in the background--both rarities in politics today. But \nas with most everything Bob does, there is a method behind his style. \nAs Bob once put it:\n\n       In Washington, there are two kinds of Senators . . . work \n     horses and show horses. I decided I would be a work horse.\n\n  Then he went on to explain the difference. He said:\n\n       Most of the show horses look in the mirror in the morning \n     and see a President looking back at them . . . But we haven't \n     elected a bald president in this country since [Dwight] \n     Eisenhower [so] I look in the mirror and realize I don't \n     have the qualifications.\n\n  What Bob failed to point out, of course, is that he has one of the \nlongest resumes in the Senate. So I would like to take a moment today \nto go through just some of the things he has achieved in a very \neventful life.\n  Born in Salt Lake City, Bob was the youngest of Francis and Wallace \nF. Bennett's five children. Bob learned the value of hard work from his \ndad and the importance of faith from both his parents. The product of \npublic education, Bob graduated from East High School in Salt Lake City \nand then went on to attend the University of Utah, where he majored in \npolitical science and served as student body president.\n  After college, he served 3 years as Chaplain in the Utah Army \nNational Guard. By then, Bob's father had already been a U.S. Senator \nfor a number of years; and after his service Bob joined his dad's \nSenate reelection campaign in 1962. It was a close race, but Bob's \nfather was able to win--and Bob himself was hooked on politics. After \nworking on the campaign, he wasn't much interested in returning to \nBennett Paint & Glass, so he packed his bags and moved to DC.\n  After bouncing around a little as a press secretary in Congress, a \ncorporate researcher working on Federal pension law, and chief \nadministrative assistant for his dad, he took a job as a lobbyist for \nJ.C. Penney.\n  Now, in those days, lobbyists did not make as much money as they do \ntoday. But Bob enjoyed the work and the friendships he made, including \nhis friendship with the legendary Bryce Harlow. Bryce ended up becoming \nmore than a friend to Bob, he really became a mentor to him. And when \nNixon won the Presidential election in 1968, Bryce pulled him aside and \ngave him some marching orders: ``If I have to give up my cushy \ncorporate job to serve this administration,'' he said, ``so do you. Go \nget measured for a suit, go over to the Department of Transportation. \nShow up; you're going to be John Volpe's head of congressional \nrelations.'' And that is exactly what Bob did. Bob will tell you he was \nproud of his work and experience he gained at DOT. He says no \ndepartment was more successful. And he has all of the Presidential pens \nto prove it.\n  At the end of 1971, Bob was ready to leave government and start \nsomething new. So he bought the public relations firm Robert Mullen & \nCo. and soon unwittingly found himself right in the middle of the \nWatergate scandal. What Bob didn't know when he bought the firm is that \nit doubled as a CIA front and that one of its employees had organized \nthe break-in at the center of the Watergate investigation. The unwanted \nattention ruined Bob's new business and completely changed the course \nof his career.\n  Howard Hughes was one of Mullen's clients at the time, and he asked \nBob to work for him directly in California. Looking for a fresh start, \nhe took the job, and left Washington for the west coast. After that, \nBob found success running a company that made day planners and \norganizers. Under his leadership, the company went from 4 employees to \n700 employees and $80 million in sales. And then, in 1992, with Utah \nRepublican Jake Garn retiring from the Senate, Bob decided to fulfill \nhis lifelong dream and follow in his father's footsteps by running for \nthe Senate. After a tough primary, he beat his Democratic opponent and \nwon the election by a 15-point margin. And since entering this Chamber, \nhe has been a central player in some of the most significant \nlegislative efforts the Senate has undertaken over the last two \ndecades.\n  A staunch conservative with a track record of finding common ground \non some of the toughest issues, Bob played a central role in the \nbailout of the Mexican government during the peso crisis in the 1990s. \nFor his efforts, President Clinton praised him as ``a highly \nintelligent, old-fashioned conservative who quickly grasped the \nconsequences of inaction and would stick with us throughout the \ncrisis.'' Around the same time, he was also instrumental in the passage \nof legislation related to the confidentiality of medical records.\n\n[[Page S8840]]\n\n  As someone who has always worked hard to build relationships with \nDemocrats, I knew I could always rely on Bob to find out the pulse of \nDemocrats on an issue. And Democrats could turn to him too. Here is \nwhat Senator Reid once said about Bob: ``There is no more honorable \nMember of this body than Bob Bennett.''\n  Bob and I have found common cause over the years, among other things, \nin our defense of the First Amendment. I remember being in the trenches \ntogether over the flag-burning amendment, which we both opposed. Both \nof us, of course, also strongly oppose any desecration of the flag. But \nwe agreed that an amendment to the Constitution was not the way to go. \nAnd in the end, we prevailed. We thought it was worth the fight to \nensure that Congress didn't place any qualifiers on the First \nAmendment.\n  Over this time, Bob became one of my most trusted colleagues, and \nthat is why, when I was elected Republican leader, I asked him if he \nwould serve as one of my advisers. He is smart and level-headed, a \nproven leader, a successful entrepreneur, and when he speaks everyone \nlistens. In addition, he has a remarkable gift of persuasion. Far from \nthe floor is where Bob does his best work. It is a trait he learned \nfrom his dad.\n  As Bob once put it, ``Building a consensus, building relationships \nwhere people will trust and do things for you is the hardest work of \nthe Senate, and when it comes to fruition . . . it's also the most \nrewarding work in the Senate.''\n  Bob decided long ago to do his best to stay out of the nasty \npolitical fights that occur from time to time in Washington. That is \none of the reasons you don't ever see him on the Sunday shows. Bob \nknows that most of the time the media is just looking for that gotcha \nmoment. He is more interested in spending his time focusing on what is \nbest for his constituents, whether it is in this Chamber, in committee, \nor back home.\n  In addition to Bob's role in leadership, he served as the ranking \nmember of the Rules and Administration Committee, as the chairman of \nthe Joint Economic Committee, as the senior member of the Senate \nBanking Committee, as the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Energy \nand Water Development and on the Senate Appropriations Committee. He \nhas been involved in nearly every major issue that has come through \nthis Chamber over the past two decades. He has worked hard to fix our \neconomy and health care system, simplify the tax code, reform \nentitlement programs, and strengthen America's national security at \nhome and abroad.\n  But Bob will tell you his most important job is being a husband. And \nof course today we also pay tribute to Joyce, who has played such an \nactive role in the life of the Senate family over the years. We will \nmiss them both. Together, they have raised six children and in nearly \n50 years of marriage, they have certainly seen a lot.\n  When asked about his legacy, Bob has pointed out that it was always \nhis hope to live up to his own father's example of integrity and hard \nwork. And Bob, we know that if your dad were here today, he would be so \nproud of all you have accomplished not only in this Chamber and for our \ncountry, but also as a devoted husband, father and grandfather. So it \nis with a sense of gratitude for all that he has meant to the Senate \nand to me personally, that I pay tribute to Bob Bennett. It has been an \nhonor to serve with him, and most importantly to call him a friend. And \non behalf of the entire Senate family, I want to thank Bob for his \nservice. He will be missed, and we wish him all the best in the next \nchapter of his life.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I too want to say a couple of words about \nBob Bennett. We are deeply impressed with his sense of integrity and \nhis commitment to working for basic, sound principles. I might say he \nmade a big impression on me when he came to my office--I think on his \nown, but maybe he was appointed to do so--to help find a way to make \nthe Senate more relevant and to find ways to change the Senate rules to \naddress some of the frustration a lot of Senators have. People who are \nwatching may wonder, gosh, why do Senators think they are not relevant? \nI must say that a lot of Senators feel they want to get something done \nquickly and they are sometimes frustrated with the actions of another \nSenator who doesn't quite have the same idea. I was impressed with \nBob's attitude. He talked to me and asked, ``What can be done, Max? \nWhat ideas do you have?'' It was very refreshing. I remember thinking \nat the time that this will be difficult, and I told him it would be \ndifficult. I didn't tell him how difficult I thought it would be. But I \nwas impressed with his freshness and his desire to help adjust the \nSenate rules.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/13/senate-section/article/S8840-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nstaff be allowed on the floor for the duration of the debate on the tax \nbill: Michael Grant, Kane Ossorio, Jack McGillis, Nicole Marchman, \nManishi Rodrigo, Will Kellogg, Danielle Dellerson, Mary Baker, Greg \nSullivan, Andrew Fishburn, and James Baker.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, about 2 years ago, our economy was on the \nbrink. One of the first things we did with our new President was to \nenact the American Recovery and Investment Act. We did so to jump-start \nour economy, and we did so to create jobs.\n  In the 2 years since, our economy has created and sustained more than \n3.5 million jobs--3.5 million more than would have been available had \nwe not taken that action. The economy is now starting to move in the \nright direction, but we still have a long way to go.\n  The positive momentum in the economy is fragile. We need to work \ntirelessly to protect it. Our first priority must be to create more \njobs.\n  The lower tax rates enacted in 2001 and 2003, along with a number of \nother tax provisions, are set to expire at the end of this year. If we \ndo not act, taxes will go up.\n  In addition, last month, the emergency Federal unemployment insurance \nprograms expired. If we don't act, then by the end of next month 2 \nmillion Americans will be without the critical assistance they will \nneed. That is help they will need to put food on the table and keep a \nroof over their head. The tax cuts and unemployment insurance both have \na critical effect on the middle-class families, our economy, and on \njobs.\n  A little more than a week ago, the Senate voted on two amendments \nthat would have extended these tax cuts for the middle class and \nunemployment insurance. Our amendments would have\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\nfocused those extensions on the most effective ways to create jobs. The \namendments we voted on last Saturday would have given critical relief \nto middle-class families. They would have provided unemployment \ninsurance to millions of Americans who lost their jobs through no fault \nof their own. These two amendments--the Baucus amendment and the \nSchumer amendment--would have extended tax cuts that would have \nbenefited all taxpayers.\n  Those amendments would have extended critical tax cuts such as the \ncollege tuition tax deduction. They would have made the child tax \ncredit permanent, and they would have cut taxes for employers, freeing \nup cash for them to expand and hire new workers.\n  Those amendments focused on providing middle-class families the tax \nrelief they need. They focused on creating the jobs our economy needs, \nand they focused on getting the biggest bang for our buck in creating \nthose jobs.\n  Cutting taxes for middle-class families and extending unemployment \ninsurance stimulates our economy. They do so because the families who \nbenefit from those policies are the families most likely to spend that \nextra money. Spending that money injects it directly back into our \neconomy, and that helps the economy to grow and create jobs.\n  The best way to extend these expiring tax provisions is to focus on \nthe middle class. That is what my amendment did, and that remains my \nstrong preference.\n  There are some in this body, however, who want to extend tax breaks \nfor the wealthiest as well. These folks have held tax cuts for the \nmiddle class hostage to get these tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  Tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires are not the best way to \ncreate jobs. The Nation's wealthiest are more likely to save their \nmoney, rather than spend it and put it back into the economy.\n  Permanently extending tax cuts for the richest Americans would cost \nour economy $700 billion over the next 10 years. That is too great a \ncost for a budget already burdened by deficits and debt. But despite \nthis disagreement, creating jobs needs to be our first priority.\n  If we do not extend unemployment insurance, then by the end of the \nnext month, 2 million Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own would lose their unemployment benefits. If we allow those \nbenefits to expire, families who currently receive them would lose much \nof their income. Emergency unemployment insurance has benefitted about \n40 million people. That has included, I might add, 10\\1/2\\ million \nchildren.\n  Emergency unemployment benefits particularly help middle-class \nfamilies. Middle-class families receive 70 percent of total UI \nbenefits. These are folks with a work history. They lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own. Unemployment benefits are the only \nlifeline many workers in Montana and across the Nation have left in \nthis tough economy. These benefits support Americans who have worked, \nwho are looking for work, and who will work again.\n  If we do not extend unemployment insurance, we take some of the most \nstimulative dollars out of the economy. That will just hurt the \neconomy's ability to create jobs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice says unemployment benefits have one of the largest effects of \neconomic output in unemployment per dollar spent of any policy. The \nDepartment of Labor reports that for every $1 spent on unemployment \ninsurance, $2 are reinvested in the economy. The Council of Economic \nAdvisers estimates that as of September, emergency unemployment \ninsurance benefits have increased the level of employment by nearly \n800,000. That is just since September.\n  Unemployment insurance goes to people who will spend it immediately. \nThat increases economic demand. It is critical to extend unemployment \ninsurance to support a fragile economic recovery and to help create \njobs.\n  If we don't extend lower tax rates enacted in 2001 and 2003 and the \nother tax provisions expiring, at the present, the end of this year, \nmillions of middle-class families will pay higher taxes next year. \nMiddle-class families are the backbone of our economy and this \nrecession has hit middle-class families hardest. Too many middle-class \nfolks who have worked hard all their lives have been knocked off their \nfeet by this great recession. Too many middle-class families are still \nstruggling. If we don't act, individual taxes will go up. If we don't \nact, the child tax credit will shrink and the college tuition tax \ndeduction will end. So will the State and local property tax deduction \nand the property tax deduction itself and a host of other tax breaks \ncritical to middle-class families. Now is certainly not the time to \nraise taxes on middle-class families.\n  If we don't act, taxes will go up on employers. Taxes will go up on \nemployers engaged in critical research and development. That is R our \neconomy needs to stay competitive in the global market, to grow and to \ncreate jobs. If we don't act, taxes will go up on employers working to \ndevelop new types of sustainable energy resources, such as wind power. \nSustainable energy is the industry that could create hundreds of \nthousands of jobs. Now is not the time to raise taxes on employers with \npotential to create jobs we need.\n  So we must act, because if we fail to extend these critical \nprovisions, we place our economy at risk. If we fail to act, we place \nmiddle-class families at risk. So while I strongly prefer acting in a \nway that focuses more on the middle class, that focuses on getting more \njobs and gets us the biggest bang for our buck, inaction is clearly not \nan option. For that reason, I will support the bipartisan compromise \nthe President has proposed.\n  Plain and simple, this bipartisan compromise is about creating jobs, \nextending middle-class tax cuts will help create jobs. Not extending \nthem would cost jobs, and we cannot afford to lose jobs. Job creation \nneeds to be our No. 1 priority. Our economy has come a long way in the \nlast 2 years, but the growth is still fragile. Let us keep the focus on \ncreating jobs, let us keep moving our economy forward, let us pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think it is very clear the vote today \nwill result in a significant majority vote for the pending \nlegislation--the so-called tax extenders--and I will be one of those \nwho will be voting for it as well. But I must say, in the brief time I \nhave, there is almost an Orwellian experience on the floor of the \nSenate as compared with the rest of America. Here we are, about to pass \nthese necessary tax extenders--necessary to give some kind of certainty \nto businesses across America, small and large, and to give tax breaks \nto people in these most difficult times, including my home State of \nArizona. But rather than just extending the tax breaks, which is what a \nmajority of Americans want, we have engaged in the continuing \npractice--a practice that has alienated the majority of American \npeople--of loading up with unneeded, unnecessary, unwanted sweeteners \nin order to, I guess, get votes or satisfy special interests.\n  The Wall Street Journal, this morning, had an article entitled ``The \nHawkeye Handouts,'' stating the tax bill is becoming a ``favor \nfestival,'' starting with ethanol. It goes on to talk about the ethanol \nextension being the bipartisan handiwork of people who direct subsidies \nand trade protectionism plus mandates that force consumers to buy \nethanol. This is a trifecta of government support and for an industry \nthat is 30 years old and that even Al Gore now admits serves none of \nits advertised environmental purposes.\n  I would like to quote for my colleagues on this side of the aisle \nwhat the Wall Street Journal says:\n\n       The greater political risk is for Republicans, who should \n     worry that the tax bill is turning into a special interest \n     spectacle. The bill revives a $1 a gallon biodiesel tax \n     credit at a cost of nearly $2 billion, and there is $202 \n     million for ``incentives for alternate fuel,'' $331 million \n     for a 50 percent tax credit for maintaining railroad tracks, \n     and so on. These credits are a form of special interest \n     spending via the tax code, which is precisely the business-\n     as-usual behavior that Republicans told tea party voters they \n     wouldn't engage in. These business subsidies are grease for \n     Senate votes in favor of the deal, so the only chance to \n     remove them would be\n\n[[Page S8842]]\n\n     the kind of public outcry that attacked the Cornhusker \n     Kickback and other ObamaCare fiascoes. Call these ethanol \n     favors the Hawkeye Handouts.\n\n  That is what this bill is all about. I say to my colleagues, I will \nvote for it, but it is not what the people said they wanted done on \nNovember 2.\n  I understand that unless online gaming, poker playing, gambling \nlegalization comes up, we will probably go to an omnibus bill, and that \nomnibus bill will be loaded down with earmarks and porkbarrel spending, \nwhich is a direct--a direct--betrayal of the majority of the voters on \nNovember 2 who said stop the earmarking, stop the spending, stop the \noutrageous porkbarrel projects.\n  If this omnibus bill comes up loaded down with porkbarrel spending, \nwe owe it to the American people to stop it. What we owe the American \npeople is a clean continuing resolution, with no additional spending on \nit, that would be good for 45 days so the new Congress, in response to \nthe American people, will act in a responsible fashion.\n  This bill we are going to pass contributes to the debt and the \ndeficit, it contributes to the mortgaging of our children's futures. I \nsay to my colleagues, we should rise against any Omnibus appropriations \nbill, and we should only enact a continuing resolution. To my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle who may not have gotten the \nmessage of November 2, vote to have a clean continuing resolution. That \nis what the American people have said they want and that is what they \ndeserve. The American people deserve to be heard. Let us reconnect \nWashington and the American people.\n  I thank my colleague from Iowa for the time, and I yield whatever \nremaining time I have.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition \nto the bill in front of us today, and I wish to start out by saying \nthat, in addition to all the many challenges facing our Nation, a \nmassive budget deficit and a crippling debt may prove to be the most \ndifficult challenge we face as a country.\n  A deep structural defect, such as the one our government has \naccumulated because of these debt levels, not only threatens our long-\nterm economic stability, it darkens the horizon in a way that \ndiscourages the innovation investment we need to spur American jobs \ntoday.\n  Moreover, our apparent inability to squarely address the problem in a \nbipartisan way is a signal to the American people--as if they needed \nmore proof--that our democracy is not working, and that is as dangerous \nas any attack on our country. It is a timebomb in our midst, the \nticking of which we cannot ignore unless we are comfortable knowing it \nwill eventually and inevitably blow up on our children.\n  Just last week, a bipartisan group appointed by the President \nconfirmed the seriousness of a threat with a different metaphor but one \nequally apt. The President's fiscal commission called our national debt \na cancer that is threatening our country from within. Whether a \ntimebomb or a cancer, the threat is real, and the Commission confirmed \nit in the starkest possible terms.\n  The chairman's recommendations on how to respond were sobering. But \nin a way, they were also like a strong cup of coffee after a serious \ndrinking binge. Americans sat up and listened, and for a few days \nbetween the release of the Commission's report and the vote of the full \nCommission the following Friday, it looked like we might be able to set \naside the ideological differences that have poisoned our politics and \naddress this problem. It looked like we might be able to follow the old \nadage when you are in a hole, stop digging.\n  However, the next week, the President announced a plan that he \nnegotiated with Republican leaders to extend the Bush tax cuts across \nthe board--a plan that would add $900 billion to our national debt over \nthe next 2 years. What is staggering to me is, it took just 4 days to \nswitch the conversation from reducing the debt to adding to it. Just 4 \ndays after the most substantive conversation we have had about \naddressing the debt, we start arguing about the wisdom of extending tax \nbreaks for millionaires and billionaires that alone will cost $700 \nbillion over the next decade. That is $700 billion in additional debt \nthe people of the United States will owe to China and our other \ncreditors around the world. To paraphrase one of my colleagues, I feel \nlike we are operating in some kind of a parallel universe.\n  Now, as the debate over the last several days has exhibited, Senators \nin this body--and the American people themselves--have a diverse set of \nviews on tax policy and how to get our economy back on track.\n  Central to these questions about tax policy is how to find mechanisms \nthat will get our skyrocketing national deficit and total debt under \ncontrol. Despite disagreements--our disagreements here and in the other \nbody--I believe we owe it to the American people and to one another to \nbe pragmatic and truthful about the fiscal challenges confronting us. \nIt's the way that Coloradans like to operate, and I believe it's the \nway that most Americans want their elected official to behave. So I \nrespect and even applaud the President's efforts to reach a compromise \nbased on political pragmatism. But what I respectfully disagree with is \nthe notion this compromise is based on anything approaching fiscal \nreality or truth in accounting, which is the point I believe the \nchairmen of the President's fiscal commission--Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson--were making.\n  If I might, I would remind my colleagues of the history of the Bush \ntax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Those tax cuts were passed after \nwe experienced one of the strongest economic environments in our \nhistory. Those who supported tax cuts for the wealthy believed that \nbecause we had begun to reduce our long-term debt, we could afford \nthem. They believed those tax cuts would stimulate our economy further \nand create millions of new jobs. In the words of then-Vice President \nCheney, it was a time when ``deficits don't matter.''\n  I did not support the tax cuts for the wealthy in 2001 or 2003, for \nmuch the same reason I don't support them today. I voted against them \nas a Member of the House of Representatives. In fact, I'll remind this \nbody that the extension of the Bush tax cuts in 2003 was only possible \nbecause Republicans pushed them through on a reconciliation vote, which \nrequires only a simple majority. It took Vice President Cheney to break \nthe tie vote. I sincerely wish those tax cuts had effectively spurred \nsustained job growth. I do. But unfortunately, the next decade saw a \ndecline in our economy such as we haven't seen since the Great \nDepression--banks failed, foreclosures reached a crisis point, we were \nforced to bail out financial institutions, an insurance giant, and the \nauto companies to keep the economy from crashing further. During that \ntime, real income for average households decreased and the unemployment \nrate nearly doubled, as millions of workers were laid off.\n\n  If tax cuts for the wealthy among us were an efficient way to spur \ninnovation and investment, I have to believe economists would be \ntelling us to continue them. But here is what they are actually saying: \nEconomists of all stripes are telling us extending tax cuts for the \nwealthy is one of the least effective ways to create jobs and build the \neconomy. Even some of America's most successful businessmen, Bill Gates \nand Warren Buffett, among those who stand to gain dramatically from the \nbill before us, have urged us to prioritize seniors, long-term economic \ngrowth, and job creation instead. They know what recent history has \nshown--that tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires do not help our \neconomy, and it certainly doesn't help our national debt.\n  Just over 1 week ago I stood here with all of my colleagues and voted \nto support a proposal that would have followed the advice of \neconomists, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett and extended relief to \nmiddle-class families. Most importantly, that plan would have heeded \nthe overwhelming wishes of Coloradans--and Americans across our \ncountry, who do not believe it makes common sense to extend tax cuts \nfor the rich. Americans understand, maybe better than many of us in \nWashington, DC, that middle-class tax relief is the way to spur our \neconomy. To a family making $50,000 a year, an $800 tax cut could make \nthe difference between paying for daycare or health insurance or a \nsecond car so both parents could work.\n\n[[Page S8843]]\n\n  As more and more Americans become the first in their families to \nstand in an unemployment line, I find it hard to explain or justify \nlast week's filibuster preventing middle-class tax relief so \nmillionaires and billionaires can get an extra six-figure check from \nthe Federal Government.\n  We have heard all kinds of arguments for extending tax cuts for the \nwealthiest Americans, and we have been told this bill represents the \nbest deal we could get in order to bring further tax relief to middle-\nclass Americans. But, again, those arguments are based on political \npragmatism not a truthful or objectively measured analysis of the \nactual impact on our budget deficit. That is why the cochair of the \nPresident's deficit commission, Erskine Bowles, a university president \nwho knows the impact our budget crisis has had on our States, on \neducation, and on families, has spoken out against this irresponsible \ntax deal for wealthy Americans. He said:\n\n       I'm deeply disappointed that we have this short-term deal \n     and it's not linked to long-term fiscal restraint.\n\n  I think that hits the nail on the head.\n  I take no pleasure in opposing most of my colleagues today. I have \nlong held the view that by working together, we can bridge divides and \nfind solutions that are both pragmatic, collaborative and factually \nsound.\n  I regret that the bill before us speaks more to our failure as an \ninstitution than it does as an example of effective compromise. This \ndeal is about politics and a President backed into a terrible corner by \na looming deadline when this Congress must adjourn and a new one will \ntake its place.\n  The bill we are considering today is where the negotiations should \nhave started--not where they ended. We should be voting on a plan that \nwould allow us to extend tax relief for working families and put the \n$700 billion we would save over a decade toward our deficit, \nunemployment insurance, tax credits for low-income Americans, and other \nways to get our economy growing.\n  We should be voting on a plan--a compromise negotiated in good faith \nand based on the realities of our economy and not a date on the \ncalendar--whose economic and fiscal impacts can be verified.\n  That is what I wish had been negotiated. And I would prefer to stay \nhere in Washington, through the holidays if necessary, to work out a \nbetter deal for the Coloradans I represent, and for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely fear that the bad choices made in the last \ndecade will haunt us through the next decade. For these reasons, the \nlegislation before us today is a step too far, and that is why I oppose \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Tax Relief, \nUnemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act. I realize \nthat this legislation has stoked intense passions both among Members of \nthis body and the public at large, and I would like to take a few \nmoments to explain my thoughts regarding this legislation and my vote \nhere today.\n  I have served in this Chamber for nearly 30 years now. And during \nthat time, I have frequently been confronted with the extremely \ndifficult necessity of voting for legislation that, while deeply \nflawed, includes provisions that are incredibly important for the well-\nbeing of the American people. Today is no exception.\n  Indeed, to say that the tax legislation we are voting on today leaves \nmuch to be desired is a vast understatement. There is quite a bit about \nthis legislation that I find extremely objectionable.\n  By extending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, including the top \n3 percent in our country for 2 additional years, what we are ultimately \ndoing is driving our country deeper into debt with foreign creditors, \nforcing damaging funding cuts during already tight budgetary times, and \nincreasing the burden of paying for our excess on our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  This legislation would also create generous new parameters for the \nestate tax, raising the exemption level to $10 million for couples and \nreducing the top tax rate to 35 percent--providing millions of dollars \nin tax breaks to the 39,000 wealthiest Americans. Indeed, in my own \nState, it is likely that fewer than 100 estates will actually be \nsubject to any tax under the estate tax provision included in this \nbill.\n  And that is to say nothing of the fact that the agreement we are \nvoting on today fails to extend numerous successful programs included \nin the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, like the TANF emergency \ncontingency fund and the COBRA premium subsidy, or that the provisions \nthat will actually stimulate economic growth are only extended for a \nmere year.\n  But in spite of my strenuous objections to much of what is included \nin this bill, I believe it would be a grave mistake for us to defeat \nthis measure today. Because while it would be incredibly easy to simply \nvote against this legislation and head home, the truth is that what is \nat stake here is far more than my opposition to tax breaks for our \nNation's wealthiest families.\n  At the end of the day, this is about the well-being of the American \npeople, far too many of whom are hurting during this period of \ncontinued economic turmoil and uncertainty. In Connecticut, nearly 9.1 \npercent of the State's workforce--some 172,400 men and women--were out \nof work in October alone. And nationally, the numbers are even worse.\n  So, while there is much in this legislation that merits indignation, \nthe fact remains that there are many provisions that are far too \nimportant to all those Americans who have fallen on hard times over the \nlast several years to warrant its defeat.\n  Besides extending tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, this \nlegislation will also extend tax cuts for middle class families making \nunder $250,000 annually, putting additional cash in the pockets of \nworking Americans and their families.\n  This legislation will also extend and expand two critically important \ntax credits for lower income families for 2 additional years--the \n$1,000 child tax credit and the earned-income tax credit. Together, \nthese provisions will benefit millions of working families and their \nchildren at a time when they need these benefits the most.\n  And perhaps most importantly, this legislation renews Federal \nemergency unemployment insurance through the end of 2011, preventing \nnearly 7 million Americans who have lost their jobs in the current \nrecession--including nearly 80,000 in the State of Connecticut from \nprematurely losing their benefits next year as they look for work.\n  So, while my decision to vote in favor of this legislation today was \nincredibly difficult to make, I nevertheless believe it is the right \none. Simply put, while it is a difficult pill to swallow, the Tax \nRelief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act--\nthe Middle Class Tax Relief Act--represents the best chance we have \nright now to extend some critically important benefits for working \nfamilies in this country. These are the people who have been hit the \nhardest by the current recession, and as their representatives, I \nbelieve we owe it to them to provide some relief, even if it does come \nin the form of the flawed legislation before us today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe that before this Congress \nadjourns we must extend unemployment benefits that are so vital to the \neconomic survival of many American families and to our economic \nrecovery. I also believe we must ensure that working families are not \nhit with a tax increase that endangers our recovery. But the \nlegislation before us exacts a high price, and it should be amended to \naccomplish those goals without giving unwarranted benefits to the \nwealthiest Americans. Unfortunately, the procedure under which it is \nintended for us to consider it will apparently give us no opportunity \nto correct its shortcomings.\n  The tax cuts included in this bill, while they would benefit working \nfamilies, are too skewed toward the well-off, and would exacerbate a \ngrowing trend of income inequality in our country. Today, the \nwealthiest 1 percent of Americans receive about one-quarter of total \nU.S. income. Thirty years ago, they earned only about 10 percent of \ntotal U.S. income. Not only have incomes for the wealthiest sector of \nthe population continued to grow. Incomes for middle-class families \nhave been stagnant and have actually fallen when adjusted for \ninflation.\n\n[[Page S8844]]\n\n  This unconscionable inequality will only increase as a result of the \nestate tax provisions in the bill before us. The pending legislation \nwould exempt the first $5 million of estates from any tax, and tax \nremaining amounts at 35 percent. This is far more generous to the \nwealthy than the $3.5 million exemption and 45 percent tax that was law \nbefore this year. Just a few thousand Americans would benefit from this \ngenerous provision, but the cost to the treasury is huge.\n  Now, our Republican colleagues have argued that all of that \ninequality is a necessity, because only if we extend these enormous \nbenefits for our wealthiest citizens will our economy continue its \nrecovery. But, we know that this is not true. We know, in fact, that \ntax breaks for the wealthy have little impact on the economy as a \nwhole.\n  As independent experts from the Congressional Budget Office and \nCongressional Research Service, from the Federal Reserve and the \nNational Bureau of Economic Research, from academia and the private \nsector have all demonstrated, tax cuts for the wealthy do a great deal \nto add to their savings, but do not stimulate the economy. Economist \nMark Zandi, who has advised members of both parties, estimates that in \nterms of bang for the buck, extending the tax cuts expiring at the end \nof this year will boost the economy by just 29 cents for every dollar \nthey cost. Compare that to Mr. Zandi's estimate that we would get $1.64 \nworth of economic boost for every dollar of enhanced unemployment \nbenefits.\n  In fact, there are few people other than our Republican colleagues \nwho believe that tax cuts have a large positive effect on the economy. \nBruce Bartlett, a conservative economist, summed up what is nearly a \nconsensus view among economists this way:\n\n       The truth is that there is virtually no evidence in support \n     of the Bush tax cuts as an economic elixir. To the extent \n     that they had any positive effect on growth, it was very, \n     very modest. Their main effect was simply to reduce the \n     government's revenue, thereby increasing the budget deficit, \n     which all Republicans claim to abhor.\n\n  This legislation does include some very important measures that will \nhelp working American families, boost the economy and increase \nemployment. First among them is the extension of unemployment benefits, \nwhich, I remind my colleagues, does not provide additional weeks of \nbenefits beyond the current 99-week maximum, but does continue the \ncurrent emergency benefits that have helped millions of families. As I \nmentioned before, these benefits are a valuable tool in building the \neconomic recovery. As Congressional Budget Office Director Doug \nElmendorf has testified:\n\n       The largest effect on the economy per dollar of budgetary \n     cost would arise from a temporary increase in aid to the \n     unemployed.\n\n  But beyond the positive effect on the economy, extending these \nbenefits is the right thing to do. The Americans who depend on these \nbenefits to put food on the table and shelter overhead did not throw \nthe economy into crisis. They did not profit from the recklessness that \nbrought so much profit to so few. Helping the jobless is simply the \nright thing to do.\n  Indeed, it is outrageous that our Republican colleagues have insisted \nthat we can only help those in great need if we also provide enormous \nbenefits to the wealthiest among us. They hold hostage aid to those in \nneed unless we include tax cuts for those who have no such need. I know \nthere were some Republicans who objected when President Obama used this \nsame language in describing their position on this issue. I would say \nto them that if people do not want to be called hostage takers, they \nshould not take hostages.\n  And we cannot forget that the result of these tax cuts for the \nwealthiest among us is the addition of billions upon billions of \ndollars to the deficit. Our Republican colleagues, who have called so \nloudly for government to live within its means, seem to live in a world \nof magical accounting, where the impact on the deficit of tax cuts for \nthe well-off can be ignored. Over the next two years, the measures in \nthis legislation that Republicans have set as the price for tax cuts \nfor the middle class and aid to the jobless will add more than $100 \nbillion to the deficit. At a time when Washington is awash in deficit-\nreduction plans that would impose draconian cuts to important Federal \nprograms, we simply cannot afford to do that.\n  Now, there is a traditional solution to the problems with this bill. \nThat solution is debate and amendment. There is no reason why those of \nus who oppose portions of this legislation should not have the \nopportunity to air our objections, propose remedies to them and place \nthem before the Senate. But the procedure under which the Senate will \nconsider this bill will apparently not allow us to do so.\n  While the problems in this legislation are significant, the apparent \ninability for Senators to offer improvements amendments also affects my \nthinking on the cloture motion before us. Even an abbreviated amendment \nprocess would provide the chance to make the case for a more equitable \nbill. While efforts to amend the bill might not be successful, it is \nunacceptable to me that we would not even have the chance. Under those \ncircumstances, I cannot agree to this motion. If we defeat this cloture \nmotion, hopefully we would be able to take up a better bill and debate \nit. I believe we must fight harder and fight longer, to the end of \nDecember if necessary, for a bill that extends unemployment benefits \nand takes other steps that are essential to the hopes of working \nfamilies, a bill that is more fiscally prudent, a bill that does not \nextract the high price that this bill extracts.\n  If given the chance to address its flaws, I believe the Senate can \nproduce sounder legislation. I hope we will reject this motion for \ncloture so that we can consider legislation that provides tax relief to \nmiddle-income families and aid to those in need without handing \nbillions in unneeded and deficit-increasing benefits to the wealthiest \namong us.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the The Tax \nRelief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of \n2010, which will prevent tax increases on middle-class Americans, \nprovide targeted investments in American businesses, and continue much-\nneeded relief for the unemployed.\n  After wrestling with my concerns about upper-class tax rates and the \nestate tax provision, I have come to the conclusion that this bill is \nnecessary in order to preserve and promote our economic recovery.\n  Between the extension of tax rates for the middle class, the patch \nfor the alternative minimum tax, and several extensions of previous tax \npolicy, almost $500 billion goes toward preventing a substantial tax \nincrease on working Americans.\n  A tax increase on that scale would significantly hamper the economy \nand place further strain on families struggling to stay afloat during \nuncertain economic times.\n  The words spoken by former President Clinton last week underscore a \nstrong point made by a man who knows something about how to forge \nlegislation necessary to move our Nation forward.\n  He said:\n\n       The agreement taken as a whole is, I believe, the best \n     bipartisan agreement we can reach to help the largest number \n     of Americans, and to maximize the chances that the economic \n     recovery will accelerate and create more jobs . . .\n\n  That is what we must do: focus as much effort as possible on creating \njobs and supporting industry in the United States. We must adapt to the \nchanging contours of the global economy and ensure we retain our \ncompetitive position as the world's greatest economic power.\n  I was very pleased to hear that the Treasury grant provision was \nincluded in this package. It illustrates the kind of policy necessary \nto encourage the industries of the future.\n  The Treasury grant program is responsible for $18.2 billion in \nrenewable energy development in just the past 2 years. That is 1,465 \nprojects around the country.\n  With the program extended, California alone could see at least 141 \nmore projects break ground next year. That would mean an additional \n27,000 megawatts of energy and tens of thousands of jobs in high-\nunemployment counties.\n  High-tech companies in California and across the country will also \nbenefit from a 2-year extension of a key research-and-development tax \ncredit.\n  And the president of the National Association of Manufacturers called \nthis\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n\nprovision ``key to manufacturers' competitiveness and ability to create \njobs.''\n  In the end, that is the bottom line. Will the economy be \nsubstantially better off if this bill passes? If the answer is yes, \nthen there is simply no other option.\n  In the past few days I have spoken to a number of prominent \neconomists about what this bill would mean for our economic recovery. \nWith unemployment levels at 9.8 percent nationally and 12.4 percent in \nCalifornia, it is crucial that the economy start growing at a fast \nenough rate to create more jobs.\n  The consensus is that the provisions before us will immediately \nhasten the pace of the recovery, creating enough momentum to get us to \nthe point of self-sustaining economic growth.\n  However, we must follow this bill with measures that address tax \nreform in order to create a simplified system that addresses the \ninequalities that have become apparent over the last decade.\n  From 2003 to 2007, income for families in the top 5 percent of \ntaxpayers increased by 7 percent, while 95 percent of taxpayers' \nincomes remained stagnant.\n  The average income of the top 1 percent of earners increased by 10 \ntimes as much as that for the bottom 90 percent.\n  During the expansion of 2002 to 2007, families saw their medium \nincome drop by $2,000, the first time Americans have seen their incomes \ndrop during a period of economic growth.\n  In 2007, the top 10 percent took home almost half of the country's \ntotal earnings, the highest level of income inequality in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  Clearly, our current Tax Code does not work for most Americans. As we \nget back on our feet, we must shift our focus to economic policies that \npromote opportunity and allow for the continued pursuit of the American \ndream.\n  The point today is that we have two options. We can swallow our \ndistaste for a few of the provisions included in this package for the \nsake of struggling Americans everywhere.\n  Or we can take a big risk with the economic recovery by allowing tax \nrates to reset to 1990s levels. The people that would hurt the most are \nthe very same people we are trying to help.\n  I choose to do what is absolutely necessary for the benefit of the \nAmericans that need help most, and that is why I will support this \nbill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, while this proposal contains a number of \nprovisions I support, including an extension of desperately needed \nunemployment benefits as well as a 2-year extension of the middle-class \ntax cuts, it fails in at least one critical respect. Rather than \ninclude a combination of responsible spending cuts and revenue \nincreases to offset its projected cost of nearly $900 billion, the \nproposal instead just adds its cost to our already massive national \ndebt. This measure adds more to our national debt than either the \nstimulus bill, which I supported, or the Wall Street bailout, which I \nopposed. There may be good arguments to postpone fully paying for these \ntax cuts or, alternatively, for offsetting their cost over a number of \nyears to avoid undermining the fragile economic recovery. But, like the \nBaucus and Schumer proposals I opposed earlier this month, the measure \nbefore us fails to make even the most modest effort to pay for these \ntax cuts. Instead, it heaps $900 billion onto an already mountainous \nlevel of debt that we are asking our children and grandchildren to \nbear. And much of this money will go toward unjustified tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest Americans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time is on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 12\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this bill is about stopping the biggest \ntax increase in the history of the country that will happen if we do \nnot pass something between now and the end of the year. That happens \nbecause the 2001 tax law, the present tax policy, was only good for 10 \nyears, and it sunsets. So you go back to the big tax policy we had, the \nhigh tax policy we had in the year 2000.\n  We are passing this now because of a simple rule of economics: you \nshould not increase taxes during an economic recession. With nearly 10 \npercent unemployment, we are still, obviously, in a recession.\n  Some on the other side supported the President's earlier proposal \nwhen he wanted to maintain the existing tax policy just for those below \na $200,000-a-year income. The Senate did not support that proposal, and \nit is clear that proposal could not pass. I know that can be a \ndifficult thing. Over the years I have seen proposals I thought were \ngood and just and that I cared passionately about defeated in the \nSenate. But you just move on, so that is what our President has done. \nHe has moved on in a pragmatic spirit. He has put forward another \nproposal to prevent the biggest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry from happening. He doesn't view it as ideal, and few on my side \nof the aisle do as well.\n  For all of us, it is a balancing act. We want to stay true to our \nideals. We also want to deliver practical results to our constituents.\n  I submit this bill does not increase taxes, it does not cut anybody's \ntaxes, and that happens to be the right balance for the vast majority \nof us. But it also happens to be what is right for the economy now that \nwe are in a recession.\n  Just 10 days ago, the unemployment rate ticked up to 9.8 percent. In \nJuly it was at 9.5 percent. The trend is in the wrong direction. We are \nin a fragile situation. The economy is clearly telling Congress: handle \nwith extreme care. The majority of the economists surveyed by CNN Money \nsays preventing the 2011 tax hikes is the No. 1 thing that Congress can \ndo right now to help the economy. The survey results are on a chart, \nshowing that 60 percent of the economists said preventing tax hikes on \nevery American was the best course of action to take at this particular \ntime; that the economy is in a fragile situation.\n  We have the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office saying GDP growth \nwill be far less if we let the biggest tax increase in the history of \nthe country happen without Congress intervening. If the tax relief \ndoesn't maintain at the present level, the economy would grow .3 \npercent less than if we do it the way the President originally wanted \nto do it, just for those people under $200,000 a year income.\n  In other words, the economy will grow at 1.4 percent if we leave the \ntax policy of the last 10 years in place as opposed to taxing people \nwho make over $200,000 a year at a higher level. Then the economy would \nonly grow at 1.1 percent.\n  Given the recession, given the high unemployment rate, given \nbusiness's reluctance to invest and grow, we need to be especially \nsensitive to GDP growth. If it were just a matter of either the \ngovernment got the money or the private sector, that would be one \nthing, as the government does have a deficit problem. But in this case \nit is a matter of money simply not being there because of the hit to \nthe gross domestic product. We are talking about dead-weight loss.\n  For those who think taxing people more will bring in more revenue, I \nwould put up a chart that expresses tax policy and the result of it \nover the last 50 years. We can see the red line that says there is an \naverage of about 18.2 percent of all the wealth. We can see the red \nline shows for a 50-year average, about 18.2 percent of the gross \nnational product has come to the Congress to spend, regardless of what \nthe high marginal tax rates were--going back to 1993 and the Eisenhower \nadministration, going down to 70 in the Kennedy administration, going \ndown to 50 in the Reagan administration, going down to 26 in the Reagan \nadministration, back up 40--almost 40 percent in H.W. Bush's \nadministration, and then down to 35 percent where they are now. They \ncould go back up to 40 percent if we do not intervene right now.\n  What this ought to tell everybody is, marginal tax rates do not make \na difference, a big difference, in how much money comes into the \nFederal Treasury. The people of this country decided about how much \nthey are going to give to us in Congress to spend out of the entire \nnational income. It is about 18.2 percent regardless of where the \nmarginal tax rates are.\n  It tells me that people, if they do not want to work, if they do not \nwant to\n\n[[Page S8846]]\n\nearn or if they want to hire people to legally avoid taxes, are going \nto do it, and we are only going to get so much.\n  Here is what the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation says about \nthis:\n\n       We anticipate that taxpayers would respond to the increased \n     marginal rate by utilizing tax-planning and tax-avoidance \n     strategies that will decrease the amount of income subject to \n     taxation.\n\n  That chart proves exactly what the nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxes has said.\n  We have known about these looming tax hikes for a decade now. We \nshould have acted many years ago. Now we have only 19 days to go before \nthe tax hikes take effect. We are down to the wire, and we need to act. \nWe need to act because it is what it takes to turn this economy around. \nThe time to dither is over. The National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, the voice of small business, had this to say recently. \nBecause of no action on expiring tax rates there is a ``cloud of \nuncertainty, larger and darker. In response, consumer sentiment fell \nand owner optimism remained anchored solidly in recession territory. \nThus, spending stayed in `maintenance mode,' deterioration of jobs \ncontinues, and capital spending remains at historically low rates. \nOwners won't make spending commitments when sales prospects remain weak \nand important decisions such as tax rates and labor costs remain so \nuncertain.''\n  That is the end of the quote from small business.\n  Uncertainty is the issue we have to deal with here. Passing this bill \nso the biggest tax hike in the history of the country will not happen \nis one thing that will bring some certainty, and maybe more certainty \nthan anything else, to our economy.\n  The bottom line, as evidenced by this chart, is stop the tax hikes. \nIt is time to leave the tax policy of the last 10 years in place so at \nleast for the next 2 years people know they can hire and expand this \neconomy and expand theirs.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  How many minutes do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think, Mr. President, I am going to take 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes to address what the Senator from Arizona said about some of the \nprovisions in this bill. We keep having ethanol referred to as a \nsubsidy.\n  Let me tell you about some of the subsidies that are in this bill \nbecause you might think that ethanol is the only one. Think in terms of \nthe research and development tax credit. That is subsidy for big \nbusiness that has been around for 30 years. Think about the Indian \nemployment tax credit, the subsidy for new market tax credits, the \nsubsidy for railroad track maintenance credit, mine rescue team \ntraining credit, the subsidy for employer wage credit for employees who \nare on Active Duty in the uniformed services, the subsidy for 15-year \nstraight line cost recovery for qualified leaseholder improvements, the \nsubsidy for the 7-year recovery period for motor sports entertainment \ncomplexes.\n  I don't quite understand, when there are 72 provisions in this bill \nthat expired on December 31, 2009, and they are just being continued as \nsome of them have been for 30 years, how somebody today is going to say \nthat is bad tax policy and they did not say it over the last 30 years, \nparticularly when it comes to a time when we know we need a balanced \nalternative energy program--balanced for whatever can be alternative \nenergy because God only made so much fossil fuel. Obviously, we ought \nto be using petroleum. But should we import more petroleum from the 10 \npercent of the fuel used in motor vehicles coming from ethanol? Do you \nbelieve we ought to have a good national security program that is less \nbased upon the requirements of imported oil?\n  I think we ought to look at this balanced program as being one of \nfossil fuel, one of alternative energy, and one of conservation and \nethanol and biodiesel and wind and solar and all that is part of a \nbalanced program, and they all have tax incentives.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk \nwill report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n     4853, the Middle Class Tax Relief Act, with an amendment No. \n     4753.\n         Max Baucus, Joseph I.

Randy Smith, the longtime executive director of the \nLondon-Laurel County Chamber of Commerce, died on November 19, 2010, at \nthe age of 52 years old. For almost 17 years, Randy led the chamber and \nthe entire community toward a stronger, fast-growing future. More than \npromoting the local businesses in the area, Randy dedicated his \nprofessional life to advancing the untapped potential and unique \nsplendor of his community. He had the skills, personality, and \nintelligence to accomplish nearly everything he undertook--from \ncreating some of the best civic events and festivals in the \nCommonwealth, to building a stronger chamber membership at a time when \nmany small businesses are struggling.\n  There is no doubt that Randy's good humor will be deeply missed by \nall who knew him. But let there also be no doubt that Randy's record of \naccomplishment and legacy in Laurel County will never fade. The \ntenacity with which he fought his cancer for more than a year displayed \nthe same trademark character that I have seen in him during our \nfriendship of over a decade. No matter the issue, Randy Smith could be \ncounted on to handle the challenge with the utmost integrity.\n  It is with a saddened heart that I ask my colleagues to join me in \nremembering the life and accomplishments of one of the Commonwealth's \ntrue unsung heroes. I would further ask that my colleagues join me in \nexpressing our deepest sympathies to his wife Kim and their children \nLogan, Cameron, and Brianna. I would also like to share my sympathies \nwith Randy's parents, Earl and Rosie Smith, as well as his brothers and \nsister, Phil and Eddie Smith and Sharon Benge.\n  The Sentinel Echo recently published a story remembering the life of \nRandy Smith and I ask unanimous consent that the text of that article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                 [From the Sentinel Echo, Dec. 3, 2010]\n\n                  Randy Smith Loses Battle With Cancer\n\n                     (By Nita Johnson/Staff Writer)\n\n       Laurel County, Ky.--Long-time London-Laurel County Chamber \n     of Commerce Executive Director Randy Smith lost his battle \n     with cancer Friday morning, leaving a legacy of dedication to \n     his community.\n       Ironically, Smith died the day of the 2010 Christmas on \n     Main events--a celebration he was instrumental in starting in \n     1994, the first year he was named the Chamber's executive \n     director.\n       According to his brother Phil, Smith died just after noon \n     on Friday. He had been undergoing treatment for cancer at \n     M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in \n     Houston since Nov. 2.\n       ``There was a medical team there waiting for him to undergo \n     radiation three days after we got here,'' Phil Smith said. \n     ``The treatments were to be completed Nov. 18 and Randy did \n     OK. He was getting around on a walker, went outside and was \n     doing well.''\n       But on Nov. 17, things took a turn for the worse.\n       ``Randy had a lung biopsy on Nov. 17 and it was very \n     challenging to him physically,'' Phil added. ``We were going \n     to come home on Nov. 18, with our reservations to fly out at \n     2:20 p.m. Randy was ready to roll but around lunchtime he \n     started having some shortness of breath. By that afternoon he \n     was in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and diagnosed with \n     aspiration pneumonia. He was really struggling. He spent two \n     weeks and a day in ICU but his cancer was advanced and with \n     the pneumonia and becoming septic while in ICU, it was more \n     than his body could handle.''\n       Randy Smith's wife, Kim, children, parents, two brothers \n     and their families were with him on Friday. Most of them had \n     been there since Thanksgiving.\n       Randy Smith began having health complications in the spring \n     of 2009. In August 2009 he was diagnosed with lung cancer and \n     later on, with bone cancer. But his fighting spirit prevailed \n     throughout his illness--a trait that Phil Smith said enabled \n     his brother to fight the disease as long as he did.\n       ``Randy was a battler with his condition. He's always been \n     competitive and up for a challenge,'' Phil said. ``I guess he \n     saw the finish line God offered more rewarding than the \n     finish line here.''\n       His competitiveness is what many attribute to Smith's \n     success with the Chamber of Commerce, said Holbert Hodges, \n     who was president of the Chamber when Smith became a board \n     member.\n       ``I asked Randy to become a director and that's how he \n     became involved with the Chamber, as a board member/\n     director,'' Hodges said. ``He was the heart and soul of the \n     Chamber. He did a lot of things for this community and for \n     people, a lot that he didn't want people to know about. He \n     was dedicated, a hard worker, a good family man. When help \n     was needed, Randy was always the first in line. He had all \n     the traits necessary to represent the Chamber and was the \n     steadying force behind its success.''\n       Hodges said hearing of Smith's passing caused many memories \n     to surface.\n       ``I'm just sitting here having memories of Randy,'' Hodges \n     said from his office on Friday afternoon. ``We worked \n     together through many good and bad times and he was the \n     steadying force. His energy level amazed me. He's going to be \n     missed.''\n       Hodges said Smith was the driving force behind the annual \n     Christmas on Main celebration.\n       ``We wanted it to be more than just a parade and we came up \n     with the idea to set up bleachers in front of the courthouse \n     for choruses and choirs and to involve the schools and \n     churches,'' Hodges said. ``We wanted it so kids and \n     grandparents and parents and aunts and uncles could come out. \n     It was very successful.''\n       Under Smith's leadership, the Chamber of Commerce sponsored \n     many other events. The annual Red, White and Boom \n     Independence Day celebration was instituted under Smith's \n     helm at the Chamber. The annual Chamber banquet, which \n     honored a local teacher from the elementary, middle and high \n     school levels along with local business people, received \n     great acclaim.\n       The Chamber also sponsored job fairs, career fairs, and \n     most recently, the ``Women in Business'' awards. Though some \n     of those programs have changed or are now under management by \n     the Chamber's Ambassador Club and the London Downtown \n     organization, Smith was the man who pushed these events to \n     success.\n       Willie Sawyers, Sentinel-Echo publisher and Chamber of \n     Commerce board member, knew Smith since elementary school and \n     worked on various committees involved with the Chamber of \n     Commerce.\n       ``Randy and I are the same age. We went to school together, \n     played basketball for many years and served on the Chamber \n     together,'' Sawyers said. ``We had a lot of personal \n     conversations about dreams and goals for our community. I \n     will greatly miss those conversations with him.\n       ``Many of the good things happening right now in London and \n     Laurel County are directly attributable to Randy's dedication \n     and enthusiasm.''\n       This sentiment was seconded by London City Mayor Troy \n     Rudder, who tearfully praised Smith and his contributions to \n     the city and county.\n       ``We are extremely sad for the loss of Randy,'' Rudder \n     said. ``He has been very influential in the growth and \n     prosperity of this city. Randy was one who was always willing \n     to work or volunteer. When it came to this community, Randy \n     was always the first one in line.''\n       ``My heart goes out to his family and this city is deeply \n     saddened,'' he added.\n       Funeral arrangements are incomplete, and will be announced \n     later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/13/senate-section/article/S8847-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8847-S8848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE MEN'S SOCCER TEAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to honor the remarkable \naccomplishments of the University of Louisville men's soccer team. Led \nby their coach, Ken Lolla, these young student athletes made it to the \nchampionship game of the NCAA Division I tournament. In a close \ncompetition against the University of Akron they suffered their first \ndefeat by one goal as the score was one to zero. This team spent most \nof the season ranked number one over the rest of their opponents. \nBecoming NCAA men's soccer runners-up is an accomplishment that has \nbrought a lot of positive energy to the university as well as the \nentire city of Louisville. The team has made their university, city, \nCommonwealth and this Senator very proud. The Louisville Courier-\nJournal recently published an article describing the team's \naccomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\n         Near-Miss a Big Hit for University of Louisville, City\n\n                            (Eric Crawford)\n\n       The game had ended in a flurry of breathtaking near-misses \n     for the University of Louisville men's soccer team. Akron's \n     players now were filling the TV screens at Molly Malone's in \n     St. Matthews, celebrating their national title. Then the \n     applause started. Fans at other locations reported something \n     similar. The mood hardly matched the disappointment of the U \n     of L players as they flashed onto the screen following their \n     1-0 loss to Akron.\n       ``What a great season,'' said Silas Boyle, a former \n     Louisville Thunder player and the goalie for the 1975 \n     Kentucky Country Day state championship team. ``What a great \n     job they did. There's no way not to be proud.'' No, there \n     isn't. Not with Louisville sports bars turning their \n     attention to another kind of football on an NFL Sunday.\n       Snow fell outside the bar for most of No.1-ranked and \n     previously unbeaten U of L's loss, just as it did in the \n     final home game. As the game clock wound down, you could see \n     out the windows the wet reflection of traffic and \n     streetlights in the middle of a busy holiday scene.\n       It was a nice reminder that while the experience of a \n     national championship game is something that coaches and \n     players earn, for fans and program and city, it is a gift. \n     It's a gift U of L teams have given twice in the past three \n     seasons.\n       And as with the run to the national title game in women's \n     basketball in 2009, this soccer run was designed by a coach \n     who's hard not to respect, one who manages to coach the team \n     without becoming its focal point.\n       David Horne, player and general manager for the Louisville \n     Lightning professional team, said U of L coach Ken Lolla's \n     reach extends far beyond his program, that he has quietly \n     become a mentor for local coaches--``I read every book he \n     mentions,'' Horne said--and a resource for players and clubs.\n       ``To me, he could become a [John] Wooden-like influence,'' \n     Horne said. ``I know that's a big name, but that's how he \n     carries himself and how he coaches. He's going to keep \n     winning, and he does it the right way.''\n       Akron, after controlling possession in the first half, \n     exerted itself still more in the second. By the time the Zips \n     scored in the 79th minute, U of L keeper Andre Bordeaux \n     already had put together a highlight reel of saves.\n       Still, the Cardinals had some golden opportunities in the \n     end, the last when two-time last-minute hero Aaron Horton's \n     strike into a goal whose keeper had strayed was deflected on \n     the ground by a defender's leg.\n       Another foot or two higher, and the score would've been \n     tied. But after Horton's last-minute game-winners in back-to-\n     back NCAA games, how much magic does one player's foot \n     possess?\n       Instead, U of L comes home with a runner-up trophy and a \n     new profile in college soccer. If you know athletic director \n     Tom Jurich, you can go ahead and put a soccer facility \n     expansion or enhancement on the stopwatch.\n       For soccer in Louisville, there's added energy--and perhaps \n     some momentum in building the kind of much-needed soccer \n     complex that a city this size already should have, one that \n     would keep local clubs from having to travel to Bowling Green \n     and other places for big tournaments.\n       For U of L, it's another NCAA championship chance in a \n     sport that not long ago wasn't anywhere on the national \n     landscape. ``You just have to believe it's only the beginning \n     for that program,'' Horne said as fans headed home Sunday \n     night. ``It's a really exciting thing for the sport in this \n     city.''\n       It's pretty rare around here for another kind of round ball \n     to grab any part of the spotlight in December. For the local \n     sports scene, it was a holiday gift. For Lolla and the \n     Cardinals, the goal is to make it a holiday tradition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/13/senate-section/article/S8848-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8848-S8849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NOTICE OF INTENT\n\n  Mr. DeMINT.

the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNSUSTAINABLE FISCAL PATH\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, since I joined the Senate almost 12 \nyears ago, I have worked to ensure that Congress deals with our \ncountry's unsustainable national debt and budgets that are not balanced \nas far as the eye can see; to do this, we must undertake tax, \nentitlement and spending reform. As most of my colleagues know, since \n2006, I worked conscientiously to create a commission that would \nundertake this task. My partner in the House was Congressman Frank \nWolf, and we introduced legislation we called Saving America's Future \nEconomy, SAFE, which got 118 House co-sponsors. In the 111th Congress, \nJoe Lieberman and I introduced the Senate bill and were gathering co-\nsponsors, then later combined our efforts with Senators Conrad and \nGregg, chair and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, to \nintroduce a similar debt and deficit commission bill, which eventually \ndid receive a vote in the Senate.\n  The Conrad-Gregg bill stipulated that if its commission's \nrecommendations were supported by 14 of its 18 members, it would be \nfast-tracked for an up-or-down vote in both the House and Senate. One \nof my biggest disappointments in the Senate is that the Conrad-Gregg \nbill failed. I believe the reasons for that failure are already known \nby my colleagues, so I won't revisit that vote. And in any event, as I \nlook back, even if it had passed the Senate, I am not so sure it would \nhave passed the House because many in the Democratic leadership opposed \nit. Thankfully, sometimes there is good that blows in an ill-wind, and \nthe President created his own debt commission by Executive Order with \npromises from Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid that they would \nallow a vote in Congress if 14 of the 18 commissioners supported this \ncommission's recommendations.\n  As you know, the President's commission, chaired by Alan Simpson and \nErskine Bowles, recently released its final report. I am supportive of \nthe commission's proposal, understanding that there would have been a \ntremendous amount of negotiation if the report they released had been \nadopted and sent to Congress.\n  I am encouraged by the fact that 11 of 18 panelists endorsed the \nreport, including my Senate colleagues Tom Coburn, Mike Crapo, Judd \nGregg, Kent Conrad and Dick Durbin. As far as I am concerned, they and \nthe other commission members who voted in favor of the proposal are \ntrue patriots who had the courage to do what is right for our country, \nand for the future of our children and grandchildren.\n  As my colleague Tom Coburn said just before the commission's vote, \n``The time for action is now. We can't afford to wait until the next \nelection to begin this process. Long before the skyrocketing cost of \nentitlements cause our national debt to triple and tax rates to double, \nour economy may collapse under the weight of this burden. We are \nalready near a precipice. In the near future, we could experience a \ncollapse in the value of the dollar, hyperinflation or other \nconsequences that would force Congress to face a set of choices far \nmore painful than those proposed in this plan.'' Fast-tracking the \ncommission's proposal for a vote during this lame-duck session would \nhave shown Americans and the world that the Federal Government is, in \nfact, deeply concerned about the direction we are headed and is not \noblivious.\n  The thing that is of grave concern to me is that in spite of the \ncommission's hard work, it may be for naught. I think back to the Mack-\nBreaux Tax Overhaul Commission that President Bush created at my \nurging. I was pleased to see that many of their recommendations were \nincorporated by the President's current commission, and I urge my \ncolleagues to look at the executive summary of the Mack-Breaux \ncommission that was given to President Bush in 2005.\n  Frankly, I thought President Bush would review, tweak, and then send \nthe Mack-Breaux recommendations to Congress. Unfortunately--and I have \na great deal of respect for our former President--Congress never \nreceived a Presidential tax reform package for its consideration. I am \nanxious to read his book to see if he explains why he didn't do so. It \nwas a missed opportunity for his administration, but more importantly \nit was a missed opportunity for the country. In my opinion, we would \nnot be in the predicament we find ourselves in now had we addressed \nthese issues in 2005 or 2006.\n  And so, here we are in a situation where we are on an unsustainable \nfiscal course caused by explosive and unchecked growth in spending and \nentitlement obligations without adequate funding. We have got an \noutdated tax code that does not sufficiently encourage saving and \neconomic growth, and a skyrocketing national debt that puts our credit-\nrating in serious jeopardy and should give all of us great pause.\n  I believe that the American people get it. They recognize that our \nfiscal situation is in the intensive care unit--on life support.\n  When speaking, I always ask the audience two questions: First, ``Is \nyour standard of living better than that of your parents?'' They answer \nyes. The second is, ``Do you believe your children's standard of living \nwill be better than yours?'' The overwhelming answer is no. Sometimes, \nI also ask whether they think they will see their Social Security when \nthey retire. Almost no one raises their hand, unless they have grey \nhair like me.\n  In all of my 74 years I have never seen such fear, uncertainty, and \nconcern about the future. I would also point out that it is not only \nthe American people who think we are oblivious to the looming fiscal \ncrisis; just ask the Europeans, the Chinese, and others\n\n[[Page S8850]]\n\naround the globe who fund our spending addiction. Many Americans don't \nrealize that foreign governments hold nearly 50 percent of our public \ndebt, and we are going to ask them to keep on purchasing more. \nMoreover, many have failed to realize just how bad this spending \naddiction has gotten. I remember speaking at the Brussels Forum last \nyear, and the Europeans were asking us for more money for NATO. When I \npointed out to them that we were borrowing 41 cents for every dollar we \nspend, a hush fell over the room.\n  It is time for us to do what needs to be done to fix our country's \nlooming fiscal crisis. So I would like to say to my colleagues that \nwhen we vote on the Obama bipartisan tax fix, my vote will be NO. I'm \nnot for any of the compromises. I am not for borrowing another $800 \nbillion dollars from China, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. To the \ncontrary, I agree with David Walker, former Comptroller of the GAO and \nformer President and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, who said, \n``This `deal' is not reasonable from an economic, fiscal and social \nequity perspective. The compromise evidently was `you give me my tax-\ncut extensions and more tax cuts, and I'll give you your spending \nincreases.' The result is a bigger bill for our kids, grandkids and \nfuture generations of Americans. It's time for Washington to wake up \nand start dealing with our structural deficits.'' Maya MacGuineas, \npresident of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, had even \nstronger words: ``This feels more than a bit surreal. On the heels of \nthe work of the White House Fiscal Commission last week on how to get \ncontrol of the national debt, the White House and Members of Congress \nchoose to engage in a negotiation that involves adding increasingly \nlarger amounts to the debt? It's utterly exasperating.''\n  Madam President, I feel the exact same way. It's time to stop kicking \nthe can down the road and let these tax provisions expire and, as a \nresult, force Congress and the President to make the tough choices \nabout not only these taxes, but the entire tax and entitlement crisis \nfacing our country. Perhaps then we would have enough anger from our \nconstituents that we would act to reform a tax system that is far too \ncomplicated and does not encourage the growth we need. I would like to \nremind my colleagues that since 1986, there have been over 15,000 \nchanges to the Internal Revenue Code and it costs all of us $240 \nbillion each year to prepare our tax returns. Think of it. If we could \nsimplify the code and make it cheaper to comply even by 50 percent each \nyear, we would save the American taxpayers $120 billion.\n  If these expiring cuts are not extended, you can count on it that \neveryone will take an interest in seeing that we finally deal with a \nbroken tax and entitlement system. Then, perhaps, we will finally get \nthe reforms that will get the floundering ship that is our country back \non even keel. It will restore people's faith in the future of America \nas well as give comfort to the rest of the world--especially our \ncreditors--that we are on the path to fiscal responsibility. It's time \nfor us to face up to what needs to be done.\n  I will not, after working my butt off from the day I got here to \naddress a broken tax and entitlement system, have one of my final votes \nas a U.S. Senator be to kick the can down the road by extending these \ntax provisions and assuming that our fiscal ills will be taken care of \nnext year. Because, you know what, if the history of our recent \nCongress is any indication of what will happen, nothing will get done.\n  Just a few weeks ago, when the President's commission released its \nreport, we started to gain momentum towards these long-overdue reforms. \nWe need to take advantage of that momentum. I feel like we are coming \nto the last mile in a marathon, and rather than push through to the \nend, we are about to turn around and go back.\n  My 45-year experience in government has been that in the absence of a \ncrisis, the tough, but necessary, measures that need to be taken are \nnot taken. If the tax cuts and other provisions expire, you can count \non it that everyone will take an interest in seeing that we finally all \ncome to the table to work to address these fundamental issues. It will \nrestore people's faith in the future of America as well as give comfort \nthat we, our country's leaders, understand the need to put our country \non a path to fiscal responsibility.\n  I have a modest proposal. The President should reconvene the same \ngroup of individuals that worked on the Bowles-Simpson commission and \ninsist that they continue their dialogue and put a package together \nthat the President can submit to the 112th Congress as soon as \npossible.\n  By the way, where is the President's leadership? The New York Times \nreported that the Obama administration is considering comprehensive \nreforms, but other reports indicate that, once again, it's more talk \nwithout action because no working groups are in the works, no \nExecutive-Congressional meetings have been scheduled. The President \nneeds to get his key folks back to the table with Congress to see if \nthey can't come up with some sort of compromise based on the best \ncommonsense, reasonable, and fiscally responsible proposals that we've \nheard from his Commission.\n  And so, to my friends that will remain in the Senate for the 112th \nCongress, and to those that will be new to this body, God bless you. \nYou have the future of our Nation and the future of my children and \ngrandchildren in your hands.\n  During my time in office, I have tried my best. I have tried my very \nbest. I am pleased with some of the progress that we've made, but \nbelieve-you-me, for someone who's been in government service for 45 \nyears, as I have already said, nothing happens unless you have a \ncrisis. So that's what we need. A crisis that says now is the time to \ndeal with tax and entitlement reform; now is the time to deal with \nbudget reform; now is the time to curb our spending addiction and \ngrowing national debt; now is the time to balance our budgets.\n  Madam President, I pray that the Holy Spirit will inspire my \ncolleagues to make the right decisions for our country's future. I pray \nthat the results between now and the end of the year will not be \nanother ``kick the can down the road-we'll take care of it later,'' \nscenario. Madam President, my time in public office has run out, and \nfrom my perspective, so has the country's. Our national debt is one of \nthe most important problems we face. Our failure to begin to address \nthis fiscal crisis now will damage our economy, our national and \ndomestic security, and the kind of future we leave to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/13/senate-section/article/S8850-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8850-S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF DARRELL BELL\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of \nPresident Obama's nominee Darrell Bell for U.S. Marshal for the \nDistrict of Montana, and I call on my colleagues to support his \nconfirmation. As the former police chief for the City of Billings--\nMontana's largest community--Darrell possesses the qualities necessary \nto lead Montana's U.S Marshal's Office. For the last 3\\1/2\\ decades, \nDarrell has served Montana's law enforcement community with passion and \nexpertise. Since 2006, Darrell has served as a criminal investigator \nfor the Montana Department of Justice, Gambling Control Division.\n  Darrell served over 30 years with the Billings Police Department, \nincluding 5 as the Deputy Chief of Police. Originally from Joliet, \nDarrell graduated from the Montana Law Enforcement Academy and began \nhis career with the Billings Police Department as a patrolman in 1974. \nWorking his way up the ranks, Darrell has served as a sergeant and then \nlieutenant of Operations Division as well as captain for the \nInvestigations, Training, and Support Services Division. Upon the \nrequest of Billings city administrator in 2005, then-Deputy Chief of \nPolice Bell stepped in to become the Interim Chief of Police. Darrell \nhas served Montana and his community on the executive boards for high-\nintensity drug trafficking areas and the Montana chiefs of police.\n  Darrell has a proven track record of bringing folks together, working \nwith local, State, and Federal law enforcement officials to provide a \nsafe environment for Montana's communities. Darrell's experience and \nleadership in law enforcement will truly be an asset for Montana's U.S. \nMarshal's Office. Mr. President, I congratulate Darrell on his \nnomination, in recognition of his continued service to the State of \nMontana, and I urge the Senate to confirm Darrell Bell's nomination.\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/13/senate-section/article/S8851-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY MAUGHAN\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, as I leave the Senate, I want to \nrecognize one staffer in particular, Ms. Mary Maughan. Mary has served \nfor 18 years on my Utah staff. Mary also worked with me on my first \ncampaign for the Senate in 1992. She was the second I person hired on \nthat campaign and has been a loyal and trusted advisor ever since.\n  Mary brought to my office vast experience, which provided a solid \nfoundation for her service on my staff during my time in the Senate. \nShe was raised in a military family as an Air Force ``brat'' and \nconsequently built a deep understanding of military culture and \noperations. Later, as a Foreign Service officer with the Department of \nState, she spent 18 months in Vietnam during the war and expanded her \npersonal experience and expertise while working in civilian and \nmilitary-support offices at both provincial and regional levels. She \nadded to her resume with further experience in Washington, where she \nfocused on Middle Eastern issues as the Iraqi desk officer at the \nDepartment of State. She also did temporary duty working on Israeli \naffairs at the Department of Commerce. Embassy duty in Europe and \nprofessional and personal travel in significant and volatile areas of \nthe world helped expand her international credentials.\n  Mary put these credentials to work as part of my Senate staff. She \nspecialize in military and veterans affairs, Department of State and \nother international issues, as well as homeland security, Department of \nJustice, and other related programs. Her expertise and fine performance \neventually helped her to advance to the position of senior adviser.\n  I thank Mary for her tireless dedication to the people of Utah and \nher loyalty and honorable service as a member of my staff for almost \ntwo decades. It is with sincere appreciation and gratitude that I \ncongratulate her on her retirement. I look forward to continuing our \nassociation in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/13/senate-section/article/S8851-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IOWA CITY WEST HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to congratulate the \nstudents from Iowa City West High School who will participate in the We \nthe People: The Citizen and the Constitution national finals in \nWashington, DC. More than 1,200 students from across the United States \nwill visit Washington, DC to take part in the national finals of We the \nPeople: The Citizen and the Constitution, the most extensive \neducational program in the country developed specifically to educate \nyoung people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. The We the \nPeople program run by the Center for Civic Education, with the help of \nFederal funding, provides an outstanding curriculum that promotes civic \ncompetence and responsibility among elementary and secondary students.\n  I am proud to announce that the students from Iowa City West High \nSchool, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won the State \ncompetition and thus were given the distinction of representing Iowa in \nthe national finals.\n  While in Washington, the students will participate in a three-day \nacademic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which \nthey ``testify'' before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their \nknowledge and understanding of constitutional principles and have \nopportunities to evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant \nhistorical and contemporary issues. In the end, students take away a \nsolid understanding of the origin of American constitutional democracy \nas well as the contemporary relevance of our founding documents and \nideals. In short, it produces better citizens.\n  I would like to personally recognize the Iowa City West students who \nare on the team that will represent Iowa in the national finals, Guo \nChen, Jinny Guo, Yelena Shabelnik, John Alatalo, Cole Anderson, Bennett \nMueller, Rebecca Wen, Elizabeth Wang, Evan Davis, Eleanor Marshall, \nMargaret Shultz, Katherine Yang, Trevor Clinkenbeard, Mark Mellecker, \nBrad Ockenfels, Ray Ockenfels, Nik Hlebotwitsh, Sara McAndrew, Jessica \nSheldon, Asya Bergal, Joe Henderson, Hilah Kohen, Jacob Larson, \nElizabeth Vandenberg, and teacher Gary Neuzil.\n  I wish these students the best of luck at the We the People national \nfinals and applaud their outstanding achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/13/senate-section/article/S8851-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                COLORADO KIDS' MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. BENNET. Madam President, today I wish to honor two young \nheroes from Colorado, who will receive the organization 9-1-1 for Kids' \nMedal of Honor this week. The medal is bestowed on a young person who \ndistinguishes himself or herself by calling 9-1-1 in an emergency and \nhelps save someone's life or report a crime. An award is also presented \nto the dispatcher who processed the call and provided the appropriate \nemergency response.\n  Earlier this year, Nathan Averhoff, a third grader at Leroy Drive \nElementary School in Northglenn, and Abigail Vicioso, a third grader at \nSkyview Elementary School in Thornton, both found themselves in a \ndifficult situation involving one of their parents.\n  Nathan, who is 9 years old, called the Thornton Communication Center \non April 23 when his mom began having a seizure. Dispatcher Edward \nCoddington answered Nathan's call and stayed on the phone with him for \n6 minutes as Nathan provided updates on his mom's condition. Nathan \nremained calm and said his dad had told him what to do in case of a \nmedical emergency. Once the seizure began to subside, Nathan held his \nmom's head to avoid further injury. His quick actions meant that there \nwas no delay in seeking medical attention for his mom.\n  On September 8, 9-year-old Abby called 9-1-1 on her cell phone when \nshe found her mother on the bathroom floor, dizzy, weak and vomiting. \nDispatcher Karen Salazar of the city of Thornton 9-1-1 Dispatch Center \nanswered her call. Although Abby was scared and worried about her mom, \nshe answered Karen's questions clearly and calmly, enabling Karen to \nget the proper emergency assistance to Abby's mom, who was eventually \ntransported to a local hospital.\n  Both of these kids knew exactly what to do. They didn't panic, and \nthey made sure their moms got the care they needed. They and the \ndispatchers who helped them serve as a great example of how important \nit is for kids to know what to do when trouble arises.\n  The organization 9-1-1 for Kids has made it its mission to ensure \nthat kids of all ages understand the importance and proper use of 9-1-\n1. It does so by raising awareness through conferences, media outreach, \ntraining activities, school events, and by highlighting the stories of \nkids like Nathan and Abby.\n  I join all Coloradans in offering our gratitude to dispatchers Edward \nCoddington and Karen Salazar for their service to their communities and \ncongratulate Nathan and Abby for this award as well as their bravery \nand calm in the face of an emergency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/13/senate-section/article/S8851-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO McKENZIE HALEY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medicare program loses an estimated $60,000,000,000 \n     annually to wasted and fraudulent payments.\n       (2) The Medicaid program also suffers from rampant fraud. \n     As the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services noted in 2009, in an analysis of \n     the only source of nationwide Medicaid claims and beneficiary \n     eligibility information, the Medicaid Statistical Information \n     System, the Federal Government does not have ``timely, \n     accurate, or comprehensive information for fraud, waste, and \n     abuse detection'' in the Medicaid program.\n       (3) Absent comprehensive estimates, the Medicaid program's \n     improper payment rate may be the most objective measure of \n     taxpayer dollars lost to fraud. The national average improper \n     payment rate ranges between 8.7 percent and 10.5 percent, but \n     many States have much higher improper payment rates.\n       (4) The new Federal health reform law substantially expands \n     the Medicaid program, significantly changes the Medicare \n     program, creates new mandates and regulations, and will send \n     hundreds of billions of dollars to insurance companies.\n       (5) It is the duty of public officials and public servants \n     in Congress and the Administration to protect the American \n     public's taxpayer dollars. Congress and the Administration \n     must continue to aggressively combat waste, fraud, and abuse \n     in public health care programs.\n       (6) The Inspector General of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services has stated that ``swift and effective \n     detection of and response to waste, fraud, and abuse remain \n     an essential program integrity strategy''. Furthermore, the \n     Inspector General noted that ``effective use of Medicare and \n     Medicaid data is critical to the success of the Government's \n     efforts to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse''.\n       (7) The loss of taxpayer dollars due to waste and fraud \n     under the Medicare and Medicaid programs not only threatens \n     the financial viability of those programs, it erodes the \n     public trust. American taxpayers should not be expected to \n     tolerate rampant waste, fraud, and abuse in publicly funded \n     health care programs.\n       (8) Congress supports the commitment of the Office of the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services to ``enhancing existing data analysis and mining \n     capabilities and employing advanced techniques such as \n     predictive analytics and social network analysis, to counter \n     new and existing fraud schemes''.\n       (9) Congress supports the use of predictive modeling and \n     other smart technologies that can transform the current ``pay \n     and chase''\n\n[[Page S8865]]\n\n     payment cultures under the Medicare and Medicaid programs and \n     prevent taxpayer dollars from being lost to waste, fraud, and \n     abuse.\n\n     SEC. 961.

A qualified airline \n     employee making such a transfer may exclude from gross income \n     the airline payment amount previously rolled over to the Roth \n     IRA, to the extent an amount attributable to the previous \n     rollover was transferred to a traditional IRA, in the taxable \n     year in which the airline payment amount was paid to the \n     qualified airline employee by the commercial passenger \n     airline carrier.\n\n[[Page S8870]]\n\n       (3) Extension of time to file claim for refund.--A \n     qualified airline employee who excludes an amount from gross \n     income in a prior taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) may \n     reflect such exclusion in a claim for refund filed within the \n     period of limitation under section 6511(a) (or, if later, \n     April 15, 2011).\n       (b) Treatment of Airline Payment Amounts and Transfers for \n     Employment Taxes.--For purposes of chapter 21 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 and section 209 of the Social Security \n     Act, an airline payment amount shall not fail to be treated \n     as a payment of wages by the commercial passenger airline \n     carrier to the qualified airline employee in the taxable year \n     of payment because such amount is excluded from the qualified \n     airline employee's gross income under subsection (a).\n       (c) Definitions and Special Rules.--For purposes of this \n     section--\n       (1) Airline payment amount.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``airline payment amount'' means \n     any payment of any money or other property which is payable \n     by a commercial passenger airline carrier to a qualified \n     airline employee--\n       (i) under the approval of an order of a Federal bankruptcy \n     court in a case filed after September 11, 2001, and before \n     January 1, 2007, and\n       (ii) in respect of the qualified airline employee's \n     interest in a bankruptcy claim against the carrier, any note \n     of the carrier (or amount paid in lieu of a note being \n     issued), or any other fixed obligation of the carrier to pay \n     a lump sum amount.\n\n     The amount of such payment shall be determined without regard \n     to any requirement to deduct and withhold tax from such \n     payment under sections 3102(a) and 3402(a).\n       (B) Exception.--An airline payment amount shall not include \n     any amount payable on the basis of the carrier's future \n     earnings or profits.\n       (2) Qualified airline employee.--The term ``qualified \n     airline employee'' means an employee or former employee of a \n     commercial passenger airline carrier who was a participant in \n     a defined benefit plan maintained by the carrier which--\n       (A) is a plan described in section 401(a) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 which includes a trust exempt from tax \n     under section 501(a) of such Code, and\n       (B) was terminated or became subject to the restrictions \n     contained in paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 402(b) of the \n     Pension Protection Act of 2006.\n       (3) Traditional ira.--The term ``traditional IRA'' means an \n     individual retirement plan (as defined in section 7701(a)(37) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) which is not a Roth \n     IRA.\n       (4) Roth ira.--The term ``Roth IRA'' has the meaning given \n     such term by section 408A(b) of such Code.\n       (d) Surviving Spouse.--If a qualified airline employee died \n     after receiving an airline payment amount, or if an airline \n     payment amount was paid to the surviving spouse of a \n     qualified airline employee in respect of the qualified \n     airline employee, the surviving spouse of the qualified \n     airline employee may take all actions permitted under section \n     125 of the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, \n     or under this section, to the same extent that the qualified \n     airline employee could have done had the qualified airline \n     employee survived.\n       (e) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to transfers \n     made after the date of the enactment of this Act with respect \n     to airline payment amounts paid before, on, or after such \n     date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4771.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, \n     the current condition of the infrastructure in the United \n     States earns a grade point average of D, and an estimated \n     $2,200,000,000,000 investment is needed over the next 5 years \n     to meet adequate conditions.\n       (2) According to the National Surface Transportation Policy \n     and Revenue Study Commission, $225,000,000,000 is needed \n     annually from all sources for the next 50 years to upgrade \n     our surface transportation system to a state of good repair \n     and create a more advanced system.\n       (3) According to the Federal Highway Administration up to \n     $131,700,000,000 must be invested annually for a 20-year \n     period to improve bridge efficiencies and the physical \n     condition and operational performance of the highway system \n     of the United States.\n\n[[Page S8897]]\n\n       (4) According to the Federal Transit Administration, up to \n     $21,800,000,000 must be invested annually for a 20-year \n     period to improve conditions and performance of the major \n     transit systems of the United States.\n       (5) The Environmental Protection Agency projects that--\n       (A) $183,600,000,000 is needed for installation and \n     maintenance of drinking water transmission and distribution \n     systems through 2022; and\n       (B) $202,500,000,000 is needed for publicly owned \n     wastewater systems-related infrastructure needs through 2024.\n       (6) According to the Edison Electric Institute, to maintain \n     current levels of service given expected growth in demand, \n     electric utilities need to invest an annual average of--\n       (A) $28,000,000,000 for generation;\n       (B) $12,000,000,000 for transmission; and\n       (C) $34,000,000,000 for distribution of electricity.\n       (7) According to the American Council on Renewable Energy, \n     renewable energy could provide up to 635 gigawatts of new \n     electricity generating capacity by 2025--a substantial \n     contribution and potentially more than the Nation's need for \n     new capacity, according to the United States Energy \n     Information Administration.\n       (8) According to the United States Green Building Council, \n     United States buildings account for 38.9 percent of primary \n     energy use, 38 percent of carbon emissions, and 72 percent of \n     electricity consumption.\n       (9) There are over 1,200,000 units of public housing \n     nationwide, with an accumulated capital needs backlog of \n     approximately $18,000,000,000, with an additional \n     $2,000,000,000 accruing each year.\n       (10) According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation \n     and Development (OECD), the United States ranks 15th among \n     OECD nations in broadband access per 100 inhabitants.\n       (11) Although grant programs of the Government must \n     continue to play a central role in financing the \n     transportation, environment, energy, and telecommunications \n     infrastructure needs of the United States, current and \n     foreseeable demands on existing Federal, State, and local \n     funding for infrastructure expansion exceed the resources to \n     support these programs by margins wide enough to prompt \n     serious concerns about the United States' ability to sustain \n     long-term economic development, productivity, and \n     international competitiveness.\n       (12) The capital markets, including central banks, pension \n     funds, financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds and \n     insurance companies, have a growing interest in \n     infrastructure investment. The establishment of a United \n     States Government-owned institution that would provide this \n     investment opportunity through high quality bond issues that \n     would be used to finance qualifying infrastructure projects \n     would attract needed capital for United States infrastructure \n     development.\n\n     SEC. 912.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medicare program loses an estimated $60,000,000,000 \n     annually to wasted and fraudulent payments.\n       (2) The Medicaid program also suffers from rampant fraud. \n     As the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services noted in 2009, in an analysis of \n     the only source of nationwide Medicaid claims and beneficiary \n     eligibility information, the Medicaid Statistical Information \n     System, the Federal Government does not have ``timely, \n     accurate, or comprehensive information for fraud, waste, and \n     abuse detection'' in the Medicaid program.\n       (3) Absent comprehensive estimates, the Medicaid program's \n     improper payment rate may be the most objective measure of \n     taxpayer dollars lost to fraud. The national average improper \n     payment rate ranges between 8.7 percent and 10.5 percent, but \n     many States have much higher improper payment rates.\n       (4) The new Federal health reform law substantially expands \n     the Medicaid program, significantly changes the Medicare \n     program, creates new mandates and regulations, and will send \n     hundreds of billions of dollars to insurance companies.\n       (5) It is the duty of public officials and public servants \n     in Congress and the Administration to protect the American \n     public's taxpayer dollars. Congress and the Administration \n     must continue to aggressively combat waste, fraud, and abuse \n     in public health care programs.\n       (6) The Inspector General of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services has stated that ``swift and effective \n     detection of and response to waste, fraud, and abuse remain \n     an essential program integrity strategy''. Furthermore, the \n     Inspector General noted that ``effective use of Medicare and \n     Medicaid data is critical to the success of the Government's \n     efforts to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse''.\n       (7) The loss of taxpayer dollars due to waste and fraud \n     under the Medicare and Medicaid programs not only threatens \n     the financial viability of those programs, it erodes the \n     public trust. American taxpayers should not be expected to \n     tolerate rampant waste, fraud, and abuse in publicly funded \n     health care programs.\n       (8) Congress supports the commitment of the Office of the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services to ``enhancing existing data analysis and mining \n     capabilities and employing advanced techniques such as \n     predictive analytics and social network analysis, to counter \n     new and existing fraud schemes''.\n       (9) Congress supports the use of predictive modeling and \n     other smart technologies that can transform the current ``pay \n     and chase'' payment cultures under the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs and prevent taxpayer dollars from being lost to \n     waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\n     SEC. 961.

Madam President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am delighted to bring before the Senate S. 3447, \nthe Post-9/11 Veterans' Educational Assistance Improvements Act of \n2010.\n  This measure, together with the managers' amendment, is based on the \nlegislation I introduced on May 27, 2010. Hearings were held on the \nbill on July 21, 2010, and on August 5, 2010, the committee ordered the \nmeasure to be reported. The committee's report was filed on October 26, \n2010.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to make modifications in the \nprogram of educational assistance operated under chapter 33 of title \n38, United States Code, for veterans who have served on active duty \nsince September 11, 2001. It would provide for a streamlined, less \ncomplex, and more equitable program, and expand certain opportunities \nfor training and education, including on-job and vocational training. \nIt would also correct a number of inadvertent omissions and errors in \nthe new chapter 33 program as enacted in 2008 as title V of Public Law \n110-252, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008.\n  As one who knows, from firsthand experience, the value of G.I. bill \nbenefits and how they can substantially enhance all aspects of an \nindividual's life, I believe that it is critical that we move toward \nmaking this new G.I. bill for today's veterans the best that it can be. \nAnd that is what my bill is intended to do.\n  In 2008, I was pleased to join with our distinguished colleague from \nVirginia, Mr. Webb, as a cosponsor of the original measure which \nestablished this new program. However, since the process leading to the \nenactment of this new program was outside the framework of the usual \ncommittee route for development and consideration of legislation, there \nare a number of issues with the new program that require legislative \nremedies. In addition, VA's yearlong experience with the program has \nmade it clear that the new program is very complex, difficult to \nunderstand, and results in unintended inequities.\n  I worked with my colleagues here in the Senate, with the Department \nof Veterans' Affairs, and with various veteran and other organizations \nto craft legislation that addresses many of the problems and will, in \naddition, make additional valuable educational opportunities for \nveterans available through on-job and apprenticeship training. Because \nthe details of the legislation are described in detail in the \ncommittee's report on S. 3447--Senate Report 111-34--I will just \nhighlight a few of the provisions.\n  First, the bill would allow members of the National Guard and Reserve \nto benefit from the new program. These individuals--those activated \nunder the authority of title 32 by orders of the President or the \nSecretary of Defense to support a national security mission--were \ninadvertently omitted from the program when it was enacted in 2008 and \nthe pending measure would remedy this oversight.\n\n[[Page S8954]]\n\n  Second, the bill would simplify the payments. Instead of a complex \nand sometimes inequitable benefits calculation based on a State-by-\nState determination, this measure would provide that if an individual \nis enrolled in a program of education at a public institution of higher \nlearning, VA would pay the cost of tuition and fees. If an individual \nis enrolled in other than a public institution, VA would pay up to a \nnational cap that will be adjusted annually based on increases in the \ncost of education. My measure sets the initial cap at $17,500.\n  Third, the bill would expand the options available to individuals and \nprovide that benefits could be paid for the pursuit of apprenticeship \nand on-job training as well as for pursuit of a vocational goal. This \nwill open up the doors for valuable benefits for those who choose these \noptions.\n  Fourth, the bill would expand the program to authorize the payment of \nthe $1,000 annual book allowance to individuals who are attending \nschool while on active duty. It would also permit veterans and \nservicemembers to use benefits for multiple licensing and certification \ncourses.\n  Finally, this measure would permit service-connected disabled \nveterans enrolled in a program of vocational rehabilitation under \nchapter 31 of title 38 who also have eligibility for the new Post-9/11 \nG.I. bill program to select under which program to receive a living or \nsubsistence allowance. This will remove the economic incentive for an \nindividual to forgo the valuable assistance available under the chapter \n31 program in exchange for a higher living stipend under the chapter 33 \nprogram.\n  While I am pleased that we have been able to produce this package of \nimprovements that will go a long way toward making the new program the \nbest that it can be, I note that we still have much to do in this area. \nThere are questions and issues that have not been addressed in this \nmeasure--such as how to ensure that veterans using their benefits are \nafforded a quality education, a 48-month cap on the total amount of \nbenefits available under all the programs of educational assistance \noffered by VA, and the overall need to curb instances of fraud, abuse, \nand misuse of benefits. I am certain this list can only grow longer.\n  But this marks an important first step and I look forward to \ncontinuing to working with my colleagues here and in the House of \nRepresentatives as we continue to move through the legislative process \nto do what needs to be done.\n  In closing, I extend a note of personal thanks to the committee's \ndistinguished ranking member from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, and his \nstaff member, Amanda Meredith, whose hard work and dedication are much \nappreciated.\n  I urge the Senate to pass the pending measure.\n  The amendment (No. 4802) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 22, in the matter following line 17, insert after \n     the item relating to section 2 the following:\n\nSec. 3.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6278, which was received \nfrom the House and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6278) to amend the National Children's Island \n     Act of 1995 to expand allowable uses for Kingman and Heritage \n     Islands by the District of Columbia, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the \nKingman and Heritage Islands Act of 2010, H.R. 6278. In particular, I \nwish to describe the legislative history and intent of this act. \nEarlier this year, essentially identical legislation, H.R. 2092, passed \nthe House and the Senate but has not been enacted for reasons that I \nwill address in this statement. Therefore, the House and Senate \ncommittee reports describing H.R. 2092 should be referenced as \napplicable legislative history for H.R. 6278.\n  D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced H.R. 2092, The Kingman \nand Heritage Islands Act of 2009, on April 23, 2009. The bill was \nconsidered by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on \nSeptember 10, 2009, and ordered reported favorably with an amendment. \nOn October 7, 2009, H.R. 2092 passed the House of Representatives under \nsuspension of the rules and the subsequent day, H.R. 2092 was referred \nto the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The \ncommittee considered the bill on May 17, 2010, and ordered the bill \nreported to the full Senate with one amendment. On September 27, 2010, \nthe Senate passed H.R. 2092 by unanimous consent. Due to a mistake, \nhowever, the version that the Senate passed on September 27 contained a \nfew drafting errors and did not reflect all of the modifications that \nour committee had intended.\n  Rather than seek the enactment of the Senate-passed version of H.R. \n2092, and in order to avoid any confusion among the government entities \nresponsible for implementing the bill, Delegate Norton subsequently \nintroduced H.R. 6278 with the support of the chairman and ranking \nmember of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. H.R. \n6278 consists of the text of H.R. 2092 as my committee had amended it \nand intended it to pass in the Senate. Delegate Norton introduced H.R. \n6278 on September 29, 2010, and it passed the House of Representatives \non November 16, 2010, under suspension of the rules. After being \nreceived in the Senate, the bill was held at the desk and today it will \npass the Senate by unanimous consent.\n  Because neither the relevant House nor Senate committee had the \nopportunity to file committee reports describing H.R. 6278, the \ncommittee reports describing H.R. 2092 should be considered as \napplicable legislative history for this bill. The report filed by the \nHouse Committee on Oversight and Government Reform report is House \nReport 111-275 and the report filed by the Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs is Senate Report 111-300. In the \nremainder of my statement I further describe the background and intent \nof the legislation.\n  The Kingman and Heritage Islands Act of 2010 would allow the District \nof Columbia to use all of Heritage Island and portions of Kingman \nIsland--the Islands--for recreational, environmental and educational \nuses. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers created Kingman and Heritage \nIslands in the District of Columbia from sediment dredged from the \nAnacostia River.\n  Until the enactment in 1996 of the National Children's Island Act of \n1995--the act--the National Park Service held administrative \njurisdiction on both islands. The act required the Federal Government \nto transfer title of the islands to the District of Columbia for use as \na children's recreational park. It also mandated that title to the \nislands would revert back to the Federal Government if the District did \nnot use the land in a manner consistent with the purposes specified in \nthe act. The Secretary of the Interior transferred title of the Islands \nto the District via quitclaim deed in January 1997. In 2000, the \nSecretary of Interior wrote the District a letter stating that the \nDistrict had fully lived up to the letter and spirit of the act and \nthat DC should retain title to the Islands.\n  DC has not developed a children's recreational park on the Islands, \nand since that time, it has re-evaluated its\n\n[[Page S8961]]\n\nneeds and interests and no longer seeks to use the Islands for that \npurpose. In 2003, in accordance with a memorandum of understanding \nbetween DC and several Federal agencies, including the NPS, the \nDistrict developed the Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan--Waterfront \nPlan--to redevelop and revitalize the Anacostia waterfront. The \nWaterfront Plan envisions using the islands for nature-themed \nexhibitions and educational projects. The District also has developed a \nComprehensive Plan to serve as a general policy document to provide \noverall guidance for future planning and development in DC.\n  Recently, the District has taken steps toward implementing the \nWaterfront Plan. In the summer of 2007, the Anacostia Waterfront \nCorporation, now part of the DC Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning \nand Economic Development, partnered with a number of other \norganizations to begin using the Islands to host environmental programs \nand cleanup. Since May 2008, Living Classrooms, a nonprofit educational \norganization with a focus on experiential learning, has been managing \nthe islands and running programs there, including educational \nprogramming and volunteer events aimed at restoring the Islands.\n  To ensure that the activities DC has authorized do not raise any \nquestions about its title to the Islands, the District has asked \nCongress to amend the act to sanction the broader work now occurring on \nthe Islands. H.R. 6278 would do just that, by amending the National \nChildren's Island Act in order to allow the District to conduct \nrecreational, environmental and educational activities on the Islands, \nconsistent with the Waterfront Plan and the District's Comprehensive \nPlan. If any portion of the land is used for an activity that is not \nrecreational, environmental or educational, the reversionary process as \noutlined in the bill could begin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 6278) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/13/senate-section/article/S8961-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 4023\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
