Mr. President, as the debate escalates over the best way to \nease the crushing burden of health care, it is easy to become \nsidetracked by misrepresentations, distracted by minor details or \ntempted to point fingers. When we do those things, we lose sight of \nwhat is at the heart of this effort, this debate, and this reform.\n  I wish to take a moment at the end of this week to remind all of us \nwhat this is all about--the health care debate. It is about hardworking \nAmericans because they are too often the casualties of our broken \nhealth care system. They deserve better than to be also casualties of \nmisleading politics.\n  To the millions of Americans without health care, this is a concrete \nand critical crisis that affects children, families, small businesses, \nand big businesses every single day. It is about the parent who can't \ntake a child to the doctor because insurance is prohibitively \nexpensive. It is about the family who lives one accident or one illness \naway from financial ruin. It is about a small business that had to lay \noff employees because it couldn't afford the skyrocketing cost of \nhealth care premiums or that small business that had to cancel health \ninsurance for its employees because it couldn't afford it. It is about \nthe three-in-five families who put off health care because it simply \ncosts too much.\n  As Democrats in the Senate, we are committed to lowering the high \nprice of health care, ensuring every American has access to that \nquality, affordable care and, finally, letting people choose their own \ndoctors, hospitals, and health plans. We are committed to protecting \nthe existing coverage when it is good, improving it when it is not, and \nguaranteeing health care for the millions--including 9 million \nchildren--who have none. We are committed to preventing disease, \nreducing health disparities, and encouraging early detection and \neffective treatments that save lives.\n  No matter what Republicans claim, the government has no intention of \nchoosing for you any of these things or meddling in any of your medical \nrelationships. If you like the coverage you have, you can choose to \nkeep it.\n  Health care is not a luxury. It shouldn't be a luxury. We can't \nafford another year in which 46 million people have to choose between \nbasic necessities and lining the pockets of big insurance companies \njust to stay healthy.\n  I hear every day from Nevadans--through e-mails, phone calls, \nletters, and other means of communication--that people are turned down \nfor health\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\ncoverage by insurance providers who care more about profits than \npeople. I hear about people who lost their health coverage when they \nlost their jobs and now have no means of getting it back. I hear of \npeople from Nevada who play by the rules and rightly demand that our \nhealth care system be guided by common sense.\n  That is what this debate is all about--nothing more, nothing less. \nThese people--and nothing else--should be the focus of the open and \nhonest debate they deserve--the people of America.\n  Mr. President, has the Chair yet announced that we are in a period of \nmorning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about health \ncare. Obviously, according to most media reports, and my experience as \na member of the HELP Committee, we are basically at gridlock. The \nCongressional Budget Office stated on Monday, in relation to the \nlegislation being considered in the HELP Committee, that\n\n       Once the proposal is fully implemented . . . the number of \n     people who had coverage through an employer would decline by \n     about 15 million.\n\n  The Lewin Group, a health care consulting firm, estimates this number \nto be much higher. They estimate that up to 70 percent of all Americans \nwho have private insurance today--120 million Americans--will lose \ntheir health insurance and be forced onto the government rolls.\n  That stands in stark contrast to the President's repeated assertions \nthat if you like your health care, you can keep it. Further analysis by \nHSI Network, a health care economics firm, found that to get all \nAmericans covered under the Democrats' bill, it would cost a staggering \n$4 trillion and result in 79 million Americans who currently have \nprivate insurance having to obtain coverage from the government plan.\n  What I have described is what is known as the ``crowdout'' \nphenomenon. It is the substitution effect that occurs when a massive \ngovernment insurance plan ``crowds out'' private insurance as the \nexpansion of publicly subsidized programs encourage or force people \nfrom private arrangements to public ones. This is a real issue and one \nwe must pay attention to.\n  On Monday the President said:\n\n       I know that there are millions of Americans who are content \n     with their health care coverage. . . . And that means that no \n     matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise: \n     If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your \n     doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will \n     be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will \n     take it away. No matter what.\n\n  If the bill we are considering is enacted, I do not believe this is a \npromise the President will be able to keep. The President's hometown \nnewspaper, the Chicago Tribune, stated in an editorial on Tuesday:\n\n       [The President] promises that anyone who wants to keep \n     their private coverage will be able to do so . . . But we do \n     know a few things about government-run health plans . . . the \n     Federal Government isn't competition. It is the health care \n     equivalent of Bigfoot . . . It sets low prices, to be sure, \n     lower than many insurers are able to match. But that just \n     means those doctors and hospitals recoup the losses by \n     shifting costs onto those with private insurance . . . \n     [which] could easily crowd out private plans. A lot of \n     Americans think the health care system isn't really all that \n     broken. They get good care. They pay for it via insurance . . \n     . But a government-run health plan? Experience says that the \n     cure would be worse than the illness.\n\n  The Chicago Tribune has it exactly right. The fact is, a lot of \nAmericans are pleased with their health care options. In fact, 70 \npercent of Americans with health insurance rated their coverage good or \nexcellent, according to a Rasmussen Reports poll dated May 14, 2009. \nThose 70 percent might be the precise group of Americans who will lose \ntheir health insurance and be forced into government-run programs if \nthe legislation is enacted.\n  It is a fact that premiums continue rising, eating into family \nbudgets and preventing the uninsured from getting covered. This is the \nproblem we need to be addressing. We need to bring down the cost of \nhealth care and thus the cost of health insurance coverage. This will \nlead to more coverage of the uninsured and ensure that those who like \ntheir health care coverage can keep their coverage and their doctor as \nthe President promises. Yet the majority bill contains not a single \nreform that will save money. Instead, as I have pointed out, it will \ncost up to $4 trillion and displace up to 79 million Americans from \ntheir current coverage.\n  This is not reform. This is why we should start over. I continue to \nbelieve that the Democrats and the White House should scrap this \nincomplete bill and start over. Democrats and Republicans must come \ntogether and draft a bill that allows the President to uphold his \npromise that Americans will be able to keep their current doctor or \nhealth care plan.\n  We spent a lot of time in the HELP Committee going over an incomplete \nproposal. Supposedly by tonight the three major issues, including the \nso-called government option, will be revealed to us by the majority \nside. I hope it is soon. I hope we will be able to view it so we could \nhave for the first time a meaningful discussion and negotiation in the \nHELP Committee. So far, three major components are still blank spaces.\n  I have been in this body for a long time. I have never seen a process \nsuch as we are going through right now. It is basically fundamentally a \ncharade so the Democrats can come to the floor and say we consulted \nwith the Republicans, we had hours and hours of debate and discussion \nand markup--when we were not presented with the key elements of the \nlegislation we were supposed to be considering. If the key elements are \nthere and we get to examine it over the weekend, then perhaps we will \nbe able to sit down together and negotiate some kind of reasonable \napproach to this bill.\n  It is not an accident that the Finance Committee, the other committee \nthat is supposed to be tracking the health reform bill along with the \nHELP Committee, has decided not to present their proposal until after \nthe Fourth of July recess because they simply do not have a way to pay \nfor it.\n  The CBO analysis and other outside analysis has revealed something \nvery important, that the plan as proposed and propounded by the \nadministration and by the Democrats is unsustainably expensive and one \nthat they do not have a way of paying for. It will be very interesting \nto see how they tailor their plan to the expenses and how they address \nthe issue of how to pay for it. Clearly, raising taxes is an option \nthey are considering. I don't think raising anybody's taxes in the \npresent day economy is something that would be beneficial to all \nAmericans.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, one thing Republicans and Democrats can \nall agree on is the need for serious health care reform. On Monday, \nPresident Obama spoke to the American Medical Association to discuss \nthe issue. I applaud the President for his commitment to health care \nreform and agree with him that we need to make health care more \naffordable and accessible to all Americans.\n  While the American people want reform, they want us to fix what is \nwrong with the system without taking away the freedom, choices, and \nquality of care they now enjoy. During a speech to the AMA, the \nPresident acknowledged these concerns and articulated some principles \non health care reform that many Republicans share. But it seems to me \nthat many of my friends on the other side of the aisle should have \nlistened more closely to what the President said to the AMA.\n  One thing the President said that Republicans agree with is that \nAmericans should not be forced to give up the insurance they currently \nhave and like and be forced into a government plan. The President \npromised the American people that:\n\n       If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your \n     doctor. If you like your health care plan, you will be able \n     to keep your health care plan. No one will take it away no \n     matter what.\n\n  Republicans agree with the President. Yet Democrats in Congress are \nmaking last-minute edits to a bill in the HELP Committee that the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says will cost 10 million \npeople with employer-sponsored insurance to lose the coverage they \ncurrently have. And that is the number of people who would lose their \ncurrent insurance under just one section of the bill. This legislation \nis still missing significant sections that could force tens of millions \nof additional Americans to lose their current coverage. Republicans \nshare the President's belief that those who like their health insurance \nshould be able to keep it, but the bill currently being considered by \nthe HELP Committee would force Americans off of the health care plans \nthey now enjoy.\n  Another issue the President and Republicans agree on is the need to \ninvest more in preventative care and wellness programs, which is an \nimportant way to cut costs and improve care. President Obama mentioned \nthe successful wellness and prevention program Safeway created, which \nhas dramatically cut the company's health care costs and employees' \nhealth care premiums. He said he would be open to doing more to help \nbusinesses across the country adopt and expand programs like the one \ncreated by Safeway. Yet the bill the Democrats are now pushing through \nthe Senate would actually ban this successful program from being copied \nand implemented by other companies.\n  Republicans also agree with the President on the need to reform our \nNation's medical liability laws. Frivolous malpractice lawsuits are a \nmajor cause of our increasing health care costs. These lawsuits cause \ninsurance premiums for doctors to skyrocket, and doctors then pass \nthose higher costs on, of course, to patients.\n  Doctors also often order expensive and unnecessary tests just to \nprotect themselves against these lawsuits, and some doctors just close \ntheir practices or stop offering services as a result of all these \npressures.\n  And patients are the ones who lose out. According to a report by the \nKentucky Institute of Medicine, Kentucky is nearly 2,300 doctors short \nof the national average--a shortage that could be reduced, in part, by \nreforming medical malpractice laws.\n  President Obama has not advocated the kind of medical liability \nreform most Republicans would like to see, but he has at least opened \nthe door to fixing the system. But none of the bills introduced in the \nCongress even acknowledge the need for malpractice reform or propose \nany solutions to deal with the problem.\n  Finally, Republicans share the President's concerns about how much \nhealth care reform is going to cost and how we will pay for it. \nPresident Obama said that he set down a rule that ``health care reform \nmust be, and will be, deficit-neutral in the next decade.''\n  But the preliminary estimates from the bill before the HELP Committee \nshow that just one--just one--section of the bill spends $1.3 trillion. \nAnd even more outrageous is the fact that the bill doesn't even have \nany proposals to pay for its enormous pricetag--other than to borrow it \nfrom the taxpayers. Americans want reform. But they don't want a blind \nrush to spend trillions of dollars that they and their grandchildren \nwill have to pay for through higher taxes and even more debt.\n  When it comes to making sure Americans can keep the coverage they \nhave, strengthening wellness and prevention programs, reforming our \nmedical malpractice laws, and paying for health care reform, \nRepublicans share common ground with the President. I just wish that \ncongressional Democrats did too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/19/senate-section/article/S6831-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Unfortunately, she will spend her birthday not in \nthe company of family and friends but in Burma's notorious Insein \nPrison where 31 political prisoners have died since 1988.\n  Despite her apparently poor health, Suu Kyi is being housed in Insein \nbecause she is standing trial for the dubious charge of permitting a \nmisguided American to enter her home.

Mr. President, I wish to share a few thoughts about the \nE-Verify system. That is the system businesses are voluntarily using \ntoday in large numbers provided by the U.S. Government that allows a \ncompany to check the Social Security number of an applicant for a job \nto make sure they are lawfully eligible for employment. This system is \ngrowing and working very well. We have had some problems, I think, with \nCongress, and I attempted to offer an amendment to fix some of those \nproblems on the tourism bill that is before us but was not able to do \nthat. So I wish to share a few thoughts about it. I have been trying to \nget this situation fixed for some time.\n  E-Verify is an online system that gives very rapid identification of \nan individual through the Social Security Administration and Homeland \nSecurity to determine whether they are eligible for a job. A business \njust checks those numbers, and if they come back as clear and they hire \nthe individual, it provides them protection from a charge that they may \nhave knowingly hired someone who was illegally in the country or \notherwise not able to be employed.\n  So it is a good system. As I said, as of June 13, this month, 130,000 \nemployers are enrolled in the program. They have, among them, 501,000 \nhiring sites. It is free and voluntary, and it is the best means \navailable to determine the eligibility of those who apply.\n  According to the Department of Homeland Security, 96 percent of the \nemployees are cleared automatically, and growth continues at over 1,000 \nnew users and participants each week as more and more businesses are \nusing it. An employer, as I said, gets protection if they use it.\n  In 2009, this year, 5.6 million inquiries were run. In 2008, through \nthe whole\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\n12 months, more than 6.6 million inquiries were run, and they continue \nto grow.\n  In Alabama alone, there are 1,000 employers who use the E-Verify \nsystem. It has been proven effective, and I think it should be made \npermanent and mandatory for everybody who does business with the U.S. \nGovernment. As a matter of fact, that was what the law was supposed to \nbe in January, but it is not. So the program is to expire in September \nunless it is extended.\n  Now, I am told the Homeland Security legislation the House passed--or \nwill pass--will extend the E-Verify Program for 2 years. I am told the \nSenate Homeland Security bill may well report language that will extend \nit for 3 years. Why we don't make it permanent is beyond me. It is a \ncornerstone of the enforcement system of business and employers to \nensure that they are attempting to comply with the law, and if they are \nnot, to be able to identify them.\n  I was extremely disappointed when the economic stimulus package was \nup earlier this year and passed, where we spent $800 billion to \nstimulate the economy and create jobs, it was passed without any \nrequirement that E-Verify be a part of the stimulus package. So a \ncontractor who gets a job with the U.S. Government, with money paid \nfrom the stimulus package, legislation that was designed to create jobs \nfor American citizens, could actually go out and hire people illegally \nin the country. That is not what the American people have a right to \nexpect. That is not good policy. It should not be done.\n  We have surging unemployment, unfortunately. All of us hoped it would \ncome in less than it is now. I know the President's budget, offered \nearlier this year, projected that unemployment would top at 8.4 \npercent. It is now 9.4 percent, the highest in over 20 years. It is \ncontinuing to go up, from what it appears. So we have an obligation to \ntry to use what resources we are expending in a way that helps the \nAmerican worker find work. Some of these stimulus jobs are good jobs. \nSo the House has supported the extension of E-Verify. It passed in the \nHouse last July, 407 to 2. Yet it still hasn't become law to extend it \npast September.\n  One of the main purposes of the stimulus bill was to see that people \ngot work. I think if we don't extend E-Verify, people have a right to \nquestion how serious we are about using that money--that huge amount--\nwisely to create jobs for American citizens.\n  An amendment offered and accepted in the House on the stimulus bill \nwas by Congressman Jack Kingston. It said that funds made available \nunder the stimulus package could not be made available to any business \nthat did not use E-Verify. They apparently accepted that without a \nsingle dissenting vote. It was in the House legislation. I offered it \nin the Senate stimulus bill and did everything I could to see that we \ncould make that a part of the law and make it permanent. It was blocked \nin the Senate by the Democratic leadership.\n  I am worried that we talk a good game about doing something about \nthis, but so far, we have been very ineffective in taking real action \nthat will work.\n  Let me share one more thing about Executive order 12989. President \nBush issued an Executive order, and that order called for the \nimplementation of the E-Verify system for government contractors in \nJanuary of this year. It mandates the use of E-Verify for all Federal \ncontractors and subcontractors. It was supposed to take effect in \nJanuary. I believed President Bush should have been stronger about that \nthan he was, but they went into it carefully, and that is what they \ndecided to do.\n  When President Obama came in, immediately he extended that and put it \noff and blocked its enforcement. So it is still not in the law. Now it \nis being delayed until September 8--that rule that a government \ncontractor at least ought to check his employees to see if they are \nlegally entitled to be employed. How simple is that? It takes a few \nminutes, and thousands of businesses are voluntarily doing it today. \nThis decision, again, to delay it now until September 8 is the fourth \ndelay this year by President Obama. I believe it signals the fact that \nthis administration is not yet serious about their stated goal of \nmaking sure that employers comply with the law and not hire people \nillegally.\n  On January 28, it was pushed back to February 20. A few weeks later, \nthe implementation was pushed back to May 21. Prior to that, it was \npushed back to June 30, and now it is further delayed until September \n8. This system is up and working. It has been up for years now. It is \nnothing unusual. I cannot imagine that if this Senate is allowed to \nvote up or down on whether to make this the law that we would not pass \nit. I am going to offer an amendment that will do just that. That is \nthe right thing to do. It makes common sense.\n  What I am afraid may happen is that we will have, through maneuvering \nand chicanery, actions taken to block that vote. If the Democratic \nleadership in the Senate blocks a vote on this question, that can only \nbe interpreted as their position is that we should not extend E-Verify \nand that we should not make it apply to government contractors.\n  It cannot be interpreted any other way because we have been talking \nabout this for years. Everybody knows what the issue is.\n  I am concerned. I hope the President, who has had his staff on board \nnow for 5 or 6 months--it is time for them to get their act together \nand let us know where they stand. Just delaying this is an indication \nto me they are not serious about it. It should not have taken 5 minutes \nto know that a government contractor should not be hiring people \nillegally in the workforce. How long does it take to do that? This is \nnot a new issue. But they are studying it, they say. OK, let's study \nit. But sooner or later, it is time to act.\n  To me, there are no two ways about it. There is one logical answer to \nthis question. If we want to make sure the government money that is \ngoing out--money taken from American taxpayers--provides jobs for \nAmerican workers, we need to pass legislation to mandate that. I hope \nwe will. I hope the President will be able to get this study complete, \nwhich they claim they are doing, and get on with doing the right thing. \nWe have waited long enough.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon, at the end of a week \nwhere--and the Presiding Officer knows this in his work representing \nthe State of Oregon and in his work as a member of our Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee--we have spent a lot of time \non health care, as we did the week before and several weeks leading up \nto this time. But now we are at the point where in our committee we are \nactually voting--voting on amendments.\n  We know this is a challenge that has faced America for decades: the \nchallenge of covering people in our country who do not have coverage \nand making sure those who do have coverage have quality health care \ncoverage that is affordable. So all these challenges are presented to \nus now.\n  We have a situation in the country today--and Chairman Dodd mentioned \nthis this morning in a hearing--that about 14,000 people a day lose \ntheir health care coverage. It is hard to comprehend that every single \nday that number of Americans are losing their health care \ncoverage. Candidly, if the number was half that, it would be \nunacceptable--or even less than that--but that is, in a very real way, \nthe status quo, where we are now. Thousands and thousands of people \nlosing coverage every day, 14,000 by one count; people who might have \ncoverage but it is hard for them to afford it or to continue to afford \nit, and sometimes people have coverage and it is not of the kind of \nquality that would ensure the best health care for them and for their \nfamilies.\n\n  We are at a point now where we are beginning to see a basic choice \nthat the Congress has to make and the American people have to make. It \nis the status quo or change. It is the status quo--where we are now--\nwhich, in my judgment, is unacceptable--or reform. It is coming down to \na basic, fundamental choice.\n  The status quo right now is the enemy of change. The status quo is \nthe impediment in front of us, the tree across the road or whatever \nimage you want to illustrate. So we have to get to work making sure \nthat the status quo doesn't stay in place.\n  There are so many ways to tell this story. Every Member of the Senate \nand every Member of the House and, frankly, virtually every American \ncould tell a story about someone they know or someone they have read \nabout and the challenges they face. In Pennsylvania, we have a lot of \nexamples about people who are living the reality of a lack of coverage \nor bad quality coverage or coverage they cannot afford. One letter I \ngot stood out for me, among many. It was written back in February of \nthis year by Trisha Urban from Berks County, PA, the eastern side of \nPennsylvania. I will read portions of her letter which I think tell the \nstory about as well as anyone could; unfortunately, in this case, in a \ntragic circumstance. She wrote, talking about her husband Andrew, that \nhe had to leave his job for 1 year to complete an internship \nrequirement that he had to get his doctorate in psychology. The \ninternship was unpaid and they could not afford COBRA coverage--\nextended health care coverage. Now I am quoting from the middle of the \nletter. Trisha Urban says:\n\n       Because of the preexisting conditions, neither my husband's \n     health issues----\n\n  He had some heart trouble----\n\n     neither my husband's health issues nor my pregnancy would be \n     covered under private insurance.\n\n  Now I am quoting again:\n\n       I worked 4 part-time jobs and was not eligible for any \n     health care benefits. We ended up with a second rate health \n     insurance plan through my husband's university. When medical \n     bills started to add up, the insurance company decided to \n     drop our coverage, stating that the internship did not \n     qualify us for the benefits. We were left with close to \n     $100,000 worth of medical bills. Concerned with the upcoming \n     financial responsibility of the birth of our daughter and the \n     burden of current medical expenses, my husband missed his \n     last doctor's appointment less than one month ago.\n\n  Trisha Urban's letter goes on. She talks about what happened at one \nparticular moment after summarizing their health care situation. She \nsays, describing her pregnancy:\n\n       My water had broke the night before. We were anxiously \n     awaiting the birth of our first child. A half-hour later, two \n     ambulances were in my driveway. As the paramedics were \n     assessing the health of my baby and me, the paramedic from \n     the other ambulance told me that my husband could not be \n     revived.\n\n  She concludes her letter this way. Again, I am quoting Trisha Urban \nfrom Berks County, PA:\n\n       I am a working class American and do not have the money or \n     the insight to legally fight the health insurance company. We \n     had no life insurance. I will probably lose my home and my \n     car. Everything we worked so hard to accumulate in our life \n     will be gone in an instant. If my story is heard, if \n     legislation can be changed to help other uninsured Americans \n     in a similar situation, I am willing to pay the price of \n     losing everything.\n\n  Trisha Urban is telling us through that poignant but tragic story \nabout her own circumstances and the circumstances surrounding the birth \nof her daughter and the death of her husband, all we need to know about \nthis debate.\n  Then, posing that question--or that challenge, I should say--to all \nof us, especially those of us who have a vote in the Senate:\n\n       I am willing to pay the price of losing everything if my \n     story can be told and legislation can be enacted to deal with \n     health care.\n\n  That is the basic challenge that Trisha Urban has put before the \nSenate and the Congress and the administration. It is the challenge we \nmust respond to. We cannot pretend it is not\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nthere. We cannot pretend that the status quo I talked about a moment \nago--14,000 people losing their health insurance every day; so many \nother people worried about the coverage they have--we cannot pretend \nthat is not there. We cannot say to Trisha Urban that we are sorry \nabout the circumstances of your story, but Congress can't get it done \nthis year.\n  We have to get it done. We have to pass a bill in our committee. We \nhave to get a bill through the Finance Committee, and we have to make \nsure the Senate votes on this legislation this year--frankly, this \nsummer; not late in the fall, not in the winter, not in 2010. Right now \nis the time for action.\n  President Obama has led us in this effort. He has attached the same \nsense of urgency to this issue that I know the American people feel.\n  What is it about? Well, it is about an act that a lot of Americans \nare just hearing about, which goes by a very simple name: the \nAffordable Health Choices Act. That is the act that is presently before \nour committee. It does a couple of things. It focuses on some \nfundamentals to get at that change that should come to the status quo. \nFirst, it reduces costs by way of prevention. It is very important. We \nknow that can reduce costs substantially. It also reduces costs by \nbetter quality and information technology. It is still hard to believe \nthat when other industries such as banking and insurance and other \nparts of our economy have moved into the new era of technology that our \nhealth care system isn't anywhere near where it has to be to reduce \nmedical errors and to provide better quality. So by focusing on \ninformation technology, we can reduce costs. That is in the bill.\n  Also, the bill contemplates rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse--\nanother area of cost reduction. We know that the big questions on costs \nwill be dealt with in the other committee--the Finance Committee--but \nthere are elements in this bill that, in fact, reduce costs.\n  Secondly, the bill preserves choice, that if you like what you have \nin your insurance plan and the coverage you have, you can keep it. \nThere is no reason why that should change, and it won't change under \nthis bill. But if you don't like the coverage you have, we want to give \nyou options and we also want to give you an option in coverage if you \nobviously don't have any health insurance at all. So it does reduce \ncosts, it does preserve choice, and, thirdly, it will ensure quality \nand affordable care for the American people.\n  I believe, and I think most people in the Senate believe, that one \nought to have the option of not just any health care but quality care \nthat is affordable, that you can actually make work in your own budget. \nSo we are going to build on the system we have. We are not going to \nthrow the old system out; we are going to build on the system we have \nand make it better.\n  We are also going to make sure that in this legislation, we protect \nthe patient-doctor relationship. There is no reason why anyone should \nget in between those two, and this bill will not do that.\n  Finally--this is a quick summary, I know--we are going to make sure \nthat at long last, a preexisting condition does not prevent you from \ngetting the kind of quality health care you have a right to expect in \nAmerica today.\n  As we move forward on this legislation, I want to make sure we \nhighlight the fundamental obligation we have, not just in the bill--but \nespecially in the bill--but even beyond this legislation, and that is \nthe obligation we have to get this right for the American people, and \nto get it right especially for our children. The Presiding Officer \nknows of the great progress we made this year on children's health \ninsurance. Thank goodness we got that done. Instead of having 6 million \nkids in America covered by the children's health insurance program, by \nway of the legislation we passed this year we are going to extend that \nto almost 11 million kids. That was wonderful. That is a big success \nand we should all be proud, but it is not enough. We should make sure \nthat the other 5 million children out there who don't have coverage \ntoday will get it but especially a child who happens to be in a poor \nfamily, a low-income family, or a child with special needs.\n\n  Here is what the rule ought to be. This is what should happen \nthroughout this process while enacting health care reform, but \ncertainly at the end of the road, so to speak, ideally this fall when \nwe will have a bill the President can sign: The rule ought to be no \nchild worse off, and especially no child who is poor or who has special \nneeds or is disabled. The great line from the Scriptures that talks \nabout a faithful friend--we have heard this over many years in the \ncontext of friendship, in the context of sometimes a reading at \nweddings, but I would like for us today to think about it in the \ncontext of our children. This is what the Scripture said: ``A faithful \nfriend is a sturdy shelter''--a great image about what friendship \nmeans. There are a lot of us day in and day out, year in and year out, \nwho talk about how important children are to us, that we are advocates \nfor children--and we should be--that we have solidarity with our \nchildren, we are going to do everything we can to protect them. In \nessence, we are saying we are their friend, that those of us who are \nelected to public office have an obligation to be a friend of and an \nadvocate for our children. Going back to that line from the Scriptures, \nif we are going to be a faithful friend to children, we better make \nsure that we provide a sturdy shelter; not just in the context of the \nobvious in health care. What is more fundamental than that, other than \nmaking sure that a child has enough to eat and making sure that child \nhas an opportunity to learn? Other than those two, health care is \nessential in the life of a child, especially a vulnerable child, \nwhether they are poor or have special needs or both. So if we are \nfaithful friends in the Senate to our children, we better provide that \nsturdy shelter. We better make sure that at the end of the day, these \nchildren are not worse off because of our legislation.\n  I wish to conclude with a thought from an expert--not someone who is \njust interested in children but someone who has an area of expertise \nwhich is probably unmatched. I am speaking of someone who testified \nlast week--a week ago today, it was--in front of our committee. Her \nname is Dr. Judith Palfrey. She is a pediatrician, a child advocate, \nand happens to be president-elect of the American Academy of \nPediatrics. She provided compelling testimony. I won't go through all \nof her testimony, but here is something she said which I think has \nrelevance and resonance for the debate we are having on health care. \nShe says--and I quote Dr. Palfrey's testimony:\n\n       Sometimes we as childhood advocates find it hard to \n     understand why children's needs are such an afterthought; and \n     why, because children are little. Because children are \n     little, policymakers and insurers think that it should take \n     less effort and resources to provide them health care.\n\n  Because children are little, we think that somehow less effort is \nrequired or less resources, less in the way of hard work. Well, none of \nus believes that, do we? We don't believe that. The health care we \nprovide to our children, the protection, the shelter we provide them \nshould be every bit as significant, every bit as fully resourced as the \nprotection we give to adults. We might disagree about a lot of the \ndetails in the health care bill, but I think we all in this Chamber \nbelieve that children may be little but in God's eyes they are 7 feet \ntall and we must treat them accordingly, especially on legislation so \nsignificant as legislation on health care reform.\n  So the rule ought to be no child worse off. It is that simple. I \nbelieve we can get it right. I believe we can enact health care reform \nthat preserves choice, reduces costs, and enhances quality and \naffordable coverage for the American people, and that we can make sure \nevery child is no worse off.\n  This is a great challenge. We understand the difficulty of it. This \nis a great challenge, but it is a challenge worthy of a great nation. \nIt is a challenge that will help us in our continuing struggle, our \njourney to make this a more perfect Union.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will make a couple of comments on Senator \nCasey's comments. We sit next to each other in the HELP Committee, and \nSenator Casey reminds us almost every day, as we work on this health \ncare bill, that ``no child should be\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\nworse off.'' That is something that, frankly, we all need to hear and \nevery Member of this body and in the House of Representatives needs to \nhear. I appreciate Senator Casey's work. It is really our mission to do \nthis right and to see that no child is left worse off.\n  We spend more than $2 trillion a year on health care in this country, \nwhich is more than double any other industrial nation. Americans \naccount for more than 35 million hospital visits and more than 900 \nmillion office visits every year. More than 64 million surgical \nprocedures are performed and more than 3.5 billion prescriptions are \nwritten. Health care is, in dollar terms, one-sixth of our national \neconomy, and it is growing. Think about that--one-sixth of our economy \nand hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet millions of Americans are one \nillness away from bankruptcy.\n  What we cannot forget as we debate health care reform are the \nmillions of Americans who are depending on us to do the right thing. We \ncannot forget their stories. Chairman Dodd, in the HELP Committee \ntoday, reminded us that 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance \nevery single day. So as our committee meets--and some people seem to be \nslowing this down a little, and they certainly have the right to offer \namendments, but they get carried away and talk some of these amendments \nto death. Every day that we don't pass this health care bill, 14,000 \nAmericans are losing their insurance. I will tell you some of the \nstories I hear.\n  Christopher, from Cincinnati, tells us that he and his wife are \nretired but are not yet 65, not yet Medicare-eligible. Without health \ncare reform, they cannot afford health care insurance because of \npreexisting health conditions. Their 401(k)--their retirement--is \nbleeding. Their small pensions don't keep up with rising premiums. \nChris puts off going to the doctor to save money. The annual premium \nincreases will raise their out-of-pocket expenses by 45 percent.\n  Our Nation spends in excess of $2 trillion annually in health care. \nYet too many people are only a hospital visit away from financial \ndisaster. We cannot afford to squander this opportunity for reform, nor \nsettle for marginal improvements. Instead, we must fight for \nsubstantial reforms that will significantly improve our health care \nsystem.\n  First of all, whatever plan you are in, if you are happy with it, you \ncan keep your insurance. We want to fix what is broken and protect what \nworks. That is why I am making a case for giving Americans a public \nhealth insurance option, not controlled by the health insurance \nindustry.\n  So many of us have had fights--even the President, when he was \ntalking about his mother as she was dying of cancer during the campaign \nlast year, about how while she was sick she had to fight insurance \ncompanies to be reimbursed and get payment for her illness. The public \nhealth insurance option is important, in part, because it is not \ncontrolled by the health insurance industry. It is a competitor. It can \ncompete with private insurance plans. We must preserve access, but that \nis clearly not enough for what we do in health care. Giving Americans a \nchoice to go with a private or public health insurance plan is good \npolicy and good common sense.\n  A public insurance option will make health care available and \naffordable for Americans like Michelle of Willoughby, OH, east of \nCleveland. When she was first diagnosed with breast cancer, she had \nexcellent coverage through her husband's insurance. But when her \nhusband lost his job, she lost her insurance. Not yet eligible for \nMedicare, she started a consulting business and found an insurance \nplan--exorbitant as it was. With the economic downturn, Michelle writes \nthat the ``sum of her work is to pay for insurance.''\n  At a time when too many Americans struggle to pay health care costs, \nthe public health insurance option will make health insurance more \naffordable.\n  A public health insurance option would make insurance affordable for \nAmericans like Gary from Toledo. Gary was laid off last year and \ncouldn't afford the more than $800 a month COBRA costs. After obtaining \nhealth insurance from a company that promised equivalent payments of \nMedicare for surgeries, Gary's wife underwent surgery. After a week of \nrecovery, they received a hospital bill of $210,000, with a hospital \nletter saying they lacked insurance. Gary talked to his provider, who \nagreed to pay only $400 out of $210,000. Fortunately for his family, \nthe hospital absorbed the remaining costs. But that should not happen, \neither, because of what that means to the local hospital. With Gary and \nhis wife still 3 years away from age 65, they deserve health reform \nthat works for them now.\n  A public health insurance option will also expand access to \naffordable health care in rural areas that are often ignored by a \nprivate insurance market that tends to target big cities with a more \ndense population and more consumers.\n  Too often, as Randall of West Liberty, OH--a small town in our \nState--can explain, rural communities have a difficult time attracting \neven basic care. Randall oversees Ohio's only rural training track in \nfamily medicine. While his program has received awards for training \nexcellence, he struggles to attract enough doctors for their rural \nresidents. He wrote to me explaining the disincentives and \nmisperceptions he has to overcome to attract the care needed to serve \nrural Ohio.\n  A public health insurance option will not neglect rural areas. \nInsurance companies bail out in rural areas or the insurance companies \nthat stay are so small in number that there is no real competition and \nthey can charge rates that are too high. Instead, the public option \nwould be consistently available in all markets, including rural eastern \nOregon and rural western and southeastern Ohio.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues to design a public insurance \noption as part of overall health care reform. The stories of millions \nof Americans behind spiraling costs of health care will no longer go \nunheard. The stories of Chris, Gary, Michelle, and Randall will guide \nthis administration, this Congress, and this Nation to protect and \nprovide health care for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we are now embarked in the Senate on \none of the most important challenges that our country faces--we will \nbegin to reform our tragically flawed and broken health care system to \nbring down its skyrocketing costs, to cover its tens of millions of \nAmericans left uninsured, and to improve its way-below-average results \nso that high-quality health care comes within reach for every American \nfamily. The stakes are high.\n  This week, in a speech before the American Medical Association, \nPresident Obama said:\n\n       The cost of our health care is a threat to our economy. It \n     is an escalating burden on our families and businesses. It is \n     a ticking time bomb for the Federal budget. And it is \n     unsustainable for the United States of America.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       Health care reform is the single most important thing we \n     can do for America's long-term fiscal health.\n\n  Savings in waste, confusion, unnecessary or defective care, and \nillness prevention could eventually well exceed $700 billion a year. It \nis not going to happen instantly, but it is a goal we can shoot for.\n  I applaud President Obama's commitment and leadership, and I commend \nmy Senate colleagues for their tireless efforts in the pursuit of \nmeaningful, comprehensive reform. The new energy and focus we have seen \nin this debate isn't limited to us here in Washington. In recent \nmonths, doctors and hospitals, patients and insurance companies, labor \nunions and drug companies have all come together in support of the need \nfor a restructure of our system.\n  Amidst all this, it has been my great honor to join the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Oregon, on the HELP Committee, where he \nserves with such distinction and where much of the legislation to \nrepair our broken health care system is being debated, written,\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\nand refined. In that capacity, I was recently invited to the White \nHouse to meet with President Obama, his health care team, and all of \nour colleagues on the HELP and Finance Committees. We discussed our \npriorities for reform, and we reported on the progress each committee \nhas made in the past several weeks.\n  In the coming weeks, we will hear a lot about the details of health \ncare reform legislation, and those details are very important. But even \nmore important are the hundreds of millions of American families in \neach of our States all over the country who have experienced real \nanguish--coverage lost or denied, hospital stays extended due to \ncomplications or errors, prescription drug bills rising and rising, \nwith no end in sight, even losing everything because a loved one fell \nill.\n  A few months ago, I launched a page on my Web site for Rhode \nIslanders to share their personal experiences with our broken health \ncare system, and hundreds of people have written in from all over the \nState.\n  Anita is a social worker and mental health professional in \nProvidence. She shared what she describes as the ``sad and rude \nawakening'' she experienced after opening her own practice last year. \nAs a provider, like all providers, she takes great pride in the quality \nof care and attention she gives to her patients. Yet she often found \nherself burdened with an endless trail of paperwork and the time-\nconsuming task of battling insurance companies and tracking down \nclaims. Like so many of her colleagues, Anita is frustrated that she \nmust spend so much time fighting administrative hurdles and navigating \nbureaucratic red tape. After years of training to become a health \nprofessional, Anita wishes she had more time to do just that--provide \ncare to her patients. She writes:\n\n       I would much rather spend the time seeing clients than \n     negotiating automated telephone systems and waiting to speak \n     to a person several hours per week. It is a total waste of \n     human time and talent.\n\n  I heard from Melissa, a self-employed writer from Newport, whose \nunpredictable income leaves her unable to afford health insurance. \nWithout coverage, Melissa knows that she risks being one serious \nillness away from what she calls the ``brink of disaster.'' Through the \nstress and fear of not having insurance--through that brink of disaster \nthat she lives on--Melissa waits and hopes that she doesn't get sick \nbecause that is the only option she has in this, our great country.\n  Rhonda is a mother in Coventry. She told me about her struggle to get \nhealth care coverage for her family. As if raising her two sons wasn't \nenough work, this single mother works two jobs to make ends meet. \nAlthough her employer offered health coverage at an affordable price, \nRhonda's limited income could not be stretched to cover the additional \ncost of coverage for her children. So her sons went without insurance \nfor 3 years. Rhonda, like so many hard-working Americans, was caught \nbetween a rock and a hard place--making slightly more than the eligible \nincome to qualify for health coverage through State assistance plans, \nbut not making enough money to afford health care coverage on her own. \nShe prayed every day her children would be spared from sickness or \ninjury.\n  I also received a story from Richard, in Providence, who told me \nabout his father--a hard-working man who left work for 6 months to \nconcentrate on fighting a battle against cancer. Sadly, just when \nRichard's father needed the support the most, his company dropped him \nfrom their health plan. Without coverage and unable to pay the costs \nout of pocket, his father was forced off his chemotherapy treatment. \nRichard's father was very lucky. The doctors cleared him of cancer. \nHowever, the medical bills were so high that Richard's parents lost \ntheir home. Remarkably, after all his family has been through, Richard \nfeels fortunate that at least his father was covered for part of his \ntreatment, but he urged us to fix ``this old and broken system.''\n\n  For these Rhode Islanders and for millions of more Americans silently \nsuffering through their own personal catastrophes all over the country, \nwe now have to be a voice. We must improve the quality of our health \ncare, we must develop our Nation's health information infrastructure, \nand we must invest in preventing disease.\n  We must protect existing coverage where it is good and improve it \nwhen it is not. As the President said, if you like your health plan, \nyou get to keep it. We must dial down the paperwork wars, and dial up \nbetter information for American health care consumers. We must speak \nfor the 46 million Americans, 9 million of whom are children, who right \nnow as I stand here on the Senate floor have no health insurance at \nall.\n  As Families USA reports, 47 million actually understates the problem \nbecause during the course of this year nearly 90 million Americans \nwill, at one point or another, go without health insurance.\n  We look around at dark and tumultuous economic times. Yet looking \nbeyond the immediate economic perils we face, a $35 trillion unfunded \nliability for Medicare--not a penny set against it--is bearing down on \nus. As the President told the AMA earlier this week:\n\n     . . . if we fail to act, Federal spending on Medicaid and \n     Medicare will grow, over the coming decades, by an amount \n     almost equal to the amount our government currently spends on \n     our Nation's defense. In fact, it will eventually grow larger \n     than what our government spends on anything else today. It's \n     a scenario that will swamp our Federal and State budgets and \n     impose a vicious choice of either unprecedented tax hikes, \n     overwhelming deficits, or drastic cuts in our Federal and \n     State budgets.\n\n  We can only avoid that vicious choice by reforming the health care \nsystem. We are committed to making sure every American has health \ninsurance coverage, but meaningful reform will take more than that. \nThink of it this way. If you had a boat out in the ocean and people \noverboard around it in danger of drowning, surely you would try to \nbring them all into the boat. But if the boat itself was sinking, if \nthe boat itself was on fire, you would have to do more than just bring \nthem on board. You have to repair the boat. You have to get it floating \nand moving forward.\n  That is what we have to do with our health care system. It is not \nenough just to provide coverage for all Americans, we also have to \nright this ship. This means improving the quality of health care and \ninvesting in prevention, especially in those areas where improved \nquality of care and investment in prevention means lower cost so that, \nfor instance, 100,000 Americans will no longer die each and every year \nbecause of entirely avoidable medical errors. This also means reforming \nhow we pay for health care so what we pay for is what we want from \nhealth care.\n  Government must act. At last, government must act. The problems of \nhealth care in America are rooted in market failures. We cannot wait \nfor the market to cure a problem rooted in market failure. It is \nnonsense. We have to change the rules of the game.\n  We also can't pay for one thing and expect another. We have to change \nthe incentives. We do not expect Americans to go out and build our \nhighway infrastructure for us. We do that through government. We can't \nsit around and wait for our health information infrastructure to build \nitself either. We cannot expect quality improvement and prevention of \nillness to flourish when we make it a money-losing proposition for the \npeople who have to make it work. We have to change those incentives \ntoo.\n  Opponents of reform are arguing that this process is going too \nquickly, that we need to slow down, wait, pause. They are loading down \nthis bill with hundreds of amendments--170 amendments alone on the \nsection that deals with preventive care. But haven't we waited long \nenough? Slow is what we have done for years, even decades. When I hear \nfrom Rhode Islanders with the stories I reported here, such as Richard \nand Rhonda and Melissa and Anita, I think not that we are going too \nfast, I think we are irresponsibly, even frighteningly late in getting \nafter this problem and taking up this charge.\n  If we wait much longer, we may be too late to avoid that tidal wave \nof costs that threatens to swamp our ship of state. To those who say \nslow down, I say keep up.\n  Opponents of reform want people to believe that a system that costs \ntoo much, that lets insurance company bureaucrats make decisions about \nour health care; that is riddled with error, duplication, and waste; \nthat leaves nearly 50 million Americans without any health insurance, \nis acceptable.\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\nEveryone says they want reform, but unless we get moving, all we will \nend up with is more of the same. As President Obama said this week: The \nstatus quo is unsustainable.\n  Some opponents want to slow this down because they know if they slow \nit down they can kill it. We cannot let that happen. The stakes are way \ntoo high.\n  The anguish out there, as you know in Oregon, as I see in Rhode \nIsland, as all our colleagues see across the country, is real and it is \neverywhere. At last we can do something about it. Now is the time. This \nis the moment. Let us make this work. Let us, together, find a way to \nmake this work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent I may proceed as if in morning \nbusiness for approximately 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, and to all present in terms of staff, \nthis is Friday, and here we are at 1:25. I apologize to the \ndoorkeepers, I apologize to the elevator operators, I don't want to \nkeep you here for a long time, so I will quit apologizing, but there \nhave been some things happening with regard to health care.\n  The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island indicated the need to \nmove forward on health care. Everybody agrees to that. The pace of it, \nwhat is going on, is a real concern, so I do have some remarks to make. \nI will try to make this as quickly and succinctly as possible so \neverybody can go about their business. I see smiles from the pages, in \nregards if I can just hurry up and get through my comments.\n  Yesterday, in the HELP Committee's markup of the Kennedy-Dodd health \ncare reform bill, we had a very good discussion about the proper use \nand the objectives of something called government-conducted comparative \neffectiveness research.\n  I know that is getting into the weeds in regard to health care \nlanguage and health care acronyms. It is called CER; remember that \nterm, ``CER.'' It is going to be around for a long time because it has \nbecome quite controversial in regard to our health care discussion and \nwhat eventually passes. CER is research that compares the relative \noutcomes of two medical treatments for the same condition to determine \nwhich one is better. That is a good thing. It is a good thing to \ndisseminate and to inform doctors and everybody in the health care \ndelivery system--nurses, health care providers, pharmacists, et \ncetera--it is a good thing. But the first problem with CER is that not \nevery patient is the same. What is better for one patient may not be \nbetter, or could actually be worse, for another. For this reason \ndoctors and patients must be able to deviate from the results of \nsomething called CER, or a master plan or a master evaluation that \ncould come out of Washington from an outfit called CMS, under the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  The situation is patients must be able to deviate from the results \nand make treatment decisions on a case-by-case individualized basis. \nThat is what we all want in terms of our treatment with our doctors.\n  The other major problem, I submit, is that CER has been used by other \ngovernments, such as the United Kingdom, to base treatment decisions \nnot just on relative effectiveness but on relative cost. There is the \nrub. If CER is going to inform doctors and everybody in the medical \ncommunity that this kind of treatment or this kind of best practice is \nthe arena in which you should operate or pasture you should operate in, \nthat is OK. But if it is used to control costs as opposed to care, then \nwe have a problem.\n  By giving priority to the relative costs of the treatments being \ncompared, the government can deny access to health care based on what I \nwould call pseudoscience, under the guise of CER. That brings me back \nto yesterday's discussion on CER on the health care markup. The \nKennedy-Dodd bill includes a section that establishes a new Center for \nHealth Outcomes Research and Evaluation. This outfit is to conduct and \nsupport comparative effectiveness research.\n  Section 219(h)(1)--if that isn't getting into the weeds, I don't know \nwhat is--includes the following language relating to the practical \neffect of CER, or comparative effectiveness research. That would, \nagain, be conducted by the center.\n\n       Center reports and recommendations shall not be construed \n     as mandates for payment, coverage and treatment.\n\n  That language was in there to get at this problem for those of us who \nworry that CER will be used by CMS--that is another acronym. That is \nthe outfit that runs Medicaid and Medicare, in terms of services. These \nare the people who count the beans, these are the people who want to \nturn the red beans into black beans. These are the people into cost \ncontainment. These are the people who many times drive board members in \nsmall hospitals crazy.\n  At any rate, to take away the worry, that language was put in there: \nSenate reports and recommendations shall not be construed as mandates \nfor payments, coverage and treatment. They thought that was enough to \nprotect us in regard to CER dictating medical care and stepping in \nbetween you and your doctor.\n  Let's go back to those words ``shall not be construed as mandates.'' \nWhat does that mean? ``Mandate'' means to force, compel, bind. This \nlanguage says the CER shall not be interpreted as forcing CMS, \nVeterans' Administration or the Department of Defense to restrict \npayments to doctors based on its results.\n  Senator Mikulski and I and Dr. Coburn as well had a very lively \ndiscussion about the intent of this language. Senator Mikulski said the \nintent of the language was to keep the right to make treatment \ndecisions with the doctor and the patient, not with the government. I \ncertainly agree with that.\n  Senator Mikulski has worked long and hard on this bill, and I respect \nher for that. She is a good colleague and a good friend. I agree with \nthis intent.\n  But as I pointed out to the Senator, the language in the Kennedy-Dodd \nbill does not accomplish our common intent of saying the government is \nnot mandated or forced to use the results of this comparative \neffectiveness research to make payment decisions. Whether you are paid \nor not in regard to Medicare or, for that matter, Medicaid is not the \nsame thing as prohibiting or preventing CMS from doing so.\n  In order to vigorously protect the rights of patients and doctors to \nmake treatment decisions against the danger that the government will \ninterfere in that process, I believe the bill must prohibit the \ngovernment from using the results of CER in making payment, coverage, \nor treatment decisions. Sorry, you cannot have that, you have got to \nhave this treatment, because it is a best medicine practice, regardless \nof the fact that maybe you and your doctor have had that treatment \nbefore and the doctor thinks that treatment is the best treatment for \nyou.\n  I offered new language, and the new language would have placed a \nclear, bright-line firewall between the conduct of CER--which, by the \nway, I think is essential to advancing medical science; it is a good \nthing--and the use of its results to restrict your doctor from using \nhis or her best judgment when treating you.\n  My language, which I further modified at the suggestion of Senator \nMikulski, read: ``Center reports and recommendations are prohibited \nfrom being used by any government entity for payment, coverage, or \ntreatment decisions.''\n  Senator Mikulski agreed to consider my suggestion over last night, \nalong with Senator Dodd. I appreciate that. But today when the HELP \nCommittee reconvened in our markup, Senator Mikulski and the majority \nrefused to accept my language and offered counterlanguage that would \nbasically put us back to square one and, in my view, would do nothing \nto protect patients and doctors from CMS or any other government agency \ninterfering in their treatment decisions.\n  When I asked why my language was unacceptable, which I thought was \nacceptable for everybody when we left yesterday, I was told that the \ndecision\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\nto say my language was not acceptable was based on concerns by \n``Washington policy experts.''\n  I said: Who is that? Which Washington policy expert said my language \nwas not acceptable?\n  When pressed on which policy experts, we learned that the directive \ncame straight down from the White House. Why would the White House be \nso concerned about prohibiting the Federal Government from using CER to \nrestrict payments to doctors or to direct doctors to follow specific \ntreatment orders? Why would the White House do this on this in-the-\nweeds proposal, which is not an in-the-weeds proposal at all, it is \nabout what the government is going to do or tell doctors and patients \nwhat they can expect.\n  It is clear from statements made by this administration that they see \nCER as the golden ring for cost containment. The President said when \nasked, how on Earth are you going to pay for the health care bill, We \nare going to cut Medicare payments.\n  How are you going to do that?\n  Well, if you have a CER golden ring that comes down from CMS or the \nNational Institutes of Health for cost containment, you can see: This \nresearch says that you should follow these practices, not those \npractices and those practices, or, these practices would certainly cost \nless.\n  I do not think that is a good thing. From OMB Director Peter Orszag, \nto the NIH Director, going on to the National Economic Council \nDirector, Larry Summers, and indications from our new Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, a good friend, former \nGovernor of Kansas, all have pointed to the huge potential of CER to be \nused to contain costs, not to recommend procedures best for patients \nand the doctors as determined by the patient and the doctor, but by CER \nto control costs.\n  That is why the White House does not want to prohibit CMS or any \ngovernment agency from using the results of CER to deny you and your \ndoctor the right to choose the treatment that is best for you.\n  After all of that was said and done, and a lot was said and not much \ndone, I got quite a lecture this morning in regard to my use of the \nword ``rationing'' to describe what this could lead to. This lecture \nwas referred to as a scare tactic. They indicated that I was using the \nword ``rationing'' out there as a scare tactic to scare people to say \nwe do not want health care reform.\n  I find that rather condescending. I find that demeaning. And it is \ncertainly not accurate. You tell me, when Medicare refuses to pay your \ndoctor if he or she decides you need a particular course of treatment \nthat deviates from the government standard, what would you call it? I \nwould call it rationing.\n  That is the danger. It is not a scare tactic. Health care rationing \nis happening right now in this country. We may not have explicit \nrationing such as in the United Kingdom where the government refuses to \ngive elderly people drugs to treat their macular degeneration until \nthey have already gone blind in one eye--not making that up--or refuses \nkidney cancer drugs for terminal patients because it is not worth the \nmoney to extend their life by 6 months. That is rationing.\n  But we do have de facto rationing, because Medicare and Medicaid \nrefuse to pay doctors anything close to what their costs are. By the \nway, it's the same thing for pharmacists, the same thing for home \nhealth care, and for all of the providers who provide our health care \ntreatment. This means those doctors cannot afford to take Medicare and \nMedicaid patients--they make the decision then--and it means that those \nindividuals do not have access to care. That is rationing I am talking \nabout.\n  I am talking about a doctor who makes a decision: I am only getting \npaid about 70 cents in terms of the dollar in regard to my cost in \nregard to Medicare patients. I have to hire extra people to keep up \nwith paperwork and regulations. Those people do not exist in the rural \nhealth care system. We have to try to find them. So it is a lot easier \nif I drop the Medicare Program.\n  That comes as a sudden jolt and a sudden decision that is not fair in \nregard to the patients who were being treated by that doctor in terms \nof Medicare. That is what we call rationing right now in regard to the \nUnited States of America.\n  We know the administration wants to use CER to contain costs. We know \nCMS has a history of denying full payment based on cost. I am not going \nto take the time on the Senate floor right now to go into all of the \nproblems that CMS has posed for the health care delivery system. Again, \nthese are folks who have a difficult task. They are trying to change \nthe red beans into black beans so that health care does not cost so \nmuch. But in terms of their decisions here in Washington in regard to \nwhat care is going to be paid for and what is not, they are an absolute \nnightmare to every hospital administrator, every hospital board member \nin the 350 or so hospitals I have in Kansas, and the 83 critical access \nhospitals I have in Kansas.\n  We do not have a very good relationship with CMS. What we have is a \nmeaningful dialog, most of the time, when yet another regulation comes \ndown the pike to contain cost, most of which the doctors have never \nheard of, not to mention everybody else in the health care delivery \nsystem. I can go into quite a rant, as you can expect from my comments \nin regard to CMS and what they do and what they do not do.\n  Why is the majority, why are the Democrats, resisting any language to \nprotect patients and their doctors, you and your doctor, and your right \nto make the right treatment decision for you? Why are they trying to \nmuzzle my warnings that this could lead to the rationing of health \ncare? It boils down to the fact that they do not want the American \npeople to know what their true plans could actually be. That is why \nthey are shoving this massive health care reform bill through Congress \nat warp speed, having markups before we even have complete language or \ncost estimates.\n  We heard from the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island about the \nneed for health care reform, and the fact that he was complaining about \nover 100 amendments in the HELP Committee. My goodness. Almost every \nmajor bill I have been associated with, you have literally hundreds of \namendments. Many fall by the wayside, many are withdrawn. We have dealt \nwith 17, 18 of them as of today.\n  Senator Mikulski and Senator Dodd did a very good job in that \nrespect, along with our ranking member, Senator Enzi from Wyoming. But \nit would be helpful, if we are going to move forward with the health \ncare reform, if we had the bill. We do not have the bill in the HELP \nCommittee. We have one section of the bill, and then we have a \nCongressional Budget Office score on one-sixth of the bill that is $1 \ntrillion. And, boy, did that shock everybody. Say $1 trillion for one-\nsixth of the bill. What is the whole bill going to cost? That estimate \nis somewhere in the neighborhood of $4 trillion. How on Earth are you \ngoing to pay, in the Finance Committee, the pay-for committee, $4 \ntrillion for health care reform, and take it out of the health care \ndelivery system?\n  I do not think you can do it. But we do not know, because we have not \nseen the legislation. We are being asked to go on a deadline schedule \nto produce amendments on things such as CER that worry people in regard \nto possible rationing by a date certain or a time certain, and we have \nnot even seen the bill we are amending.\n  I have never been through a situation like that. Not to mention the \nspecific cost estimates by CBO. This is not right. That is why Chairman \nBaucus in the Finance Committee had at least the good sense to postpone \nthe markup of his bill until we could work this out. That is why \nslowing down does not necessarily mean that everybody is opposed to \nhealth care reform. It means we ought to get it right.\n  We at least ought to have a bill to read, to know what we are dealing \nwith. I think it is because they know that if Americans knew what they \nwere doing, they would never stand for it. I think we need to get this \nout to the public, and the public will hopefully fully understand it. I \nam not going to allow this. Personally, I am going to continue to shout \nit from the rooftops and beware of what lurks under the banner of \n``reform'' to tell every doctor, every hospital administrator, every \nhospital board member, anybody who has anything to do with the health \ncare delivery system, watch out in regard to CER.\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\n  It could be the golden ring of cost containment, and it could put you \nout of business. It could put you out of business. We have examples of \nCMS doing exactly that. So do not wake up one day and realize that the \ngovernment has taken over your health care the same way they have taken \nover the banks and the auto industry. Do not let them ration your \nhealth care. Rationing is not what we need.

Mr. President, we have worked several days this week trying \nto move forward on the tourism bill. It is an extremely important piece \nof legislation. It is important to every State in the Union. That is \nwhy it is so heavily bipartisan.\n  We have almost 50 cosponsors of this legislation. Lots of Republicans \ncosponsored this legislation--Bond, Brownback, Enzi, Graham, Martinez, \nThune, Wicker, Alexander, Cochran, Ensign, Vitter--and I am sure there \nare others. It is a bipartisan bill.\n  We have already wasted so much time. We had to file cloture on a \nmotion to proceed to this heavily bipartisan bill. Once we were on the \nbill, I spoke to the Republican leader. We thought we had a pathway to \nhaving civility here, so the Republicans would try to help us. But, of \ncourse, we learned yesterday the GOP is still saying no; Democrats need \nto know when they bring bills up, we are going to extend debate as long \nas we can, even if we cannot win.\n  We said: OK. You offer--you, the Republicans--four amendments. And \nthey did. They picked all the amendments they wanted to offer--not \ngermane to this bill.\n  I said: OK. They were all involving TARP or the money that we all \nknow about by now. So I said, and I told the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nSanders: If the Republicans want to offer nongermane amendments, I will \nbe happy to have you offer your amendment.\n  His is a fairly simple amendment. We see what is happening in the \nworld today as it relates to oil. Again, we are seeing speculation. We \nknow it was there before, we are seeing it again. We have a large \ninventory, with no reason for the price to spike. But we have those \npeople, these commodity traders, who are rolling the dice as if they \nwere coming to Las Vegas to roll the dice on the oil because they think \nthe price is going to go up.\n  What Sanders wanted to do is basically nothing unique. He wanted to \nmake sure the entity that is responsible for making sure there are no \nshenanigans being conducted by these traders, that we pass some \nlegislation saying: You have to do better than what you have done, in \neffect. I am paraphrasing the picture of that legislation. It was \nfairly noncontroversial. But the Republicans said no. Whom are they \ntrying to protect?\n  So we were generous in our offer. What was the other amendment they \nwanted to offer? They still had another amendment. I said: Fine, go \nahead. The Senate should take hard votes. I am not concerned about my \nfolks having to take difficult votes.\n  The Presiding officer knows, in the short time he has been here, that \nwe have taken some hard votes. That is what we are elected to do. We \nare not elected to run from issues. To be clear, some of the amendments \nwhich my Republican colleagues wanted to include would have been votes \nthat have nothing to do with this bill. I said: Let's do it anyway.\n  But the standard for a Democrat offering an amendment that is not \ngermane, I guess, is different. You can have four. I said: We do not \neven need the same number of amendments. I guess what is good for us is \nnot good for them.\n  I am disappointed this has not been worked out. I was going to \npropound an agreement which was agreed upon that would permit the \nprocess of legislating on this most important tourism bill, but I am \nnot able to do so because we do not have a Republican here to object. I \ncertainly am not going to take advantage of anyone because no one is \nhere to object.\n  But I do want the Record to reflect that the majority is ready to \nmove forward with amendments now or Monday. I hope that on Monday, when \nour managers are here, Senators Dorgan and Martinez, we may still be \nable to reach an agreement to begin the process of working through this \nlegislation. If we cannot, we are going to vote at 5:30 on Monday on \ncloture on this bill.\n  A decision is going to have to be made. I have not tried to jam \nanybody. We have not tried to jam anybody. We have been as reasonable \nas anybody can be. But we are going to have to make a decision on this \nlegislation.\n  The State of Oregon, the home of the Presiding Officer, a couple \nyears ago I took my family to Oregon. Every summer we take all 5 \nchildren and all 16 grandchildren and try to go someplace. We went to \nOregon. We rented a home on the beautiful coast that was stark. For 8 \ndays the Sun did not shine. But I loved it. Being from the desert, I \nloved that rain a little bit. It was wonderful.\n  I would love to go back. There were so many things to do around \nthere. We drove 20 miles to see a waterfall. The water fell some 300 or \n400 feet. It was not a lot of falling, but it dropped a long way.\n  The only point I am making is there is so much for people to see. \nYears ago, UNLV had a great basketball team. Yours was good, but theirs \nwas great--the Tarkanian years. So I flew into Portland with my wife. \nWe drove over to the coast, down the coast, and went to--I think it was \ncalled Salem, the University of Oregon, I think, or Oregon State, \nwhatever university it was where they had this tournament.\n  I watched UNLV play. The reason I mention it, driving down that coast \nwas so beautiful. But every State, every State I have ever been to--I \nhave been to most of them. I think I have been to all of them--have \nbeautiful things for people to come and see. That is what this \nlegislation is all about.\n  The No. 1, 2 or 3 most important driver of the economy in every State \nis tourism, every State. It is the same in Oregon, where unemployment \nnow is over 12 percent. We can get more people to come to Oregon or \nNevada. It would be tremendous for those economies. That is what this \nlegislation does. It sets up a public-private partnership in the model, \nfrankly, of what the Las Vegas Convention Center did, which has been so \nsuccessful. That is what this legislation is all about.\n  It is bipartisan legislation. Because we could not work anything on \namendments, I hope we will get cloture on this bill. But whether we do \nor not, I am happy to work with my Republican colleagues to move \nforward on this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/19/senate-section/article/S6839-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6839-S6840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I wanted to go into a bit more detail \nabout the cash for clunkers provision the Senate passed yesterday as \npart of the $105 billion war supplemental. I continue to believe that \nthe American people would be appalled to learn the specifics of this \nlemon legislation. Here is a quick summary:\n  Any person who trades in a car he or she has owned and insured for at \nleast 1 year that has a combined fuel economy value of 18 miles or less \nper gallon is eligible for: $3,500 toward the purchase of a new car if \nit has a fuel economy value at least 4 miles per gallon higher than the \ntrade-in, or a new truck if it has a fuel economy value at least 2 \nmiles per gallon higher than the trade-in; or $4,500 toward the \npurchase of a new car if it has a fuel economy value at least 10 miles \nper gallon higher than the trade-in, or a new truck if it has a fuel \neconomy value at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the trade-in.\n  The auto dealer that sells the new car, must accept the trade-in and \ncrush it, then submit paperwork to the Department of Transportation, \nDOT, and the money is directly wired to the auto dealer. This is ripe \nfor fraud and abuse and the bill provides a penalty of a mere $15,000 \nfine for each abuse.\n  Only cars costing less than $45,000 and purchased between July 1, \n2009, and November 1, 2009, are eligible.\n  Lastly, I want to talk about how this clunker was salvaged by the \nDemocrats placing it in a war supplemental bill. On January 14, 2009, \nseveral Senators introduced a cash for clunkers bill that would provide \nbetween $2,500 and $4,500 toward the purchase of a new or used car as \nlong as the trade-in had a fuel economy rating of less than 18 miles a \ngallon and the new or used car had a fuel economy rating exceeding \ntarget for that class of vehicles by at least 25 percent, as determined \nby DOT.\n  Then on May 21, 2009, a new cash for clunkers bill was introduced by \na different group of Senators who limited the benefit to only the \npurchase of a new car, and removed the requirement that the new car \nmust have a fuel economy rating exceeding the target by at least 25 \npercent and replaced it with a more lax requirement that a new car \nmerely had to be 2 miles per gallon more fuel efficient.\n  Senators Collins and Feinstein wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street \nJournal on June 11, 2009, stating:\n\n       It's amazing how quickly a good idea can go bad in \n     Washington . . . Our ``Cash for Clunkers'' proposal was a \n     win-win for the environment and the economy. Then Detroit \n     auto industry lobbyists got involved. Soon a rival bill \n     emerged . . . tailored perfectly to the auto industry's \n     specifications. They claim their bill would have resulted in \n     32 percent more oil savings and reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions. And then Detroit's bill was placed into the war \n     supplemental and will likely be signed into law without ever \n     having been reviewed by the committee that has jurisdiction \n     over such legislation or being available for amendment by the \n     full Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/19/senate-section/article/S6844-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD REFUGEE DAY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, tomorrow is World Refugee Day, a day to \npause and recognize the millions of people who have been forced from \ntheir homes by natural disaster, conflict, or in some cases \npersecution. They often only carry with them the clothes on their backs \nand the new burdens and trauma that accompany the title of ``refugee.'' \nYet as we acknowledge the tragedy of their loss, we can also celebrate \ntheir enduring resilience. Even after years of suffering and \nhopelessness, many refugees never give up hope that they will return to \ntheir homes to be allowed to live peaceful and full lives. They \ncontinue to struggle to ensure that their basic rights are protected \nand basic needs met.\n  Today, the overall number of refugees and internally displaced people \nis estimated at 42 million. The refugee experience cuts across borders \nand countries, but the circumstances that give rise to displacement are \noften unique. There are so many crises to talk about--in Colombia, Sri \nLanka, Thailand, and Zimbabwe, for example--but I want to briefly \nhighlight three in particular.\n  First, in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, a humanitarian \ncrisis continues to unfold as more than 2 million Pakistanis have been \ndisplaced from their homes due to fighting between militants and the \nPakistani Government. The Pakistani people have borne additional \nhardship as friends, families, and strangers--already strained by the \nglobal economic crisis--have opened their homes and lives to many of \nthe displaced. We must do more to encourage this generosity through \ncreative means as well as providing traditional aid to the hundreds of \nthousands in camps.\n  I also wish to highlight the eastern Democratic Republic of the \nCongo. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the \nfighting between the Congolese military and armed groups in eastern \nCongo, forcing people into squalid camps where children are subject to \nforced recruitment and women suffer unspeakable levels of sexual \nviolence. In eastern Congo and so many other conflict zones, rape and \nother forms of gender-based violence have become not just outgrowths of \nwar and its brutality--they are used as weapons of war. We must do more \nto stop this horrifying practice, to provide protection to these \nvulnerable refugee populations, and to address the underlying causes of \neastern Congo's conflicts.\n  Third, there continue to be more than 250,000 refugees from the \nDarfur region of Sudan in eastern Chad in addition to some 190,000 \ninternally displaced people--Chadians--in the area. Moreover, millions \nof people remain internally displaced in Darfur. These people do not \nhave access to many basic humanitarian needs such as water, health \ncare, and education, and they continue to be subject to attacks by \ngovernment forces and armed rebel groups. We need to address their \nneeds and enhance civilian protection, while working to stand up a \nviable peace process for Darfur and the wider region.\n  Finally, World Refugee Day is also an occasion to celebrate the work \nof donor governments including our own, private individuals, \nnongovernmental organizations, and agencies like the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees that are working to meet the needs of \nthe displaced. To those who have given generously, to those who have \nlived among the displaced, and to those who report their stories and \nrefuse to allow them to be forgotten, I say, thank you.\n  Nonetheless, we must do more to bring attention to the plight of the \ntens of millions of refugees around the world and to ensure their \nfundamental right to be safe. The theme of this year's World Refugee \nDay is ``Real People, Real Needs''--a reminder of the human face of \nrefugee crises around the world. Today, let us see that face and commit \nourselves to meeting the real needs of refugees and IDPs around the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/19/senate-section/article/S6844-5", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6844-S6845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    CONGRATULATING THE ORLANDO MAGIC\n\n Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nrecognize the Orlando Magic on a tremendous 2008-09 season; which ended \non Sunday as the Los Angeles Lakers won a hard fought victory to win \nthe NBA Finals. Although the Magic didn't end up taking home the \nchampionship trophy,\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\nthey still turned in an inspiring performance throughout their \nimprobable postseason run.\n  Four years ago, few would have imagined the Orlando Magic would be \nthe 2008-2009 Eastern Conference Champions. During the 2003-2004 \nseason, the Magic finished last in the league with a record of 21 wins \nand 61 losses. Since that time, the Magic organization has assembled a \nteam that has made the Orlando community and now all of Florida proud.\n  I commend coach Stan Van Gundy for leading his team to their third \nconsecutive postseason and the team's second NBA Finals appearance. \nWhether it was overcoming long odds to beat the defending champion \nBoston Celtics or defeating LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, \nthe team proved that when ``Blue and White Ignite,'' it is tough to \nbeat the Orlando Magic.\n  For their hard work and sportsmanship, I would like to recognize \nDwight Howard, Hedo Turkoglu, Rashard Lewis, rookie Courtney Lee and \nthe rest of the team for setting a tremendous example.\n  Today, all Floridians are proud of the Orlando Magic for having such \na memorable season. I congratulate the Magic organization and their \nfans on a great season and look forward to the next season as the team \nbuilds on this year's success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/19/senate-section/article/S6845-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING MAIKI AIU LAKE\n\n Mr. INOUYE.

Her unwavering dedication to her students and art has proved \nhula more than a dance; the elegance and beauty exhibited in hula \nenriches its audience, and instills a deeper understanding and \nappreciation for Hawaii's artistic heritage. Her Halau Hula is renowned \namong many for its attention to detail and profound respect for the \ntraditions of the Native Hawaiian people. Through her passion as both \nan artist and teacher, Aunty Maiki has touched countless lives. She \nremains an enduring influence whose legacy continues through the work \nof her many students and devoted friends.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the \ngreat accomplishments of Maiki Aiu Lake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/19/senate-section/article/S6845-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/19/senate-section/article/S6845-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/19/senate-section/article/S6845-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 10:45 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 813.

Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am pleased to submit the enclosed \n     draft bill to authorize $1,196,230,000 for Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA) major facility construction projects \n     for Fiscal Year 2010 and $196,227,000 for major facility \n     leases for Fiscal Year 2010.\n       Title 38 U.S.C. section 8104(a) (2) requires statutory \n     authorization for all VA major medical facility construction \n     projects and all major medical facility leases prior to the \n     appropriation of funds. In accordance with title 38, the \n     draft bill authorizes five major medical facility \n     construction projects and fifteen major facility leases. The \n     five major medical facility construction projects are located \n     in: Livermore, California; Walla Walla, Washington; \n     Louisville, Kentucky; Denver, Colorado; and Bay Pines, \n     Florida. Previously, Congress authorized funds for Denver and \n     Bay Pines. This proposed bill would authorize additional \n     funds necessary to continue with these projects.\n       The proposed project in Livermore is for construction, \n     including the acquisition of\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\n     land, necessary for the realignment of services and closure \n     projects. The proposed project in Walla Walla is for \n     construction of a Multi-Specialty Care Facility. The proposed \n     project in Louisville is for the construction, including the \n     acquisition of land, for a new medical facility.\n       The proposed project in Denver will provide for the \n     replacement of the existing medical center. Additional \n     authorization is required to complete this project. The \n     proposed project in Bay Pines is for construction of both \n     outpatient and inpatient improvements. Additional \n     authorization is required to complete this project.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this legislative proposal \n     to the Congress and that its enactment would be in accord \n     with the program of the President.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Eric K.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nexpand and strengthen cooperative efforts to monitor, restore, and \nprotect the resource productivity, water quality, and marine ecosystems \nof the Gulf of Mexico; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, today I introduce an important piece of \nlegislation that will help protect and preserve the health and \nproductivity of one of our Nation's most important bodies of water--the \nGulf of Mexico.\n  The Gulf of Mexico Restoration and Protection Act will serve as a \nnational and international model for the collaborative management of \nlarge marine ecosystems. Specific provisions of this Act will be \nadministered by the Gulf of Mexico Program, formed in 1988 by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency as a non-regulatory, inclusive \npartnership that collaborates with federal offices, state, and local \ngovernments and the private sector in each of 5 Gulf States--all \ncommitted to helping preserve and protect the Gulf.\n  Collectively, the fertile waters and seabed of the Gulf of Mexico \nrepresent the 6th largest economy in the world with a total economic \ntrade value of almost $6 trillion. These waters are now threatened by \nexcessive nutrient loads and invasive species as well as the \nsignificant deterioration of many coastal wetlands as a result of \nhurricane and tropical storm damage.\n  The future of the Gulf's environmental stability is vital to \nAmerica's economy and security. This legislation authorizes much needed \nadditional funds to the Gulf of Mexico Program and finally puts it on a \npath toward more equal footing with other national great water body \nprograms. Members of the Gulf of Mexico program are working together to \nsecure the Gulf's future. It is time for this critical region to be \nrecognized for its strategic importance. This legislation is an \nimportant step toward ensuring the Gulf receives the kind of support it \ndeserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/19/senate-section/article/S6848-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 193--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR ALL IRANIAN CITIZENS WHO \nEMBRACE THE VALUES OF FREEDOM, HUMAN RIGHTS, CIVIL LIBERTIES, AND RULE \n                     OF LAW, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Graham, Mr. Brownback, \nMr. Kyl, Mr. Bunning, and Mr. Cornyn) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 195\n\n       Whereas Bishop Museum was founded in 1889 in Honolulu, \n     Hawai`i by Charles Reed Bishop in memory of his beloved wife, \n     Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the great granddaughter of \n     Kamehameha I, to house the personal legacies and bequests of \n     the royal Kamehameha and Kalakaua families;\n       Whereas the mission of Bishop Museum since its inception \n     has been to study, preserve, and tell the stories of the \n     cultures and natural history of Hawai`i and the Pacific;\n       Whereas the collections of Bishop Museum include more than \n     24,000,000 objects, collectively the largest Hawai`i and \n     Pacific area collection in the world, which includes more \n     than 1,200,000 cultural objects representing Native Hawaiian, \n     Pacific Island, and Hawai`i immigrant life, more than 125,000 \n     historical publications (including many in the Hawaiian \n     language), more than 1,000,000 historical photographs, films, \n     works of art, audio recordings, and manuscripts, and more \n     than 22,000,000 plant and animal specimens;\n       Whereas a primary goal of Bishop Museum is to serve and \n     represent the interests of Native Hawaiians by advancing \n     Native Hawaiian culture and education, protecting the \n     collections and increasing access to them, and strengthening \n     the museum's connections with the schools of Hawai`i;\n       Whereas the national significance of Bishop Museum's \n     cultural collection lies in the Native Hawaiian collection, \n     which collectively represents the largest public resource in \n     the world documenting a way of life, and has been a source of \n     knowledge and inspiration for numerous visitors, researchers, \n     students, native craftsmen, teachers, and community and \n     spiritual leaders over the years, especially since the \n     cultural revival, which has been steadily growing and gaining \n     in popularity;\n       Whereas more than [300,000] people visit Bishop Museum each \n     year to learn about Hawaiian culture and experience Hawaiian \n     Hall;\n       Whereas the desire to see Hawaiian Hall and to learn about \n     Hawaiian culture is the primary reason [400,000] visitors \n     each year give for visiting Bishop Museum;\n       Whereas Hawaiian Hall is the Nation's only showcase of its \n     size, proportion, design, and historic context that is \n     devoted to the magnificent legacy of Hawai`i's kings and \n     queens, and the legacies of its Native Hawaiian people of all \n     walks of life and ages;\n       Whereas Hawaiian Hall, constructed between 1889 and 1903 \n     and 1 of 3 interconnected structures known as the Hawaiian \n     Hall Complex, is considered a masterpiece of late Victorian \n     museum design with its Kamehameha blue stone exterior \n     quarried on site and extensive use of native koa wood, and is \n     one of the few examples of Romanesque Richardsonian style \n     museum buildings to have survived essentially unchanged;\n       Whereas Hawaiian Hall, designed by noted Hawai`i architects \n     C.B. Ripley and C.W. Dickey in 1898, was placed on the \n     National Register of Historic Places in 1982, based on its \n     unique combination of architectural, cultural, scientific, \n     educational, and historical significance;\n       Whereas the restoration and renovation of Hawaiian Hall and \n     its exhibits by noted Hawai`i architect Glenn Mason and noted \n     national and international museum exhibit designer Ralph \n     Appelbaum are integral to the museum's ability to fulfill its \n     mission and achieve its primary goal of serving and \n     representing the interests of Native Hawaiians;\n       Whereas the restoration and renovation of Hawaiian Hall, \n     begun in 2005, included the building of a new gathering place \n     in an enclosed, glass walled atrium, improved access to the \n     hall through the installation of an elevator in the new \n     atrium to all 3 floors of the hall and other buildings in the \n     Hawaiian Hall Complex, improved collection preservation \n     through the installation of new, state-of-the-art \n     environmental controls, lighting, security, and fire \n     suppression systems, and restored original woodwork and \n     metalwork;\n       Whereas the restoration and renovation of the hall's \n     exhibits bring multiple voices and a Native Hawaiian \n     perspective to bear on Bishop Museum's treasures, by \n     conveying the essential values, beliefs, complexity, and \n     achievements of Hawaiian culture through exquisite and \n     fragile artifacts in a setting that emphasizes their ``mana'' \n     (power and essence) and the place in which they were created;\n       Whereas the new exhibit incorporates contemporary Native \n     Hawaiian artwork illustrating traditional stories, legends, \n     and practices, and contemporary Native Hawaiian voices \n     interpreting the practices and traditions through multiple \n     video presentations;\n       Whereas the new exhibit features more than 2,000 objects \n     and images from the museum's collections on the open floor, \n     mezzanines, and the center space, conceptually organized to \n     represent 3 traditional realms or ``wao'' of the Hawaiian \n     world--Kai Akea, the expansive sea from which gods and people \n     came, Wao Kanaka, the realm of people, and Wao Lani, the \n     realm of gods and the ``ali`i'' (chiefs) who descended from \n     them;\n       Whereas the new exhibit's ending display celebrates the \n     strength, glory, and achievements of Native Hawaiians with a \n     large 40-panel mural titled ``Ho`ohuli, To Cause An \n     Overturning, A Change'', made by students of Native Hawaiian \n     charter schools in collaboration with Native Hawaiian artists \n     and other students, and interpreted by Native Hawaiian \n     artists and teachers in a video presentation; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States wish to convey \n     their sincerest appreciation to Bishop Museum for its service \n     and devotion: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the reopening of historic Hawaiian Hall on \n     the 120th anniversary of the founding of Bishop Museum in \n     Honolulu, Hawai`i; and\n       (2) on the occasions of the reopening and anniversary of \n     the museum, honors and praises Bishop Museum for its work to \n     ensure the preservation, study, education, and appreciation \n     of Native Hawaiian culture and history.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution that \nrecognizes the Bishop Museum on its 120th Anniversary and celebrates \nthe reopening of its historic Hawaiian Hall.\n  The Bishop Museum was founded in 1889 by Charles Reed Bishop in honor \nof his late wife, Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the last descendant \nof the royal Kamehameha family. The museum was established to house the \nextensive collection of Hawaiian artifacts and royal family heirlooms \nof the Princess, and has expanded to include millions of artifacts, \ndocuments and photographs about Hawaii and other Pacific island \ncultures.\n  Today, the Bishop Museum is the largest museum in the State of Hawaii \nand the premier natural and cultural history institution in the \nPacific, recognized throughout the world for its cultural collections, \nresearch projects, consulting services and public educational programs. \nIt also has one of the largest natural history specimen collections in \nthe world. The museum provides a great service to the State of Hawaii \nand I commend them for their long time commitment of serving and \nrepresenting the interests of native Hawaiians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/19/senate-section/article/S6849-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6849-S6850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 196--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FREEDOM OF \n    THE PRESS, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN IRAN\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN (for himself, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Bunning) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 193, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 193) expressing support for all \n     Iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom, human \n     rights, civil liberties, and rule of law, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the resolution I submitted, on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Lieberman and others, is exactly the same as has been \nintroduced by Congressmen Berman and Pence in the House of \nRepresentatives. It is the exact same resolution. It expresses support \nfor all Iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom, human \nrights, civil liberties, rule of law, and for other purposes.\n  The resolution expresses its support for all Iranian citizens who \nembrace the values of freedom, human rights, civil liberties, and the \nrule of law, and for other purposes. It condemns the ongoing violence \nagainst demonstrators by the Government of Iran and progovernment \nmilitias as well as the ongoing government suppression of independent \nelectronic communication through interference with the Internet and \ncell phones and affirms the universality of individual rights and the \nimportance of democratic and fair elections.\n  Basically, what this is is a resolution that has been introduced in \nboth Houses, which affirms America's fundamental respect and commitment \nto human rights, to people no matter where they reside in the world.\n  It is unfortunate, in a way, that this resolution is required since \nthe administration does not want to ``meddle,'' and the President has \nrefused to speak out in support of these brave Iranian citizens, most \nof them young, who are risking their very lives to protest what was \nclearly an unfair and corrupt election.\n  What we are seeing in Iran today is sort of a sequence of events that \nshould worry all of us who have watched this before. The demonstrators, \nsome beaten, some killed, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls together the \nparticipants in the election and then says there should be no more \ndemonstrations and strong action will be taken.\n\n[[Page S6855]]\n\nThat is coupled with ejecting the world's media from Iran--first \nrestricting it and then forcing them out so as not to record events. \nUnfortunately for the Iranian mullahs, Twitter has become an incredible \nmeans of communication, as well as cameras in cell phones. The word is \nstill coming out as to the degree of oppression that is being practiced \nby the Iranian Government.\n  There is a lot I wish to say today about what is going on in Iran; \nthe fact that we, the United States of America, have a long history of \nspeaking out on behalf of people who are oppressed, who are victims of \na corrupt election. We stood tall, America did, for the workers in \nGdansk, in solidarity with Lech Walesa. We stood tall for the people of \nPrague during the Prague Spring, and we were not afraid, as Ronald \nReagan was not, to go to the Berlin Wall and say ``Take down this \nwall,'' and call an evil empire what it was, an evil empire.\n  One of the ironies of this situation that I wish to address very \nbriefly is that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's political adviser said \nThursday that the United States will regret its interference in Iran's \ndisputed election. In other words, our President says he does not want \nto go meddle and at the same time, of course, they are accusing us of \ndoing exactly that.\n  He, the adviser, said:\n\n       I hope in the case of the elections they realize their \n     interference is a mistake and that they don't repeat this \n     mistake. They will certainly regret this. They will have \n     problems reestablishing relations with Iran.\n\n  In the history of this country, since July 4, 1776, we affirmed the \nfundamental rights of all people throughout the world, and that is the \ninalienable rights granted by our Creator to life, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness. That commitment to human rights was there then \nand it is there today. The United States of America must, and this body \nmust, affirm our support for fundamental human rights of the Iranian \npeople who are being beaten and killed in the streets of Tehran and \nother cities around Iran. We are with them.\n  It is not an accident that the signs ``Where is my vote?'' are in \nEnglish. They are waiting for an expression of support from the \nGovernment and the people of the United States of America. I think this \nresolution is an important way to do so.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 193) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to S. \nRes. 198.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 198), observing the historical \n     significance of Juneteenth Independence Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week people all across the Nation are \nengaging in the oldest known celebration of the ending of slavery. It \nwas in June of 1865, that the Union soldiers landed in Galveston, TX, \nwith the news that the war had ended and that slavery finally had come \nto an end in the United States. This was 21\\1/2\\ years after the \nEmancipation Proclamation, which had become official January 1, 1863. \nThis week and specifically on June 19, we celebrate what is known as \n``Juneteenth Independence Day.'' It was on this date, June 19, that \nslaves in the Southwest finally learned of the end of slavery. Although \npassage of the thirteenth amendment in January 1863, legally abolished \nslavery, many African Americans remained in servitude due to the \ndelayed dissemination of this news across the country.\n  Since that time, over 145 years ago, the descendants of slaves have \nobserved this anniversary of emancipation as a remembrance of one of \nthe most tragic periods of our Nation's history. The suffering, \ndegradation and brutality of slavery cannot be repaired, but the memory \ncan serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever perpetrated again \non American soil.\n  All across America we also celebrate the many important achievements \nof former slaves and their descendants. We do so because in 1926, Dr. \nCarter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed such a recognition as \na way of preserving the history of African Americans and recognizing \nthe enormous contributions of a people of great strength, dignity, \nfaith, and conviction--a people who rendered their achievements for the \nbetterment and advancement of a nation once lacking in humanity towards \nthem. Every February, nationwide, we celebrate African American History \nMonth. And, every year on June 19, we celebrate ``Juneteenth \nIndependence Day.''\n  Lerone Bennett, editor, writer and lecturer has reflected on the life \nand times of Dr. Woodson. Bennett tells us that one of the most \ninspiring and instructive stories in African American history is the \nstory of Woodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West \nVirginia to the summit of academic achievement:\n\n       At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal \n     Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after \n     teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, \n     he entered high school and mastered the four-year curriculum \n     in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at \n     Berea College [in Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines \n     and studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. \n     He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he \n     received bachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard \n     University, where he became the second Black to receive a \n     doctorate in history. The rest is history--Black history.\n\n  In keeping with the spirit and the vision of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, I \nwould like to pay tribute to two courageous women, claimed by my home \nState of Michigan, who played significant roles in addressing American \ninjustice and inequality. These are two women of different times who \nwould change the course of history.\n  The contributions of Sojourner Truth, who helped lead our country out \nof the dark days of slavery, and Rosa Parks whose dignified leadership \nsparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the start of the civil rights \nmovement are indelibly etched in the chronicle of the history of this \nnation. Moreover, they are viewed with distinction and admiration \nthroughout the world.\n  Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one \nof the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day on the \ninhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the \nabolitionist movement, and a ground breaking speaker on behalf of \nequality for women. Michigan recently honored her with the dedication \nof the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument, which was unveiled in Battle \nCreek, MI, on September 25, 1999. In April 2009, Sojourner Truth became \nthe first African American woman to be memorialized with a bust in the \nU.S. Capitol. The ceremony to unveil Truth's likeness was appropriately \nheld in Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitor Center. I was pleased \nto cosponsor the legislation to make this fitting tribute possible. \nSojourner Truth lived in Washington, DC for several years, helping \nslaves who had fled from the South and appearing at women's suffrage \ngatherings. She returned to Battle Creek in 1875, and remained there \nuntil her death in 1883. Sojourner Truth spoke from her heart about the \nmost troubling issues of her time. A testament to Truth's convictions \nis that her words continue to speak to us today.\n  On May 4, 1999, legislation was enacted which authorized the \nPresident of the United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to \nRosa Parks. I was pleased to coauthor this tribute to Rosa Parks--the \ngentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the \nhumiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. I\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\nwas also pleased to coauthor legislation directing the Architect of the \nCapitol to commission a statue of Rosa Parks, which will be placed in \nthe U.S. Capitol, making her the second African American woman to \nreceive such an honor.\n  Her personal bravery and self-sacrifice are remembered with reverence \nand respect by us all. Over 55 years ago, in Montgomery, AL, the modern \ncivil rights movement began when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat \nand move to the back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this \ncourageous woman captured the consciousness of not only the American \npeople, but the entire world. The boycott which Rosa Parks began was \nthe beginning of an American revolution that elevated the status of \nAfrican Americans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader \nwho would one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the \nReverend Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  Mr. President, we have come a long way toward achieving justice and \nequality for all. We still however have work to do. In the names of \nRosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., and many others, let us rededicate ourselves to continuing \nthe struggle and the struggle for human rights.\n  In closing, I would like to pay tribute to the Juneteenth directors \nand event coordinators throughout my State of Michigan. They have \nworked tirelessly in the planning of intergenerational activities in \ncelebration of Juneteenth. Ms. Marilyn Plumber is heading up three \nevents in Lansing, MI, this week and coordinators in Flint, Detroit, \nSaginaw, and other areas around the State are observing Juneteenth \nthrough a wide range of programs over several days.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, that there be no intervening action or debate, and \nany statements related to this resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 198) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 198\n\n       Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach frontier \n     areas of the United States, and in particular the \n     southwestern States, for more than 2\\1/2\\ years after \n     President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which was \n     issued on January 1, 1863, and months after the conclusion of \n     the Civil War;\n       Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major \n     General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas with news \n     that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were free;\n       Whereas African-Americans who had been slaves in the \n     Southwest celebrated June 19, commonly known as ``Juneteenth \n     Independence Day'', as the anniversary of their emancipation;\n       Whereas African-Americans from the Southwest continue the \n     tradition of celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as \n     inspiration and encouragement for future generations;\n       Whereas for more than 140 years, Juneteenth Independence \n     Day celebrations have been held to honor African-American \n     freedom while encouraging self-development and respect for \n     all cultures;\n       Whereas although Juneteenth Independence Day is beginning \n     to be recognized as a national, and even global, event, the \n     history behind the celebration should not be forgotten; and\n       Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by \n     former slaves remains an example for all people of the United \n     States, regardless of background, religion, or race: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes the historical significance of Juneteenth \n     Independence Day to the Nation;\n       (B) supports the continued celebration of Juneteenth \n     Independence Day to provide an opportunity for the people of \n     the United States to learn more about the past and to \n     understand better the experiences that have shaped the \n     Nation; and\n       (C) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     Juneteenth Independence Day with appropriate ceremonies, \n     activities, and programs; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the celebration of the end of slavery is an important \n     and enriching part of the history and heritage of the United \n     States; and\n       (B) history should be regarded as a means for understanding \n     the past and solving the challenges of the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/19/senate-section/article/S6857-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 22, 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.
