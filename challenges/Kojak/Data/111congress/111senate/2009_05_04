Mr. President, with the administration still unsure of \nwhat to do with the detainees at Guantanamo, Attorney General Holder \nhas described its arbitrary closing date as one of his most daunting \nchallenges. Secretary Gates said some would be released or transferred \noverseas, some tried in American courts, and the administration doesn't \nknow what to do with 50 to 100 who can't be released or tried. Clearly, \nthe administration lacks a plan and a safe alternative for closing \nGuantanamo. Let me make a suggestion. The administration should \nreconsider its arbitrary deadline on Guantanamo, as it has reconsidered \nits commitment to arbitrary withdrawal deadlines in Iraq. Once the \nadministration has a plan to safely detain, prosecute or transfer these \ndetainees, Congress should be consulted and briefed to evaluate the \nproposal. With no safe alternative, this is the only sensible approach.\n  No American will penalize the administration for putting safety over \nsymbolism. Europe should not either, since it has been far more \ncritical than helpful. It is increasingly clear that working through \nthe problems related to Guantanamo will require time and close \nconsultation with Congress. The Senate voted 94 to 3 against sending \ndetainees to American soil even if only to prisons. Let me say that \nagain. The Senate voted 94 to 3 against sending detainees to U.S. \nprisons, not to mention the possibility that they would simply be \nreleased into neighborhoods. Secretary Gates has conceded that no one \nwants these detainees in their communities.\n  The legal authority for releasing trained terrorists is in question, \na concern the administration hasn't publicly\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\naddressed at all. The administration hasn't decided if it will use the \nmilitary commissions process that Congress passed on a bipartisan basis \nat the suggestion of the Supreme Court.\n  Finally, the administration hasn't said how it plans to deal with the \nproblem of terrorists we release returning to the battlefield even, \neven as DOD has confirmed that 18 of the prisoners we released have \nreturned to terrorism and that at least 44 are suspected as having done \nso.\n  The American people want to keep the terrorists at Guantanamo, out of \ntheir neighborhoods and off the battlefield. At this point, the only \nway we can assure them that neither one of these things will occur is \nfor the administration to keep this secure facility open until it \ndevelops a sensible plan for the Congress to evaluate. We remain a \nnation at war with ground forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Despite \ndisagreements over the best way to combat international terrorism, the \ntruth remains that we haven't been attacked at home since 9/11. That is \na record we wish to continue. Maintaining a safe and secure way to \ndetain terrorists is a critical part of protecting the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/04/senate-section/article/S5046-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to celebrate the life of \na great American, Jack Kemp.\n  Jack Kemp was many things to many different people. Probably everyone \nknows the basics about Jack. He was a football player, a Member of \nCongress, a Cabinet Secretary, and a Vice Presidential nominee. Perhaps \nhe was best known as the coauthor of the Kemp-Roth tax cuts that were \nthe basis of the Reagan economic plan that brought progress out of \nprosperity and stagflation.\n  Today's Wall Street Journal said about Kemp:\n\n       He was among the most important Congressmen in U.S. \n     history. He wasn't powerful because he held a mighty post, \n     and he never served in the House majority. He helped to \n     transform the Republican Party though he was never its \n     Presidential standard-bearer. His influence sprang from the \n     power of his ideas, and from the sincerity and enthusiasm \n     with which he spread them.\n\n  To millions of Americans, he was much more than a football player, \nCongressman, and candidate. For minorities who suffered from \ndiscrimination, Jack was an olive branch from a party that too often \nignored them. As a quarterback and as leader of the football players \nunion, he championed the cause of African-American ball players and \nfought against segregation. For the poor struggling to rise above their \ncircumstances in the inner city, Jack was hope for a better future. He \nproposed empowering tenets in public housing, offering vouchers for \nhousing and education. For hard-working families who wanted more \nfreedom from Government, Jack was a crusader for their cause. He \nbelieved everyone, especially those in inner cities, should have an \nopportunity to participate in our economy. His idea of enterprise zones \nhas expanded and developed into many different areas of providing \nopportunities for those caught in circumstances in which they would \notherwise have none.\n  Jack was all these things and more. Today Jack serves as a role \nmodel, I believe, for the future of our party. Known as the happy \nwarrior, Jack always focused on the positive.\n  Don't get me wrong, Jack never shied away from a fight, and I know \nthat in a couple instances. He called out his fellow party members for \nprotectionism and anti-immigration efforts, believing they were wrong \nfor this country and for the opportunities we seek. No matter how big \nthe adversary, whether it was a linebacker or a powerful committee \nchair, Jack was a fearless fighter. But as a happy warrior, Jack \nunderstood the power of the positive.\n  Today's Washington Post carried an article by Michael Gershon in \nwhich he said:\n\n       Opportunity, [Kemp] argued, is the most important measure \n     of economic justice; capitalism is perfected by the broadest \n     possible distribution of capital; and economic freedom and \n     political freedom are inseparable.\n\n  Jack was well known for saying:\n\n       The best way to oppose a bad idea is to replace it with a \n     good one.\n\n  You see, Jack was more about solutions than party labels. It is that \npragmatism and willingness to work across the aisle to solve problems \nthat all of us would be well advised to embrace today. As a self-\ndescribed bleeding heart conservative, there are so many examples of \nJack Kemp doing that. Jack worked across the aisle on some of the most \nimportant issues of our time, from civil rights to safe housing for all \nfamilies. It was Jack who, along with the esteemed Dr. Benjamin Hooks, \nbrought to the national stage the scourge of lead paint poisoning which \nwas afflicting children and families in many of our cities, \nparticularly older ones. Exposure to lead, particularly by young \nchildren, was causing learning disabilities, behavioral problems, \nslowing growth, and possibly causing seizures, coma and, in some \nserious instances, death.\n  Jack Kemp and Dr. Hooks gave this avoidable tragedy a face and a very \npowerful voice. Thanks to their advocacy, Senator Mikulski and I \nlaunched a $50 million initiative to remove exposed paint in targeted \nneighborhoods. What started as an idea and a mission is now a more than \n$300 million program that has helped countless children and their \nfamilies. But this is just one example of the ideas that Jack, with his \ntireless advocacy, turned into action to improve the lives of the most \nvulnerable and needy in our country. Jack's extraordinary life has made \na lasting impact on the generations of conservatives he inspired, on \nthe Republican Party, on the national debate, but, most importantly, on \nthe countless lives and communities which have benefited from his \npowerful ideas being put into action.\n  To Joanne and the rest of the Kemp family, Linda and my thoughts and \nprayers are with you. We shall always remember and treasure the memory \nof Jack Kemp and the great contributions he made.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy of the Wall \nStreet Journal piece entitled ``Capitalist for the Common Man'' and the \nWashington Post column by Michael Gershon entitled ``Head and Heart.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                 Head and Heart: Remembering Jack Kemp\n\n                          (By Michael Gerson)\n\n       Some deaths make the world feel old, like they have stolen \n     a part of youth itself. Normally this applies to those who \n     die in their prime. But Jack Kemp's prime was supernaturally \n     long. It is difficult to imagine his bounding arrivals, his \n     shaken-gravel voice, his juice and joy, all stilled and \n     ended. But there it is.\n       Generations of young conservatives--most of us no longer \n     young--were drawn into Jack's orbit (I worked for him briefly \n     in the 1990s as a speech-writer). We were attracted, in one \n     way or another, to Jack's ``bleeding-heart conservatism,'' \n     with its mix of economic opportunity, social inclusion and \n     ebullience. We came to love Jack's gracious wife, Joanne, and \n     his accomplished children. We hoped and expected that Jack \n     would become president of the United States. In the end, he \n     lacked the consuming focus that quest requires. But in his \n     passion for ideas--and in the affection he inspired--Jack was \n     the most influential modern Republican who never became \n     president.\n       Jack believed that ideas--not interests or political deals \n     or public passions--rule the world. In this sense, he \n     strangely resembled idealists such as Hegel or Marx, who \n     discerned hidden, powerful currents beneath the surface of \n     history. For Jack, that force was liberal democratic values'' \n     (small ``l'' and small ``d,'' as he invariably added). \n     Economic freedom, in his view, provides the poor with a hope \n     beyond the dreams of socialism or large ``L'' Liberalism--the \n     hope of becoming wealthy themselves. Opportunity, he argued, \n     is the most important measure of economic justice; capitalism \n     is perfected by the broadest possible distribution of \n     capital; and economic freedom and political freedom are \n     inseparable.\n       This belief in the power of ideas removed all rancor from \n     Jack's political approach. Everyone fell into one of two \n     categories: convert or potential convert. He seemed to \n     believe that if he had just an hour--better yet,\n\n[[Page S5047]]\n\n     three hours--with anyone, he could change their mind by the \n     force of his ideas. So he gave nearly everyone the benefit of \n     the doubt. He assumed goodwill on the part of his opponents. \n     And he became the rarest kind of public figure--a conviction \n     politician who was also a peacemaker.\n       The direction of Jack's career was set by two events. In \n     the 1960s, he saw the American civil rights movement from the \n     perspective of sports. As a quarterback and leader of the \n     American Football League players union, he stood up for \n     African American teammates victimized by segregation on their \n     travels. The experience left a deeply rooted impatience with \n     bigotry.\n       For this reason, Jack criticized the failures of urban \n     liberalism--the high-rise horrors of the projects, the \n     economic desolation of the inner city, the schools that \n     betray minority students without consequence. He became the \n     nation's leading advocate for educational vouchers, housing \n     vouchers and enterprise zones--applications of his philosophy \n     of freedom to the needs of the poor. But Jack was nothing if \n     not consistent. The same impulse led him to assert that the \n     party of Lincoln would never be healthy or complete without \n     the support of African Americans--and to oppose outbreaks of \n     anti-immigrant sentiment among Republicans, often at \n     political cost to himself.\n       The second event that shaped Jack's career was a stroke of \n     intellectual lightning in the 1970s that became known as \n     supply-side economics. Jack was an amateur economist of broad \n     reading, convinced he knew exactly the way the world works. \n     National wealth depends on productivity, which depends on low \n     tax rates that reward work, enterprise and investment. So as \n     a backbench congressman, he proposed 30 percent across-the-\n     board tax reductions, persuaded Ronald Reagan to embrace \n     them, and helped spur decades of prosperity. Some dispute \n     this version of economic history. Yet few would recommend a \n     return to the 70 percent tax rates and stagflation of America \n     before Jack Kemp.\n       Jack's ideals and priorities never really changed over the \n     years, as a congressman, as a Cabinet secretary, as a vice \n     presidential nominee. This is a contrast to many Republicans, \n     and former Republicans, who will leave no mark beyond the \n     vague, unpleasant memory of their opportunism. Even in Jack's \n     absence, we know precisely what he would say: You can't \n     divide wealth you don't create. Don't punish the rich, enable \n     everyone to become rich. Value the dreams and contributions \n     of immigrants. Be a happy warrior, not an angry one. And let \n     me tell you about the gold standard.\n       But as much as we need it, we won't hear that voice again. \n     It left a massive silence when the bleeding heart stopped.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                     Capitalist for the Common Man\n\n       The scene was a low-rent Manhattan auditorium, circa 1978. \n     A young Congressman from Buffalo with a raspy voice and rapid \n     delivery was debating a liberal from central casting about \n     the necessity of tax-cutting to stimulate economic growth and \n     spread prosperity. Here, we thought, was something exciting: \n     A politician who could speak about the benefits of capitalism \n     for the average American. The crowd was mainly hostile, but \n     then Jack Kemp never did confine his free-market evangelizing \n     only to the believers.\n       Kemp, who died Saturday at age 73, was among the most \n     important Congressmen in U.S. history. He wasn't powerful \n     because he held a mighty post, and he never served in the \n     House majority. He helped to transform the Republican Party \n     though he was never its Presidential standard bearer. His \n     influence sprang from the power of his ideas, and from the \n     sincerity and enthusiasm with which he spread them.\n       A celebrated pro quarterback, Kemp was an unlikely \n     intellectual. Yet amid the economic troubles of the 1970s, he \n     immersed himself in the details of fiscal and monetary \n     policy. Along with a handful of others, many of whom wrote \n     for this newspaper, Kemp became a champion for the classical \n     economic ideas that challenged the Keynesian orthodoxy of \n     that time. He also had to mount an insurgency inside the \n     Republican Party, which for decades had been dominated by \n     budget-balancers who saw their fate mainly as moderating and \n     paying for liberal excess.\n       Along with Senator William Roth of Delaware, Kemp proposed \n     a 30% across-the-board tax cut. Though the Democrats who ran \n     Congress, combined with Old Guard Republicans to defeat it \n     during the Carter Presidency, a GOP candidate by the name of \n     Ronald Reagan liked what he saw. Reagan largely adopted Kemp-\n     Roth as his own, campaigned on it in 1980; and the proposal \n     eventually became the basis for the 25% income-tax cuts that \n     finally took effect in 1983 and became the most successful \n     domestic policy achievement of the modern era. The Kemp-\n     Reagan policy mix of lower taxes to lift incentives, sound \n     money to break inflation, and regulatory relief to unleash \n     entrepreneurs became the foundation for the prosperity of the \n     1980s and 1990s.\n        . . . and could speak to the concerns of union members. \n     His athletic career exposed him to men of different races and \n     creeds, and he developed the conviction that economic liberty \n     was even more vital for the poorest Americans than for the \n     affluent.\n       Importantly, however, and unlike many of today's \n     Republicans, Kemp's populism was inclusive. Across his \n     career, he ventured into neighborhoods where Republicans too \n     rarely tread. His policy innovations included enterprise \n     zones; public-housing vouchers and a free-trade pact for all \n     of North America. Also like Reagan, he believed that \n     immigrants made America stronger and more vibrant. His \n     religious faith was strong but never censorious. Kemp's \n     loquacious optimism was contagious, even if he did sometimes \n     get carried away.\n       One historic imponderable is what might have happened if \n     Reagan had chosen Kemp as his running mate in 1980. The idea \n     had support among the Reagan brain trust, but the Gipper went \n     with the allegedly safer pick of George H.W. Bush as a way to \n     unite the GOP. Mr. Bush had famously described Kemp-Roth as \n     ``voodoo economics,'' but Reagan's success made Mr. Bush the \n     front-runner when he defeated Kemp for the GOP Presidential \n     nod in 1988. Mr. Bush went on to repudiate Reaganomics with \n     his tax increase of 1990 and made himself a one-term \n     President. He also passed over Kemp as a running mate in \n     1988, and by the time Bob Dole selected Kemp in 1996 as his \n     vice presidential nominee, the GOP ticket was already doomed.\n       Kemp's ideas and legacy continue to be relevant for today's \n     Republicans, even if few of them seem to recognize it. The \n     financial meltdown and recession have given President Obama a \n     chance to revive a policy mix of higher spending and taxes, \n     intrusive regulation and easy money. If those policies don't \n     result in a sustainable expansion--and history argues that \n     they won't--then Americans will again be looking for other \n     ideas.\n       Republicans will need to be ready with Kempian proposals to \n     address middle-class economic anxieties and revive broadly \n     shared prosperity. The GOP also needs a rhetoric and a \n     demeanor that invite all Americans to its cause. The Kemp-\n     Reagan Message was rooted in ideas but it also appealed \n     broadly across ages and incomes because of. . . .\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in mourning the passing \nof Jack Kemp last Saturday.\n  Jack was ever the quarterback, leading, inspiring, and winning \nfrequently, it seemed, by sheer optimism and will. In my mind, Jack had \nthree core political beliefs which he consistently promoted throughout \nhis career. First, he was a pure free market enthusiast. He believed in \nAdam Smith's invisible hand and worked tirelessly to convince everyone \nelse about the benefits of supply-side economics.\n  His many legislative achievements promoting growth through lower \ntaxes and less regulation are a testament to his indefatigable efforts. \nJack understood that free market theory also encompassed support for \nwhat he called ``the least of these,'' a reference to the subjects of \n``The Good Shepherd.'' He was the original compassionate conservative, \nmaking sure always to provide a helping hand to the less fortunate.\n  His work to expand housing opportunity as HUD Secretary and outreach \nto minorities and the poor resulted in a political appeal far beyond \nhis conservative roots. Finally, Jack was a passionate advocate for \nhuman rights, freedom, democracy, and the military strength to support \nAmerica's national security requirements. Peace through strength was \nJack's mantra.\n  Three weeks ago, I visited with Natan Sharansky in Israel. Jack had \nintroduced me to Sharansky more than 20 years ago, after he had gotten \nout of the Soviet gulag. I told him Jack was ill. He asked me to convey \nhis best wishes. When I left a message on Jack's phone, I asked his \noffice to confirm he had gotten it. A couple days later, Jack himself \ncalled back, clearly touched by the concern of an old friend half the \nworld away. I will always treasure this last conversation with Jack. He \nwas still fighting.\n  We will miss Jack: gregarious, indomitable, earnest, always positive. \nHe loved being with his family. He was very proud of his children. He \nrelied on and was supported by his extraordinarily gracious wife of 51 \nyears, Joanne.\n  Similar to sports, politics can be a great leveler, even of those who \nseem larger than life. But whether he won or lost, Jack always kept the \nfaith. And so it was in the last battle of his life.\n  Jack Kemp, No. 15, thank you for your service, your leadership, and \nfriendship. May God bless you and your family.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, America lost a good friend when \nformer Congressman Jack Kemp passed away over the weekend at the age of \n73. He is survived by his wife Joanne, a marriage of 50 years, his 4 \nchildren, and 17 grandchildren.\n  Jack and Joanne have been personal friends of Grace and mine over the \nyears. I will never forget one time; Jack was already a great celebrity \nwhen I came into the House of Representatives 30 years ago, in 1979, \nand on one of the tax bills I actually had the temerity to take him on \non the floor. I will never forget the chairman of the Budget Committee \nwalking up to me and saying: You better watch out because he is a \nfierce debater. Indeed, he was. He was passionate about what he \nbelieved in, and he was a strong advocate of what he believed in. That, \nof course, is a quality all of us admire. It was one of the attributes \nthat drew me to Jack, he reciprocated, and we had a friendship over \nthese last 30 years.\n  Clearly, the record has been set. Jack, of course, was the star \nquarterback for the Buffalo Bills. Before that, he was with the San \nDiego Chargers, and he said that his career in football prepared him \nwell for a career in politics because he had been booed, cheered, cut, \nsold, traded, and hung in effigy in football. Sooner or later, those of \nus in politics will experience all of those. And how true a statement \nthat is.\n  He talked about his career in politics. Jack represented western New \nYork in the House for 9 terms. He ran for President. He served as the \nSecretary of HUD. He ran for Vice President. It is a great loss.\n  The one thing I want to call to the attention of the Senate is the \nletter he wrote to his grandchildren upon the election of Barack Obama \nas President. This letter was posted online on Jack's company Web site. \nI want you to listen to what he wrote:\n\n       . . . just imagine that in the face of all these \n     indignities and deprivations, Dr. Martin Luther King could \n     say 44 years ago, ``I have an abiding faith in America and an \n     audacious faith in mankind.''\n\n  Jack continues to write this letter to his grandchildren:\n\n       He described his vision for America, even as he and his \n     people were being denied their God-given human rights \n     guaranteed under our Constitution.\n       You see, real leadership is not just seeing the realities \n     of what we are temporarily faced with, but seeing the \n     possibilities and potential that can be realized by lifting \n     up people's vision of what they can be.\n\n  That is just one snippet of that letter he wrote to his \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe entire letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      A Letter to my Grandchildren\n\n                             (by Jack Kemp)\n\n       Dear Kemp grandchildren--all 17 of you, spread out from the \n     East Coast to the West Coast, and from Wheaton College in \n     Illinois, to Wake Forest University in North Carolina:\n       My first thought last week upon learning that a 47-year-old \n     African-American Democrat had won the presidency was, ``Is \n     this a great country or not?''\n       You may have expected your grandfather to be disappointed \n     that his friend John McCain lost (and I was), but there's a \n     difference between disappointment over a lost election and \n     the historical perspective of a monumental event in the life \n     of our nation.\n       Let me explain. First of all, the election was free, fair \n     and transformational, in terms of our democracy and given the \n     history of race relations in our nation.\n       What do I mean?\n       Just think, a little over 40 years ago, blacks in America \n     had trouble even voting in our country, much less thinking \n     about running for the highest office in the land.\n       A little over 40 years ago, in some parts of America, \n     blacks couldn't eat, sleep or even get a drink of water using \n     facilities available to everyone else in the public sphere.\n       We are celebrating, this year, the 40th anniversary of our \n     Fair Housing Laws, which helped put an end to the blatant \n     racism and prejudice against blacks in rental housing and \n     homeownership opportunities. As an old professional football \n     quarterback, in my days there were no black coaches, no black \n     quarterbacks, and certainly no blacks in the front offices of \n     football and other professional sports. For the record, there \n     were great black quarterbacks and coaches--they just weren't \n     given the opportunity to showcase their talent. And pro-\n     football (and America) was the worse off for it.\n       I remember quarterbacking the old San Diego Chargers and \n     playing for the AFL championship in Houston. My father sat on \n     the 50-yard line, while my co-captain's father, who happened \n     to be black, had to sit in a small, roped-off section of the \n     end zone. Today, we can't imagine the NFL without the amazing \n     contributions of blacks at every level of this great \n     enterprise.\n       I could go on and on, but just imagine that in the face of \n     all these indignities and deprivations, Dr. Martin Luther \n     King could say 44 years ago, ``I have an abiding faith in \n     America and an audacious faith in mankind.'' He described his \n     vision for America, even as he and his people were being \n     denied their God-given human rights guaranteed under our \n     Constitution.\n       You see, real leadership is not just seeing the realities \n     of what we are temporarily faced with, but seeing the \n     possibilities and potential that can be realized by lifting \n     up peoples' vision of what they can be.\n       When President-elect Obama quoted Abraham Lincoln on the \n     night of his election, he was acknowledging the transcendent \n     qualities of vision and leadership that are always present, \n     but often overlooked and neglected by pettiness, partisanship \n     and petulance. As president, I believe Barack Obama can help \n     lift us out of a narrow view of America into the ultimate \n     vision of an America where, if you're born to be a mezzo-\n     soprano or a master carpenter, nothing stands in your way of \n     realizing your God-given potential.\n       Both Obama in his Chicago speech, and McCain in his \n     marvelous concession speech, rose to this historic occasion \n     by celebrating the things that unite us irrespective of our \n     political party, our race or our socio-economic background.\n       My advice for you all is to understand that unity for our \n     nation doesn't require uniformity or unanimity; it does \n     require putting the good of our people ahead of what's good \n     for mere political or personal advantage.\n       The party of Lincoln, i.e., the GOP, needs to rethink and \n     revisit its historic roots as a party of emancipation, \n     liberation, civil rights and equality of opportunity for all. \n     On the other hand, the party of Franklin Roosevelt, John \n     Kennedy and now Obama must put forth an agenda that \n     understands that getting America growing again will require \n     both Keynesian and classical incentive-oriented (supply-side) \n     economic ideas. But there's time for political and economic \n     advice in a later column (or two).\n       Let me end with an equally great historical irony of this \n     election. Next year, as Obama is sworn in as our 44th \n     president, we will celebrate the 200th anniversary of Abraham \n     Lincoln's birth. I'm serving, along with former Rep. Bill \n     Gray of Pennsylvania, on the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial \n     Board to help raise funds for this historic occasion. \n     President-elect Obama's honoring of Lincoln in many of his \n     speeches reminds us of how vital it is to elevate these ideas \n     and ideals to our nation's consciousness and inculcate his \n     principles at a time of such great challenges and even \n     greater opportunities.\n       In fact, we kick off the Lincoln bicentennial celebration \n     on Wednesday, Nov. 19, in Gettysburg, Pa. The great filmmaker \n     Ken Burns will speak at the Soldier's National Cemetery on \n     the 145th anniversary of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. On \n     Thursday, Nov. 20, at Gettysburg College, we will have the \n     first of 10 town hall forums, titled ``Race, Freedom and \n     Equality of Opportunity.'' I have the high honor of joining \n     Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., Professor Allen Guezlo and Norman \n     Bristol-Colon on the panel, with Professor Charles Branham as \n     the moderator.\n       President-elect Obama talks of Abraham Lincoln's view of \n     our nation as an ``unfinished work.'' Well, isn't that \n     equally true of all of us? Therefore let all of us strive to \n     help him be a successful president, so as to help make \n     America an even greater nation.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is ``A Letter to my \nGrandchildren'' by Jack Kemp on November 12, 2008, just a few days \nafter the election of Senator Obama as President of these United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/04/senate-section/article/S5048-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5048-S5049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to shift gears from that \nsad note to a celebratory note because\n\n[[Page S5049]]\n\nwe are approaching the 40th anniversary of the first landing on another \ncelestial body by human beings. A number of our colleagues have joined \nme to honor two major firsts from the early days of America's space \nprogram.\n  One of those firsts is the lunar landing. We have introduced \nlegislation to bestow the distinguished Congressional Gold Medal, the \nhighest civilian award given by Congress, on the crew of Apollo 11. \nNeil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first and second humans to set \na footprint on the Moon, while command module pilot Mike Collins \norbited above.\n  In this legislation, which we have termed the ``New Frontier \nCongressional Gold Medal,'' we also honor the first American who \norbited the Earth, Senator John Glenn.\n  Today at 87 years old, John Glenn is retired from the Senate. He \nlives in his home State of Ohio. He retains his home in the Washington, \nDC, area. We get a chance to see John from time to time as he comes \nback and joins his colleagues on the floor of the Senate.\n  These are pioneers. They are firsts--Glenn first to orbit the Earth \nas an American. Remember, we got surprised by the Soviets. They \nlaunched Yuri Gagarin for one orbit, and we did not even have a rocket \nwith strong enough thrust to get into orbit.\n  Shortly after Gagarin, we put Alan Shepard up only into suborbit, \nfollowed by another suborbital mission with Gus Grissom. Ten months \nafter Gagarin--and by this time the Soviets had flown a second \ncosmonaut, Titof, and he had orbited several times--10 months after \nthat fateful first human flight, we took a chance. We took that Mercury \ncapsule that John Glenn climbed into--indeed, he had to shoehorn in to \nget into it, it was so small--put it on top of an Atlas rocket that we \nknew had a 20-percent chance of failure, and the rest is history.\n  Of course, we remember that story. There was an indication that \nJohn's heat shield was loose which, had it been, he would have burned \nup on reentry. The last radio communication we had as he entered that \nblackout period coming through heat 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit at reentry \nthat creates a blackout situation for radio frequency, the last thing \nwe heard from John Glenn before he went into that blackout period was \nhe was humming the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' Oh, what words \nthose were when suddenly we heard: ``Houston, this is Friendship 7.'' \nWe knew he was alive.\n  He paved the way for that extraordinary message back to Earth from \nNeil Armstrong in which he said:\n\n       This is one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for \n     mankind.\n\n  This past weekend, I had the occasion to join with a number of our \nAmerican astronauts on the induction of three more space explorers into \nthe Astronaut Hall of Fame. The inductees were space shuttle veterans--\nPinky Nelson, Bill Shepherd, and Jim Wetherbee. They joined the elite \nranks of 70 other legendary astronauts, who already include John Glenn, \nArmstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.\n  I went to this particular ceremony because I had the privilege of \nbeing a crew mate of Pinky's, and Bill Shepherd, otherwise shown as \n``Shep,'' was the rookie astronaut who actually strapped us in before \nlaunch.\n  While I was there meeting with and seeing these three new astronauts \nhonored by induction into the Hall of Fame, I thought about the amazing \nachievements we have made, how strong leadership and bold vision has \nchanged not the space program but all our lives. I think about the true \nAmerican character of exploration, whether it is the space program or \nexploration into the inner workings of the mind, the functions of the \nbody, exploration into the climate of this planet, exploration of how \nwe cope each day with all the problems we are facing, our space program \nbeing one part of our exploration which did not start just recently. We \nare a nation of explorers.\n  We did not just start with exploration. This started way back in our \nhistory. We had a frontier then. It was westward. Now that frontier is \nin so many other areas, including space.\n  The space program has given us much to improve life on Earth, from \nfire-resistant material to weather forecasting equipment, to scratch-\nresistant lenses, to new kinds of laser surgery. It has also given us \nselfless heroes who put their lives on the line for the benefit of all \nthe rest of us and for the generations to come.\n  It was Armstrong who made that first step out onto the lunar dust. It \nwas Glenn who paved the way for the rest of Mercury and Gemini and \nApollo. It is hard to believe that all these things happened after \nPresident Kennedy presented a bold challenge before a joint session of \nthe Congress in which he said: We are going to send a man to the Moon \nand return him safely to Earth by the end of the decade, and that was \nwithin a span of only 9 years.\n  The space program became the focal point of the Nation coming \ntogether. It inspired a generation of kids to get excited about \nscience, math, technology, and engineering. We have seen that \ngeneration fulfill President Kennedy's promise, which was science and \neducation have greatly enriched a new knowledge of ourselves, of our \nuniverse, and our environment. Life on Earth has improved by leaps and \nbounds from all the spinoffs from the space program.\n  Simply put: We all reap the harvest of gains because of exploration \nand the pioneering endeavors of brave Americans, such as these whom we \nhonor with this gold medal, the highest congressional honor. They \ndeserve this honor because of their significant contributions to planet \nEarth.\n  I ask our colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. There \nwill be ample opportunity for cosponsorships, in addition to those of \nus who have submitted the resolution.\n  I yield the floor. I do not have to suggest the absence of a quorum \nbecause the great Senator from the State of Delaware is here, and I \nwant him to know what a delight and pleasure he is to serve with.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I wish to say it is an honor serving with \nSenator Nelson. I also commend him for his tribute to Senator Glenn and \nthe astronauts. As usual, he is right on point. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 25 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today marks the beginning of Public \nService Recognition Week. This is a time to recognize the hard-working \nand devoted men and women who serve in our Federal, State, county, and \nmunicipal governments.\n  I wish to make particular mention of the several programs taking \nplace throughout the week in celebration of our civil servants and \ntheir contributions. I know the Partnership for Public Service, an \norganization with a mission to highlight our finest Government workers \nand promote public service, will be marking the week by awarding their \nannual Service to America medals. I congratulate the medal finalists \nand thank them for their excellence in service to our Nation.\n  This is an appropriate occasion to address the subject which is so \nrelevant to the way we face the challenges before us as a nation. These \nchallenges have shaken the public's confidence in our financial \nmarkets, in our economy, and in our Government. We must work to restore \nthe public's confidence.\n  So many of the solutions being presented from the rising cost of \nhealth care to the multiple threats from overseas, to the mortgage \ncrisis, rely primarily on the work of dedicated and dependable civil \nservants. The Federal employees who work day in and day out to better \nour country, often at great private sacrifice, deserve our public's \nconfidence, and that is what this speech will be all about.\n  In the post-9/11 era of insecurity and following years of political \nindecision\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\nand divisive partisanship, we are left with an abundance of problems. \nOur honored veterans complain of diminishing benefits, while the young \ndecry the increases in the cost of education. America's health care \nsystem is outdated and leaves millions uninsured. We remain painfully \naddicted to foreign oil, and auto manufacturers require more public \nfunds to stay afloat. Some of our challenges rise to a level unseen in \ndecades.\n  Of course, whenever Americans face difficulty, we display that \ngreatest trait of our nature. Service to the common good has been our \nanswer to every hardship since even before the birth of our Republic. \nOne would be hard-pressed to find any public figure of note who does \nnot highly invoke the praise of community service and voluntarism.\n  Indeed, in every neighborhood in all 50 States, one can find our \ncitizens extending their hands in help to their fellow Americans and to \nthe unfortunate throughout the world. Likewise, no one can refrain from \nhonoring the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in \nuniform. Their dedication and diligence ensure our safe borders and \nsustain our liberty. The hard work of our servicemembers is rightly \ncongratulated.\n  But, Mr. President, there are those who give so much of themselves \nand often so many years of their lives, yet receive hardly any share of \nrecognition. In the recent past, the disparagement of our Federal \nemployees--the greatest civil servants in the history of our republican \ngovernment--has become sadly commonplace. Diminishing their \ncontribution to this Nation is an all-too-frequent exercise.\n  Federal employees deserve praise for the vital roles they play each \nday enforcing the laws we pass in this very Chamber. They care for our \nveterans. They toil in laboratories to create new energy technologies. \nOur Federal workers safely manage the complex networks of flights \ncrossing our skies day and night. They deliver our mail, regulate fair \nhousing practices, and conduct our diplomacy abroad. They serve in all \nthree branches of Government.\n  They are, in many ways, silent sentinels of our Nation's well-being.\n  Indeed, Federal employees have become indispensable to our national \nlife. With a generation of Federal employees nearing retirement, we \nneed to attract our most talented citizens back to public service. \nGood, honest, responsible government requires the best civil servants.\n  Throughout our history, great men and women answered the call to \nserve in the Federal Government--citizens from all walks of life and \nfrom every corner of America. There are those who dedicate their entire \ncareers to public service, but there are also so many Americans who \nenter Federal employment for just a short period. Even the novelist \nWilliam Faulkner worked part-time as a postmaster when he was a young \nman.\n  The nature of our Federal workers today is the same as it was when \nthe French philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville visited in the early 19th \ncentury. He observed that:\n\n       Public officers in the United States are commingled with a \n     crowd of citizens; they have neither palaces nor guards, nor \n     ceremonial costumes. This simple exterior of the persons in \n     authority is connected not only with the peculiarities of the \n     American character, but with the fundamental principles of \n     that society.\n\n  I, too, was a Federal employee when I worked for 22 years with then-\nSenator Joe Biden, and I can attest as much as anyone that to serve \nentails responsibility and dedication. During my years in Government \nwork, including 13 years as a member of the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors, I met so many hardworking, well-qualified, and devoted \npublic servants, most of whom will not be recognized individually by \nthe public for their important contributions.\n  The American people collectively put their faith in all who work in \nGovernment, from those elected to the highest offices, to those, like \nFaulkner, working part-time for an hourly wage. Our esteemed \npredecessor in this House, Henry Clay of Kentucky, once declared:\n\n       Government is a trust, and the officers of the government \n     are trustees; and both the trust and the trustees are created \n     for the benefit of the people.\n\n  Senator Clay could not have been more correct. Those who serve the \nRepublic carry the heavy responsibility of not working for the benefit \nof themselves alone but for the good of all.\n  What should be a source of pride to those who enter employment in the \nFederal Government has become, all too often, a thankless job. Serving \nin the Federal Government can be an enriching experience, and we need \nto do more to promote civil service among young people. I am encouraged \nthat there is a growing desire now, unlike in the past several years, \namong our best and brightest students to seek Federal jobs.\n  For so long, the allure of easy wealth on Wall Street and scorn for \nGovernment work led our young graduates to overlook positions in civil \nservice. But it should not take a recession and a popular new \nadministration to attract this talent. Our young people are eager to \ntake on responsibility, to prove themselves worthy of others' trust. \nThey want to have a part in what President Obama has called ``repairing \nthe world.'' With more recognition of our Federal workforce and praise \nfor its important contribution, there is no reason we cannot convince \nthese young, idealistic Americans to seek in Government what they so \ndesire--a role in history, a chance to shape their world.\n  The recent decision by Kal Penn, the young Hollywood star, to accept \na position working in the administration advances this effort \nsignificantly. Despite a lucrative career in film and on television, \nPenn--a second-generation American whose parents are immigrants from \nMumbai--announced he would take a couple of years off from acting to \nserve his country in the Federal Government. When asked about his \nmotives, he said:\n\n       It's probably because of the value system my grandparents \n     instilled in me. There's not a lot of financial reward in \n     these jobs. But, obviously, the opportunity to serve in a \n     capacity like this is an incredible honor.\n\n  Mr. President, when I was young, it used to be that this honor which \nPenn speaks of drew young people by the thousands to careers in our \ncivil service. A job in Government was a mark of distinction. It was a \nprivilege to be able to work for the betterment of the American people. \nHowever, in recent years, that honor has been eroded by the \nmisconception that our civil service is growing beyond measure and \nconsists of those in Washington who are out of touch with ordinary \nAmericans. But I say this characterization is completely untrue.\n  The number of Federal employees today has not grown significantly \nlarger than its size in the 1960s. In fact, 85 percent of all Federal \nemployees live and work outside of Washington. They are ordinary \nAmericans, yet they perform extraordinary work.\n  As De Tocqueville observed more than 150 years ago, the qualities \nembodied by our civil servants reflect the greatest values we hold dear \nas Americans. Federal employees display exemplary citizenship, choosing \nof their own accord to pursue careers that not only provide for their \nfamilies but benefit the Nation as a whole. This is despite the \nadvantages to private sector employment. Our civil servants are \nindustrious. They work hard, tackle difficult problems affecting \nmillions of their fellow citizens, and do so with grace and humility.\n  They often need to take risks, not only to make new discoveries in \nscience and engineering or to represent us in unsafe corners of the \nworld, but also to expose unnecessary waste and corruption where it may \narise. The history of our civil service is filled with those who choose \nto uphold the public trust even when at a danger to their own lives and \ncareers. Their work requires great perseverance, and results may take \nlonger than their tenure in office. It requires great care and \nattention to detail. When the public's faith is bestowed upon you, \nthere can be no halfhearted effort. Most of all, employees in our \nFederal Government display an unbelievable level of modesty.\n  You may wonder why I go on about the virtues of our public servants \nwhen there are so many pressing matters to be considered by this body. \nI return, however, to my first point--that no matter what programs we \nlaunch to get America back on the right path, they will be carried out \nby our Federal workers.\n  Exemplary cases abound, but I want to highlight a few individuals in \nparticular who embody these values and\n\n[[Page S5051]]\n\nreflect the excellence of our civil service as a whole. They have each \nbeen selected by a blue ribbon panel which includes Senator Susan \nCollins, in concert with Partnership for Public Service, to receive a \nService to America medal.\n\n  When she began her job as Director of the Office of Public Housing \nPrograms in 2002, Nicole Faison inherited a HUD rental system program \nrated for 13 years as a ``high risk'' program by the Government \nAccountability Office due to rampant waste, fraud, and abuse. Today, it \nis recognized for helping more low-income families receive housing \nassistance without wasting resources. Under Nicole's guidance, the \nprogram eliminated over $2 billion in fraudulent payments and earned \npraise for its streamlined operations.\n  Since 9/11, there has been much attention on the security of cargo \ncontainers entering our country from overseas. Leading the charge to \nsecure our ports, Tracy Mustin serves as Director of the Department of \nEnergy's office of Second Line of Defense. Under Tracy's leadership, \nher office has installed monitoring devices at more than 100 airports, \nseaports, and border crossings in over 40 countries which help detect \nand prevent the trafficking of nuclear or radiological substances. She \nalso oversees the Megaports Initiative, which screens and monitors \ncargo entering major seaports around the world. In addition to her \nresponsibilities as a civil servant, Tracy is commissioned as a captain \nin the Navy Reserve.\n  While Tracy and her team have been fortifying our Nation's second \nline of defense against terrorism, brave men and women in the Armed \nForces remain overseas fighting on the first line of defense. When our \nwounded warriors return home, they can thank the dedicated civilian \nemployees of our Defense Department for significant advancements in the \ntreatment and care they will receive for their injuries.\n  Dave Carballeyra, the Air Force's Director of Stereolithography, \nintroduced a new 3-D technology for bone and tissue imaging which has \nimproved treatment and rehabilitation care for wounded veterans. In \nparticular, his work has helped soldiers suffering from severe burns \nfrom bombings in Iraq and Afghanistan and those requiring surgery to \nattach prosthetic devices. These advances have significantly improved \ntheir quality of life. Believe it or not, Dave is only 25 years of age.\n  Another public servant whom I very much want to mention is Dr. Rajiv \nJain. Each year it is estimated that 2 million patients develop \ninfections while in U.S. hospitals for routine procedures. One hundred \nthousand of these patients die as a result, and the elderly and newborn \nare particularly susceptible. Rajiv and his team at the Veterans \nAffairs Hospital in Pittsburgh are at the forefront of an effort to \nreduce these infections. The infection rate at their VA facility has \nalready dropped 60 percent, and the strategy developed by Rajiv to \nprevent infections has now been adopted by all 153 VA hospitals.\n  When asked about his work, he commonly explains that ``one infection \nis too many.''\n  The final person I will mention, who works for the Department of \nEnergy, has proven wrong those who are convinced that Government can't \ndo something right. At the end of the Cold War, when the former Rocky \nFlats nuclear weapons plant near Denver was designated as a Superfund \nsite, it was estimated that it would take 70 years and nearly $40 \nbillion to clean it up. Many advocated a permanent quarantine of the \nsite, arguing that its rehabilitation was not worth the cost. Frazer \nLockhart took charge of the cleanup effort in 1995 and finished the job \nin 10 years, spending only $7 billion. Today, 95 percent of the \noriginal site has been delisted from the Superfund and been set aside \nas a 6,200-acre wildlife refuge. Frazer's sound management and \nperseverance led to the cleanup 60 years ahead of schedule and $30 \nbillion under budget.\n  Mr. President, these stories are just a few of the countless many. \nIndeed, there are a great number of exceptional Federal employees, and \nI hope to continue sharing their stories before the Senate and honoring \ntheir service over the coming weeks and months, beginning with this \ngroup. I invite my fellow Senators to join me on those or other \noccasions in doing the same. These men and women daily carry out the \nwork of developing new technologies, protecting our free markets, \nensuring a cleaner environment, and advancing our interests around the \nworld.\n  I believe the Founders foresaw the need for a vibrant and effective \ncivil service and that they would be proud of the Federal employees \nserving today. When the first Congress convened in New York on March 4, \n1789, its first matter of business was to fulfill an obligation set to \nit by the Constitution. Article VI declares that all public officers \nare to be bound by an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution, \nbut the document leaves up to Congress to decide on the form.\n  The first piece of legislation ever to be passed by the United States \nCongress and signed into law by President Washington codified this \nsimple but poignant oath:\n\n       I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n\n  In the years since, it has been expanded to the oath presently taken \nby all of us who serve in this Chamber and in the House of \nRepresentatives and by every Federal employee. But the underlying point \nremains unchanged from that original oath. What the Founders intended \nin their first act of Government, and what we now reaffirm with each \ntaking of our modern oath, is that everyone who serves in our \nGovernment is not only obligated to support the Constitution but also \nentrusted with that responsibility. That trust--the same as was noted \nby Clay--is the foundation of our civil service. It is the guiding \nprinciple of our Federal workers and the reason they deserve the \npublic's confidence.\n  Careers in Government, we know, frequently pay far less than \ncomparable careers in the private sector, and many times our Federal \nemployees are asked to move across the country or overseas to perform \ntheir duties. Many serve for 20 years or more, leaving a lasting impact \non communities and on our national policies without special \nrecognition. They never see bonuses like those paid on Wall Street or \nelsewhere in the private sector. However, after many years of service, \nwhen our civil servants retire, they can look back on their careers and \nknow with certainty that when their country needed them, they gave of \nthemselves. They gave to our Nation, and they know their contribution, \neven if little recognized, has been genuine and significant. This is \ntheir bonus, the satisfaction and the knowledge that they have answered \nthe call to duty, that their lives have surely served a meaningful \npurpose.\n\n  Again, please let it be noted that the first week of May each year is \nPublic Service Recognition Week, and it is with great pride that I \nhonor the service and sacrifice of our Federal employees. I thank them, \nand I urge my colleagues to join me this week and in future weeks to \nthank them for their continued work in support of our recovery during \nthis challenging time.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 896, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 896) to prevent mortgage foreclosures and \n     enhance mortgage credit availability.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Dodd/Shelby amendment No. 1018, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Corker amendment No. 1019 (to amendment No. 1018), to \n     address safe harbor for certain servicers.\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\n       Vitter amendment No. 1016 (to amendment No. 1018), to \n     authorize and remove impediments to the repayment of funds \n     received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\n       Vitter amendment No. 1017 (to amendment No. 1018), to \n     provide that the primary and foundational responsibility of \n     the Federal Housing Administration shall be to safeguard and \n     preserve the solvency of the Administration.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes to explain. \nI know the leadership has already made these announcements, but as I \nhave been told, at 5:30 there will be two votes on amendments offered \nby our colleague from Louisiana, Senator Vitter. I am going to take a \nfew minutes here, once again, to review the underlying proposals \nSenator Shelby of Alabama and I have crafted as part of this bill. Then \nI will take a few minutes to express my views on the two Vitter \namendments. I presume Senator Vitter himself may come over and talk \nabout this or others who are interested in the two amendments may show \nup to express their interest in them as well.\n  I thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, for scheduling the time \nfor the consideration of this bill. Obviously, the importance of \nforeclosure mitigation is still critical. I still believe, as many do, \nthat the root cause of our financial problems in this country began \nwith the residential mortgage market, the predatory lending that went \non with literally millions of people in this country. The Wall Street \nJournal reported that some 60 to 65 percent of people who were talked \ninto predatory loans, subprime loans, actually qualified for \nconventional mortgages. Conventional mortgages are far less costly than \nsubprime mortgages, but because there was a greater financial reward \nfor brokers and others who were able to market and sell the subprime \nmortgages, they were marketed to people. Of course, those mortgages \nbecame far more costly. There were adjustable rate mortgages, there \nwere teaser rates with almost no downpayments required and very little \ninterest payments for months on end and then, of course, ballooning to \nthe point that many people could ill-afford them. For many, they could \nnot the afford them at all, to the point that problem migrated to other \nareas of our economy. As a result, today we find ourselves in a \nrecession, and a deep one at that.\n  This bill is designed to help families save their homes. That is what \nit is designed to do. There are a lot of provisions that relate to the \nsmaller banks in the country and how we can be of some help to them to \nget credit moving.\n  I did this last week at the close of business, but I thought I would \nspend a few minutes to review, once again, the major provisions of the \nbill without going into great detail as to what is included in each \nprovision and then, as I said, address the two Vitter amendments that \nwill be offered later this afternoon.\n  This amendment we have offered is a substitute amendment that Senator \nShelby and I have before us now, which is S. 896. It expands the number \nof tools available to try to prevent foreclosures and the ability of \nhomeowners and loan servicers to use those tools. In addition, the bill \nincludes provisions to make the banking system more stable and improve \nthe availability of credit.\n  Specifically, there are about 8 or 9 or 10 major provisions of the \nbill.\n  The first of these provisions expands the ability of the Federal \nHousing Administration in rural housing to modify loans. I made the \npoint last week that this is absolutely critical. FHA has been a savior \nin many cases, providing credit when credit has not been available \nelsewhere to keep a limited housing market open. It is very important \nthat they have the tools to do that--certainly the tools to modify FHA \nor USDA loans, as they do for non-Government loans they service.\n  This part of the bill is one that is critically important and can \nmake a huge difference to people. There will be amendments offered to \nmodify this provision of the bill. If we end up undermining the role of \nthe FHA at this critical time, we can make it far more difficult for \nthese foreclosures to be mitigated and decrease the possibility of \npeople remaining in their homes.\n  Second, it expands access to the HOPE for Homeowners legislation, \nwhich makes a number of changes to that bill we adopted last summer. It \nwas a program that was well intended but left a lot of problems in \nterms of the effectiveness and efficiency of the legislation. This bill \nwill allow for the option to lower fees and streamline the borrower \ncertification requirements. We give the Secretary of the housing agency \nin our country limited discretion to determine the amount and \ndistribution of future appreciation. We ban the very wealthiest in our \ncountry from being involved in this program. It was never intended to \nbe such. We allow for incentive payments to servicers and originators \nwho participate in the program. Again, it is something designed to be \nof help to the average citizens, working families in this country.\n  Third, we create more enforcement tools for the FHA to eliminate bad \nlenders. This was an important provision that provides the tools to the \nhousing and urban development agency to more expeditiously drop lenders \nthat break FHA rules. This was needed to strengthen those provisions \nand make sure resources go to the areas that need them. They are \ncertainly not to be used by lenders who are violating the rules of FHA.\n  We then provide for a safe harbor for servicers who would either \nmodify a loan consistent with the Obama foreclosure mitigation program \nor refinance the borrower into a HOPE for Homeowners loan. This has \nbeen a contentious issue between bankers and investors, trying to do \nsomething with regard to mitigation. This has been narrowly drawn.\n  The House-passed bill--and I say this respectfully of the other \nbody--had a broad provision in this area. This was an idea Senator \nMartinez offered a number of weeks ago. He has since modified this--and \nI agree with him--to try to restrict time, duration, and circumstances \nin which a safe harbor would apply.\n  What is a safe harbor? A safe harbor is designed to encourage the \nservicers to modify loans, servicers who have had contracts with \ninvestors. The investors obviously are somewhat reluctant to watch a \nmodification of any of these things that would deprive them of the \nability to take legal action against a servicer who engaged in a \nmodification creating a safe harbor for the servicer. We encourage \nthem--it doesn't mandate but encourages them to modify those loans with \nthe borrower, in the absence of which I doubt any servicer will be \nwilling to step forward do so.\n  So this is an absolutely critical area. While there are still \nconcerns on the part of some, I believe it is the right step to be \ntaking. It is limited in duration. It is limited to only the Obama \nforeclosure mitigation and the HOPE for Homeowners, only in those two \ninstances, and therefore would not be as open and broad-based as \nprovisions that have been adopted elsewhere.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to be supportive. There will be an \neffort to change this in a way that I think would make it unworkable in \nterms of achieving the desired results here. Again, with 10,000 \nforeclosures going on every single day in our country, we need to try \nto bring closure to that problem where we can. This is not going to \nsolve every foreclosure, but it can certainly make a huge difference. \nAn estimated 1.7 to 2 million foreclosures can be avoided with this \nkind of proposal in the bill.\n  With the Obama proposals and HOPE for Homeowners proposals, we think \nthat would make a significant difference, allow people to stay in their \nhomes, and allow the lenders to get some payment back rather than the \nproperty falling into foreclosure.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the contagion effect of a foreclosed \nproperty in a neighborhood is very daunting. We know for a fact that \nwith one foreclosure in a neighborhood of a one-square-block area, the \nvalue of every other property in that square block declines by as much \nas $5,000 that very day. The last thing you want to see on your block, \nin your neighborhood, is foreclosed, boarded-up properties \ndeteriorating. If you have a home there and that property is declining \nin value by the day, obviously everyone is adversely affected.\n  So while I know this is a contentious issue for some, I am pleased \nthat most\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\nof the consumer groups, the realtors, the Financial Roundtable, and \nothers strongly support the provisions Senator Shelby and I have in \nthis bill when it comes to the issue of safe harbor. Again, I thank \nSenator Martinez, my colleague from Florida, for initiating the idea of \nthis proposal.\n  The next provision authorizes an additional $130 million for \nforeclosure prevention activities. Senator Reid is the author. I \nmentioned earlier that his support in creating the space and time for \nthis bill to come up has been critically important but also the \naddition of this language which we now know is terribly effective.\n  Earlier, Senator Schumer and others offered language to provide \nresources for the support of the prevention activities; that is, \ncounseling activities. It proved very helpful. These can be complicated \nareas. To get into the issue of modifying a mortgage requires some good \ncounseling. This is not a matter where the average person can just walk \nin and negotiate by themselves. I think having people who are \nexperienced and knowledgeable, as we now have across the country, who \ncan assist in this process, has been a great asset. These additional \nresources Senator Reid of Nevada has offered here will make a huge \ndifference for people across our Nation, in addition to what has \nalready been allocated.\n  Then we have some provisions to increase the deposit insurance with \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from $100,000 to $250,000. I \nmentioned earlier how important that is to people to avoid the kinds of \nruns that can occur when fear grips investors and depositors. \nCertainly, those who have even a passing knowledge of history, of the \nGreat Depression, know what happened when fear gripped the country and \nthere were great runs on the banks, people running and taking their \ndeposits out of the banks, feeling as though they were going to lose \nthem, and the old notion of hiding it in your mattress was not a joke; \npeople actually did that. They buried their hard-earned money on their \nproperty rather than keep it in what they perceived as an unsafe \ninstitution where they could lose those resources.\n  So back in the 1930s, the FDIC was created to provide, among other \nthings, an ability, when a bank is in trouble, to make that transition \nfrom a closed bank to one that could open so the people would not loose \ntheir resources, as well as providing insurance so that money would not \nbe lost, a full guarantee of up to $100,000.\n  The world has changed a lot since the 1980s, which is when I believe \nthat provision, the $100,000, was added, over the last 29 or 30 years. \nRaising it to $250,000 we believed was necessary to assist, providing \nfurther guarantee and assistance as well.\n  We increased borrowing authority in this bill for both the FDIC and \nthe National Credit Union Administration, from $100 billion in the case \nof the FDIC and $6 billion for the National Credit Union \nAdministration. There is additional authority that requires the \napproval of a two-thirds vote of the FDIC or National Credit Union \nAdministration, a two-thirds vote of the Federal Reserve Board, and \nagreement by the Secretary of Treasury in consultation with the \nPresident of the United States.\n  We stretch out the payment of assessments to rebuild bank thrift and \ncredit union deposit insurance funds to 8 years. This was a very \nimportant provision; for many of our lending institutions, that period \nof assessment is absolutely essential. If it is too short, it obviously \nputs a huge financial burden on these institutions. I believe the 8 \nyears was a provision that was very important to these institutions and \none that they are very pleased our legislation includes. I hope that \nwill work as well as we intend it to.\n  We also improve the FDIC systemic risk special assessment authority. \nAgain, that is a real relief to institutions that would not participate \nin that program, that would have been assessed anyway. This provision \nof the bill protects them from that kind of assessment. Again, it is \nessentially important.\n  That is a very quick review of the major provisions of the bill. As I \nmentioned earlier, this legislation enjoys broad-based support in our \ncountry, from major groups of people from major consumer groups in our \nNation: The National Consumer Law Center, the Independent Community \nBankers, the Center for Responsible Lending, along with the Housing \nPolicy Council, the Financial Services Roundtable, the American Bankers \nAssociation. Rarely do I find these organizations coming together \naround a bill.\n  You will normally have the consumer groups on one side and your \nfinancial services sector on the other side. That is normally how it \nworks. But because of the effort made by so many people on our \ncommittee and elsewhere, we have put together a piece of legislation \nwhich we think will make a difference on foreclosure, provide some \nneeded reform to our major financial institutions, provide counseling \nand additional support for people who seek that kind of help, as well \nas attract the kind of support from diverse institutions that watch and \ncare very much about these groups.\n  Last week I included letters of support. I should add as well that \nLenders One, an association of mid-sized independent mortgage brokers, \nand the Mortgage Bankers Association, have endorsed what Senator Shelby \nand I have put together in this bill.\n  That is a rough summary of the legislation. Of course, anybody who is \ninterested in further information about this, we would welcome them to \ncome over and discuss any provision they have interest in.\n  Let me, at this point, if I can, address the two amendments which \nthis body will consider at 5:30. The first one I will discuss is the \namendment of Senator Vitter of Louisiana No. 1015.\n  This amendment, as I understand it--obviously Senator Vitter will \ncome and explain his own amendment. I hope I am accurately describing \nit. Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, currently it \nrequires the Treasury to permit a TARP recipient to repay the financial \nassistance it receives subject to consultation with the appropriate \nFederal banking agency. When the assistance is repaid, the recipient \nmust also buy back the warrants it provided to the Treasury at the \ncurrent market price.\n  As I understand the Vitter amendment, it would require the Treasury \nto permit a TARP recipient to repay TARP assistance it received if the \ninstitution would be ``well capitalized'' after repaying the funds.\n  Capitalization of our lending institutions is a critical component, \nas the Presiding Officer knows, very important, certainly essential, \nbefore one would even consider, again, having TARP money come back, the \nwhole idea of insisting upon properly capitalized institutions.\n  Under the amendment, Treasury could not condition the right of a TARP \nrecipient to repay TARP on an agreement to also buy back the warrants. \nUnder the current law, payback of the TARP money must be accompanied by \nthe repurchase of those warrants.\n  In fact, the amendment gives the TARP recipient the right to \ndetermine when the Treasury must buy back the warrants it received; the \nTARP recipient is not required to pay market price for them.\n  I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against it, I \nsay respectfully of the author of the amendment, Senator Vitter, a \nmember of our committee. I am concerned this amendment, if adopted, \nwould further destabilize our financial system and could harm taxpayers \nwho, of course, are the ones who put up the TARP money.\n  Under this amendment, the Treasury would be forced to permit a bank \nthat received TARP money to repay that assistance based on the sole \ncriterion that the bank would remain well capitalized. Again, I \nemphasize that is an important consideration, but it is not the only \none.\n  If there is one lesson we have learned from this crisis, the \ndefinition for what ``well capitalized'' means is inadequate. For \nexample, Citibank and Bank of America are well capitalized according to \nthe standard in the amendment, and despite their obvious troubles, they \nwould be able to return the TARP money they received. The standard the \namendment would establish is simply ineffective and not comprehensive \nenough.\n  Currently, the regulators can consider the bank's condition in a more \ncomplete, holistic way in assessing its\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\nfitness to return TARP funds. The amendment would tie the hands of the \nregulators to this one particular factor, capital, a very important one \nbut not the only one, a factor that has already proven to be faulty and \ninsufficient to weather today's economic climate.\n  To get out from under the executive compensation restrictions and \nother conditions imposed by Treasury, for example, institutions that \nare in a weakened condition may put themselves and the broader economy \nat risk. That is why this is important. If we are only talking about \none institution, certainly getting the TARP money back is something we \nwould all welcome. But I think we need to look at this beyond just what \nthe effect is on that one institution but what is the effect of the \noverall financial system. That was the reason why these TARP dollars \nwent out in the first place.\n  So while being well capitalized is very important, if you limit it to \nthat and that only and allow an institution, such as the ones I have \nmentioned, to then move beyond that, there could be put at risk the \nlarger economy, which is, of course, the major goal here, to get the \noverall economy functioning and moving in the right direction.\n  If banks were allowed to move in that direction merely on that basis \nalone, then I think we would regret that. Again, I think it is \nsomething we ought to be striving for, but this amendment is too \nnarrow, in my view, to limit the decisions strictly on that one \ncriterion. If lending is limited as a result of this amendment, that \nwould mean more businesses closing for lack of financing, more job \nlosses in our country, and a further weakening of the overall economy, \ndelaying even further the recovery we all seek.\n  It also would mean more foreclosures, which is at the heart of the \nbill. Foreclosed homes will stay on the market longer because people \nwould not be able to get mortgages to buy these homes.\n  As my colleagues know, the large banks have gone through the so-\ncalled stress tests. Many of them, despite being designated as ``well-\ncapitalized,'' may still be forced to raise more capital, we are told.\n  It strikes me as unwise that we want to tie Treasury's hands at this \nimportant time, right when the results of the stress tests are to be \nannounced.\n  The amendment would also harm the taxpayer by allowing the TARP \nrecipient to decide when warrants may be exercised and by limiting the \nTreasury's ability to require the repurchase of warrants when TARP \nfunds have been repaid.\n  It also harms the taxpayer by eliminating the requirement that \nTreasury pay market price for the warrants and would allow banks to try \nto negotiate a better price, thereby reducing the returns to the \ntaxpayers who put up the money in the first place.\n  In conclusion, I would respectfully oppose this amendment. Current \nlaw already allows the banks to repay their TARP funding--in fact, we \nwould encourage it--when it is the right time and safe to do so, \nexamining an array of criteria, not just being well-capitalized. The \nquicker we can do that, the better off we are going to be. But it will \nbe important that when some of these major institutions repay that, \nthat in so doing they are not going to be jeopardizing the economy at \nlarge.\n\n  The amendment, however, could cut credit availability at a time when \ncredit is desperately needed; and could put more institutions at risk \nwhen stability is needed; and it is a bad deal, further, for the \nAmerican taxpayer who, ultimately, is the one who put up the resources \nand hopes to get repaid when this economy begins to recover.\n  Again, respectfully I say to my colleague and friend from Louisiana, \nI would oppose that amendment.\n  The second amendment is No. 1017. This amendment deals with the \nFederal Housing Administration. The Vitter amendment would establish \n``solvency'' as the ``primary foundational responsibility'' of the \nFederal Housing Administration, the FHA.\n  The amendment then requires the Secretary to close down any FHA \nprogram if it seems ``reasonably likely'' that the FHA might need \ncredit subsidy from Congress. Again, I oppose this amendment because it \ndoes exactly the opposite of what we ought to be doing at a moment such \nas this.\n  We thank our lucky stars that we have the FHA providing credit at \nthis time. In exactly a moment such as this, you need the FHA out there \nto provide that credit when credit is so unavailable through the \nclogged-up financial system in our Nation. First and foremost, this \namendment fails to reflect the fact that the primary mission of the \nFederal Housing Administration is to help create and sustain home \nownership for American families.\n  The mission of the FHA is especially important now, while we are \nstruggling through such troubled economic times. FHA currently insures \nnearly 30 percent of the mortgage market in our Nation.\n  If you extend the logic that the amendment proposes, you would shut \nthe doors of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac right now because both have had \nto draw on their credit lines from the Treasury. Without them, we would \nlose the other 70 percent of the mortgage market overnight, turning a \nhousing recession into a deep housing depression.\n  In my view, if it were not for the Federal Government at this hour, \nworking through FHA and other federally supported institutions, there \nwould be no mortgage credit available at all.\n  The FHA has a mission. It is to ensure that adequate and affordable \nmortgage credit is available in every part of our Nation. It is \ncurrently fulfilling that mission admirably, while many other sources \nof credit, as I mentioned earlier, have totally disappeared or almost \ncompletely disappeared.\n  The Federal Housing Administration pushes against the prevailing \ndownward winds in our economy. It is countercyclical. The Senator's \namendment would turn the FHA into a procyclical program, withdrawing \ncredit, pulling it back, when credit is so difficult to come by. This \nchange would help deepen the worst housing recession we are \nexperiencing since the Great Depression.\n  Moreover, I think it is important to know that FHA fund is not at \nrisk. As of the second half of the fiscal year 2009, the sum of FHA's \ninvestments and cash on hand is nearly $32 billion. Its net position, \nassets minus liabilities, on March 31 of this year, was a positive \n$11.8 billion. Although FHA's capital has fallen to 3 percent, it is \nstill 50 percent above its statutorily mandated level of 2 percent. \nFalling capital in tough times is to be expected. That is what is going \non. We all understand that. That is what you have capital for, to \nprotect yourself in the bad times.\n  In addition, it is important to remember that FHA has always been a \nfixed-rate mortgage insurer. It never got involved in the exotic and \noften predatory practices offered by the subprime lenders. FHA has also \nrequired income to be documented and verified.\n  In fact, because FHA has been known for its solid loan products, more \nand more people with better credit quality are using FHA today. Over \nthe past 6 months, the average credit score in FHA has increased by \nnearly 40 points.\n  Finally, current law already establishes a fiduciary duty ``to ensure \nthat the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund remains financially sound.'' \nThe Secretary is already required to make program changes or adjust \npremiums if FHA's performance is expected to differ substantially from \nthe baseline established by an independent actuarial report.\n  Secretary Donovan has assured me and the Congress that the Congress \nwould be immediately alerted if he thought the FHA was at risk at all.\n  In short, I ask my colleagues, again, I say this respectfully of its \nauthor, to oppose this amendment. It is not needed. It would be exactly \nthe wrong message, the wrong action to be taking at this critical time. \nSolvency is not an insignificant issue, but the role of the FHA is not \nto provide solvency, necessarily, but it is to provide credit at a time \nwhen credit is not available.\n  When as many people as I have indicated by the facts are relying on \nthe FHA at a time when we are trying to encourage home ownership on \nresponsible terms--and the FHA, as I pointed out earlier, was not one \nof these exotic lenders that was out there with these predatory \npractices. Quite the contrary. So rather than, in a sense, changing the \nmission of the FHA, fundamentally altering what its goal is\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\nand ought to be at these times, we need to oppose this amendment.\n  Again, we need to rely, as we can and must, on the fact that the FHA \nis in sound shape. If it is not for some reason, we have every reason \nto believe we can take improvement steps.\n  Accordingly, again, I would urge our colleagues, when talking about \nboth of these amendments, join me in opposing them, given the \ndifficulty that both these amendments would raise if they were to be \nadopted.\n  Again, I will be happy to be in the Chamber for the next hour or so. \nIf people wish to come over and engage in a discussion or debate, I \nwelcome that opportunity. But at 5:30, in a little more than an hour, \nwe will have a vote on both these amendments of our colleague from \nLouisiana.\n  Let me say, again, I think we assume this is personal in nature. It \nis not. I have respect for my colleague. We have a different point of \nview on matters. That is the nature of the institution and the debate \nthat occurs.\n  I don't question his motives or the sincerity behind his amendments, \nbut I believe in both cases they would move us in the opposite \ndirection from where we need to be going.\n  With regard to TARP funding, all of us wish to get the TARP money \nback to the taxpayers as quickly as we can with interest. But we need \nto understand it is more than just capitalization when we make that \ndecision. We don't want to do harm to our economy at a critical moment \nsuch as this. Secondly, with regard to FHA, solvency is important. The \nmission of FHA is, of course, to be countercyclical, not procyclical. \nAt a critical time such as this, depriving them of that opportunity to \nfill a credit gap that does not exist today would be exactly the wrong \nmessage and do great damage to a critical component of home ownership.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to offer some remarks on the \nHelping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009.\n  The housing foreclosure crisis continues to affect families and \ncommunities throughout the Nation. I appreciate the good efforts of \nSenators Dodd and Shelby and the Banking Committee for trying to tackle \nthis crisis. Until we address these issues head-on and remove the toxic \nassets that have poisoned not only our financial system but the world's \nfinancial system, economic recovery will be difficult to achieve. \nPresident Obama himself said, when he addressed us in January, that all \nthe other things happening are not going to get us out of the crisis we \nare in until we get the toxic assets out of the system.\n  I particularly appreciate the fact that included in the bill is the \nDodd-Crapo-Bond bill as an amendment which will strengthen the power of \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to go after institutions \nwhich are on the verge of failing. To me, that is the direction this \nadministration and the previous administration should have been \nfollowing but have not.\n  But there are some troubling aspects of the Government's action in \nthe FHA area, and I am concerned about the implications of some of the \nprovisions in the bill before us. My biggest concern is the health and \nsolvency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Federal \nHousing Administration, or FHA. I appreciate the work the managers have \ndone to deal with the fraud issues. I also support Senator Vitter's \nefforts to raise this issue through an amendment he has offered. I \nthink this amendment goes in the right direction. We might want to work \non some of the language, but it gets at the problem.\n  The bottom line is this: The FHA is a powder keg that could explode, \nleaving the taxpayers on the hook if Congress and the administration \ncontinue to overburden the Government agency. As I stated at a recent \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee hearing, the FHA's health and solvency are at high risk. \nThe signs are troubling in many areas: FHA default rates are at their \nhighest level in several years. FHA's economic value has fallen by \nalmost 40 percent over the past year. FHA approval of new lenders has \nincreased by 525 percent over the past 2 years, and there is evidence \nthat some former subprime lenders and brokers have infiltrated FHA to \nconduct business. That in itself ought to be an alarm bell that goes \noff. Fraudulent activity in the mortgage industry has put and is at \nrisk of exposing FHA to more risk. FHA has seen a significant increase \nin foreclosures, which endangers the stability of communities and \nneighboring homes. The rise in FHA defaults and foreclosures, \nespecially in areas already victimized by subprime lending, threatens \nto make a bad problem worse. These troubling signs all point to a \npowder keg that is waiting to explode.\n  What does this mean for taxpayers? It means, by law, FHA is required \nto carry a 2-percent reserve or a 50-to-1 leverage rate. If it falls \nbelow that statutory level, FHA must raise the premiums it charges to \nborrowers or Congress must appropriate funds. That means taxpayers \nfooting more of the bill.\n  I have a message for my colleagues in Congress and the \nadministration: Americans do not want another bailout. The taxpayer \ncredit card is maxed out.\n  Luckily, HUD is currently being led by a very capable leader, HUD \nSecretary Shaun Donovan. However, he alone cannot fix the longstanding \nproblems with HUD and FHA. The Congress and the administration must not \nmake Secretary Donovan's job harder by placing more risk on FHA until \nthe problems of the agency are fixed or the agency will crash.\n  I read in today's Wall Street Journal an editorial, which I will ask \nto be printed in the Record, that says:\n\n       In a rational world, Congress and the White House would \n     tighten FHA underwriting standards, in particular by \n     eliminating the 100% guarantee. That guarantee means banks \n     and mortgage lenders have no skin in the game; lenders \n     collect the 2% to 3% origination fees on as many FHA loans as \n     they can push out the door regardless of whether the borrower \n     has a likelihood of repaying the mortgage.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. Let me reemphasize, because this is important, if we \ncontinue to overburden FHA, this powder keg may explode.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Vitter, for highlighting the need to \nmake protecting FHA solvency a priority--so taxpayers are not left on \nthe hook. I ask my colleagues to support that amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 4, 2009]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         The Next Housing Bust\n\n       Everyone knows how loose mortgage underwriting led to the \n     go-go days of multitrillion-dollar subprime lending. What \n     isn't well known is that a parallel subprime market has \n     emerged over the past year--all made possible by the Federal \n     Housing Administration. This also won't end happily for \n     taxpayers or the housing market.\n       Last year banks issued $180 billion of new mortgages \n     insured by the FHA, which means they carry a 100% taxpayer \n     guarantee. Many of these have the same characteristics as \n     subprime loans: low downpayment requirements, high-risk \n     borrowers, and in many cases shady mortgage originators. FHA \n     now insures nearly one of every three new mortgages, up from \n     2% in 2006.\n       The financial results so far are not as dire as those \n     created by the subprime frenzy of 2004-2007, but taxpayer \n     losses are mounting on its $562 billion portfolio. According \n     to Mortgage Bankers Association data, more than one in eight \n     FHA loans, is now delinquent--nearly triple the rate on \n     conventional, nonsubprime loan portfolios. Another 7.5% of \n     recent FHA loans are in ``serious delinquency,'' which means \n     at least three months overdue.\n       The FHA is almost certainly going to need a taxpayer \n     bailout in the months ahead. The only debate is how Much it \n     will cost. By law FHA must carry a 2% reserve (or a 50 to l \n     leverage rate), and it is now 3% and falling. Some experts \n     see bailout costs from $50 billion to $100 billion or more, \n     depending on how long the recession lasts.\n       How did this happen? The FHA was created during the \n     Depression to help moderate-income and first time homebuyers \n     obtain a mortgage. However, as subprime lending took off, \n     banks fled from the FHA and its business fell by almost 80%. \n     Under the Bush\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\n     Administration, the FHA then began a bizarre initiative to \n     ``regain its market share.'' And beginning in 2007, the Bush \n     FHA, Congress, the homebuilders and Realtors teamed up to \n     expand the agency's role.\n       The bill that passed last summer more than doubled the \n     maximum loan amount that FHA can insure--to $719,000 from \n     $362,500 in high-priced markets. Congress evidently believes \n     that a moderate-income buyer can afford a $700,000 house. \n     This increase in the loan amount was supposed to boost the \n     housing market as subprime crashed and demand for homes \n     plummeted. But FHA's expansion has hardly arrested the \n     housing market decline. The higher FHA loan ceiling was also \n     supposed to be tempor- rary, but this year Congress made it \n     permanent.\n       Even more foolish has been the campaign to lower FHA \n     downpayment requirements. When FHA opened in the 1930s, the \n     downpayment minimum was 20%; it fell to 10% in the 1960s, and \n     then 3% in 1978. Last year the Senate wisely insisted on \n     raising the downpayment to 3.5%, but that is still far too \n     low to reduce delinquencies in a falling market.\n       Because FHA also allows borrowers to finance closing costs \n     and other fees as part of the mortgage, the purchaser's \n     equity can be very close to zero. With even a small drop in \n     prices, many homeowners soon have mortgages larger than their \n     home's value--which is one reason FHA's defaults are rising. \n     Every study shows that by far the best way to reduce defaults \n     and foreclosures is to increase downpayments. Banks know this \n     and have returned to a 10% minimum downpayment on their non-\n     FHA loans.\n       In a rational world, Congress and the White House would \n     tighten FHA underwriting standards, in particular by \n     eliminating the 100% guarantee. That guarantee means banks \n     and mortgage lenders have no skin in the game; lenders \n     collect the 2% to 3% origination fees on as many FHA loans as \n     they can push out the door regardless of whether the borrower \n     has a likelihood of repaying the mortgage. The Washington \n     Post reported in March a near-tripling in the past year in \n     the number of loans in which a borrower failed to make more \n     than a single payment. One Florida bank, Great Country \n     Mortgage of Coral Gables, had a 64% default rate on its FHA \n     properties.\n       The Veterans Affairs housing program has a default rate \n     about half that of FHA loans, mainly because the VA provides \n     only a 50% maximum guarantee. If banks won't take half the \n     risk of nonpayment, this is a market test that the loan \n     shouldn't be made.\n       These reforms have long been blocked by the powerful \n     housing lobby--Realtors, homebuilders and mortgage bankers, \n     backed by their friends in Congress. They claim FHA makes \n     money for taxpayers through the premiums it collects from \n     homebuyers. But keep in mind these are the same folks who \n     said taxpayers weren't at risk with Fannie Mae and Freddie \n     Mac.\n       A major lesson of Fan and Fred and the subprime fiasco is \n     that no one benefits when we push families into homes they \n     can't afford. Yet that's what Congress is doing once again as \n     it relentlessly expands FHA lending with minimal oversight or \n     taxpayer safeguards.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I applaud the work of Chairman Dodd on \nthis issue, as on so many others--fighting the terrible problems of \ncredit card abuse, dealing with the home foreclosure mess--and thank \nhim for his work.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me just say that my offering these \namendments should not necessarily indicate we have reached an agreement \non these amendments. Senator Grassley's staff and our staff are working \ntogether to see if we can achieve an agreement on them. We hope we do. \nBut certainly he has the right to raise those amendments, and I was \nmore than happy to offer them on his behalf.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1016 and 1017\n\n  Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 shall be equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendments Nos. 1016 and 1017 \noffered by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to again present my amendments \ncoming up for a vote, Nos. 1016 and 1017. I have spoken before on this \nfloor about them, but I want to summarize briefly.\n  Amendment No. 1016 is very simple and straightforward, but it is very \nimportant as well. It says any bank that has accepted taxpayer TARP \ndollars can repay those dollars, with interest, and get out of the \nprogram whenever it wants, as long as it meets all of the safety and \nsoundness criteria, and all the capitalization and liquidity criteria \nthat all of the regulators who regulate that bank have on them. Again, \nthis is a very basic but important idea.\n  The TARP program was designed to stabilize shaky banks. So if a bank \nwants to give back the money, with interest, as long as it meets all of \nthe safety and soundness criteria--every one in sight--it should be \nable to do that.\n  You would think this would be beyond debate. Unfortunately, it is not \nand, unfortunately, several folks, starting with the Secretary of the \nTreasury, Timothy Geithner, are refusing to let this happen. In fact, \nSecretary Geithner has been very clear that this isn't simply up to \nthose banks; it is up to their new senior partner, the Federal \nGovernment. It is sort of like when the mob comes in as your partner in \na business; you lose complete control and you cannot decide that it is \nnot time for them to buy you out. After that happens, no, no, no, it is \nno longer your decision.\n  As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, with regard to an \ninterview with the Secretary, he indicated that the ``health of \nindividual banks won't be the sole criteria for whether financial firms \nwill be allowed to repay bailout funds.''\n  What a great, brave, new world we now live in, where individual \nprivate institutions cannot set their own course, cannot decide their \nown destiny, and cannot even give back taxpayer dollars to benefit the \ntaxpayer, benefit the Treasury, with interest, as long as they meet all \nof the safety and soundness and capitalization and liquidity \nrequirements in sight.\n  There is also a provision in my amendment that says Treasury cannot \nforce repayment buyback of the warrants at a price they name. That is \ncompletely noncontroversial, since a distinguished member of the \nmajority, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, is proposing precisely my \nsame language with regard to warrants. This is an important issue \nregarding our free market system and whether we are going to allow it \nto get back to a private firm-based free market system.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Second is my amendment No. 1017. This amendment has to do with the \nFederal Housing Administration. It simply focuses like a laser beam on \nthe importance of preserving and protecting the fundamental solvency of \nthe FHA. This amendment requires that the first duty of the FHA is to \nmaintain that solvency. It says if the provisions of this underlying \nbill, or any other existing requirement, cause the FHA to be reasonably \nlikely to need a bailout from Congress--which a lot of folks think is \nimminent--then the Commissioner shall temporarily suspend that program \nwhich is causing a need for a bailout and recommend legislation to \nCongress to fix the situation.\n  Many observers, including the Wall Street Journal, think it is a \nvirtual certainty that we are headed toward a crippling blow to the FHA \nneeding a bailout from Congress. Rather than rush there and heap more \nburdens and more requirements and more need for more money on the FHA, \nwhich this underlying bill does, perhaps we should put in place some \nbasic protections to the solvency of the FHA. That is what my amendment \ndoes very clearly.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I see my friend from Louisiana is here. I \nspoke earlier about my colleague's two amendments. I appreciate the \nspirit and motivation behind them. I will take a couple of minutes to \nreview my concern about them.\n  First, regarding Senator Vitter's first amendment, No. 1016, dealing \nwith TARP money, I think we all would like money coming back sooner \nrather than later--getting to a point where these resources come back, \nwith additional interest, to the extent that taxpayers can be made \nwhole as a result of coming up with that money in the first instance \nand trying to bring stability to the financial markets. There is no \ndebate about that. We agree about that.\n  There was significant debate that occurred about whether there should \nbe TARP money to begin with. It wasn't all one way. I supported it. I \nthought it made sense to try to stabilize our economy. I believe most \nbelieve that the decision made last September, early October, was the \nright one. In fact, had we not done that, we probably would have lost \nmajor lending institutions in the country over many months. Obviously, \nthis administration inherited a good part of the problem, which didn't \nbegin overnight, and it is trying to grapple with it in a holistic \nfashion, institution by institution.\n  My concern with the amendment of my friend from Louisiana is this: He \nis absolutely correct that, again, if we have an institution that is \nwell capitalized, that is a very important criteria in consideration of \nwhen these TARP moneys ought to be repaid. My concern is it is not the \nonly criteria. We have major lending institutions, which I could make a \ncase both in Citi and Bank of America, that are well capitalized but, \nfrankly, they have other issues they are grappling with beyond being \nwell capitalized.\n  If that was the sole criterion, then we would be able to have the \nTARP money come back. Citi may want to do that, and Bank of America--\nand I am not suggesting they do, but they may--\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\ntheir problems could migrate very quickly to the larger financial \nproblems with which we are trying to deal.\n  On the one hand, I agree with the motivation, and that is we ought to \ntry to get to the bottom of this as quickly as we can, get the TARP \nmoneys back so the Treasury is replenished with these resources. On the \nother hand, if we do so prematurely solely on the basis of being well \ncapitalized, we can end up compounding a problem that is already \nserious and making it far worse.\n  For that reason, I urge this amendment be rejected. I say that \nrespectfully to my colleague. I don't like getting up and opposing \namendments for the simple reason of opposing them. There is a \ndifference here, to have one criteria on which we would depend solely \non the determination of returning these dollars, putting the larger \nissues at risk, I think would not be the right move to make at this \npoint. Therefore, at the appropriate time I will ask for the amendment \nto be rejected.\n  Regarding FHA--and, again, I find myself in the awkward position of \nnot disagreeing with my colleague. Solvency is obviously an important \nissue. Had the rest of the lending institutions in the country been as \nprudent as FHA, we wouldn't be here talking about this larger problem.\n  FHA never engaged in the exotic instruments that many others did in \nthe subprime markets with teaser rates and no-doc loans, as they were \ncalled, or liar loans. FHA has been a well-run, prudent operation. \nToday, when very little credit is available for home mortgages, FHA is \nproving to be vitally important. Thirty percent of the mortgage market \ntoday is made up of FHA. If the goal of FHA is strictly the solvency of \nit--today it is 50 percent above statutorily what it is required to \nhave on a cap of 2 percent, at 3 percent, less than 6 they had a while \nago. Obviously, we have to keep an eye on this. But the law statutorily \nrequires the Secretary of the Treasury to notify the Congress when, in \nfact, there is danger of FHA falling either at or below that 2-percent \nrequirement.\n  Again, solvency is not insignificant. If that becomes the criteria at \na time when we need to be getting more credit out so we begin to get \nthe housing market moving again, I think it is absolutely essential. If \nFHA is forced to close down just as it is needed most, making it \nprocyclical not countercyclical--which is exactly what we need to be is \ncountercyclical, not procyclical--then we would be turning the \nrecession in the housing area into a depression, which none of us want \nto see happen.\n  At this hour, it is very important that we keep FHA moving in that \ndirection, watching, obviously, as my colleague from Louisiana suggests \nby his amendment, that solvency not be disregarded.\n  Current statute already requires the Secretary to adjust programs \nthat ensure FHA remains financially sound. In fact, like all housing-\nfocused activities, FHA has lost money in this crisis, but it still has \nmore capital than the law requires, and the quality of its borrowers is \nimproving as we speak. That is to be applauded.\n  At this very moment, were we to move away from FHA when so much of \nour housing market depends upon them, I think would be a step in the \nwrong direction. For that reason, I respectfully ask our colleagues to \noppose this amendment. Again, I find myself in the awkward position of \nnot disagreeing with what my colleague talks about in the case of both \namendments; that is, getting TARP money back as soon as we can and that \nsolvency is a critically important function at FHA. That is why the \nstatute was written the way it was. I agree with him on those points. I \nam just concerned if in the first case we set a sole criteria of being \nwell capitalized, and in the case of FHA if solvency is the only value, \nthen we lose the value of FHA at a time when housing is having a hard \ntime finding available credit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I appreciate the kind comments of my \ncolleague. I note that he never disagrees with me, although, \nunfortunately, he always opposes my amendments. We will work through \nthat.\n  I have a few closing comments. First of all, with regard to my first \namendment allowing banks to repay the TARP money as long as they are \nsound and secure, I note that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly \nsupports this amendment. I have a letter from the Chamber.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe Chamber of Commerce.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2009.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, supports \n     Vitter Amendment #1 to S. 896, the ``Helping Families Save \n     Their Homes Act of 2009.'' This amendment would remove \n     impediments to the repayment of funds received under the \n     Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).\n       The Chamber supported the passage of the Emergency Economic \n     Stabilization Act (EESA) and the creation of the TARP \n     program. Inadequate credit markets blocked the life blood of \n     the economy forcing thousands of businesses to close and \n     millions of people to lose their jobs. The EESA allows the \n     federal government to undertake temporary measures to \n     stabilize the financial services sector and restore fully \n     functioning credit markets. To bolster the effectiveness of \n     TARP, the Treasury Department requested that otherwise \n     healthy firms enter the program. Those firms have since \n     complied.\n       While the success and administration of TARP has been hotly \n     debated, the program was always envisioned as a temporary \n     measure. Last week, House Financial Services Committee Chair \n     Barney Frank was quoted in reports that he envisioned the \n     banking sector being TARP-free within a year and that ``it \n     would be good for public confidence'' if banks repay TARP \n     funds. Nevertheless, published reports have stated that \n     impediments may exist, or would be put in place, to make the \n     repayment of TARP funds problematic at best.\n       The Vitter Amendment would remove any impediments to \n     repaying TARP funds. The repayment of TARP funds is an \n     important element in restoring confidence in the financial \n     services sector and a vital and necessary step on the road to \n     economic recovery.\n       Accordingly, the Chamber urges you to support Vitter \n     Amendment #1 to S. 896.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                               Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I also note a particular line in that \nletter, which is an excellent point, which is that the repayment of \nthese moneys from TARP banks will actually be an enormously positive \nconfidence-inspiring turn of events, and I think it will do a lot to \nshore up concern regarding financial institutions that will be \ncorrectly perceived as movement in the right direction.\n  With regard to my second amendment regarding the FHA, I will just \nnote a couple of things. First of all, my amendment does not propose in \nany way shutting down the FHA under any circumstances. What it says is, \nif the FHA thinks it is headed toward insolvency, it is going to stop \nthese new mandates on it, these new programs which are pushing it \ntoward insolvency and, at the same time, immediately report to Congress \nabout how we deal with that situation.\n  Unfortunately, I don't think it is a very well kept secret that this \nis a grave threat for the FHA to start walking down the path of Fannie \nand Freddie and everyone else.\n  Again, the Wall Street Journal wrote in their very prescient article, \n``The Next Housing Bust,'' predicting exactly that. There are very many \ntell-tale signs on the horizon:\n\n       According to Mortgage Bankers Association data, more than \n     one in eight FHA loans is now delinquent, nearly triple the \n     rate of conventional non-subprime loan portfolios. Another \n     7.5 percent of recent FHA loans are in serious delinquency, \n     which means at least 3 months overdue. The FHA is almost \n     certainly going to need a taxpayer bailout in the months \n     ahead.\n\n  Let's try to head this off before another collapse, another rattling \nof the system is upon us and keep the FHA solvent rather than having it \nshaken, having public confidence rattled once again and having Congress \nhave to act in a complete emergency atmosphere. My amendment would head \nthat off in an effective way.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time to the extent I \nhave any.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to add regarding the FHA amendment,\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\nfor my colleague's information, joining me in opposing the amendment \nare the mortgage bankers, homebuilders, realtors, Lenders One--the \npeople very involved in the residential mortgage market.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                             Kentucky Derby\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know we are probably going to move \nforward on discussing the underlying bill. I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak about a resolution I would like to discuss for a moment, about a \nwonderful event that actually took place in our country this weekend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, every year for 135 years, the country \nhas been watching and cheering and celebrating the Kentucky Derby.\n  While this event is not held in Louisiana--it is held in Kentucky--\nmany people in my State and around the country tune in. Some people \nhave the opportunity to actually attend what has become one of the most \nextraordinary sporting events in our Nation's calendar year. This \nweekend was no exception. It was an extraordinary race. Anyone who \nwatched it could attest to the tremendous skill of the Louisiana born-\nand-bred jockey who rode Mine That Bird to a victory in a heart-\npounding, quite shocking and surprising victory. So this resolution \njust simply says:\n\n       Whereas Calvin Borel, born and raised in St. Martin Parish, \n     Louisiana, began riding match horses at the age of 8;--\n\n  As my husband says, we just sort of strap them on and let them go, \nbut he most certainly learned at a young age--\n\n       Whereas Mr. Borel began his professional career as a jockey \n     at the age of 16;\n       Whereas [he] has won more than 4,500 career starts;\n       Whereas [he] won the 135th Kentucky Derby by 6\\3/4\\ length, \n     the greatest winning margin since 1946;\n       Where [he] is the first jockey since 1993 to win both the \n     Kentucky Oaks--\n\n  Which is the fillies race--\n\n     and the Kentucky Derby in the same year;\n       Whereas in 2 minutes and 2.66 seconds, [he] and Mine That \n     Bird completed the race and placed first, making it [his] \n     second Kentucky Derby victory: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commends Calvin Borel and Mine \n     That Bird for their extraordinary victory at the 135th \n     Kentucky Derby.\n\n\n[[Page S5060]]\n\n\n  It is sporting events like this and races run like this on a horse \nthat cost $9,500, I understand, that was trailored by the owner and its \nmanager that keeps this sport exciting and open for so many. For all of \nus in Louisiana, we are very proud of this young jockey from down in \nthe bayou, as we say, and for the pride that he brings to our State and \nto a wonderful industry.\n\n\n                Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day\n\n  Finally, let me take a moment before the Senator comes back to debate \nthe underlying bill and submit to the Record a statement about an event \nthat took place last week on Capitol Hill and actually around the \ncountry. It is an event that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and I proudly \nand happily, joyfully sponsor every year for the Senate; that is, Take \nOur Daughters and Sons to Work Day.\n  It was started 17 years ago by Ms. Magazine, thinking it might be a \ngood idea for girls, particularly girls between the ages of 10 and 16, \nto have an opportunity to go to work with their parents because many \nwomen, of course, do wonderful work at home raising children and \nworking out of the home. But a lot of important work goes on outside of \nthe home as well. Ms. Magazine thought it would be a great opportunity \nfor girls, particularly, and then, of course, have included boys, to go \nanywhere where their parents work, whether that work is out of the home \nor in the home and actually come to appreciate the work that goes into \nkeeping our society moving forward and this country moving forward.\n  So Kay Bailey Hutchison and I cohosted. The Senator from Texas and I \nhost this every year. I would like to first acknowledge her support, \nalso acknowledge Ms. Magazine that founded this day, and to thank all \nof our Senators and staffers and workers around the Capitol who \nparticipated in that day.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the names of the young \nladies who joined me that day.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Sophie Boudreaux, Meraux, LA, Chalmette High School; \n     Dominique Cravins, Washington, DC, St. Peter's School; \n     Heather Duplessis, New Orleans, LA, Metairie Park Country Day \n     School; Maya English, Baton Rouge, LA, St. George's Episcopal \n     School; Matisse Gilmore, Mitchellville, MD; Monet Gilmore, \n     Mitchellville, MD; Golnaz Kamrad, Washington, DC, Georgetown \n     Day School; Mallory MacRostie, Bethesda, MD, Bethesda Chevy \n     Chase High School; Lily Silva, Washington, DC, Georgetown Day \n     School; Mary Shannon Snellings, daughter of Senator Mary \n     Landrieu, Washington, DC, Georgetown Day School; Mary Agnes \n     Nixon, Washington, DC, Aidan Montessori School; Sydni Rita-\n     Louise Sumas, New Orleans, LA, Ursuline Academy; Kelsey Teo, \n     Bristow, VA, Stonewall Jackson High School; Eliza Warner, \n     daughter of Senator Mark Warner, Alexandria, VA, Potomac \n     School; Brittany Watts, Tickfaw, LA, Hammond High School.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. These young ladies and many young men who joined them \nhad a wonderful day, understanding what happens at the Capitol, working \nin the Senate. I thank them and their parents for making this day \nspecial for us and hope and trust that their day was inspirational to \nthem as they think about their career opportunities in the future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will not offer my amendment at the \nmoment. We are still trying to negotiate it. But I want to discuss an \namendment I will offer, hopefully, with agreement. That is an amendment \nthat would require the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of HUD and other housing-related Federal agencies, to \ndevelop a program to address the rising defaults and foreclosures in \nmultifamily properties.\n  The program is necessary because the same excesses that occurred in \nthe single-family mortgage market also occurred in the multifamily \nmortgage market, leading to buildings that are significantly \noverleveraged with rent rolls that are unable to support basic \noperational expenses and maintenance. The tenants of these buildings \nhad absolutely no input into the misguided decision of the owners and \nlenders who mortgaged the property beyond supportable levels, but they \nare the ones who will face the consequences of this investment and \nforeclosure, as owners are unable to meet monthly payments and maintain \nthe properties.\n  In New York City alone, it is estimated that 60,000 units of \nmultifamily housing are at risk of disinvestment and foreclosure. We \nhave similar problems in smaller ways in many upstate cities as well. \nWe have seen buildings in New York where in order to make the loan \nunderwriting work, lenders estimated tenant turnover rates that would \ndouble or triple the neighborhood average, rent increases that were not \neven legal under local law, and expected maintenance costs that were \nactually less than half of what the owner spent in previous years. This \nkind of basic underwriting malpractice has left tens of thousands of \nfamilies in New York State and other States vulnerable. We are not the \nonly ones. New York has the eleventh highest multifamily delinquency \nrate in the country, according to a recent Deutsche Bank report.\n  The 15 States with the highest multifamily delinquency rates are not \nconcentrated just in the Northeast or on the west coast. This is a \ntruly national problem. I ask my colleagues to listen because their \nState may be among the one-third, or close to it, the 15 out of 50. \nThey are Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Texas, \nIllinois, Ohio, Indiana, Connecticut, Oklahoma, New York, Kentucky, \nMissouri, and Mississippi.\n  While I am strongly supportive of the administration's efforts to \nhelp families across the country obtain loan modifications and other \nfinancing options, a similar effort to protect tenants of multifamily \nproperties must be made. It must be made in a way to protect the \ntenants first and foremost and not let the developers and the \ninvestors, who did all the wrong, get away with wrongs.\n  Housing experts in New York have begun to examine options to assist \nthese buildings. There are a number of different ways that might be \neffective in addressing this problem. So the bottom line is, we need \nFederal expertise, leadership, and support to help determine the best \ncourse of action and implement a program across the country to ensure \nthat innocent tenants do not have to pay the price for the poor \ndecisions of landlords and lenders.\n  This should be an easy amendment to support. I am not asking for any \nnew money. We are certainly not asking to bail out any of the bad \nactors or even giving specific directions to the Treasury Department to \ntake this approach or that one, although I have talked to the Secretary \nof HUD about this problem and, in fact, we worked on some problems \nrelated to this when he was the head of the HPD, the housing department \nin New York City.\n  What we are doing in this amendment is simply asking the Congress to \ndirect Treasury to examine this problem and develop a program to \naddress it in whatever way they determine best. My hope is that the \nTreasury will consult with HUD. It is unfair that tenants of \nmultifamily rental buildings are being left out in the cold while \nsingle-family homeowners receive focused attention from their agencies. \nSingle-family homeowners should but so should those in multiple \ndevelopments.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that once the \nSenate resumes consideration of S. 896 on Tuesday, May 5, the time \nuntil 10:50 a.m. be for debate with respect to the Corker amendment No. \n1019, with the time equally divided and controlled between Senators \nDodd and Corker or their designees; that at 10:50 a.m., the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the amendment, with no amendment in \norder to the amendment prior to a vote.\n\n[[Page S5061]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow is National Teacher Day, granting \nus all an opportunity--an important opportunity--to honor and thank \nsome of the most dedicated public servants in our land: our teachers. \nTheir tireless devotion to the education of our children is the \ngreatest investment made in the future success of this country. At no \ntime is this more obvious than today. I rise to express my gratitude to \nthose who make a difference in young lives every day.\n  My mother, who passed away 3 months ago, was a high school English \nteacher. She grew up in Georgia. She taught in Florida. She taught in \nOhio. She always stressed the importance of an education but also \nimpressed upon me and my two older brothers the importance of how we \nuse that education.\n  So many teachers across the country are like my mother. They impart \nknowledge while they cultivate wisdom. They teach the facts while they \nencourage the imagination. Most importantly, our teachers inspire us to \nachieve our greatest goals while providing us with the foundation we \nneed to do so.\n  There are over 100,000 Ohio teachers who spend each day devoted to \nthe education and enrichment of our children. There is not one Senator \nhere who does not owe his or her achievement in public service to a \nteacher who lit that path before us. Let's all take the time to \nremember that support for our teachers today is the surest way to \npromote a better tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/04/senate-section/article/S5061-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in the last 2-plus years, I have held \nalmost 150 roundtables around my State, and there is one thing I know \nfor sure: health care reform must include health insurance reform.\n  Ohioans--as are North Carolinians and people from Connecticut--are \ntired of trying to get coverage and being rebuffed because they have a \n``preexisting health condition.'' They are tired of premiums, \ndeductibles, and copays that keep climbing. They are tired of fighting \ntooth and nail simply to get their claims paid. They are tired of \nwondering whether their insurer will pay for them to see the specialist \nthey need, get the medicine they need, have the operation they need. \nThey are tired of health insurance, which is supposed to ease \nuncertainty, breeding uncertainty instead. If they lose their job, they \nlose their insurance. If they get sick, they cannot get insurance. If \nthey submit a claim, it may be paid in a month, in 3 months, in 6 \nmonths. Sometimes they fight and fight and fight, and the claim is not \npaid at all. Ohioans are tired of their insurer treating them like \nunwanted guests rather than paying customers.\n  To be meaningful, health care reform must be responsive. And to be \nresponsive, health care reform must address insurance affordability, \ninsurance reliability, and insurance continuity. That requires a two-\npart strategy.\n  The first strategy is to give Ohioans and every American more \noptions. They should be able to choose whether to keep the coverage \nthey have or purchase coverage backed by the Federal Government. What \nis the difference between the two?\n  The federally backed plan--again, an option--would provide \ncontinuity; it would be available in every part of the country, no \nmatter how rural, no matter how sparsely populated, its benefits would \nbe guaranteed, and its cost-sharing would be affordable, no ifs, ands, \nor buts. The federally backed plan would be an option but certainly not \nthe only option. Americans who have employer-sponsored coverage would \nstill have it. Americans who have individual coverage through a private \ninsurer would still have that. The federally backed insurance would be \nan option, not a mandate. Some people will choose it, others will not.\n  One reason such an option--a Federal option--is important is because \nhundreds of thousands of Americans are losing their jobs and have no \nplace to go, have no affordable coverage options. This would give them \none. Where would they turn otherwise? If you have ever tried to \npurchase affordable coverage in the individual insurance market, you \nunderstand why a federally backed insurance program is so important. If \nyou live in a rural area where no affordable insurance coverage is \navailable, you know why a federally backed insurance option is so \nimportant. There needs to be an option for people who cannot find what \nthey need in the private insurance market--just as Medicare is there \nfor seniors. The federally backed option will give those under 65 a \nplace to turn.\n  The second strategy is to fix what is wrong with private insurance. \nOhioans should not be discriminated against by insurers based on past \nhealth care needs. Take, for example, Debra from Summit County, OH, \nnear Akron. She is one of the nearly 50 million Americans locked out of \nour health care system because she lacks insurance. Her income is too \nhigh for Medicaid, and her preexisting conditions--she has a spinal \ninjury and is recovering from two heart attacks--disqualify her from \nfinding affordable insurance in the private market. As a result, she \nhas piled up thousands of dollars in unpaid bills and is in constant \npain.\n  She wrote to me:\n\n       My only option [is] to start paying for my funeral.\n\n  Ohioans should not have to go through 100 hoops just to get a claim \npaid or see the specialist they need. They should not have to wait for \nmonths to receive their claims check. They should not have to pay \npremiums that break the bank. They should not have to pay copays and \ndeductibles so high that coverage, for all intents and purposes, is \nmeaningless. They should not be subjected to huge bills based on the \ndifference between what their provider charges and their insurer's \nreasonable and customary payments. When an insurer reimburses providers \nonly pennies on the dollar and patients have to pick up the difference, \nthat is not reasonable. That is not real insurance.\n  Long story short: Insurance reform, plus the public option, must be \npart of health care reform. We cannot claim we have fixed our health \ncare system while leaving a fault-riddled insurance system intact. If \nwe give consumers more options, including the option to purchase \nfederally backed coverage designed to provide affordability, \nreliability, and continuity, and if we reform the private health \ninsurance system to require insurers to actually do their job instead \nof skirting their liability, we will have gone a long way toward making \nthe U.S. health care system work for every American.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I compliment our colleague from Ohio for his \neloquent statement. I think it is important that we all hear our \ncolleagues as to what goes on in our respective States.\n  I commend my colleague, who has had around 150 roundtables in his \nState where he has been listening to his constituents on a wide range \nof issues. I think we all benefit from his report on those meetings.\n  I say to my colleague from Ohio, those responses you are hearing from \nyour constituents in Ohio are not any different from what we are \nhearing from all across the country, as I know my colleague is aware. \nSo we thank our colleague very much for that, and his comments on \nhealth care are very important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/04/senate-section/article/S5061-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5061-S5062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             KENTUCKY DERBY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, even people who don't follow horse \nracing, and certainly those who do, have been thunderstruck by this \nyear's Kentucky Derby results. The only reason I mention it is that the \nhorse wearing the blanket of roses this year is a gelding from New \nMexico. ``Mine That Bird'' swept the field on Saturday, coming from so \nfar behind he was last, to win with nearly seven lengths separating him \nfrom his nearest competitor.\n\n[[Page S5062]]\n\n  We have seen his trainer, Bennie ``Chip'' Woolley, and his owners, \nMark Allen and Leonard Blach, talk about this remarkable victory and \nabout the outstanding jockey, Calvin Borel.

It was a \nmasterful display of ability and skill from all involved, not least the \nhorse, and New Mexicans are delighted that our state is home to this \nyear's Derby winner.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share my feelings on the \n     outlandish energy circumstances of this great country and her \n     citizens. There is no question that increasing prices have \n     caused my family to rethink our spending habits. Though we \n     are able to fuel the vehicles right now, in an attempt to \n     save a little more we are spending substantially less in any \n     other economic environment. We do not go out to eat anymore. \n     Rarely do we seek entertainment the way we have in the past. \n     Though we will still travel, I can only do that because of \n     credit card points from my business. We are also relying on \n     food storage more so we spend a great deal less at the \n     grocery store. All of these combine to make one statement \n     from our household: Current energy prices and future \n     speculation have and will continue to impact our ability to \n     support a once thriving economy.\n       For my business, I work with truck drivers: owner-\n     operators. I have lost clients as they have shut down because \n     they cannot afford fuel. More are on the way. Everything \n     costs more. I do not need to belabor this point as I know all \n     are feeling this. What I just do not understand is the \n     stubborn bull-headedness in the legislature of those who work \n     to block everything that could ease the pain. It is as if \n     they want to destroy this country and her citizens--even \n     those citizens who elected them. It is as if there is some \n     conspiracy to destroy this country and such actions makes \n     less than no sense to me. I appreciate the few of you who \n     seem to be working to resolve the problem.\n       Increasing domestic production is the only immediate \n     resolution and future technology is the only long term \n     resolution. I support green-focused energy but not at the \n     immediate and deadly cost to our society, economy and \n     national security--all of which are on the verge of collapse \n     through our reliance on energy purchased from those who would \n     have us destroyed--enemies foreign and domestic.\n       Again, thank you for this opportunity.\n     Troy.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for allowing us to make our voices heard. I am \n     the mother of six wonderful children. My husband and I have \n     been married almost 15 years. We are raising a beautiful \n     family of good, caring, hard working children. The rising \n     cost of fuel has affected us. We do not even have the option \n     of purchasing a hybrid, or smaller car as our family will not \n     even fit. We will be staying closer to home this summer, \n     though we have family out of town we would love to visit. I \n     do not have a heart-wrenching story to give you, but it \n     affects our family every day. Due to the increasing price of \n     food, clothing, and transportation, we have cut back. We will \n     make it, but it takes money away from savings for college, \n     savings for medical expenses, and just general peace of mind \n     savings. I am a stay-at-home mom, who has thought more than \n     once lately of finding a way to enter the workforce without \n     leaving the upbringing of my six children to someone else.\n       I would very much like us to open up the resources we have \n     in this great country. It seems ludicrous to me that we have \n     the resources right around us, and yet continue to buy \n     foreign fuels . . . The earth was placed here to support us \n     and we can still take care of it even when tapping into those \n     resources that are so abundant around us. Research \n     alternative energy methods, find ways to harness those things \n     around us to power our lives.\n       Thank you for listening.\n     Shel, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I are frustrated with having to spend so \n     much on gasoline these days when the oil companies are making \n     so high a profit that each quarter they set a new record. Why \n     are they charging so high prices at the pump when they are \n     continuously setting new records? I work in downtown Boise \n     and live in southeast Boise near Micron where there are no \n     public transportation services available and impossible to \n     ride a bicycle. So I have no choice but to drive a car to \n     work. Carpooling is not feasible due to my schedule after \n     work.\n       If it were not for our Economic Stimulus Tax Rebate check, \n     we would have to cancel our summer vacation to Oregon to \n     visit family and the Oregon Coast. Due to gas prices we \n     cannot make a trip to Washington this summer to visit our \n     three other children and their families. Our daughter and \n     son-in-law who live near Belfair, Washington, are faced with \n     the difficulty with wondering how they will afford heat this \n     winter because they have oil heat in their house. They cannot \n     afford to purchase a new electric furnace nor can they afford \n     to have their oil tank refilled with the current prices. A \n     few weeks ago when it was still cold, they ran out of oil and \n     had the tank refilled one-quarter. It costs them \n     approximately $450. A tank does not make it through the \n     winter and they can in no way afford to pay current prices.\n       These prices are causing difficulty for many people and our \n     government needs to take action to have the prices reduced to \n     affordable levels such as more drilling here at home and not \n     relying on foreign resources and other ways to help save \n     energy. Back in the 70s and early 80s when we had the last \n     fuel crisis, the federal government ordered all states to \n     drop the maximum speed limit to 55 mph so to save fuel. My \n     husband and I find that both of our vehicles get more miles \n     on a tank of gas if we drive under 60 mph so we are doing so. \n     Perhaps the federal government could take this action again \n     because driving 20 miles less per hour is not that difficult \n     when you plan and allow the extra time on a long trip.\n     Betty.\n                                  ____\n\n       I need to express my concerns over the cost of energy. It \n     has affected every part of my life. I drive 40 miles one way \n     to work every day. I do this because I live in the country. \n     My costs have tripled in the last seven years. I am now \n     looking for a job that is closer to home. But, this is my \n     problem. I am 55 years old and the sole support for my \n     husband and I. He got laid off from the INL several years ago \n     after a bad car accident and has not been able to find a job \n     that pays more than $8 a hour. As I am also older and I look \n     closer to home, it will also cause me to find a lower-paying \n     job with less benefits. I am currently spending about $500 a \n     month in gas. If I purchase a newer car that gets better gas \n     mileage, I am not gaining anything because I would have to \n     pay a larger car payment and more insurance which would eat \n     up any savings. There is no public transportation in my area \n     that I can use instead of driving. I have tried carpooling, \n     but those who have ridden with me have not paid so, I am \n     hauling people without any help. I am in an endless \n     circle, and I do not appreciate the position it has put me \n     in. I am an older person who sees that I am not going to \n     be able to retire for a very long time.\n       What do I expect the government to do? I do not expect them \n     to nationalize the oil companies or discourage business. I \n     would like to see more alternative options than just \n     gasoline. There are autos out there in other countries that \n     are running on compressed air. According to the article I \n     read on the internet, we do not accept them in this country \n     because we do not recognize ``air'' as a fuel. Why not? If it \n     works, let us allow it. Why are we behind other countries. I \n     have heard that we do not have the support system for other \n     resources like hydrogen. Why not? We did not have support for \n     the gasoline engines either but we did it. What happened to \n     the good ole American spirit? We have a can-do attitude and I \n     do not think we should be whipped by the oil companies. Let \n     us give them some competition in other alternative fuels. \n     India uses methane gas to cook with. We have a lot of dairies \n     here in Idaho with a lot of cow ``by product'' that is \n     definitely renewable. So, lets encourage the American Can Do \n     attitude and support ideas promoting renewable resources.\n     Elaine.\n                                  ____\n\n       Gas prices do not affect us in one single way but in \n     hundreds of ways. They make everything more expensive and \n     work to slow the economy as a whole. People travel less and \n     buy less consumer items because they cost more. Therefore, \n     companies buy less, expand less, and spend less on their \n     facilities. It is like a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n       Please forget about short-term solutions such as the gas \n     tax amnesty. That is a ridiculous idea. Our real solutions \n     are all long-term. Invest now and in ten or twenty years \n     you'll be patting yourself on the back.\n       Here are my priorities for making the U.S. energy \n     independent:\n       1. More drilling everywhere, ANWR, the Gulf Coast, etc. \n     Give oil companies more areas to drill.\n       2. More nuclear production. Please do everything you can to \n     make it easier and cheaper for companies to put in new \n     reactors.\n\n[[Page S5063]]\n\n       3. More electric and plug-in hybrid cars. Most people do \n     not seem to make the connection that nuclear, coal, wind, \n     etc. produce electricity and without electric and plug-in \n     hybrid cars, gas prices are not going to go down. We have the \n     technology now for both of these types of cars. Let us start \n     producing them! This is probably the quickest and most \n     immediate way to reduce gas prices. We already have all of \n     the infrastructure in place.\n       4. Clean coal production. Nuclear alone will not cut it. We \n     need to get off of coal but it is going to take several \n     decades.\n       Low, Low, Priorities:\n       1. Alternative energy (wind, solar, etc.). It is a \n     ridiculously small percentage of our total power production \n     for several reasons. I know that it is great politically but \n     the technology is generations away. Nuclear is a technology \n     we already have.\n       2. Hydrogen Vehicles: This technology is a long way off. \n     Also, what about the infrastructure? It would be ridiculously \n     expensive.\n       I would say this to any politician: Please do what is right \n     for the United States, regardless of what is right for you \n     personally or politically. That is really what we need.\n     Nathan, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       You may not like what I have to say. I believe in tough \n     love and tough policies. Current oil prices are causing \n     changes, but they are the types of changes that create a \n     ``correction'' whereby the cost of fuel is real. It is real \n     that foreign oil prices are too high to ignore. Governments \n     getting in the way of a natural rebellion to that real cost \n     does not offer long-term sustainable solutions. Okay, so I \n     become a bit more frugal with the miles I drive; and so I \n     start looking into buying a more fuel-efficient vehicle. \n     These changes cause real and natural consequences like \n     manufacturers dumping more of their money into creating \n     greener options for consumers. Consumers will rebel \n     against costs. Lifestyles will change. Why do not we \n     embrace the positive direction this drives us--away from \n     materialism and consumerism (the hatred of which caused us \n     to be the target of the Taliban in the first place)?\n       War on terrorism is still war. Showing love to our planet \n     and global community by accepting the consequences of prior \n     mistakes (need I elaborate?) and vowing not to repeat or \n     continue the rape our natural resources: this will heal the \n     hatred. There is something much deeper at stake here than the \n     pocketbooks of the American people. I urge you to dig for \n     that, not for petroleum.\n       All the issues are as connected as we Americans are to the \n     cultures that span the globe.\n     Susan, Ketchum.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a disabled Vietnam Veteran; my disability benefits are \n     $914 a month. With the cost of gas now and the rising price \n     of food, I cannot really afford to go anywhere. It takes me \n     three months to save enough extra money to buy a tank of gas \n     to go visit my mother. who is in a home in Jackson, Wyoming. \n     If gas and food prices get any higher, there will be no need \n     for me to even own a car, for I will not be able to afford \n     the insurance and tags.\n     Robert.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am less concerned about gasoline price than I am about \n     heating fuel. Being recently (involuntarily) placed in the \n     ``fixed income'' category, I am in a position that I do have \n     a fair amount of discretion regarding the number of miles I \n     drive each year, but as both my wife and myself are advancing \n     in age, thus increasingly more sensitive to hyperthermia, I \n     am much less flexible regarding heating. The projected global \n     cooling for the next decade, with return to harsh Idaho \n     winters, simply exacerbates the situation. A few years ago, \n     the highest monthly home energy bill I faced (fuel oil, \n     electricity, and propane) was on the order of $500. Last \n     winter, that cost rose to $1,500. Looking at projected fuel \n     and electricity costs, within a few years that will increase \n     to $3,000. Should that happen, I am faced with the prospect \n     of having to sell my house in order to afford heating it.\n       In the 1970s, the citizens of this country accepted energy \n     conservation as a stopgap measure to allow the federal \n     government time to devise a self-sufficient and affordable \n     energy infrastructure for the country. The federal government \n     has not only squandered the three decades of grace given it, \n     but has actively blocked all measures attempted by private \n     enterprise to develop a workable domestic energy supply. The \n     only measures that have been taken by the federal government \n     (such as ethanol) have made the situation worse by \n     skyrocketing food costs, which we are only seeing the leading \n     edge of. I raise poultry. A 50-pound bag of turkey finisher \n     (of which corn is a major component) cost $8 in 2004. In \n     February of this year, it was $15, Last month, that same sack \n     of turkey finisher was $30. A 50-pound bag of scratch grain \n     rose from $5 to $15 during that same time frame. Chicken feed \n     ain't chicken feed any more, and although transportation \n     costs have contributed to feed cost, it certainly is not the \n     major contributor. Whatever were you people thinking of when \n     you decided to subsidize competition of this country's energy \n     supply with its food supply?\n       As far as what I want to see our federal government do, \n     first, dissolve the Department of Energy and replace it with \n     a commission drawn from private enterprise, then task them to \n     correct the total failure of the DOE to devise an effective \n     short-term and long-term energy policy for the USA. Second, \n     remove the hobbles the government has placed on the oil \n     companies for using currently known petroleum reserves, \n     including off-shore and, especially, ANWR. Third, roll back \n     the excessive and crippling regulations the federal \n     government has placed on this country. Quit the insane policy \n     of requiring our dwindling number of refineries to produce \n     dozens of different gasoline and diesel blends. Return to a \n     licensing process that allows a nuclear plant, coal-fired \n     plant, or refinery to be on line within five years of license \n     application. Fourth, immediately start rebuilding our nuclear \n     infrastructure. Even if you take the first three steps I \n     propose, we no longer have the internal capability to build \n     and operate nuclear plants at the scale needed \n     for significant contribution to the energy future of the \n     country. Without the government immediately commencing the \n     domestic equivalent of the Manhattan Project, we will find \n     ourselves contracting with France, Japan, and probably \n     even Iran to build and staff our new reactors.\n     Darwin, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I support the development and utilization of our natural \n     resources including drilling on the north slope and \n     extracting shale oil in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming. Why \n     would we endanger our sovereignty by relying so heavily on \n     foreign oil anyway? We should be producing our own oil like \n     we did in the 80s when the U.S. reacted to the oil embargo of \n     1973. OPEC realized that we were capable of being self-\n     sufficient so they lowered the price of their oil. The way to \n     contain energy costs is to keep reminding them that if they \n     are going to take advantage of a free world economy then, \n     they will also have to deal with the natural results of \n     competition. Our founding fathers understood the concept--\n     have we forgotten it? I do not support increased taxes for \n     oil companies or the consumer. Let the oil guys make some \n     money and remove the fetters of exploration, refinement, and \n     drilling. Let us take care of America for a change. Every \n     American should be able to afford to drive--it is part of \n     being free.\n     Don.\n                                  ____\n\n       Fewer trips, less fishing, flying when I used to drive--all \n     because the [partisan behavior of politicians]. Most lack \n     plain old `common sense', lack any business or military horse \n     sense. I believe price of fuel will continue upward until we \n     fix [partisan posturing].\n     Bob.\n                                  ____\n\n       I just wanted to take a moment to write to you to let you \n     know how the price of gasoline has affected me and my family \n     and the recent past. I am a student working on my doctorate \n     in Political Science at ISU. This last semester I had to \n     drive down from Rigby to Pocatello five days a week. As you \n     may be aware, that is a one-way distance of about 70 miles. \n     The cost last semester for transportation to and from campus \n     almost broke me. With the prices as they are presently I am \n     lucky that I am only going to have to go to the Pocatello \n     campus one day a week in the fall semester or I would have to \n     drop out because I would not be able to afford the \n     transportation costs simply to get from home to campus and \n     back home again.\n       My wife works for janitorial service and Idaho Falls as a \n     night supervisor, and part of her job requires her to drive \n     from site to site, delivering supplies, checking on the \n     janitors, and making sure that they have done their job. This \n     means that she spends a good part of her job every night in \n     the car, putting miles on driving from spot to spot. Her job \n     does not pay her for mileage nor for gas used, and does not \n     pay enough for her to be able to deduct her mileage off of \n     her taxes. Since her employer cannot afford to give her a \n     raise and we have no way of being able to recoup the \n     increased costs of her doing her job, we have, in effect, had \n     a cut in income from her. I do not know what can be done and \n     I do not know what should be done, but something needs to \n     change because I know in our case we are falling farther and \n     farther behind simply because of the increased price in \n     gasoline.\n       There is no doubt in my mind that we cannot drill our way \n     out of this problem. But there is also no doubt that ignoring \n     the option of drilling will make matters that much worse. I \n     believe we need to have a comprehensive energy policy that \n     includes drilling for more oil resources, increased use of \n     natural gas, a reduction in the policies that prohibit the \n     building of nuclear power facilities, and coal liquefaction \n     programs.\n       Thanks for reading my comments,\n     Jay, Rigby.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/04/senate-section/article/S5063-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5063-S5064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CATHY LEWIS\n\n Mr. BROWN.

The club sponsors social \nevents throughout the year so that classmates with and without \ndisabilities cannot only have fun together, but learn from each other \nas well.\n  Ms. Slein was nominated by St. Joseph Regional Catholic School for \nher work raising money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. She baked \ncookies and cupcakes every night for 2 months and sold them at school \nthe next day, raising a total of $440 for this very worthy \norganization.\n  It is important that we encourage and support the kind of selfless \ncontributions these young people have made. People of all ages need to \nthink more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at \nthe local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and \nneighborhoods. Young volunteers such as Mr. Zaremba and Ms. Slein are \nexamples to all of us, and I commend them for their service.\n  I would also like to congratulate two other young people in my State \nof New Hampshire who were named Distinguished Finalists by the \nPrudential Spirit of Community Awards for their outstanding volunteer \nservice. Rachel Liff of Bedford prepared a handbook for Special \nOlympics athletes and volunteers, and Jane Stark of Merrimack raised \nmoney to purchase water filtration systems for people living in \ndeveloping countries.\n  All these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and \naccomplishment that is encouraging in today's world, and they deserve \nour admiration and respect.

GARRETT\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to John A. \nGarrett, an honorable Alabamian and a good friend of mine. On Sunday, \nMay 10, 2009, John A. will celebrate his 100th birthday.\n  John A. was born in 1909 in Bay Minnette, AL. He graduated from \nAlabama Polytechnic Institute, now known as Auburn University, in 1936, \nthe same year that he married the love of his life, Katherine Virginia \nStowers, at the Snowdoun United Methodist Church in Montgomery. \nTogether, they have two daughters, Kitty Walter Dawson and Mary John, a \nson-in-law Sim Byrd, three grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.\n  Most people in Alabama know John A. for his many contributions to \nAlabama's agriculture industry. During the 1950s, he served as the \nState director of commodity services for the Alabama Farm Bureau. \nLater, he would go on to own and operate Cherokee Builders, an \nindustrial and commercial construction business.\n  In 1969, he was appointed by President Nixon to serve as the director \nof the Alabama Farmer's Home Administration, a position he would hold \nuntil 1977. In the early 1970s, John A. became a nationally recognized \nleader on agricultural and water issues. Later, at the age of 68, John \nA. established the Alabama Rural Water Association, an organization of \nwhich he served as executive director for 17 years.\n  An avid leader, John A. is the recipient of many honors and awards. \nIn 1970, John A. was designated an Honorary State Farmer by the Future \nFarmers of America. Two years later, he relieved the ACTION Federal \nEmployee Distinguished Voluntary Service Award for his extraordinary \nvolunteer service. In 1985, Auburn University honored John A. for his \noutstanding services on the Montgomery County Auburn Committee. He was \nnamed Alabama Arthritis Foundation Humanitarian of the Year in 1989 and \nwas inducted into the Alabama Senior Citizens Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\n[[Page S5065]]\n\n  John A. is also known for his wit and wisdom. In addition to \nauthoring numerous poems, John A. penned the secrets to a wonderful \nlife: a positive attitude and thinking, clean living, and ``Toddy \nTime'' every afternoon. Indeed, Congress should live by his rules.\n  Today, John A. remains very active in his community. He attends the \nmonthly meetings of the Snowdoun community, Snowdoun Volunteer Fire \nDepartment, Montgomery County Alfa, and the Alabama Cattlemen's \nAssociation. John A. can also frequently be found greeting the visitors \nat his gift shop on Mulberry Street or riding on his farm and tending \nto his cattle.\n  On the day of his 100th birthday, John A. will be celebrated by his \nfriends and family, and honored for his dedication and many \ncontributions to Alabama. I wish him much luck in his future endeavors, \nand I ask this entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the \nlife of my good friend John A.

A bill to authorize the regulation of credit default swaps \nand other swap agreements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today, along \nwith Senator Collins, to strengthen the transparency, accountability, \nand stability of a key aspect of our nation's financial system. Right \nnow, trillions of dollars in complex financial transactions known as \nswap agreements are being marketed, traded, and implemented by \nfinancial institutions operating in the U.S. without adequate oversight \nor regulation.\n  Swaps are typically an agreement between two parties placing a bet on \nfuture cash flows. Some swaps bet on whether a stock price, interest \nrate, commodity price, or currency value will rise or fall; others bet \non whether a company will default on payment of a bond. Stock price \nbets are referred to as equity swaps; bets on whether companies will be \nunable to pay their debts are referred to as credit default swaps.\n  As of June 2008, according to data compiled by the Bank of \nInternational Settlements, worldwide swaps markets included credit \ndefault swaps with a total notional value of $57 trillion; commodity \nswaps with a notional value of $13 trillion; equity swaps with a \nnotional value of $10 trillion; foreign currency swaps with a notional \nvalue of $62 trillion; and interest rate swaps with a notional value of \n$458 trillion. These multi-trillion-dollar swap transactions are going \non full bore, without appropriate U.S. disclosure requirements, \nclearing requirements, capital or liquidity safeguards, or other \nmeasures to protect the U.S. financial system against systemic risk.\n  Why? Because current law prohibits key Federal financial regulators--\nincluding the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, and the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission, CFTC--from exercising oversight \nor issuing regulations to ensure the safety and soundness of swap \ntransactions. That prohibition has been in place for nearly 10 years \nnow, since the year 2000; it has never made any sense; it helped cause \nthe financial crisis that is engulfing the American economy; and it \nought to be eliminated immediately.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the Authorizing the Regulation of \nSwaps Act, would do just that. It would immediately repeal the \nstatutory prohibition on the SEC and CFTC from regulating swaps. In \naddition, the bill would give authority to federal financial \nregulators, including bank, securities, and commodities regulators, to \noversee and regulate all types of swap agreements, whether traded on an \nexchange or over-the-counter, including credit default, commodity, \nequity, foreign currency, and interest rate swaps. The bill would \nenable financial regulators, for the first time since 2000, to exercise \noversight of the now largely hidden and unregulated swaps markets.\n  To understand why this legislation is needed and should be enacted \npromptly without waiting for the larger financial reform bill that's \ncoming, I want to review some history. Twelve years ago, in 1997, \nBrooksley Born, then the head of the CFTC, raised a red flag about the \ngrowing use of over-the-counter swaps and other derivatives that were \nbeing traded outside of regulated exchanges and outside of normal \nfederal oversight. She called for a study of those over-the-counter \ntransactions and for comments on whether they should be subject to some \ntype of regulation.\n  Her effort was immediately met with resistance, however, from not \nonly the financial industry that profited from swaps trading, but also \nother Federal regulators then in office. For example, then Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, then Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, \nand then SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt all opposed her effort to even \nexamine over-the-counter swap agreements. The dominant view at the time \nwas that regulation was unnecessary and would only slow down a booming \nmarket.\n  In 1998, at the urging of then Chairman Greenspan, Secretary Rubin, \nChairman Levitt, and others, Congress enacted legislation which \nactually barred the CFTC from conducting the study that Chairman Born \nwanted and from developing any regulatory alternatives for over-the-\ncounter swaps.\n  In 2000, Congress went farther. In late December, during the final \ndays of the 106th Congress, legislation affecting a range of financial \nissues was slipped without notice into a conference report of an \nomnibus appropriations bill. That legislation, called the Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act, included provisions which together created a \nflat out prohibition on the regulation of every kind of swap the \nauthors could\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\nthink of, including credit default, commodity, equity, foreign \ncurrency, interest rate, and even weather swaps. That type of sweeping \nstatutory prohibition had never been included in any bill voted on by \nthe Senate before being inserted into a must-pass appropriations bill \nin December 2000. That omnibus appropriations bill was approved by the \nSenate on a voice vote.\n  Today we are living with the disastrous consequences of that ill-\nconceived prohibition on the regulation of swaps.\n  One example says it all: AIG. AIG is a financial holding company \nthat, all by itself, has cost taxpayers more than $150 billion so far. \nOver a period of years, AIG had issued more than $400 billion in credit \ndefault swaps without setting aside sufficient capital or liquidity \nreserves. After its swaps began losing value, AIG's counterparties \nrequired AIG to post multi-billion-dollar collateral to secure payment \non those swaps, and a credit rating downgrade threatened to increase \nits collateral calls, AIG came pleading for a taxpayer bailout. The \n$150 billion in taxpayer dollars was needed not only to keep AIG \nafloat, but also to bail out a dozen other large financial institutions \nthat had purchased credit protection from AIG, including Goldman Sachs, \nMerrill Lynch, and Bank of America.\n  Apparently, none of those credit default swap exposures had been \nknown to Federal regulators until AIG informed the Federal Reserve on a \nFriday that it was likely to go out of business the following week \nunless provided billions in taxpayer support. When regulators \nunderstood how far in the hole AIG had fallen and how many financial \ninstitutions would be affected by its financial collapse, they \ndetermined that they had no choice but to prop up the whole mess with \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  AIG is not the only financial institution with risky credit default \nswaps. But even if federal regulators know of other high-risk problems, \nthe law has tied their hands in terms of what steps can be taken in \nresponse. Even measures that most experts believe would reduce systemic \nrisks, such as requiring companies to use credit default swap \nclearinghouses or requiring traders to disclose all credit default swap \ntransactions, cannot be fully implemented, because Federal agencies \nlack the authority to regulate swaps.\n  Seven months ago, during a Senate hearing in September 2008, \nChristopher Cox, then chairman of the SEC, testified that the credit \ndefault swap market was ``completely lacking in transparency'' and \n``ripe for fraud and manipulation.'' A few days later he called on \nCongress to take ``swift action'' to give regulators the authority to \noversee credit default swaps. But the statutory barriers prohibiting \nswaps regulation have remained in place.\n  Giving the regulators what they have asked for is long overdue. It \ndoes not make sense for Federal regulators to be statutorily barred \nfrom requiring disclosure of swap transactions, mandating use of \nclearinghouses, or imposing other safeguards particularly in light of \nthe size of the swaps market with trillions of dollars in credit \ndefault swap, interest rate, commodity, equity, foreign currency, and \nother swaps.\n  Even some past opponents of swaps regulation have rethought their \nopposition.\n  Alan Greenspan acknowledged last October that there are ``serious \nproblems'' associated with credit default swaps.\n  Robert Rubin recently acknowledged that derivatives, which include \nswaps, ``create systemic risk.''\n  Arthur Levitt said it was a mistake not to have regulated swap \nagreements.\n  Top financial officials in the Obama Administration, including \nTreasury Secretary Tim Geithner, National Economic Council Chairman \nLarry Summers, SEC Chair Mary Schapiro, and CFTC nominee Gary Gensler \nhave all called publicly for stronger regulation of over-the-counter \ntransactions, including swap agreements.\n  Congress and the Administration are now engaged in an effort to enact \ncomprehensive financial reforms to safeguard our economy. While some of \nthose reforms require a lot of time and deliberation to get right, \nothers can--and should--be implemented more quickly. Removing the \nprohibition on regulating swaps is one of those reforms that can and \nshould be done now, so our regulators can begin, without the hindrance \nof ill-conceived statutory barriers, to design a sensible regulatory \nframework for swaps.\n  Here is what my bill would do. First, it would repeal about a dozen \nprovisions in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act and other laws \nthat prevent federal financial regulators from overseeing and \nregulating swap agreements. Second, it would give Federal financial \nregulators, including bank, securities, and commodity regulators, \nimmediate authority to oversee and regulate swaps involving the \nfinancial institutions and exchanges that they already regulate. To \nensure regulators have sufficient authority, the bill would use the \nsame comprehensive definition of swap agreement that is used in current \nlaw to prohibit swaps regulation.\n  These measures would give regulators immediate authority to acquire \nswap-related data. That would allow them to evaluate swap risks at \nspecific companies as well as across the financial system. Regulators \ncould then use this data to look into what additional safeguards are \nneeded and what abuses need to be stopped.\n  One thing the bill would not do is require federal financial \nregulators to regulate swaps or tell them how to regulate swaps if they \ndecide to do so. That is left for the larger regulatory reform bill \ncoming later this year. The only instruction provided in this bill is \nthat, if any regulator decides to act, it must consult, work, and \ncooperate with all of the other federal financial regulators to ensure \nswaps are treated in a consistent way.\n  I see this bill as a necessary first step to eliminate harmful \nstatutory barriers that tie regulators' hands, impede oversight of the \nmulti-trillion-dollar swaps markets, and create systemic risk. The bill \ndoes not take the needed second step of laying out ways to regulate \nswaps. It does not, for example, specify swaps recordkeeping, \ndisclosure requirements, clearing requirements, capital or liquidity \nsafeguards, or other measures. Senator Collins has another bill that, \nin part, addresses credit default swaps clearinghouses; I have a \nseparate bill that specifies safeguards in the area of commodity swaps. \nOther colleagues have introduced bills that address a variety of swaps \nissues. The legislation we are introducing today does not contradict or \npreclude any of those other approaches it is an interim measure that \nwould clear the way for more specific swaps requirements in subsequent \nreform legislation.\n  The Levin-Collins bill offers a limited, commonsense way to restore \nimmediate federal authority over a high-risk, high-dollar financial \nsector that has operated for too long in the shadows, and whose failure \nhas cost us hundreds of billions of dollars so far. Due to the \ntrillions of dollars and financial risk involved, I urge the Senate to \nact on this bill as soon as possible.\n  I would also like to take a moment to extend my thanks and \nappreciation to the SEC, CFTC, and Treasury officials who took the time \nto provide technical assistance in drafting this legislation. I hope \nthose agencies, and the Obama Administration as a whole, will announce \ntheir support for the bill and work for its enactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Summary of Levin-Collins Authorizing the Regulation of Swaps Act\n\n       The Authorizing the Regulation of Swaps Act, introduced by \n     Senator Carl Levin, D-Mich., and cosponsored by Senator Susan \n     Collins, R-Maine, is intended to give federal financial \n     regulators immediate authority over swap agreements in light \n     of the fact that trillions of dollars in swap transactions \n     continue to be marketed, traded, and implemented in the \n     United States without adequate federal oversight or \n     regulatory authority. Hundreds of billions of taxpayer \n     dollars have already been expended to overcome the failures \n     of firms that engaged in unregulated swaps. The bill contains \n     the following provisions.\n       Repeal Existing Prohibitions on Regulating Swaps. The bill \n     would repeal over a dozen provisions in existing law, \n     including in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, \n     which prohibit federal financial regulators from regulating \n     swap agreements.\n       Authorize the Regulation of Swaps. The bill would give \n     authority to federal financial\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\n     regulators, including bank, securities and commodities \n     regulators, to oversee and regulate all types of swap \n     agreements, including credit default, commodity, equity, \n     interest rate, and foreign currency swaps. The bill uses the \n     same definition of swap agreement that is used in current law \n     to prohibit swaps regulation, and would authorize federal \n     oversight and regulation of all exchange-traded and over-the-\n     counter swaps.\n       Require Consistent Treatment of Swaps. The bill does not \n     require federal regulators to regulate swap agreements--it \n     merely authorizes such regulation and removes barriers that \n     have prevented this regulation since 2000. Nor does the bill \n     provide any direction to federal financial regulators on how \n     to regulate swaps other than to require them to consult, \n     work, and cooperate with each other to promote consistency in \n     the treatment of swap agreements.\n       Establish Interim Authority. By removing existing statutory \n     prohibitions and providing federal financial regulators with \n     authority to oversee and regulate swaps, the bill would \n     eliminate harmful statutory barriers, give regulators \n     immediate interim authority over multi-trillion-dollar swaps \n     markets, and clear the way for more specific swaps \n     requirements in subsequent comprehensive financial reform \n     legislation later this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 962. A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2009 \nthrough 2013 to promote an enhanced strategic partnership with Pakistan \nand its people, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, the \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, in \nintroducing what we consider to be an important piece of legislation \nfrom our committee and an important initiative for the administration \nand for the Congress and the American people. We are joining today to \nintroduce the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act. I believe the \nlegislation has already been placed at the desk.\n  This is legislation that will fundamentally change America's policy \ntoward Pakistan, and I hope over time it will fundamentally change \nAmerica's relationship with the people of Pakistan as well.\n  I especially thank Senator Lugar for his partnership in crafting this \nlegislation and for his ongoing leadership on this issue.\n  It is hard to overstate the importance of Pakistan to our national \nsecurity. In fact, every day the newspapers are full of events that are \ntranspiring there and of the challenges we face. Pakistan is a nation \nwhich could either serve as a force for stability and progress in a \nvolatile region or it could become an epicenter for radicalism and \nviolence on a cataclysmic scale.\n  This is a nation of striking contradictions and on divergent paths \nforward.\n  On one hand, we all know Pakistan is a nation where Osama bin Laden \nand the leadership of al-Qaida have found sanctuary for the past 7 \nyears--a haven from which they and their confederates have plotted and \ncarried out attacks on their host country, on neighboring countries, \nand on sites around the globe--a nation that has in recent weeks seen \nthe Taliban advance to within 60 miles of its capital, and a nation \nwith a full arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable \nof delivering them anywhere in a 1,000-kilometer range.\n  On the other hand, Pakistan is also a nation whose 170 million people \nare overwhelmingly moderate, overwhelmingly committed to democracy and \nrule of law; a major non-NATO ally that has sacrificed the lives of \n1,500 of its soldiers and police in the fight against terrorism and \ninsurgency; and a nation that has lost more of its citizens to the \nscourge of terrorism than all but a tiny handful of countries \nthroughout the world.\n  In short, Pakistan has the potential either to be crippled by the \nTaliban or to serve as a bulwark against everything the Taliban \nrepresents. That is why the Obama administration and many of us in \nCongress see the need for a bold new strategy for Pakistan. The status \nquo has not brought success, the stakes could not be higher, and we \nhave little choice but to think differently--in fact, to think bigger--\nabout what these challenges are. The Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan \nAct is the centerpiece of this new approach, which is why President \nObama has called on Congress to pass it.\n\n  An earlier version of this bill was reported out of the Foreign \nRelations Committee in July with overwhelming bipartisan support. This \nversion builds upon its predecessor in a number of important ways. \nFirst, this new legislation directs $100 million toward an urgent need: \npolice reform and equipping. Second, it mandates strict accountability \nfrom the administration as to every dollar that is spent, using \nbenchmarks and metrics to measure and adapt our performance. Third, in \nlight of the acute security challenge on the ground today, this bill \ngives our Ambassador the flexibility needed to respond to events as \nthey unfold.\n  We believe this bill is urgently needed. For decades, the United \nStates has sought the cooperation of Pakistani decisionmakers through \nmilitary aid--almost exclusively military aid--while paying scant \nattention to the wishes and urgent needs of the population itself. This \narrangement is, frankly, rapidly disintegrating. We believe we are \npaying too much for one thing and getting too little for a broad number \nof things we really need. When I say ``we,'' I really emphasize the \nPakistani people's needs. The desires and aspirations of the Pakistani \npeople have never been adequately focused on or attended to \nsufficiently in these policies. Most Pakistanis understand that they \nhave been, frankly, left out of the policy in broad terms. As a result, \nan alarming percentage of the Pakistani population now sees America as \na greater threat than al-Qaida. Until we change that perception, there \nis, frankly, very little chance of ending tolerance for terrorist \ngroups or persuading any Pakistani Government to devote the political \ncapital necessary to deny such groups and to deny them the sanctuary \nthey have been able to receive, particularly in the western part of the \ncountry, as well as to deny them the covert material support which they \nhave also been able to get from a number of different sources.\n  The dangers of inaction are rising almost every day. So when people \nmeasure this legislation, that is really what they have to consider. \nWhat happens if you do nothing? Well, if you do nothing, it is clear \nthat the march of terror that is taking hold in a number of different \nplaces clearly threatens nuclear weapons that might then potentially \nfall into hands that are completely unpredictable. In fact, to whatever \ndegree they might be predictable, one can only see danger in that kind \nof eventuality. The dangers of inaction are real. Almost any scenario \nplayed out plays against the broader interests of the Pakistani people \nand of the democratic Government which struggles today to provide \nservices and to govern them.\n  In the month since President Obama called on Congress to pass the \nbill we are now introducing, the situation on the ground in Pakistan \nhas deteriorated significantly. The Government struck what many of us \nbelieved and said at the time was an ill-advised deal that effectively \nsurrendered the Swat Valley to the Taliban. The deal, predictably--as \nmany of us said--emboldened the Taliban to deploy the same brutal \ntactics they had used in both Pakistan and Afghanistan and to use their \nbase in Swat to then extend their reach ever closer to the country's \nheartland.\n  I emphasize--I know Senator Lugar will join me in emphasizing this--\nultimately, it is not the United States or the policy of the United \nStates that is going to decide what happens in Pakistan. Ultimately, it \nwill be Pakistanis, not Americans, who must determine their nation's \nfuture. But we can change the nature of our relationship and we can \nempower those Pakistanis who are fighting to steer the world's second \nlargest Muslim country onto a path of moderation and stability and \nregional cooperation. That is the foundation of the bill Senator Lugar \nand I are introducing.\n  Frankly, I have seen firsthand how this approach works. Following the \n2005 Kashmir earthquake, the United States spent nearly $1 billion on \nrelief efforts. Having visited places, as I did then, such as Mansehra \nand Muzaffarabad in the earthquake's aftermath, I can personally attest \nto the awesome power of the operation we launched. I will never forget \nflying up in a helicopter to the northwest part of Pakistan, not far \nfrom the big Himalayas, where one could see off in the distance, and \nlanding in a small spot by the river and meeting kids in a\n\n[[Page S5070]]\n\ntent city because this was the first time those kids had ever come out \nof the mountains and, in fact, the first time any of those kids had \never gone to school. It was extraordinary to see the sight of American \nservice men and women saving the lives of Pakistani citizens. Frankly, \nit was invaluable in changing the perceptions of America in Pakistan. \nAt that period of time, while we provided that assistance and while we \nwere visibly involved in saving lives, not in taking them, the fact is \nthat the reputation of the United States in the country as it was \nmeasured by polls at the time markedly increased, very dramatically \nincreased.\n  In the wake of that natural disaster, we weren't the only ones to \nrecognize the need for public diplomacy based in deeds rather than in \nwords. The front group for the terrorist organization Lashkar-e Taiba \nset up a string of professional relief camps throughout the region \ntrying to mimic what we were doing. But our effort was far more \neffective, and the permanent gift of the U.S. Army's last mobile Army \nsurgical hospital, or MASH, had a profound impact on the perceptions of \npeople in the region. For a brief period, America was going toe-to-toe \nwith extremists in a true battle of hearts and minds, and we were \nwinning.\n  It is up to us to recreate this kind of success on a broader scale, \nwithout waiting for a natural or even a manmade disaster. The question \nis, How can we most effectively demonstrate the true friendship of the \nAmerican people for the Pakistani people?\n  We believe this bill is an important first step. It is a prime \nexample of what we call ``smart power'' because it uses both economic \nand military aid to achieve an overall effect that is greater than the \nsum of its parts. On the economic side, this bill triples nonmilitary \naid to $1.5 billion annually for 5 years and urges an additional 5 \nyears of funding. These funds will be used to build schools, roads, and \nclinics. In other words, they aim to do on a regular basis what we \nbriefly achieved with our earthquake relief and what the Pakistani \nGovernment, because of the economic crisis as well as political crisis \nin the country, has been unable to do to date. But this money will do a \ngreat deal more than just good deeds. It will empower the fledgling \ncivilian Government to show that it can deliver the citizens of \nPakistan a better life. It will empower the moderates, who will have \nsomething concrete to put forward as evidence that friendship with \nAmerica actually brings rewards, not just perils, and it will empower \nthe vast majority of Pakistanis who reject the terrifying vision of al-\nQaida and Taliban but who have been angered and frustrated by the \nperception that their own leaders and America's leaders don't care \nabout their daily struggle.\n  To do this right, we must make a long-term commitment. Most \nPakistanis think that America has used and abandoned their country in \nthe past, most notably after the jihad against the Soviets in \nAfghanistan. They fear we will just desert them again the moment the \nthreat from al-Qaida subsides. It is this history and this fear that \ncause Pakistan to hedge its bets.\n  If we ever expect Pakistan to break decisively with the Taliban and \nother extremist groups, then we need to provide firm assurance that we \nare not just foul-weather friends. By authorizing funds through 2013, \nand hopefully longer, this bill offers the chance to clearly state \nAmerica's longer term concerns and interests.\n  On the security side, the bill places conditions on military aid that \nwill ensure the money is used for the intended purposes, which was not \nthe case over the last 8 years. In order for Pakistan to receive any \nmilitary assistance, it will need to meet an annual certification that \nits army and spy services are genuine partners in this endeavor.\n\n  In the struggle against al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, \nincluding Lashkar-e Taiba--as we all know, Lashkar-e Taiba was the \nperpetrator of the Mumbai massacre of last November. We also will need \na certification of their partnership in the battle against the Taliban \nand its affiliates who threaten our troops in Afghanistan from their \nsanctuaries in the Pakistani tribal areas, as well as in the effort to \nsolidify democratic governance and the rule of law in Pakistan. We \nbelieve these conditions are eminently reasonable, and they should be \neasy to meet for any nation receiving American aid.\n  As important as the economic and military components of the bill are \nis the question of how they fit together. Making this unequivocal \ncommitment to the Pakistani people enables us to calibrate our military \nassistance more effectively. In any given year, we may choose to \nincrease it or decrease it or to simply leave its level unchanged, but \nwe will have the flexibility which we haven't had in prior years. For \ntoo long, the Pakistani military frankly believed we were bluffing when \nwe threatened to cut funding for a particular weapons system or an \nexpensive piece of hardware because that was the only game, if you \nwill. It was the only money on the table. This bill will change that. \nUp to now, frankly, they were right about the unwillingness of the \nUnited States to take alternative routes. But if our economic aid \nbecomes the centerpiece of our aid policy and it is tripled to $1.5 \nbillion, then we can actually guarantee that we pay more attention to \nhow the military assistance is being spent and what is occurring. We \nwill finally be able to make the choice of expenditure on the basis of \nboth of our natural security interests rather than simply the \ninstitutional interests of the security forces in Pakistan.\n  Let me be clear on the issue of military aid. The bill does not take \nany position on the level of such assistance deliberately. It is \npossible to envision a significant increase in military aid, just as \neasily as one could envision a decrease. The Pakistani army needs more \nhelicopters. It needs more night-vision capability, more training and \ncounterinsurgency techniques. So instead of locking in a figure for \nfuture years, what this bill does is provide us the ability to target \nour military aid directly to the areas that best serve both of our \nnational security interests, which are fighting terrorism, fighting the \ninsurgency, and keeping the people of Pakistan safe from the most dire \nthreats.\n  Moreover, this bill allows us to fine-tune our approach in response \nto the level of will and competence displayed by Pakistan's military: \nWhen we see the genuine commitment, then we can help increase \ncapabilities, and if we see at any time that commitment is lacking, we \nhave the ability to adjust and redirect assistance rather than permit \nit to be wasted. We have spent some $10 billion in military aid and \ncompensation over the past 8 years. Still, the militants got within 60 \nmiles of the capital recently and al-Qaida continues to enjoy a \nsanctuary. So it is long past time we figure out how to work more \neffectively with the Pakistanis and the Pakistan Government on a more \neffective approach. That is what we hope this achieves.\n  This bill is not a short-term fix. It aims for the medium term and \nespecially the long term. It won't drive the Taliban out of Swat Valley \nnext week or next month. Its aim is, once the Taliban is driven from \nSwat and from Bajaur and from Dir, to help keep them out. To put it in \nterms of basic counterinsurgency doctrine made familiar by General \nPetraeus, the Pakistani military is already able to handle the \n``clear'' phase of the struggle. The United States will now be \nassisting this mission through other vehicles. But the bill Senator \nLugar and I are introducing will provide vital help for the ``hold'' \nand the ``build'' parts of the mission. Nor is this bill intended to be \na silver bullet. It provides powerful tools, but these tools are only \nas effective as the policymakers who wield them. I am confident \nPresident Obama and his team will use wisely whatever policy tools are \nat their disposal.\n  We need to approach this endeavor with a large dose of humility. The \ntruth is that our leverage is limited.\n  This bill aims to increase that leverage significantly. But we need \nto be realistic about what we can accomplish. Americans can influence \nevents in Pakistan, but we cannot and we should not decide them. \nUltimately, the decisionmakers are the people and the leaders of \nPakistan.\n  Ask any resident of Lahore, Karachi, or Peshawar what these places \nused to be like and you will hear a long statement of the reveries of \nthe time that now seems a world away. We need to help Pakistan once \nagain become a nation of stability, security, and prosperity, enjoying \npeace at home and abroad--a nation, in short, that older\n\n[[Page S5071]]\n\nPakistanis remember from their childhoods.\n  It is this nation that most Pakistanis desperately wish to reclaim. \nThe bill that Senator Lugar and I now introduce will help America \nensure that Pakistanis have the resources necessary to choose a \npeaceful, stable future. It offers them a helping hand in getting \nthere. I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to join our \nchairman, John Kerry, in introducing the Enhanced Partnership with \nPakistan Act of 2009. Then-Senator Joe Biden and I originally \nintroduced this legislation in July 2008. I have been especially \npleased to continue the bipartisan effort on this bill with Senator \nKerry.\n  Senators Biden and Kerry and I have worked closely over the past year \nwith the State Department, USAID, the Defense Department, and the \nNational Security Council to craft this legislation.\n  On March 27 of this year, President Obama announced a comprehensive \nstrategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. In his speech he called on \nCongress ``to pass a bipartisan bill cosponsored by John Kerry and \nRichard Lugar that authorizes $1.5 billion in direct support to the \nPakistani people every year over the next 5 years--resources that will \nbuild schools, roads, and hospitals, and strengthen Pakistan's \ndemocracy.''\n  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ADM Mike Mullen and CENTCOM \nCommander David Petraeus repeatedly advocated expanding foreign \nassistance to Pakistan as an essential element of our national \nsecurity. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton both have testified that strengthening democracy and countering \nterrorism in Pakistan go hand in hand. Secretary Clinton said at a \nSenate Appropriations Committee meeting last week:\n\n       As President Obama has consistently maintained, success in \n     Afghanistan depends on success in Pakistan. We have seen how \n     difficult it is for the government there to make progress, \n     and the Taliban continues to make inroads. Counterinsurgency \n     training is critical. But of equal importance are diplomacy \n     and development to provide economic stability and diminish \n     the conditions that feed extremism. This is the intent of the \n     comprehensive strategy laid out by Senator Kerry and Senator \n     Lugar, which President Obama has endorsed.\n\n  I take the time to detail administration backing for this bill and \nits concepts because any U.S. policy related to Pakistan will require \nthe cooperation and active support of both the executive and \nlegislative branches of our Government. It also will require that \npolicy toward Pakistan be closely integrated with United States efforts \nthroughout the region.\n  I do not regard the Kerry-Lugar bill as a congressionally driven \ninitiative in which we are bargaining for support of the \nadministration; rather, Senator Kerry and I are trying to play a \nconstructive role in facilitating a consensus position between branches \nthat will undergird a rational approach to the region with the best \nchance of success. With this in mind, it is vital that the \nadministration's message on Pakistan be clear and consistent. The \nadministration also must continue to actively consult with Congress on \nelements of strategy, not just lobby us for funds.\n  The United States has an intense strategic interest in Pakistan and \nthe surrounding region. The U.S. National Intelligence Estimate last \nyear painted a bleak picture of the converging crises in Pakistan. A \ngrowing al-Qaida sanctuary, an expanding Taliban insurgency, political \nbrinksmanship, and a failing economy are intensifying the turmoil and \nviolence in that country. These circumstances are a threat to Pakistan, \nthe region, and the United States of America.\n  We should make clear to the people of Pakistan that our interests are \nfocused on democracy, pluralism, stability, and the fight against \nterrorism. These are values supported by a large majority of Pakistani \npeople. If Pakistan is to break its debilitating cycle of instability, \nit will need to achieve progress on fighting corruption, delivering \ngovernment services, and promoting broad-based economic growth. The \ninternational community and the United States should support reforms \nthat contribute to the strengthening of Pakistani civilian \ninstitutions.\n  This legislation marks an important step toward those goals. While \nour bill envisions sustained economic and political cooperation with \nPakistan, it is not a blank check. It expects that the military \ninstitutions in Pakistan will turn their attention to the extremist \ndangers within Pakistan's borders. The bill subjects our security \nassistance to a certification that the Pakistani Government is using \nthe money for its intended purpose--namely, to combat the Taliban and \nal-Qaida. The bill also calls for tangible progress in governance, \nincluding an independent judiciary, greater accountability by the \ncentral government, respect for human rights, and civilian control of \nthe levers of power, including the military and the intelligence \nagencies.\n  In providing substantial resources to enhance a strategic partnership \nwith Pakistan, our bill contains provisions to help ensure that this \nmoney is spent effectively and efficiently. The bill stipulates that \nthe administration must provide Congress with a comprehensive \nassistance strategy before additional assistance is made available. \nThis strategy is expected to detail clear objectives, enumerate \nprojects the administration intends to implement, and identify criteria \nthat the administration will use to measure the effectiveness of our \nassistance.\n  Once money begins to flow, the administration must report every 6 \nmonths on how the money is spent and what impact it is having. In \naddition, the bill provides that before the administration spends more \nthan half of the $1.5 billion authorized in any fiscal year, it must \ncertify that the assistance provided to that date is making substantial \nprogress toward the principal objectives contained in the \nadministration's strategy report. We also have asked the Government \nAccountability Office to review annually the administration's progress \non stated goals. To ensure that sufficient resources will be available \nto oversee our program in Pakistan, we authorize $20 million each year \nfor audits and program reviews by the inspectors general of the State \nDepartment, USAID, and other relevant agencies.\n  I look forward to working with the administration of President Obama \nand with congressional colleagues on a policy toward Pakistan that \nbuilds our relationship with that nation and protects vital interests \nof the United States.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kerry for his partnership and leadership on \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Udall of New Mexico):\n  S. 965. A bill to approve the Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights \nSettlement Agreement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today Senator Udall and I are \nintroducing a bill that will end an ongoing water rights dispute in \nnorthern New Mexico. The bill accomplishes this by authorizing a water \nrights settlement resolving Taos Pueblo's water rights claims in the \nRio Pueblo de Taos, a tributary to the Rio Grande.\n  The Rio Pueblo de Taos adjudication is a dispute that is almost 40 \nyears old. The parties have been in settlement discussions for well \nover a decade but it was not until the last 5 years that the \ndiscussions took on the sense of urgency needed to resolve the issues \nat hand. A settlement agreement was signed by the Pueblo, State, and \nother interested parties in March 2006. Federal legislation was then \nfinalized and introduced last year. Progress was made on the bill, \nincluding hearings in both the House and Senate which resulted in the \nidentification of a few more issues which needed to be addressed. The \nparties negotiated a resolution to these issues and legislation to \nauthorize and implement the settlement is now ready to move forward.\n  The settlement will fulfill the rights of the Pueblo consistent with \nthe Federal trust responsibility. It will also continue the tradition \nof sharing precious water resources in a manner necessary to protect \nthe sustainability of traditional agricultural communities. Finally, \nthe Town of Taos and other local entities are assured of accessing the \nwater necessary to meet municipal and domestic needs. In sum, the Taos \nPueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act represents a commonsense\n\n[[Page S5072]]\n\nset of solutions that all parties to the adjudication have a stake in \nimplementing.\n  This legislation is widely supported in the Taos Valley, probably as \nclose to a consensus as any water-related agreement can get in the \nWest. The State of New Mexico, under Governor Richardson's leadership, \ndeserves recognition for actively pursuing a settlement in this matter \nand committing financial resources in recognition of the importance of \nthis matter to all water users in the basin.\n  This bill, as with any water rights settlement, is crucial to New \nMexico's future. In an arid State such as ours, the legal system is \npoorly equipped to allocate water and create the infrastructure needed \nfor its efficient use. Negotiated agreements between the parties, the \nState Engineer, and the Federal Government are much more likely to lead \nto long-term solutions that allow for the use of water in a sustainable \nmanner. This legislation builds upon the provisions included in the \nNavajo water rights settlement enacted into law on March 30, 2009 as \npart of the Omnibus Public Lands bill. That settlement, and each \nsubsequent one, will help provide more certainty and less conflict with \nrespect to the allocation and use of water in New Mexico. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, as well as the \nHouse of Representatives, to see that this bill gets enacted into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 965\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join Senator Bingaman \nin introducing a bill to complete the Abeyta water settlement in \nnorthern New Mexico. Introduction of this bill represents a major \nmilestone in the resolution of Taos Pueblo's water rights claims in the \nRio Pueblo de Taos. Years of work and negotiation have gone into the \nsettlement, and I am pleased that the tribes, village, city, county, \nacequias, and community groups involved were able to come to an \nagreement that is mutually beneficial to all the users of this \ntributary to the Rio Grande.\n  New Mexico is a State rich with tradition and culture, where the \nwater resources are scarce and precious. As is common in most of the \narid West, this vital but limited commodity can foster conflict between \ncommunities and individuals, and in a State where the history is long \nand complex, disputes over water are uniquely complicated. But, despite \nthe complications surrounding water tenure, New Mexicans are united in \na common respect for this resource. From the pueblos and tribes of New \nMexico, to the historic acequias and growing communities, water is \nfundamental to both survival and cultural traditions, and is respected \nas such. The Abeyta settlement is an example of communities and the \ntribe coming together to resolve their differences and find a way to \nensure that everyone has access to this precious and respected \nresource.\n  The Abeyta settlement establishes the water claims of the Pueblo of \nTaos, the Taos Valley Acequia Association, the Village of El Prado, and \nthe Town of Taos. These communities depend heavily on agriculture and \nirrigation for both traditional practices and subsistence. The \nsettlement ensures water for both agricultural and domestic use, and \nfacilitates the rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure. \nAdditionally, the settlement helps to protect the quality of water in \nthe watershed by protecting and recharging the wetlands areas of the \nTaos Pueblo's buffalo pasture. After years of negotiation, the parties \ninvolved in this important settlement have come to an agreement based \non respect for cultural practices and a commitment to live as good \nneighbors sharing a common resource. I invite my colleagues to take \nnote of the unprecedented level of cooperation, negotiation, and mutual \nsupport manifest in this settlement.\n  It has been said that the wars of the future will be fought over \naccess to water. In New Mexico, we are setting a different precedent--a \nprecedent of respect and compromise. One that will help us move into \nthe future with well-established partnerships and a commitment to \nconserve and manage this vital resource to the benefit of all. I am \nhonored to join Senator Bingaman today in introducing this legislation \nthat will bring the Pueblo of Taos and the surrounding community one \nstep closer to establishing a secure water future.\n\n[[Page S5076]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Rockefeller (for himself and Mr. \n        Whitehouse)):\n  S. 966. A bill to improve the Federal infrastructure for health care \nquality improvement in the United States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, \nSenator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, to introduce the National Health \nCare Quality Act, legislation that makes health care quality a national \npriority. We have before us an overwhelming opportunity to make \nsweeping changes to our health care system. The dramatic change we need \nto improve America's health care delivery system requires a solid \ncoordinated infrastructure to guide quality improvement; however this \ninfrastructure does not exist today. The lack of a coordinated effort \nto improve health care quality has hindered our nation's ability to \nimprove patient health outcomes and reduce inefficiencies in our health \ncare system. In order to achieve our goals for true delivery system \nreform, health care quality must be elevated as a national priority.\n  As the cost of health care in America continues to increase, the \nquality of care Americans receive continues to decrease. The average \ncost of health insurance premiums has doubled in the last nine years, \nfrom $5791 in 1999 to $12,680 in 2008. However, less than half of \nadults receive recommended care. More is spent per person on health \ncare in the United States than in any other nation in the world, and \nyet America has some of the worst health outcomes. Wide-spread \ninefficiencies plague our health care system. The Congressional Budget \nOffice, CBO, estimates that 30 percent of annual health care spending, \nor as much as $700 billion, could be eliminated with little to no \nimpact on the system. Additionally, the Commonwealth Fund estimates \nthat more than 100,000 American lives could be saved annually by \nimproving health care quality to the level of performance achieved in \nother nations.\n  Several entities contribute to health care quality improvement in the \nU.S., including numerous federal departments, several key Federal \nagencies within those departments, and additional private-sector \npartners. While there has been some progress to coordinate efforts \namong these entities and create a framework for navigating quality \nimprovement efforts, there is no defined structure in place to guide \nthe process of quality improvement, prioritize limited resources, and \nprovide oversight to ensure these efforts reflect the best interests of \nall patients. Therefore, legislation is needed to modernize our health \ncare structure to create better coordination of quality efforts, and \nmake certain the decisions about reimbursement and coverage will allow \nthe government to effectively deliver care that is of the highest \nquality.\n  The National Health Care Quality Act would create a sensible \ninfrastructure for health care quality improvement by creating an \naccountable entity--a new Office of National Health Care Quality \nImprovement within the Executive Office of the President--to set health \ncare quality priorities for the nation. This office will be led by a \nnew Director of National Health Care Quality, who will work with public \nand private stakeholders to establish and routinely update health care \nquality priorities for the nation based on a number of mandatory \nconsiderations, including the needs of children and the void in \npediatric quality measures.\n  This legislation also puts forth a construct to coordinate health \ncare quality improvement efforts across all federal agencies involved \nin purchasing, providing, studying, or regulating health care services. \nThe bill statutorily re-establishes the Quality Interagency \nCoordinating Council, QuICC, first created during the Clinton \nadministration, within the Office of National Health Care Quality \nImprovement. The purpose of the Quality Interagency Coordinating \nCouncil is to coordinate health care quality improvement efforts across \nall relevant Federal departments and agencies involved in health care \nservices. It also provides a framework for the development and \nimplementation of Department- and agency-specific quality improvement \nstrategies.\n  Lastly, the legislation enhances health care quality improvement \nefforts within the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, by \nexpanding the authority of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality and elevating the role of the Director of AHRQ to a Senate-\nappointed position. By building on and improving the public-private \nprocess for health care quality measure development, AHRQ can also help \nto streamline the implementation of quality improvement measures within \nfederal health programs under the jurisdiction of HHS. AHRQ will \nestablish a standardized method for reporting quality measures and data \nto all federal health programs. Lastly, AHRQ would be required to \ndevelop and launch a public education campaign, aimed at both providers \nand consumers of health care, about health care quality improvement.\n  It is my belief that the multi-pronged approach provided in the \nNational Health Care Quality Act will lead to vast improvements in the \ncoordination of quality efforts and, most importantly, patient health \noutcomes. Given the current problems in the health care system, \nCongress has a responsibility to the American people to guarantee \nindividuals have access to high quality, safe and effective care, and I \nurge my colleagues to join us in support of this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 966\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \ncreate a petroleum product reserve, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce The Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve Modernization Act of 2009. This bill will ensure that \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve will continue to fulfill the goal that \nits creators envisioned for it in 1975, which is to protect Americans \nfrom the economic consequences of oil supply disruptions.\n  This bill includes two key provisions. First, it creates a refined \npetroleum product component within the existing SPR. The Department of \nEnergy is required to hold at least 30 million barrels of the total 1 \nbillion barrel SPR inventory in refined petroleum products, such as \ngasoline and diesel fuel.\n\n[[Page S5081]]\n\n  In the 1970s, the U.S. was vulnerable to supply disruptions in crude \noil, as it was a significant and growing importer of crude oil. In \n1973, major oil exporting nations embargoed oil exports to the United \nStates in retaliation for U.S. support for Israel during that year's \nArab-Israeli War. The embargo and resulting oil price spikes wreaked \nhavoc on the U.S. economy. Preventing a recurrence of this kind of \ngeopolitical oil supply disruption was the primary goal of the SPR. \nBecause the country then held significant surplus refinery capacity, \nSPR managers decided to hold only crude oil in the SPR.\n  In 2009, our domestic oil market has changed. While we are more \ndependent on imported crude oil than ever before, we also import more \nrefined petroleum products and have considerably less spare refinery \ncapacity. When U.S. refinery operations are disrupted, we require \nimported products from other countries to fill the gap.\n  We have also learned in the last 34 years that weather-related events \nare the most frequent source of oil supply disruptions. In history, the \nSPR has been used in connection with only on geopolitical event, during \nthe 1990-1991 Iraqi invasion of and removal from Kuwait, while it has \nbeen used several times in response to hurricanes or other weather \nevents, such as dense fog halting tanker traffic in the Houston Ship \nChannel.\n  These more frequent weather events are usually as disruptive, if not \nmore disruptive, to U.S. refinery operations as to crude oil production \nand imports. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in September 2008 took much of \nthe U.S. Gulf Coast infrastructure offline, and shortages of gasoline \nand diesel were experienced throughout the Southeast through October of \nthat year. The SPR was of limited use in mitigating these shortages \nbecause the refineries affected by the storms were not able to process \nSPR crude oil into gasoline and diesel.\n  Including a small volume of refined petroleum products in the SPR, as \nrequired by The Strategic Petroleum Reserve Modernization Act of 2009, \nwould provide a cushion to affected markets while damaged \ninfrastructure were brought back online, or until imported gasoline and \ndiesel could arrive to service the area.\n  The second key provision included in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nModernization Act of 2009 authorizes the Secretary of Energy to release \nemergency oil from the SPR. Under current law, only the President of \nthe United States can authorize an emergency sale of SPR oil. Experts \nbelieve that this requirement creates a disincentive to use SPR oil for \nthe purposes for which it is intended, as the President does not want \nto alarm the public by announcing that the country is in an oil supply \nemergency.\n  Moving the SPR drawdown authority to the Secretary of Energy would \nallow SPR policy decisions to be made closer to the oil markets that \nthe SPR serves. I believe that many of my colleagues share my \ndisappointment that recent discussions about when and how to use the \nSPR have become so political that sound decisions, based on the reality \nof our country's oil market, have not been possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 967\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to award competitive grants to eligible partnerships \nto enable the partnerships to implement innovative strategies at the \nsecondary school level to improve student achievement and prepare at-\nrisk students for postsecondary education and the workforce; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in our global economy, a high school diploma \nhas become the minimum qualification necessary for a good job. Yet only \nabout a third of the students who enter 9th grade each fall will \ngraduate 4 years later prepared for college or the workforce.\n  Another third will leave high school with a diploma, but without the \nskills and knowledge they need to succeed. Yet another third will not \ngraduate from high school within four years, if at all.\n  This trend, across thousands of our Nation's schools, robs millions \nof young Americans--particularly poor and minority students--of their \nbest chances to succeed.\n  Students in Nevada are hit particularly hard. Less than 70 percent of \nhigh school students in my home state graduate on time. For African \nAmerican and Latino students, that number is closer to 50 percent. \nNearly 20,000 students in Nevada who started school with the class of \n2008 did not graduate with their peers.\n  Leaving these students behind hurts our economy in both the short- \nand long-run. These students will cost the State's economy an estimated \n$5.1 billion in lost wages over the course of\n\n[[Page S5082]]\n\ntheir lifetimes, and will earn an average of almost $10,000 less each \nyear compared to their classmates who finished high school.\n  Almost 90 percent of the fastest-growing and best-paying jobs require \nsome postsecondary education. We can no longer afford to ignore our \nunacceptable graduation rates. We can no longer afford to look the \nother way while more and more students remain unprepared to compete in \nthe global economy. It is not right for these students, and it is not \nright for our economy.\n  That is why Senators Murray and Pryor and I are introducing the \nSecondary School Innovation Fund, a bill to improve the education our \nstudents get in America's secondary schools. Our future competitiveness \ndepends on our ability to transform our Nation's middle- and high-\nschools to meet the needs of the 21st century. This legislation aims to \naddress some of these challenges.\n  Many of our high schools are too large and impersonal. They lack the \nrigor and high expectations that we must set for all of our students. \nOf course, many of the problems that lead students to lose interest or \ndrop out of school begin at the middle-school level.\n  To meet the challenges of this economy and prepare our young people \nfor life after high school, we must give our middle and high schools \nthe opportunity to try new ideas and approaches that will improve \nstudents' performance and their graduation rates.\n  We must take proven ideas and put them in the schools that need them \nthe most like extending the school day or year; dividing large urban \nschools into smaller, more personal learning academies; expanding \nsummer learning opportunities for middle-school students; or partnering \nschools with colleges and universities to allow high school students to \ntake and receive credit for college-level courses.\n  The good news is that schools throughout my home state of Nevada, and \nacross the country, have already started implementing these sorts of \ninnovative strategies:\n  The Clark County Schools District in southern Nevada--the Nation's \n5th largest and one of the fastest growing--has opened some of the most \ncutting-edge career and technical academies in the country. With \nprograms in engineering and design, medical occupations, and media \ncommunications, a visitor to one of these new academies might think \nthey were on a university campus.\n  In northern Nevada, the Washoe County School District has teamed up \nwith one of the local community colleges. The Truckee Meadows Community \nCollege High School now allows students to take a combination of \ncollege and high school courses, and they get credit on both levels. \nNot only do these students complete more challenging, college-level \ncoursework, but they are laying the groundwork for success after high \nschool.\n  Encouraging our secondary schools to meet new, demanding and \ncompetitive requirements requires replicating these types of school \nmodels. But they need adequate Federal support to do so. The Secondary \nSchool Innovation Fund gives them just that.\n  President Obama and Secretary Duncan know this as well. The budget we \npassed last week proposes a similar fund that would promote innovation \nand excellence in America's schools. And the economic recovery plan \nthat we passed earlier this year includes unprecedented funding for \nimproving and reforming our education systems. It also creates a $5 \nbillion ``Race to the Top Fund'' that rewards states and districts for \ninnovation.\n  This bill would give states, districts, schools, institutes of higher \neducation, businesses and community-based organizations $500 million in \ncompetitive grants in each of the next 6 years to reform in our \nNation's secondary schools. By supporting a variety of strategies for \ninnovation and creating evidence-based, systemic and replicable models \nof reform, we will improve student achievement and prepare them to \nsucceed in school and then in the workforce.\n  We also know that every dollar we spend belongs to the American \npeople. That is why we will only help programs that can demonstrate \nthat their students are improving.\n  Democrats are committed to expanding educational opportunities for \nall Americans and preparing them to succeed in the global economy. We \nmust give them the best chance to achieve their full potential, and \nthis bill will help make that possible. I hope my colleagues will join \nme in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 968\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Secondary School Innovation \n     Fund Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since almost 90 percent of the fastest growing and best \n     paying jobs now require some postsecondary education, a \n     secondary school diploma and the skills to succeed in \n     postsecondary education and the modern workplace are \n     essential.\n       (2) Only \\1/3\\ of all high school students in the United \n     States graduate in 4 years prepared for a 4-year institution \n     of higher education. Another \\1/3\\ graduate, but without the \n     skills and qualifications necessary for success in \n     postsecondary education or the workplace, and the rest will \n     not graduate from high school in 4 years, if at all.\n       (3) Dropouts from the class of 2008 will cost the United \n     States more that $319,000,000,000 in reduced earnings.\n       (4) The Nation's failure to meet the increasing demand for \n     skilled workers means that American companies cannot fill a \n     large number of jobs. 81 percent of American manufacturing \n     companies report experiencing a moderate to severe shortage \n     of qualified workers.\n       (5) The education system of the United States should \n     support critical thinking, creativity, and innovative \n     approaches to problem-solving--all skills that cannot easily \n     be outsourced. The Program for International Student \n     Assessment is an international assessment that measures these \n     high-demand skills. Unfortunately, when the results on this \n     assessment of students from the United States are compared to \n     those of students from 27 other countries, many of which are \n     economic competitors of the United States, the United States \n     students rank 24th in problem-solving, 21st in scientific \n     literacy, and 25th in mathematical literacy.\n       (6) As the bar for success continues to be raised, the \n     responsibility to engender these attributes with progressive \n     programs and original models lies squarely with the education \n     system. It is imperative that the United States develop and \n     implement new, innovative approaches to fully prepare every \n     student for the 21st century.\n       (7) Realigning the education system to meet new, demanding \n     requirements and face intensifying competition requires \n     effective, systemic reform. Identifying effective, replicable \n     models that achieve this goal is a critical step towards \n     enhancing the prospects of all students entering the modern \n     workforce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today I introduced a Senate Resolution \nrecognizing the United States Army and the physicians of Maine Medical \nCenter for saving the life of a 6-year-old Iraqi girl.\n  My Maine constituents and I are bursting with pride over the \ntremendous commitment and contribution of Dr. Reed Quinn and the team \nof health professionals at Maine Medical Center who recently conducted \nan eight-hour open heart surgery procedure which saved young Tiba's \nlife. The procedure was made possible by the compassion of the Maine \nFoundation for Cardiac Surgery, and the mission was fulfilled by a team \nof genuine American heroes, led by the U.S. Army.\n  I am particularly touched by the bravery of a young child and the \noutstanding service of our courageous soldiers in the U.S. Army. I will \nalways remember this story because it places a human face at the center \nof a war-torn area.\n  After viewing the moving news series reported by Kim Block of WGME \nChannel 13 in Portland on ``Operation Good Heart,'' I thought it was \nfitting to recognize the story of 6-year-old Tiba and her mother, \nSareea, and their journey from their village in Iraq to Maine. Tiba \nsuffered a dangerous heart condition and was transported by the U.S. \nArmy from Iraq to Maine for life-saving open-heart surgery performed by \nthe talented physicians of Maine Medical Center.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in commending the dedicated \nsoldiers of the U.S. Army, the superlative professionals of Maine \nMedical Center, the generous folks at the Maine Foundation for Cardiac \nSurgery, the good people of Channel 13, and--above all--the brave \nmother and daughter who traveled across the globe. This is a \nheartwarming story about wonderful people who make America great, and I \nurge adoption of the Resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/04/senate-section/article/S5085-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n        committee on homeland security and governmental affairs\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.
