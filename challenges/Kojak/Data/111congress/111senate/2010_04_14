The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 479) expressing sympathy for the \n     people of Poland in the aftermath of the devastating plane \n     crash that killed the country's President, First Lady, and 94 \n     other high ranking government, military, and civic leaders on \n     April 10, 2010.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 479) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 479\n\n       Whereas the United States and Poland are close allies, with \n     a shared bond of history, friendship, and international \n     cooperation;\n       Whereas Polish immigrants were among the first Jamestown \n     settlers, and Casimir Pulaski immigrated to the United States \n     to fight in the Revolutionary War;\n       Whereas more than 9,000,000 Americans of Polish descent now \n     reside in the United States, bringing vitality to major \n     metropolitan areas such as Chicago, Detroit, and New York \n     City;\n       Whereas Polish-Americans have been leaders in all walks of \n     American life;\n       Whereas the American people stood in support of the \n     Solidarity movement as it fought against the oppression of \n     the communist government of Poland through peaceful means, \n     eventually leading to Solidarity members being elected to \n     office in open democratic elections held on June 4, 1989, \n     events that helped spark the movement to democracy throughout \n     eastern Europe;\n       Whereas Poland joined the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) in 1999, joined the European Union in \n     2004, and has contributed to United States and NATO \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas Poland has enjoyed a thriving and prosperous free \n     market democracy since the end of the Cold War;\n       Whereas the President of Poland Lech Kaczynski and 95 other \n     people, including Poland's First Lady, the deputy foreign \n     minister, dozens of members of Parliament, the chiefs of the \n     army and navy, and the president of the national bank, were \n     tragically killed in a plane crash in western Russia on April \n     10, 2010;\n       Whereas President Kaczynski and his colleagues were \n     traveling to Katyn, Russia for a memorial service to mark the \n     70th anniversary of the Soviet secret police killing of more \n     than 20,000 Polish officers, prisoners, and intellectuals who \n     were captured after the Soviet Union invaded Poland in 1939;\n       Whereas Anna Walentynowicz, the former dock worker whose \n     firing in 1980 sparked the Solidarity strike that ultimately \n     overthrew the communist government of Poland, was also killed \n     in the crash;\n       Whereas Ryszard Kaczorowski, who served as Poland's final \n     president in exile before the country's return to democracy, \n     also perished in the crash;\n       Whereas Chicago suffered the loss of a respected artist \n     when Wojciech Seweryn, whose father was killed in Katyn, died \n     in the crash;\n       Whereas Mr. Seweryn recently completed a memorial to the \n     victims of Katyn at St. Adalbert Cemetery in Niles, Illinois, \n     which President Kaczynski planned to visit in May;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama said, the ``loss is \n     devastating to Poland, to the United States, and to the \n     world. President Kaczynski was a distinguished statesman who \n     played a key role in the Solidarity movement, and he was \n     widely admired in the United States as a leader dedicated to \n     advancing freedom and human dignity.'';\n       Whereas Former Solidarity leader and ex-president Lech \n     Walesa said, ``Today, we lost part of our intellectual elite \n     in a plane crash. It will take a long time until the wounds \n     of our democracy are healed.''; and\n       Whereas thousands of Poles gathered in the center of Warsaw \n     and elsewhere around the world on Saturday to mourn those \n     killed in the crash and affirm their continued solidarity \n     with the people of Poland: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its deepest sympathies to the people of \n     Poland and the families of those who perished for their \n     profound loss;\n       (2) expresses strong and continued solidarity with the \n     people of Poland and Polish-American communities in the \n     United States; and\n       (3) expresses unwavering support for the Government of \n     Poland as it works to address the loss of many key public \n     officials.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I also want to join Senator Reid in \nacknowledging the cosponsors of this resolution, and I am sure this \nlist will grow as our colleagues come forward and ask to be added, but \nI thank Senator Johanns for joining me in this effort. I give special \nthanks to Senator Mikulski. We know of her pride in her Polish heritage \nand we know of her deep respect for the people of Poland and our shared \ngrief over the loss to that great nation. Senators Kerry, Voinovich, \nBrown of Ohio, Cardin, and others have also joined me in considering \nthis resolution.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate, Mr. President, with a heavy heart. \nI express my sympathy to the people of Poland and to Ambassador \nKupiecki who is here representing them. I shared a moment with him \nearlier this morning and mentioned that when I heard the news of this \ntragic loss, my thoughts went back immediately to 47 years ago when we \nlost our President, John Kennedy, and what it meant to our Nation and \nhow devastating it was. This city ground to a halt on that day, and the \nbells began to peal in the church towers all across Washington every \nhour on the hour as our Nation reflected on its great loss. It was a \ntime of great sadness, as it should have been in our history, and as I \nam sure it is now in Poland, as people reflect on the morning of \nSaturday, April 10, when a plane carrying Polish President Lech \nKaczynski, his wife Maria, and 94 other high-ranking government, \nmilitary and civilian leaders crashed while traveling to a memorial \nservice in Russia that was to recognize and memorialize the dreadful \nKatyn massacre.\n  The tragic accident is a devastating loss to the Nation of Poland and \nto their friends around the world. This photo I brought to the floor \nshows literally thousands of Poles who gathered in Warsaw on Saturday \nevening to remember those who died. They were outside St. John's \nCathedral in Warsaw grieving for the loss of their President and so \nmany leaders of their nation.\n  The pain of this sad moment is felt around the world but especially \nin the city of Chicago, which I am honored to represent. It is home to \nmore Polish American families than anywhere else in the United States. \nAnd what a proud heritage they bring to our city, our State, and our \nNation; what a contribution they have made. The grief they feel today \nis a grief we share.\n  Yesterday, as I mentioned, my fellow Senators joined me in offering \nthis resolution. The United States and Poland share a strong bond of \nhistory, friendship, and international cooperation. Polish Americans \nhave become leaders in all walks of life. In the Senate, Senator \nMikulski and others of Polish heritage have shown that their \ncontribution to America continues to this day. We joined with Poland in \nour Revolutionary War, and we are so grateful for those Poles who, like \nCasimir Pulaski and others, stepped forward and joined us in our effort \nto gain independence. When the time came many decades later, and Poland \nwas seeking its own independence after the Solidarity movement, the \nUnited States stood by their side.\n  We know President Kaczynski was part of that effort, and we know he \nwas in fact interred in prison because he fought for democracy in \nPoland. He was respected throughout his country for the role he played \nand the leadership he brought to this modern, free, democratic Poland \ntoday. We have stood by Poland as the Solidarity movement grew into a \nstrong, vibrant democracy. We have supported Poland's membership in \nNATO, so that we are joint allies in an effort to defend the values we \nshare and in the European Union where they have become a modern economy \nand a major leader in Europe. Poland also stood by the United States as \nwell in our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  As Poles struggle to come to terms with this week's tragedy, the \nUnited States will stand with them and will support their government as \nit works to overcome the loss of so many of its great leaders.\n  President and Mrs. Kaczynski and their delegation were on a mission \nto try, so many years later, to close a deep wound to the Polish people \nof the Katyn massacre of World War II, where more than 20,000 Poles \nwere executed by Soviet secret police and buried in\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\nmass graves in that forest. As the Ambassador said to me this morning, \nthat Katyn Forest is a holy and a cursed place because now this tragedy \nis added onto the memory of the loss that took place so many years ago.\n  Russia and Poland have begun to deal with this tragedy, and that is a \npositive thing. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin recently joined \nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk at a ceremony marking that tragedy. \nPrime Minister Putin--the first Russian leader to attend that memorial \nservice--said:\n\n       We bow our heads to those who bravely met death here.\n\n  This was the beginning of the closure of a critical chapter in the \nhistory of those two nations. This is the beginning of healing, which \nis long overdue. Sadly, the Katyn tragedy has now been compounded by \nthe loss of so many of Poland's leaders who were destined to head to \nthis location in memory of those who had fallen.\n  Aboard the plane were some of Poland's highest military and civilian \nleaders--the Deputy Foreign Minister, the Chiefs of the Army and Navy, \nthe president of the national bank, and dozens of Members of \nParliament. Two prominent civilian leaders aboard the plane were \nWojciech Seweryn and Anna Walentynowicz.\n  Seweryn was an artist from Chicago and an influential member of \nChicago's Polish community. Mr. Seweryn's father died at Katyn, and it \nsoon became his life's passion to honor his father's memory with \nbeautiful memorials that he had built in the United States and in the \nlocation of the Katyn Forest. What a bitter irony that he would lose \nhis life journeying to this memorial occasion. Throughout his life he \nbrought awareness to the Katyn tragedy. He led an effort in the Chicago \narea to construct a memorial in remembrance of the Katyn massacre at \nSt. Adalbert Cemetery, which Poland's President Kaczynski was planning \nto visit in just a few weeks.\n  Anna Walentynowicz was a famous civilian leader and a former dock \nworker whose firing in 1980 sparked the Solidarity strike that \nultimately overthrew the Polish Communist government. Due in part to \nher inspiration, Poland has emerged as a thriving and prosperous free \nmarket democracy since the end of the Cold War.\n  Poland shares a state partnership program with my home State's \nNational Guard, a partnership that has been in place since shortly \nafter the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is one of the many partnerships \nour Illinois National Guard has with former Warsaw Pact member nations. \nSince 1993, hundreds of Illinois National Guard members have \nparticipated in exchanges with Polish forces in cooperative efforts \nsupporting the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and in other military \ntraining and exchanges.\n  Among those killed in last week's tragedy are officers who were well \nknown to the Illinois National Guard. Several troops in the Illinois \nGuard have served under the officers who were on President Kaczynski's \naircraft. These fine soldiers are in the thoughts of all the people of \nIllinois and the 13,000 men and women of the Illinois National Guard \ntoday.\n  On Saturday I visited the Polish Consulate in Chicago to pay my \nrespects and leave my regards in the condolence book. People were \nstarting to flock to this site, people in Chicago, driving with Polish \nflags proudly displayed over their vehicles, to come to this consulate \nto express their own sorrow for this loss, to join in the long line \nsigning the condolence book, and to leave flowers at the flagpole \nbearing the Polish flag right outside of the consulate.\n  I have such admiration for the people of Poland who have endured so \nmany trials and struggles. What has brought them through time and again \nis faith and family, and those two enduring qualities will help them as \nthey try to cope with this massive crisis that is facing their country.\n  As the ambassador said to me this morning, there is no doubt that \nPoland will emerge strong; that this government is going to be stable; \nthat it is going to move forward. He can count as well that we will be \nat his side and the side of the people of Poland as they rebuild their \ngovernment and their nation from this tragedy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring of this measure and \nsupport passage of the resolution which we just considered on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, let me start my comments today by \nthanking the senior Senator from Illinois. It has been an honor to join \nwith him on this important resolution.\n  I rise today to pay my respects to the people of Poland, to \nacknowledge the great work of their President, President Lech \nKaczynski, to acknowledge the death of his wife and 94 other Poles who \ndied in the plane crash in western Russia this last Saturday, April 10.\n  They were traveling to Katyn, Russia for a memorial service to mark \nthe 70th anniversary of the Soviet killing of more than 20,000 Polish \nofficers in 1940.\n  Among the Polish leaders killed in the plane crash last Saturday were \ndozens of members of Parliament, revolutionary heroes from 1989, senior \nmilitary commanders, and the president of the national bank. This is a \nterrible, heartbreaking loss, not just for Poland but for its close \nfriend and ally, the United States.\n  The tight bond that has been forged between Poland and this country \nhas been one of the most welcome results of the end of the Cold War. \nSince the fall of communism, in which the Polish Solidarity movement \nplayed a major role, Poland has led the way in building a pro-United \nStates free market democracy. Poland's access to NATO in 1999 has led \nto invaluable Polish contributions to peace and stability around our \nworld. Polish soldiers have fought side by side with Americans in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, including in key coalition leadership positions. We \nhave suffered together when our troops took casualties, and today we \ngrieve together.\n  The foundation of our close partnership was laid by many Polish \nimmigrants to America. Today, over 9 million Americans of Polish \ndescent reside in the United States, including the State of Nebraska. I \nam very proud to be one of them. My grandparents immigrated here from \nPoland many decades ago.\n  The Polish are an important part of this great country and have been \nsince the earliest days of our Nation when they helped settle \nJamestown, VA. I am very pleased to introduce this resolution along \nwith the senior Senator from Illinois. The senior Senator may not know \nthis, but he represents some of my relatives in Chicago, and represents \nthem well. I joined with him and all of our colleagues in a moment of \nsilence, as we have done today. I want to pay our respects to the \nPoles, both in this part of the country and across this great Nation, \nas well as in Poland. I also acknowledge the great contributions they \nhave made to our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, join with my colleagues to rise \nto express my deep and heartfelt condolences to the people of Poland on \nthis unbelievable and tragic loss. I thank my colleague Senator Durbin \nfor organizing this time, joined by Senator Johanns of Nebraska.\n  As one who notes the Senate floor today, I see we stand here not as \nDemocrats and not as Republicans but as Americans who want to extend \nour heartfelt sympathy to the people of Poland. I thank my colleague \nfor organizing this resolution and for all of his efforts in support of \nPoland--from the years of trying to get the truth out about the Katyn \nForest, to his very able and unstinting efforts to bring Poland into \nNATO and to advance Polish democracy. I thank him.\n  I rise here today as a granddaughter of a woman who came from Poland \nover 100 years ago, when women did not even have the right to vote. \nWhen she got off of that boat at Fells Point in Baltimore she was a 16-\nyear-old girl in search of the American dream. Little did she dream \nthat less than 100 years later, her granddaughter would stand on the \nfloor of the Senate, advocating for democracy in Poland, righting the \nwrongs of World War II. And little did I realize, with the great honor \nthe people of Maryland have given to me, that\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\nI would stand on the floor of the Senate and express sympathy at this \ntragedy of unimaginable magnitude.\n  Poland has suffered a loss where the wounds might not ever heal. The \nfacts are now well known. Poland lost their President, Lech Kaczynski, \na great leader with a lifetime of service to this country.\n  The Polish people lost their First Lady, Maria, beloved by the people \nfor her good works and her good deeds. More than 90 other dedicated \nPolish patriots perished that terrible Saturday morning--esteemed and \ndecorated military officers, the equivalent of our Joint Chiefs; \nexperienced diplomats; elected leaders; the head of their central bank, \nand citizens who have put their lives on the line for Poland. All were \nPolish patriots. My heart weeps for the terrible loss and for the \npeople of Poland.\n  We know the terrible story of the Katyn massacre that brought them to \nthis site, this unbelievable site for the last 70 years saturated with \nincredible melancholy. In the spring of 1940, the Soviet secret police \nexecuted over 20,000 Polish prisoners of war--20,000 Polish military \nofficers. Then there were other intellectuals from law, from science, \nfrom medicine. A whole generation of Polish patriots and lenders was \nmurdered in that terrible place, people who died for Polish freedom.\n  Part of Stalin's efforts to destroy the Polish people was to destroy \nits leaders. The Nazis then continued what Stalin had begun. Then the \nworld--after a brutal war, the terrible death camps--at Yalta and \nPotsdam the West abandoned Poland, and Poland, against its will, was \nforced behind the Iron Curtain.\n  What do we know about the Polish people? Their nation never dies \nbecause their nation does live not only in a government, not only now \nunder a rule of law and a constitution that is serving them so well at \nthis troubled time, but Poland lives within the hearts of its people. \nNo massacre, no Iron Curtain, could ever take it away from them.\n  During those dark years when Poland continued to be under Soviet \ndomination, there were those who worked to tell the story of what \nhappened at Katyn. Joining with my colleagues in the Congress, I fought \nfor many years to release the information about that horrific massacre, \neven contacting President Gorbachev, as part of his glasnost and \nperestroika, to at least release all the information. Finally, in 1990 \nthey began to do it. But it was only now, last Wednesday, 1 week ago, \nat the site where the massacre occurred, the Prime Minister of Poland, \nMr. Tusk, with Mr. Putin, met in that forest where Putin issued a \nformal apology to the Polish people and said all information and \narchives would be open.\n  We were so filled with joy. It was a time of great reconciliation. \nThat is what Saturday was about, it was the continuation of a great and \ngrand reconciliation between these nations.\n  Kaczynski traveled to bring the leadership there. In the leadership \nwere people who had been trail blazers. Mr. Kaczynski himself had been \na member of Solidarity, his wife solidly at his side. And now, as he \nwas President of Poland, forging new relationships, mending the wounds \nwith the Jewish community, it was a time of Polish leadership reaching \nout to the world in efforts of reconciliation. In this case, Russia \nreached back.\n  One of the people who died--it was so poignant--was a woman named \nAnna Walentynowicz. She was in many ways the Rosa Parks of Solidarity \nmovements. She was a crane operator in the Gdansk shipyard. They fired \nher for trying to form a union and when Anna stood up, so did Lech \nWalesa, and Solidarity was born. When he leapt over that wall he took \nthe whole world with him. Down it came, after years of martial law and \noccupation. We had Solidarity and then ultimately a free Poland.\n  At this time of great tragedy as we honor those who died in the \nforest in 1940, and those who died in the forest on Saturday, we can \nsee that hopefully some good would come out of this. It has been a \ntriple tragedy--the massacre of 1940, the coverup by the Soviet Union, \nand now the Saturday airplane crash. But out of this we hope would come \na new sense of cooperation. I acknowledge that the Russian Government \nhas been working with the Polish Government to recover the bodies and \nsend them home with dignity and honor. Their promises of a complete \ninvestigation seem to be unfolding and they have invited Polish \nofficials to join with them, side by side.\n  We hope out of this tragedy might further come other acts of great \nreconciliation. That is what we need to think about, how Poland \ncontinues to move the world to peace and to reconciliation.\n  I want to acknowledge the people from Poland and what they did for \nthe United States. Pulaski helped fight in our Revolution. Kosciuszko \nbuilt West Point, was one of the architects of the American Revolution. \nWhen he went back home to help Poland be free, he left money with \nThomas Jefferson to fight for the abolition of slavery.\n  Through all of the wars, Poland has always been on the side of the \nWest. During World War II, those who would escape from Poland led the \narmies in exile. They were at Monte Cassino, they flew in the \nKosciuszko Squadron with the RAF, they have been at our side in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Wherever there is a fight to be made for freedom, the \nPoles are there and they need to know, when they make those fights, the \nUnited States of America is with them.\n  For those who died on Saturday in that terrible, melancholy forest, \nour hearts go with them. To the people of Poland we express our \nsympathy, but we also express our pride in their stalwart, unrelenting, \nunflinching commitment to peace and justice in their own country and in \nthe world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland. She is \nof proud Polish heritage. When she spoke of her grandmother coming to \nFells Point in Baltimore, I couldn't help but think of my grandmother \ncoming to that same place, 99 years go, from Lithuania, to become part \nof this American family. I would like to acknowledge, too, on behalf of \nmany who followed her, our gratitude to Poland over the years. Poland \nwas first to democracy in the region, and stood by the Baltic States, \nparticularly Lithuania, their neighbor, as they reached their own level \nof democracy and freedom.\n  The Senator from Maryland will be heartened to know that we have just \nbeen notified by the cloakrooms that all 100 Senators have asked to be \nadded as cosponsors of this resolution, to show our solidarity with the \npeople of Poland.\n  I thank the ambassador for his attendance this morning and hope he \nwill express to his government and the people of his country our \nprofound grief at his loss and our determination that our strong \nfriendship with Poland continues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday morning I came to the floor \nto point out, regretfully, that the financial regulatory bill the \nDemocratic majority plans to introduce in the coming days is fatally \nflawed. It not only allows endless bailouts for Wall Street, it \ninstitutionalizes them, making them official government policy. This is \ntruly astonishing. For nearly 2 years, the American people have been \ntelling us that any financial reform should have two goals: It should \nprevent the kind of crisis we experienced in the fall of 2008, and it \nshould ensure that the biggest Wall Street banks pay for their own \nmistakes--the biggest Wall Street banks pay for their own mistakes. Yet\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\nthe bill we are being asked to consider does not even begin to solve \nthese fundamental problems. In fact, it exacerbates them. It is almost \nas if the people who wrote this bill took the pulse of the American \npeople and then put together a bill that endorses the very things they \nfound most repugnant about the first bailout.\n  The proponents of this bill will make a lot of claims about what this \nbill does and does not do. But the American people did not go through \nthe financial crisis, did not put up their own collateral to bail out \nWall Street only to be deceived about the contents of this Wall Street \nbill.\n  We need some truth in advertising here, so let's look at what this \nbill actually does. Its authors claim the bill gives the government the \nauthority to wind down failing firms with no exposure to the taxpayer. \nBut as a factual matter the bill creates bailout funds, authorizes \nbailouts, allows for backdoor bailouts in the FDIC, Treasury, and the \nFed, and even expands the scope of future bailouts.\n  It does this, first of all, by creating a new permanent bailout fund, \na prepaid $50 billion bailout fund, the very existence of which would, \nof course, immediately signal to everyone that the government is ready \nto bail out large banks the same way it bailed out Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. So the same distortions--the very same distortions that \ndeveloped within the housing market would inevitably develop in the \nfinancial sector. Didn't like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? How about 35 \nto 50 of them? That is what this bill would give us.\n  Second, it authorizes bailouts for creditors. In other words, it is \nnot enough to bail out a bank; the people who invested in the bank \nwould get a bailout too. Made a bad bet? No problem; the government \nwill bail you out. Made a bad bet on a company that made a bad bet? No \nproblem; the government will bail you out, too--provided, of course, \nthat you are among the creditors favored by the White House. This is \ngreat if you are on Wall Street; it is not so great if you are on Main \nStreet. It is great if you are in a union; it is not so great if you \nare not. This bill institutionalizes the picking of winners and losers \nand gives the government broad authority in choosing which creditors \nget paid in full and which ones do not.\n  Third, the bill gives the government a backdoor mechanism for \nbailouts by extending to the Federal Reserve an enhanced emergency \nlending authority that is wide open to abuse. It gives the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation and Treasury broad authority over \ntroubled financial institutions without requiring them to assume \nresponsibility for their own mistakes. This means that unproductive \nfirms which would otherwise go into bankruptcy would now be propped up \nby the government like zombies.\n  Fourth, this bill expands the scope of potential future bailouts--\nexpands the scope of potential future bailouts. It does this by \nauthorizing a financial stability oversight council to designate \nnonbank financial institutions as potential threats to financial \nstability and, hence, too big to fail. So a new government board based \nin Washington would determine which institutions would qualify for \nspecial treatment, giving unaccountable bureaucrats and self-appointed \nwise men in Washington even more power to protect, promote, or punish \ncompanies at whim. These favored firms would then have a funding \nadvantage over their competitors, leading to outsized profits and the \nextension of enormous additional bailout risk for taxpayers even beyond \nthe largest banks.\n  Fifth, the bill does nothing to correct the massive market \ndistortions that we all know were created by Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac. Job 1 in writing this bill should have been to address the \ninherent problems caused by these massive government-sponsored \nentities. This bill ignores that issue entirely.\n  The American taxpayer has suffered enough as a result of the \nfinancial crisis and the recession it triggered. They have asked us for \none thing: Whatever you do, they say, do not leave the door open to \nendless bailouts of Wall Street banks. Whatever you do, the American \npeople have said, do not leave the door open for endless bailouts of \nWall Street banks. This bill fails at that one fundamental test.\n  If there were two lessons we should have drawn from this crisis, one \nis that if investors are reckless, then they should pay for their \nrecklessness. If investors are reckless, they should pay for their \nrecklessness. The other thing we should have learned is that Washington \nbureaucrats are horrible at seeing these kinds of crises develop. It \nshould be beyond obvious that more bureaucrats will not prevent the \nkinds of problems other bureaucrats overlooked.\n  If you need to know one thing about this bill, it is that it would \nmake it official government policy--official government policy--to bail \nout the biggest Wall Street banks. This bill would make it official \ngovernment policy to bail out the biggest Wall Street banks. So if the \nadministration is looking for bipartisan support on this Wall Street \nbill, they can start by eliminating this aspect of the bill, not \nbecause Republicans are asking for it but because community bankers, \ncommunity bankers all across the country, and American taxpayers are \ndemanding it.\n  Unfortunately, the administration evidently is more interested in \nusing this debate as a political issue than in actually addressing, on \na bipartisan basis, the many weaknesses that are currently built into \nour economy. For example, it has been reported that the senior \nDemocratic Senator from Arkansas was working on a bipartisan solution \nto one of the key areas where reform is needed but that she was told by \nthe White House in no uncertain terms that it didn't approve of her \nefforts at forging a bipartisan deal. It has also been reported that \nthe Democratic chairman of the Banking Committee backed out of \nbipartisan negotiations under pressure from the White House. The White \nHouse spokesman was even more explicit, saying late last month that the \nWhite House is not interested in compromising on this legislation. So \nthe White House has been really quite clear. It plans to take the same \napproach on financial reform as it took on health care--put together a \npartisan bill, then jam it through on a strictly partisan basis. It \nshould go without saying that this is not the kind of approach most \nAmericans want in Washington, and it is not the kind of approach they \nwere told they could expect from this administration.\n  We can do better, and we must. Americans are still dealing with the \nfallout from the financial crisis. Getting this policy right should be \nour first priority. This bill gets it very, very wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2255-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on a \ntopic I have addressed many times since I came to the Senate in the \nfall of last year. Having come from running a business and having \nworked in State government, every day it is still alarming to me the \nway Washington spends money. In no other place in America and perhaps \nno other place in the world is money spent by an organization without \nany reference to how much money is being taken in. Unfortunately, the \nsituation has gotten to a point where it is completely unsustainable \nfor this country.\n  We open our newspapers today and we read stories about Greece having \nto borrow money from the European Union, being so far in debt that the \nforecast of the country's viability is in question. Yet our country is \nheaded on the same path, but few come to the floor of this Chamber and \nsound the alarm. I will continue to do that for\n\n[[Page S2256]]\n\nthe remainder of the time I have here in this body because the future \nof this country is at peril.\n  While we have spent too much for many years, the rate and pace of \nthat spending now is beyond control. But it need not be. We need not \ncontinue in the ways of spending more money than we can possibly pay \nback. Let me set the table, if I may, of the financial situation we are \nin.\n  Here in 2010, we are about the business of setting up the budget for \n2011. You would think the first question we would ask would be, How \nmuch money do we expect to take in in 2011? Well, the number is about \n$2.2 trillion. Yet the projected budget of how much we are going to \nspend is $3.8 trillion. We will run a deficit in this year alone of \n$1.6 trillion.\n  Now, these numbers are so big. Well, $1 trillion--what is $1 \ntrillion? Well, $1 trillion is $1,000 billion--$1,000 billion. A \nbillion is 1,000 million. The numbers are so hard to fathom, but let me \nexplain, if I can, in a way I have often talked about here on the \nfloor. If you put dollar bills side to side, you could cover two \nfootball fields with $1 million.\n  If one laid $1 billion on the ground in one-dollar bills side by \nside, they could cover Key West, FL, which has a square area of more \nthan 3 miles. They would blanket the city with one-dollar bills with $1 \nbillion. Mr. President, $1 trillion will cover the State of Rhode \nIsland twice. Every one of these dollars is a dollar taken from the \nAmerican taxpayer, a dollar they could spend on families, on children's \neducation, on homes, on needed repairs. We take those dollars and spend \nthem. Now we spend them beyond an ability to pay them back. Right now, \nbecause of the money we borrow, more than $200 billion a year goes to \ninterest payments alone, paying for the money we should not have spent \nin the past. At our current rate of spending, according to this \nadministration, by the end of this decade, we will have another almost \n$10 trillion in debt, making our total debt $22 trillion.\n  At that point, our interest payment each year will be $900 billion. \nAt that point, the budget breaks. At that point, what we call mandatory \nspending on entitlements, such as Social Security and Medicare and \nMedicaid, will be all of the budget plus the interest. There will be no \nmoney for defense, no money for homeland security, for any of the other \nprograms in government.\n  If we have this impending crisis, if we are driving the car toward \nthe wall, why aren't we making any changes? Today I am filing \nlegislation to enact a change, enact a mechanism, an architecture to \nhave a discussion on the floor in this Chamber and in the House to find \na solution to put America back on a stable financial path. The bill is \nwhat I call the 2007 solution. In 2007, the economy was still going \nstrong. It was not until December of that year that we found ourselves \nbeginning the recession.\n  If I go home to Florida, as I did this past weekend, and talk to \nFloridians and ask: Could you live on what you had in 2007? Based on \nthese difficult times, my constituents had more money in 2007 than they \ndo in 2010. Why shouldn't the Federal Government be able to live on \nwhat we spent in 2007? Why can't that be enough? If we did that, if we \nfroze spending across the board at 2007 levels, when the economy was \nstill going strong, before we injected all this stimulus money, if we \ngo back to a place of normalcy--and, trust me, there was plenty of \nredundant and wasteful spending in 2007--let's go back to that as a \nframework. If we were to cap our spending at 2007 levels, by 2013, we \nwould balance the budget and start running a surplus. By 2020, instead \nof having a $22 trillion national debt that is unsustainable, we would \nhave a $6 trillion national debt. We would have cut it in half. We \nwould have preserved the American dream for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I have four small kids--we just had a baby 2 weeks ago--Max, Taylor, \nChase, and Madeleine, 6, 4, 2, and 2 weeks. My greatest fear is, \nsomeday one of my kids is going to come to me, when they are an adult, \nafter they have gone to school, and say: Dad, we are going to move to \nIndia or Brazil or Ireland or some other country. The opportunities in \nthose countries are better than the ones in the United States. Dad, \nyour generation and the generation before so mismanaged this government \nthat you ruined the American dream. Our taxes now are so high to pay \nfor the debt for things you spent in the past. Our entitlements are so \nweighty we can't afford them. We are going to leave.\n  The 2007 solution would solve that problem. How does it work? Every \nyear under this bill, the majority leader of the Senate and the \nmajority leader in the House would have to come to the floor and file a \nprocedure to allow for 50 hours of debate on this floor and on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives to decide how we are going to \nmake cuts to stay within 2007 levels. If the majority leader doesn't do \nit, the minority leader has the opportunity. If the minority leader \ndoesn't do it, any Senator can do it. Then we will have to, for the \nfirst time, have an adult conversation about priorities. Maybe then we \nwould call in the agency heads of the different agencies of government \nwho have had 10, 15, 20 percent-plus increases year after year in their \nbudgets for more than a decade, and we would say: Can you make some \ncuts? Can you do things more efficiently?\n  American businesses for the past 3 years have been making tremendous \ncuts because they have to. We don't make cuts in our agencies. Our \nagency heads don't meet with the members of their organizations, the \ntens and thousands of workers who work in the different agencies, and \nsay: Can we do things differently? Can we do things more efficiently?\n  This morning I had the opportunity to speak to a friend of mine who \nis about to become speaker of the house of the Florida House of \nRepresentatives, a man named Dean Cannon. Right now the Florida \nlegislature is in session. They have to balance their budget, a very \nunfamiliar notion in Washington, DC. They are cutting billions of \ndollars from the Florida budget, as they did last year and the year \nbefore, because revenues are down because the economy is hurting. They \nhave three choices. They can make cuts, raise taxes, or find new \nsources of revenue. Right now they are going through the process of \ncutting because they have to. They are making responsible leadership \ndecisions. That process does not happen in Washington, DC. Under this \nbill, a framework would be provided that would require that debate. It \nwould require that focus.\n  The majority of my colleagues are more interested in new programs \nthan making the programs we have run more efficiently and effectively. \nWe cannot afford new programs. We cannot afford the programs we have \nnow. If we keep blindly looking off and pretending we don't have this \ncrisis, the car is going to hit the wall. Our children are going to be \nin a situation where they can't fulfill the American dream. The 2007 \nsolution says we are going to have a debate for 50 hours on the floor \nof this Chamber every year about how we can get back to 2007 levels. It \ndoesn't specify where the cuts should be. Shall we make cuts in the \nDefense Department? Do we need to reform our entitlement programs? Is \nthere waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare? We would have those \ndiscussions. It would be our governing, focusing principle for at least \n50 hours. Do we not have 50 hours to figure out whether we can run \ngovernment more efficiently and effectively?\n  There are hundreds of billions of dollars we could cut out of the \nFederal Government and not impact our constituents back home. I am \nconvinced of it. Do we not think there is 10 percent waste in Federal \nagencies that have not made cuts for more than a decade? If we cut 10 \npercent across the board in Federal agencies, we would save more than \n$100 billion a year; 20 percent gets us close to $300 billion. \nBusinesses, families, State governments are doing this right now and \nhave been doing it for years. The 2007 solution, which I hope my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will embrace, says: Let's \nhave a discussion. Let's have the architecture in place to get back to \na level of sustainable spending. If we did that, if we were principled \nabout it, we could save this country. It is to that point. The debt is \ncascading out of control.\n  I came to this body in September of last year. I stand on the floor \nof the Senate in April, and we have gone $1 trillion more in debt since \nI arrived, $1 trillion in a 6- or 7-month period. It took us until \n1980, from 1789 to 1980, to go $1 trillion in debt. We did it in 6 or\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\n7 months. Our spending is out of control. We need a solution. We need a \nframework for a governing leadership discussion. I believe the 2007 \nsolution bill can do that.\n  I hope my colleagues will embrace this provision. I hope we can \ncreate an architecture to put America back on the right path. I know \nthere are people of good conscience on both sides of the aisle, \nincluding the man who sits in the chair today, who care about this \nspending problem. If we could get past partisanship, if we could get \npast rhetoric and focus on this issue, we could save America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, last Sunday at midnight thousands of \npeople in my home State of Washington, who have lost their jobs through \nno fault of their own, had the rug pulled out from underneath them. \nThat is because these men and women, who wake up each day to scan the \nclassified ads and send out resumes and travel to interview after \ninterview, had the unemployment benefits they count on suddenly cut \noff. In losing that critical support, they lost an important source of \nsecurity they need to help them stay in their homes or make rent and \nthe stability that allows them to continue to afford to look for work.\n  Over the last 2 weeks, I have traveled throughout my State, talking \nto my constituents and discussing our economy and working to support \njob-creation efforts, and I have to say the frustration is very clear. \nIt is written on the faces of so many in my State who just cannot seem \nto get a break, who have come close to being hired but have been told \nthe time is just not right, they should come back next month or next \nyear. These are people who are struggling job seekers, and they do not \nhold back when describing what they continue to face. It is an \nemergency. It is an emergency that affects their ability to pay their \nbills, their ability to put food on the table, and their ability to \nkeep their job search going. It is an emergency that time and again we \nhave worked hard here to respond to, but time and again we have faced \nopposition to do that.\n  Before we left for the recess, we had an opportunity to pass an \nextension of the unemployment benefits, to respond to that emergency in \nour job market, and to avoid the uncertainty job seekers across the \ncountry now face. Democrats put an unemployment extension out on the \ntable. It was a proposal that was similar to extensions we have done \nroutinely in difficult times, and, as we all know, times have seldom \nbeen more difficult. But it has become an all too familiar story now: \nThose on the other side of the aisle said no and put obstruction before \nassistance, politics before people, and point-scoring before the needs \nof those who have lost their jobs.\n  This week, we have a chance to make things right. The legislation we \nare trying so hard now to pass this week is very straightforward. This \nbill will get unemployment insurance to millions of struggling families \nwho rely on it to meet their basic needs, to pay their mortgage, and \nafford school. It will restore the safety net that is critical to \nkeeping our economy stable. It will give those people who are looking \nfor jobs the means to afford to keep looking for them. And it will keep \nour economic turnaround on course. It is aimed at helping real families \nwith the real problems they face every day.\n  But make no mistake, the consequences of not reaching a compromise \nand passing this bill are just as real. Today, families in every single \none of our States are sitting around their kitchen table trying to \nfigure out how they are going to make it through the weeks and months \nahead without these payments. Oftentimes, they have spent their day \ncalling employers and going to job fairs with long lines and very few \nopportunities, filling out more job applications. These families are \nnow looking to us for the help they need in a time of crisis. But every \nevening these families are turning on the nightly news to hear another \nstory about gridlock in our Nation's Capital. They see this Senate \nbeing forced to jump through procedural hoops and endure endless delay \ntactics to get even emergency legislation passed. They see politics \nclouding policy, obstruction impeding process, and, do you know what, \nthey are really getting sick of it.\n  So today I urge all of us to come together and move forward with the \nsame urgency those who have lost their unemployment have, that we join \ntogether the way we did to pass the Children's Health Insurance Program \nor fair pay for women in the workplace or small business tax cuts. We \nneed to restore the faith of the American people and pass this critical \nextension.\n  But for those who are fighting to get back to work and support their \nfamilies once again, unemployment obviously is not enough. We need to \nbe taking every step we can to improve the job market unemployed \nworkers wake up to face every morning because while there certainly \nhave been signs of improvement, we have a lot of work left to do. I \ncertainly believe that work starts with helping our small businesses, \nwhich are the heart and soul of our economy.\n  Growing up, my dad ran a five-and-ten-cent store on Main Street--\nactually Main Street--in Bothell, WA. All six of my brothers and \nsisters and I worked there. From an early age, we swept floors, we \nstocked the shelves, we worked the register. And when small businesses \nlike ours struggled, we all knew the consequences. We saw it in the \ntill at the end of the day. We saw it in the families who were coming \nto buy things from my dad. Small businesses really were the economic \nengine of Main Street then, and, do you know what, they still are \ntoday.\n  But what I hear time and again today is that while Wall Street is \ndoing a whole lot better, Main Street is still really struggling and \nthat the small community banks, which are a major source of capital in \nall of our communities, are not lending. When small banks, which are \nthe lifelines of our small businesses, do not lend, then credit is not \nflowing, businesses are not hiring, and recovery is not coming to Main \nStreet. That is exactly why I have introduced legislation that would \nredirect TARP dollars to buy toxic assets such as bad mortgages off the \nbooks of our community banks at home to help free up their credit and \nget them lending to our small businesses again. We have done enough for \nWall Street. It is past time we concentrate on helping our small \nbusinesses and local employers.\n  Another way to help improve local job markets and all those who are \nlooking for work is to, of course, lessen the tax burden on our small \nbusinesses so they can afford to hire new workers. Over the recess, I \nhad the opportunity to talk to owners of local bakeries and motels and \nmarketing companies and a lot more throughout my entire State, and, do \nyou know what, they all told me the same thing. They want to hire and \nthey want to expand. They even see new opportunities. But the risks for \nthem now are just too great. What they need from us is certainty and \nsecurity. I told them we are working to provide them with just that. I \ntold them the health care reform bill we just passed includes a 35-\npercent tax credit that small business owners can receive immediately \nto help them cover their workers. I encouraged them to hire unemployed \nworkers who have been out of work for more than 60 days because we now \nare giving them an exemption from their payroll taxes for those new \nemployees. I told them now is the time to make big purchases they want \nbecause we have worked to pass legislation that will allow them to \nwrite those purchases off immediately. I told them we have worked to \nensure that the Small Business Administration is increasing its local \nlending efforts. But\n\n[[Page S2258]]\n\nI also told them, of course, that we have more to accomplish and they, \nthe small businesses, need to be the focus of recovery efforts from \nthis point on.\n  Another central tenet of improving the job market is included in the \nhistoric health care reform legislation we passed into law last month. \nAs we all know, that bill greatly expands access to care in communities \nacross the Nation, but what has gone less noticed is that the bill also \ngreatly expands access to health care careers to help meet that new \ndemand.\n  I was the Senator in the HELP Committee who was responsible for the \nhealth care workforce section of the bill we passed, and I worked to \nmake sure we made numerous investments to create and sustain good-\npaying health care jobs. Our bill that is now signed into law \nincludes incentives such as loan repayment programs, scholarships, and \ngrants, all to help encourage students to go into high-need fields and \nto work in underserved areas. It invests in education, training, and \nretention efforts, not just for new health care workers but for those \nwho are already working to provide quality care in our country. \nInvestments in our health care workforce create jobs. They ease the \nstrain on overworked health care professionals. And it is going to keep \nAmericans healthy so they can be productive on the job.\n\n  Finally, I believe we need to pay particular attention to our efforts \nto hire our Nation's heroes, and they, of course, are our veterans. \nRight now, the unemployment rate for veterans who are returning from \nIraq and Afghanistan is over 21 percent. More than one in five of the \nmen and women who went and fought for our country are returning home \nonly to have to fight to find work. These are disciplined, technically \nskilled, determined workers who nonetheless have been left to stand at \nthe back of the line or have their resumes lost in a stack somewhere.\n  Over the last 2 weeks, I talked to many unemployed veterans in my \nhome State of Washington about just what it is that is keeping them \nfrom finding work, and, frankly, what they told me was shocking. Many \nveterans told me they sometimes leave off the fact they are veterans \nfrom their resume because employers are looking at it as a negative \nrather than a positive because of the stigma of the invisible wounds of \nwar. National Guard members talked of coming home to find they have \nbeen laid off because their job no longer existed at the company they \nleft behind when they went to serve our country. Other veterans told me \nthe Pentagon and VA transition programs just are not working for today. \nAnd they struggle to have employers understand how the technical skills \nthey learned in the military will translate to help them in the \ncivilian working world.\n  What I heard is unacceptable, and it has to change immediately. So \nnext week I am going to be introducing a bill on the Senate floor that \nwill take a look at why our military skills are not translating into \nskills that get them jobs when they come home. It will help our \nveterans get into apprenticeship programs and careers where I know they \nwill excel. It will improve the military and civilian transition \nprocess. And we are going to set up a veterans business center within \nthe Small Business Administration to help our veterans get the skills \nand resources to start their own businesses.\n  This week on the Senate floor, we have a chance to keep our \nunemployed workers afloat. It is an unemployment extension that is a \nlifeline. It is a lifeline that will help allow unemployed workers to \ncontinue looking for every job opportunity and to support their \nfamilies in that process. But ultimately we need to get these workers \ninto the boat. We need them to get good, stable jobs. That means \nsupporting our community banks, reducing the tax burden on small \nbusinesses, and expanding opportunities for health care workers and our \nreturning heroes--our veterans.\n  As I said earlier, the American people are watching us. They want us \nto have the same urgency they feel in their lives every day. They want \nto know their dinner table debates are our floor debates. They want to \nknow that creating jobs is our No. 1 priority and that we will be at \nthe back of those who are trying so hard to get back to work.\n  So I come to the floor to urge everyone to come together to pass this \nimportant extension of unemployment benefits, put politics aside for a \ncouple weeks and months, and help us all work together to create job \nopportunities and get Americans back to work.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2258-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2258-S2262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FINANCIAL REFORM\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this morning to try and set the \nrecord straight, if I can, on some of the rhetoric I have heard over \nthe last 24 hours or so regarding the financial reform efforts I have \nbeen engaged in along with my colleagues on the Senate Banking \nCommittee for the past 38 months.\n  I became chairman of the Banking Committee in January of 2007, about \n38, 39 months ago. Since that time, of course, we have held countless \nhearings and meetings to deal with the financial crisis beginning in \nJanuary and February of 2007. In fact, the very first hearings we held \nwere on the foreclosure crisis in the Nation and trying to get the \nattention of the previous administration, Secretary Paulson and others, \nto pay attention to the situation that was emerging. Our economy was \ncollapsing and too many people were losing their homes, an economic \ncatastrophe was looming, and, frankly, there was not enough attention \nbeing paid initially to this issue by the previous administration. \nNonetheless, we worked forward. So, today, we find ourselves on the \nbrink of making an effort to deal with this problem.\n  After listening to some of the rhetoric of the last 24 hours, I \nwonder if we are in not only the same Chamber in the same city but on \nthe same planet when it comes to the efforts that have been made to try \nand reach bipartisan agreement to deal with financial reform. I have \nalmost unlimited patience, as many of my colleagues know, but that \nunlimited patience is being tested by some of the comments I have \nheard. So I felt incumbent to respond this morning to some of these \naccusations about the effort being made to achieve a proposal on \nfinancial reform that might attract broad support in this Chamber, \nunlike other efforts that have been made over the past several years, \nas I have said repeatedly during the many months we have been working \non this important legislation.\n  These are complex issues. We have gone through the most serious \nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression. That is how serious this \nis. In the words of financial leaders in this country and elsewhere, we \nwere on the brink of a meltdown of the entire financial system in this \ncountry, and we came perilously close to having that occur. For those 7 \nmillion who lost their homes or the 8.5 million who have lost their \njobs, it might as well have been a financial meltdown, not to mention \nthe retirement incomes that evaporated and, of course, the loss of \nconfidence in our future, along with health care and a variety of other \nthings that have happened to working families in this country.\n  During the course of this debate, as critical as it is, of these \ncomplex matters that make up the structure of the architecture of our \nfinancial system, it is critical to the future of our economy and the \nlivelihoods of millions of middle-class Americans across this Nation \nthat this debate should not be sullied by misinformation or derailed by \nthose who would try and make it just another partisan game. Playing \npolitics with this issue is dangerous indeed. Unfortunately, the \ntalking points deployed by the Wall Street lobbyists, in an effort to \nprotect the status quo, leave my constituents and many Americans \nvulnerable to yet another economic crisis. Those arguments are littered \nwith falsehoods--outright falsehoods--that I regret to say are now \nbeing repeated by people who should know better and, frankly, do know \nbetter.\n\n[[Page S2259]]\n\n  So today and this morning I wish to set the record straight. I wish \nto start by attacking one of the wildest and, frankly, most dishonest \nobjections to this legislation, which is the notion that it is somehow \na partisan document. I consider the minority leader and the ranking \nmember of the Banking Committee to be good friends. They are patriots, \nwith whom I have worked over many years on many issues. Senator Shelby \nand I have been working together for over 1 year on these issues, and I \ncannot, for the life of me, understand how anyone can claim with a \nstraight face that what I have tried to achieve on this bill is a \npartisan effort. I have spent the last year seeking bipartisan \nconsensus.\n  In February of 2009, over 1 year ago, with the new Obama \nadministration freshly sworn in, I insisted from the very beginning \nthat Senator Shelby's staff be included in meetings with the White \nHouse and Treasury Department on all financial matters. When I had the \nopportunity to take over the chairmanship of the HELP Committee, the \ncommittee charged with the responsibility of writing the health care \nreform legislation, I chose to stay as chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, in no small part because I received commitments from Senator \nShelby and others that we would work together on this financial reform \nlegislation.\n  When I introduced a discussion draft of this proposal back in \nNovember--almost 6 months ago--Senator Shelby indicated we had \nbipartisan consensus on at least 70 percent of the bill back in \nNovember. To get closer to a full agreement, I created four bipartisan \nworking groups almost 6 months ago, each of which was charged with \nachieving real and meaningful progress in various sections of the bill. \nEven when Senator Shelby and I found areas where we could not agree, I \ncontinued to reach out to other members of the committee, including my \nfriend and colleague from Tennessee, Senator Corker, and others, \nspending weeks working to try to achieve a consensus on financial \nreform. It is not even a slight exaggeration to say we spent countless \nhours--phone calls, meetings, e-mails, discussion drafts--day after \nday, week after week, month after month, to try to get closer and \ncloser to a proposal our colleagues could support.\n  We can see the results. The bill we marked up in our committee last \nmonth was much changed from the proposal I made in November, the \ninitial discussion draft, to reflect the work that had gone on over \nthose many weeks and months and the ideas brought to the table by \ncolleagues of both parties from members of that committee and others. \nMy friends on the other side of the aisle may not like every line in \nthe bill that will now be before us in a few short days, but at the \nvery least let us not pretend the bipartisan work that produced this \nlegislation didn't happen. It did happen. That is a disservice to \nyourselves--those who make these allegations--and their good staffs who \nworked hard over these many weeks with my Democratic staff and others \nto produce this product.\n  If Members wish to vote against the bill, they can do that. That is \ntheir right to do so. They can go on record in support of leaving their \nconstituents vulnerable to more lost jobs, more foreclosures, more \nshuttered small businesses, more wiped out retirement accounts. It is \nup to each individual Member to decide for themselves that is the vote \nthey wish to cast when it comes to this effort. But the outcome of this \ndebate will, mark my words, affect the economic security of ordinary \nAmericans, and they deserve to know the truth of what has happened.\n  Today, I wish to talk about bailouts. Nobody likes them.\n  Under our proposal, they will never happen again. As the President \nsaid in his State of the Union Address, bailing out some of the large \nbanks whose own mismanagement caused the crisis was ``about as popular \nas a root canal.'' That, of course, happened under the previous \nadministration, I should note.\n  But serious legislators of both parties realized that we had no \nchoice. Our system was so broken that these companies had become too \nbig to fail. If we did nothing else, our entire economy could collapse, \nwe were told.\n  You would think that if you wanted to avoid being backed into that \ncorner again, if you wanted to avoid more bailouts, you would oppose \nefforts to protect the status quo. But Wall Street special interests \nneeded a way to defend this broken system. After all, for many of them, \nthe kind of mismanagement that costs us millions of jobs is the way \nthey pad their profits and pay their lobbyists. So they turned to Frank \nLuntz, their political strategist.\n  Let me tell you what he came up with. I will quote from Mr. Luntz's \nmemo that was leaked, I will quote from his partisan memo:\n\n       The single best way to kill this legislation is to link it \n     to the big bank bailout.\n\n  No matter what is proposed, no matter what is in the bill, no matter \nwhat protections it includes, call it a bailout. It is a naked \npolitical strategy. If it succeeds and this legislation goes down, and \nanother crisis sinks the American economy, then the next recession and \nall of the damage it will bring to the working families of this country \nwill have happened for the sake of that false talking point that Mr. \nLuntz has been proposing. I don't expect Frank Luntz to care about the \ntruth of what we are engaged in here. That is not his job. He is a \npolitical strategist. He is to provide political talking points to \npeople when you want to defeat something. I don't expect the bank \nlobbyists and special interests to care about the truth; they don't \nseem to worry about that. But the American people deserve better from \nus in this Chamber.\n  That is why I have been so dismayed over these last 24 hours to hear \nMembers of this body repeat the utter falsehood--concocted by special \ninterests whose jobs and pensions are plenty secure, thank you very \nmuch--that this bill will lead to more bailouts.\n  Frank Luntz suggested that allies of the big banks say:\n\n       If there is one thing we can all agree on, it's that the \n     bad decisions and harmful policies by Washington bureaucrats \n     that in many ways led to the economic crash must never be \n     repeated.\n\n  The minority leader, speaking yesterday, said:\n\n       If there's one thing Americans agree on when it comes to \n     financial reform, it's this: Never again should taxpayers be \n     expected to bail out Wall Street from its own mistakes. We \n     cannot allow endless taxpayer-funded bailouts for big Wall \n     Street banks. That's why we must not pass the financial \n     reform bill that's about to hit the floor.\n\n  Remember what Frank Luntz said:\n\n       The single best way to kill any legislation is to link it \n     to the big bank bailout.\n\n  It is straight from the Wall Street special interest talking points. \nThat is what they are determined to do to defeat this bill--suggest \nsomehow that there is a bailout provision in this bill. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth.\n  The bill, as drafted, ends bailouts. Nothing can be more clear in the \nlegislation. For the very first time, our Nation will have someone with \nthe job of monitoring risks to the financial system and sounding the \nalarm before those risks can take down the entire system, as it almost \ndid. The bill imposes sufficient standards on Wall Street firms that \ncreate those risks.\n  Our bill establishes a financial stability oversight council to \nmonitor risks and requires the Federal Reserve to write strict rules, \nincluding stronger requirements regarding capital, leverage, liquidity, \nand risk management on the largest financial companies, making it hard \nfor them to get too large and limiting the risk they represent. \nCracking down on the biggest players is critical to ending bailouts.\n  If a Wall Street firm does become too large or too complex and poses \na grave threat to our financial stability, the Federal Reserve has the \npower to restrict its risky activities, restrict its growth, and even \nto break up those institutions. I will repeat that. If a Wall Street \nfirm becomes too large and too complex, the Federal Reserve has the \npower under our bill to prohibit those activities, including even \nbreaking up those institutions.\n  Additionally, our bill extends oversight to dangerous nonbank \nfinancial companies, such as AIG, that could pose a risk to our \nfinancial stability, as it did.\n  It prohibits banks and other financial institutions that own banks \nfrom engaging in proprietary trading, making risky bets with money that \ndoesn't even belong to them.\n  Second, our bill eliminates the Federal Reserve's ability to prop up \nindividual institutions using what is called\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\nthe 13(3) authority, another way to stop banks from thinking that they \ncould be bailed out if in fact they engage in activities that cause \nthem to begin to fail. The Fed's lending authority is strictly \nrestricted, not expanded, as some have claimed.\n  Third, our bill sets up predictable, orderly, and safe processes for \nshutting down dangerous Wall Street firms that fail without endangering \nthe entire economy. No financial firm will ever again be ``too big to \nfail.'' Quite the opposite. We insist that the provisions be in place \nso that it can never again make the claim that they are too big to \nfail.\n  Large, complex financial companies will be required to submit plans \nfor their own shutdown--we call them living wills--if the company goes \nunder. Companies that fail to produce a realistic plan will be hit with \ntougher capital requirements, restricted in how much they can grow, and \neven can be broken up.\n  Most large financial companies would be resolved through the normal \nbankruptcy process. That is the presumption in our bill--receivership.\n  Where bankruptcy is not an option, the bill creates a mechanism for \nthe FDIC to unwind those companies. The management will be fired, \nshareholders will be wiped out, and creditors will take their losses. \nMiddle-income families on Main Street won't have to pay a penny. The \nlargest Wall Street firms would have to put up money for a $50 billion \nfund to cover the costs of liquidating the failed financial firm, and \nany shortfall will be made up by the largest and riskiest financial \nfirms. Why should the American taxpayer have to pay for unwinding these \ncompanies? They should put up the money themselves. Let them pay for \nthe unwinding that goes on. Don't charge it to the American taxpayer. \nOur bill includes those provisions.\n  Wall Street doesn't like this fund, and they are plenty content to \nlet taxpayers continue to pay the price for industry mistakes. Let me \nbe clear, despite what their apologists may claim, these funds can only \nbe used by the FDIC and only used to liquidate the failed company, not \nprop it up.\n  To review, our bill imposes tougher standards on large, risky Wall \nStreet firms. It eliminates the Federal Government's capacity to bail \nout individual companies. It requires that financial firms write their \nown shutdown plans and even pay for the liquidation process if it is \nneeded.\n  Here is what I have to say to Wall Street. If you have a better idea, \nlet's hear it. If you have other ideas, let's debate them. But if all \nyou have is black-and-white talking points that bear no relation to \nreality, don't reflect the efforts that have gone on for months to try \nto produce a proposal that might gain broad support here in this \nChamber, then get out of the way and let the serious legislators work. \nDon't write this off by quoting a political strategist's talking \npoints, when all of this effort has been made over these many months.\n  I am told by my staff--and I have dealt with 42 pieces of legislation \nin 39 months--that about 37 have become the law of the land. I made a \ndetermination as chairman to work together, wherever possible, to \nachieve common points. So my history is to try to achieve that wherever \npossible, and I take great offense at the suggestion that it has been \notherwise.\n  The outcome of this debate affects the economic security of every \nsingle American and every single American family. What we have been \nthrough, we should never have to go through again. Our bill takes steps \nto try to achieve that. It is not that we are going to stop every \neconomic crisis in the future. That would be a foolish suggestion. But \nwhat we have done is fill in the gaps that allowed this crisis to occur \nand provide tools for the coming generation so they can address future \neconomic crises and still allow for the vitality of a financial \nservices sector to produce jobs, create wealth, allow credit to flow \nand capital to form so our economy can prosper again.\n  Trying to achieve those three goals has been the hallmark of what I \nhave tried to put together with the bill, along with my colleagues on \nthe committee. I believe we have done a good job in achieving that. I \nwould be the last one to claim perfection. If people have other ideas, \nthat is what the process is for. But to castigate it and label it as \nnothing more than a partisan debate and suggest that somehow what we \nhave done here is to perpetuate ``too big to fail'' is poppycock. It is \nunfortunate that at this hour in this debate, that is all we hear from \non the other side.\n  The door is still open. We are not yet on the floor debating this \nbill. I will have meetings with Senator Shelby and others. My patience \nis running out. I have extended the hand, and I have written provisions \nin the bill to accommodate various interests. I will not continue doing \nthis if all I am getting from the other side is a suggestion that this \nis a partisan effort. We have been through it over and over on the \nfloor for the last year and a half. I think the American people are \nsick of it. They want to see us work together to achieve results that \nbenefit them, not some political party, or narrow ideology, and \ncertainly not the narrow interests on Wall Street.\n  In the coming days, I will give you a bill I think we can vote for \nand stand up and proudly support and, more importantly, one that we can \nsay to the American people we will not have to go through what we have \nbeen through in the last 2 years, and never again should another \ngeneration face the kinds of risks we did because of the gaps that \nexisted in our financial regulatory structure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire Frank Luntz memo be printed \nin the Record. I want the public to read it so they will know what we \nare up against here with this political chicanery.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    The Language of Financial Reform\n\n                    (By Dr. Frank Luntz, Jan. 2010)\n\n                      The Financial Reform Climate\n\n\n                          setting the context\n\n       This document is based on polling results and an Instant \n     Response dial session conducted after the House of \n     Representatives passed ``Financial Reform'' legislation and \n     prior to the Senate's consideration of the bill. The document \n     helps capture not just how Americans feel about the \n     ``financial crisis'' (they believe it still exists) and \n     potential reform initiative (they're against)--and how they \n     want to address the issue (carefully).\n       When it comes to the financial crisis, there is one clear \n     consensus--the crisis is a stain on the fabric of America's \n     economy that will linger for years to come. The impact of the \n     crisis is real and has reverberated throughout every part of \n     our society. Rule #1:\n       When addressing the crisis, never forget its impact on your \n     audience. Above all else, never EVER minimize the pain.\n       1. Americans are divided on the cause of the crisis. The \n     consequences of the crisis may be undeniable, but its cause \n     is debatable.\n       --To conservatives: government policies caused the bubble \n     and its ultimate crash. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal \n     Reserve, and the Community Reinvestment Act all had a role in \n     the catastrophe. The government inflated economic bubbles \n     with easy credit policies. Interest rates were kept \n     intentionally low. Low-income families were encouraged to \n     become homeowners despite the knowledge that many would never \n     be able to pay them back. Government bought and backed these \n     subprime loans, essentially encouraging brokers to find more \n     subprime clients--risk be damned.\n       --To liberals: the roots of the crisis lie in Big Business \n     and the marketplace. Mortgage companies peddled adjustable \n     rate mortgages without ever explaining the future costs. \n     Credit card companies flooded college campuses with high \n     interest credit cards. Wall Street firms traded mortgage-\n     backed securities and created credit default swaps that \n     played key roles in the economic calamity. Contracts written \n     in legalese, coupled with the risks of adjustable rate \n     mortgages, were never explained to the average consumer--\n     perhaps intentionally. Those that blame the market are \n     passionate about the need for more reform.\n       --But to a majority of Americans believe that individuals \n     who ran up their credit cards and took out mortgages they \n     couldn't afford are also responsible for the calamity that \n     ensued.\n       What industries bear the brunt of the blame? Home mortgage \n     companies (33%) and banks (31%) are seen as primarily \n     responsible. But it is not the companies so much as the \n     leadership of the companies that are to blame. . .\n       But the largest percentage of Americans believes ``all of \n     them'' played a role in today's economic conditions.\n       2. You must acknowledge the need for reform that ensures \n     this NEVER happens again. Despite the different perspectives \n     on the causes of the crash, there is an agreement that the \n     crisis must be addressed--that changes must be made so the \n     mistakes that led to this point are never repeated. The \n     status quo is not an option. The system failed\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\n     us--all of us--and the causes of the failure must be \n     corrected.\n       3. Now, more than ever, the American people question the \n     government's ability to effectively address the issue. \n     Billions in handouts to Wall Street. A stimulus bill that \n     isn't creating jobs. Cash for Clunkers. Health Care. A \n     ``Credit Card Bill of Rights'' that increases fees and \n     interest rates on consumers. The American people believe \n     Washington has gone wrong, and these legislative initiatives \n     have become symbols of Washington's inability to do anything \n     right. A majority of both Republican and Democrats believe \n     that. . .\n\n\n                            words that work\n\n       If there is one thing we can all agree on, it's that the \n     bad decisions and harmful policies by Washington bureaucrats \n     that in many ways led to the economic crash must never be \n     repeated.\n       This is your critical advantage. Washington's incompetence \n     is the common ground on which you can build support.\n       Ordinarily, calling for a new government program ``to \n     protect consumers'' would be extraordinarily popular. But \n     these are not ordinary times. The American people are not \n     just saying ``no.'' They are saying ``hell no'' to more \n     government agencies, more bureaucrats, and more legislation \n     crafted by special interests.\n       Incredibly, these results are PRIOR to efforts to educate \n     voters about the inherent problems of the legislation. One \n     reason why initial support for more government action is \n     rooted in the simple belief that government cannot \n     effectively regulate the financial markets at any level . . .\n       4. Public outrage about the bailout of banks and Wall \n     Street is a simmering time bomb set to go off on Election \n     Day. To put it mildly, the public dislikes taxpayer bailouts \n     of private companies. Actually, they HATE it.\n       In fact, a vote in favor of creating a permanent bailout \n     fund of private companies is like committing political hari-\n     kari. Frankly, the single best way to kill any legislation is \n     to link it to the Big Bank Bailout.\n\n\n                            WORDS THAT WORK\n\n       Taxpayer-funded bailouts reward bad behavior. Taxpayers \n     should not be held responsible for the failure of big \n     business any longer. If a business is going to fail, no \n     matter how big, let it fail.\n       5. The public is angriest about lobbyist loopholes. Part of \n     public perception that Washington cannot do anything right is \n     the belief that lobbyists write most of the bills. The \n     American people are tired of add-ons, earmarks, and backroom \n     deals--but they are mad as hell at ``lobbyist loopholes.'' \n     This bill is riddled with such loopholes. You must put \n     proponents of the legislation on the defensive, forcing them \n     to attempt to justify the ``lobbyist loopholes'' and \n     exemptions placed in the bill:\n       --Why were pawnbrokers exempted?\n       --What about car dealers?\n       --Vegas casinos and their credit lines?\n       The power of this argument cannot be underestimated. When \n     participants in our dial sessions heard that the casinos and \n     pawnbrokers were exempted from the legislation, someone \n     remarked, ``We have become the Roman Senate.''\n       Highlight the exemptions. Broadcast them. Remind them, \n     ``The legislation is filled with lobbyist loopholes that \n     exclude certain wealthy, powerful industries from \n     regulations.'' As Churchill would say, that statement is the \n     ``soft white underbelly.'' When the participants were \n     presented a list of nearly a dozen objections to the bill, \n     the lobbyist loopholes blew away virtually every other \n     argument against the legislation.\n       6. You must be an agent of change. We have spent so much \n     time in this analysis on general economic perceptions because \n     that's what you need to address. You have to be on the side \n     of change. Always. The financial crisis is not a theoretical \n     economic textbook concern. The pain felt by the crisis is \n     real and omnipresent. Retirement funds were depleted. Homes \n     were foreclosed. Jobs were eliminated. The status quo is \n     unacceptable. However, it's wrong to assume government can \n     correct the problem without addressing its role in the \n     crisis, yet that is what Congress is trying to do. What to \n     say? ``It addresses market excesses but keeps government \n     excesses in place.'' The American consumer wants more easily \n     understood contract language so that consumers have all the \n     information they need.\n       7. Demand accountability--government accountability. \n     Despite creating economic conditions comparative to the Great \n     Depression, it is important to ask some basic questions--What \n     government regulator lost their job for their hand in the \n     crisis? What government policies were changed? What laws were \n     repealed? The obvious answer is none.\n\n\n                            WORDS THAT WORK\n\n       We don't need another Federal government agency. We don't \n     need bigger government. What we need is a better approach \n     that promotes accountability, responsibility and effective \n     oversight.\n       Yet, Congress is poised to add another Washington agency \n     with more Washington bureaucrats on top of existing laws and \n     regulations. In fact, the proponents of the new government \n     agency and regulations are the same members of Congress who \n     created and supported the housing bubble.\n\n\n                            WORDS THAT WORK\n\n       The architects of failure are now designing the rescue. \n     Many of the same members of Congress responsible for the \n     legislation that helped create the housing bubble and the \n     Wall Street financial crisis are now attempting to create \n     another new government agency with an unlimited budget and \n     almost unlimited regulatory powers.\n       I'm sorry to say this but they don't know what they're \n     doing. They have gotten it wrong time and time again and now \n     they want to do it yet again.\n       The perceived incompetence of Washington extends to its \n     leadership. Barney Frank, the Chairman of the House Financial \n     Services Committee, is an example. Frank's favorable rating \n     is 13%. His unfavorable rating is 30% (though a majority \n     don't give him any rating at all--so don't make him the \n     enemy. Washington is the enemy.)\n       8. More bloated government bureaucracy is not the solution. \n     We're witnessing out-of-control federal spending. The \n     Government takeover of health care and other industries has \n     Americans questioning the competence of government. They want \n     smarter solutions, not more of the same. ``A new agency with \n     new bureaucrats is not change we can believe in.'' It's not \n     change at all. As our dial session participants agreed, \n     ``It's another agency to clean up a mess from a different \n     agency.''\n\n\n                            WORDS THAT WORK\n\n       The financial crisis hurt all of us. Homes were lost. Jobs \n     were destroyed. Businesses closed. There is enough blame to \n     go around. We need a solution to the problem, not more of the \n     same. Creating another costly government bureaucracy on top \n     of existing bureaucracy isn't a solution--it helped cause the \n     problem. This time, let's get it right.\n       9. Devil is in the details. Every bill passed by Congress \n     is larded up with pork, handouts, and earmarks. The American \n     people have lost faith in Congress, and no matter how good a \n     bill sounds, they want to know ``What is in the fine print?''\n       10. Caution: Unintended consequences ahead. The government \n     caused the Savings and Loan crisis by changing the rules. \n     Congress jacked up fees and interest rates on consumers after \n     enacting the ``Credit Card Bill of Rights.'' What will be the \n     effects and impact of the CFPA? How will small business be \n     affected? Will choices be limited? Will consumer fees be \n     impacted? Evidence suggests the answer is definitely ``yes''.\n\n                           Language Findings\n\n       11. Enforcement of current law trumps creation of new laws. \n     Despite the need for reform, the public believes real reform \n     means ensuring current laws are enforced rather than adding \n     another layer of agencies, laws, regulations, and red tape on \n     top of the existing agencies, laws, regulations, and red \n     tape.\n\n\n                            WORDS THAT WORK\n\n       We don't need more laws. We need better enforcement of \n     current laws. We don't need more bureaucrats. We need the \n     people in charge to do their jobs as they were meant to be \n     done. We don't need layers and layers of additional federal \n     bureaucracy. What we need is to instill accountability, \n     responsibility and effective oversight to what is being done \n     already.\n       12. The bailout provisions get the most visceral reaction. \n     It is not often you come across an issue where people of all \n     political stripes come together so stridently on an issue. \n     Taxpayer bailouts of CEOs and companies are such an issue.\n\n\n                            WORDS THAT WORK\n\n       Bailouts for Wall Street. Government takeovers of insurance \n     companies. Trillions of taxpayer dollars to bail out CEOs and \n     their risky investment schemes. And now Congress is preparing \n     to enact legislation to pass a law with $4 trillion more for \n     more bailouts. Should people who write the financial reform \n     laws be the same ones who helped cause the crisis? Should \n     taxpayers be punished and the big banks and credit card \n     companies be rewarded? The time has come to take a stand. \n     Oppose the big bank bailout bill.\n       13. ``Bureaucrats'' are worse than ``bureaucracies.'' While \n     Americans don't like bureaucracy, they loathe bureaucrats \n     even more. In fact, America's disdain of bureaucrats is \n     almost as high as Americans' dislike and mistrust of \n     lobbyists.\n       14. Americans want to end the legalese and confusion in \n     contracts. The strongest argument in favor of the CFPA is the \n     claim the agency would somehow end confusing contracts \n     written by lawyers in language only lawyers can understand. \n     When was the last time a government agency made things easier \n     to comprehend?\n\n\n                            WORDS THAT WORK\n\n       We must require greater transparency and more easily \n     understood contract language so that consumers have all the \n     information they need.\n       15. Just the facts, ma'am. In the testing of the ads and \n     other communications, it is clear that Americans want more \n     than just red meat rhetoric. You have to give them two \n     concrete facts to prove your case--or you will be just \n     another special interest group playing politics with their \n     lives. Two facts. Two statistics. Two clear-cut statements of \n     evidence.\n       16. Personalize the impact. It's small business owners, and \n     not small businesses, that will be harmed by this \n     legislation. Yes, they recognize small business as a key \n     component of the economy, but stronger arguments against \n     creation of the CFPA lie elsewhere. Americans want to support \n     small businesses, but are more willing to support a person \n     who owns a small business. Make it personal.\n       17. It's not ``reform.''--This is not a reform bill. It is \n     the ``Stop the Big Bank Bailout bill.'' This is important.\n\n[[Page S2262]]\n\n       18. Small business ownership is about the American Dream. \n     The most popular images of small business owners both \n     projected optimism with signs saying ``grand opening'' or \n     ``open.''\n\n\n                            WORDS THAT WORK\n\n       Owning a small business is part of the American Dream and \n     Congress should make it easier to be an entrepreneur. But the \n     Financial Reform bill and the creation of the CFPA makes it \n     harder to be a small business owner because it will choke off \n     credit options to small business owners. That will make it \n     harder to start a new company and harder to expand an \n     existing one.\n       19. No surprise here. The strongest image ad we tested \n     pertained to the bailout provisions and the ``lobbyist \n     loopholes'' for the casino industry.\n       20. The Final Word. The department store Syms used the \n     slogan ``an educated consumer is our best customer.'' We \n     could easily say an educated citizen is the biggest opponent \n     or, your biggest ally against the creation of the Financial \n     Reform bill and the CFPA.\n\n\n                              Words to Use\n\n       Accountability, Transparency & Oversight, Lobbyist \n     Loopholes, Enforcement of Current Laws, Bureaucrats, Wasteful \n     Washington Spending, Never Again, Government Failures and \n     Incompetence, Let's Help Small Businesses, Big Bank Bailout \n     Bill, Bloated Bureaucracy, Fine Print, Unintended \n     Consequences, Special Interests, Hard Working Taxpayers, \n     Another Washington Agency, Unlimited Regulatory Powers, Devil \n     Is in the Details, Red Tape.\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor several times \nnow to discuss the problem of too big to fail, which I believe is the \nmost critical issue to be addressed in any financial reform bill.\n  Financial institutions that are too big to fail are so large, so \ncomplex, and so interconnected that they cannot be allowed to fail nor \nfollow the normal corporate bankruptcy process because of the dire \nthreat that would pose to the entire financial system.\n  The largest six bank holding companies--Bank of America, JPMorgan \nChase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley--are \ncertainly too big to fail. The term may also cover a larger set of \ninstitutions.\n  After all, last year's most vaunted stress tests of the largest bank \nholding companies covered 19 institutions, and even that exercise did \nnot include many other systemically significant nonbank financial \ninstitutions, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, insurance \ncompanies, derivatives clearinghouses, and hedge funds.\n  While many in government and industry want to eliminate the term \n``too big to fail,'' the fact is these too-big-to-fail financial \ninstitutions are bigger, more powerful, and more interconnected now \nthan ever before.\n  Only 15 years ago, the six largest U.S. banks had assets equal to 17 \npercent of overall gross domestic product. The six largest U.S. banks \nnow have total assets estimated in excess of 63 percent of gross \ndomestic product. That goes from 17 percent of GDP just 15 years ago to \n63 percent of GDP now.\n  While some still argue there are benefits to having very large \nfinancial conglomerates--and I am sure there are--virtually everyone \nagrees the problem of too big to fail needs to be address. The \ndisagreement is how this be done.\n  I was interested to hear Senator McConnell on the Senate floor \nyesterday say we must never use taxpayer money again to bail out too-\nbig-to-fail institutions. But no one wants to do that. No one is \nthinking about that. No one is planning to do that.\n  The question is, What is the solution to prevent these institutions \nfrom failing in the first place? The other party has put forward no \nsolution, and doing nothing is by far the worst solution of all.\n  The minority leader came to the floor today and said the bill before \nthe Senate is good for Wall Street and bad for Main Street. That is \nsimply an astounding statement to make. Main Street wants Congress to \nact. Main Street wants Congress to ensure that Wall Street never \nengages in reckless behavior again. Yet what does the minority leader \noffer?\n  Despite the experience of Lehman Brothers, the minority leader \napparently believes we should do nothing and simply stand back in the \nfuture and let these megabanks fail when they take risks that go wrong.\n  The minority leader said yesterday:\n\n       The way to solve this problem is to let the people who made \n     the mistakes pay for them. We won't solve this problem until \n     the biggest banks are allowed to fail.\n\n  Astounding. His answer is, the resolution of too-big-to-fail banks \nneeds to be dealt with through the bankruptcy process. In my view, that \napproach is dangerous and irresponsible.\n  If we do nothing and wait for another crisis, future Presidents--\nwhether Republican or Democratic--will face the same choices as \nPresident Bush: Whether to let spiraling, interconnected, too-big-to-\nfail institutions, such as AIG, Citigroup, and others, collapse in a \ncontagion, sending the economy into a depression or step in ahead of \nbankruptcy and save them with taxpayer money.\n  If that happens, the choice of allowing bankruptcy will mean \ntremendous economic pain on Main Street America. So some Congress in \nthe future will similarly be faced with another TARP-like decision, \nwhich in the fall of 2008 many in both parties believed they had no \nchoice but to support, including the minority leader.\n  Relying on bankruptcy law is not the answer. The approach by many \nconservatives and those on the other side of the aisle is to simply let \nthem fail and let U.S. bankruptcy law--where shareholders get wiped out \nand creditors take a haircut--reimpose the discipline in the financial \nsystem that was lacking in the runup to the crisis.\n  For example, Peter Wallison and David Skeel have argued in the Wall \nStreet Journal:\n\n       The real choice before the Senate is between the FDIC and \n     the bankruptcy courts. It should be no contest, because \n     bankruptcy courts do have the experience and expertise to \n     handle a large-scale financial failure. This was demonstrated \n     most recently by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.\n\n  If bankruptcy was a cure in Lehman Brothers, it was one that almost \nkilled the patient. When former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson decided \nto let Lehman Brothers go into bankruptcy, our global credit markets \nfroze and creditors and counterparties panicked and headed for the \nhills. Instead of imposing market discipline, it only prompted more \nbailouts and almost brought down the entire financial system. It \nultimately took 18 months to close out the case on Lehman Brothers, an \neternity for financial institutions that mark to market and fund their \nbalance sheets on an interday basis.\n  Bankruptcy is an even more unattractive option when one considers \nthat Lehman was an investment bank, while today's megabanks operate \nunder the bank holding company umbrella. It is virtually impossible to \nhave an integrated resolution of a large and complex bank holding \ncompany. The bank subsidiary would go into FDIC resolution, the \ninsurance affiliates would go into State liquidation procedures, the \nsecurities affiliate would go into chapter 7, while other affiliates \nand overall holding companies would go into chapter 11.\n  A plan this unwieldy is no plan at all. In fact, the only way to \ntruly eliminate the problem with too-big-to-fail banks is for Congress \nto act. It is true that I believe we should go further than the current \nbill. I would break these big banks apart, thus limiting their size and \nleverage. Given the consequences of failing to do enough to prevent \nanother financial crisis, the safest thing to do today is for Congress \nto put an end to too big to fail. If you believe these megabanks are \ntoo big, if you reject the choice of bankruptcy that will lead to a \nrecession or depression, then breaking them up is the logical answer. \nThat is the only way that greatly diminishes the future probability of \nanother financial disaster. The Great Depression of the 1930s must be \navoided at all cost.\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\n  Two years ago, permitting Lehman Brothers to enter bankruptcy brought \nabout the Great Recession, the most painful economic downturn this \ncountry has seen since the Great Depression. If we were to let other \ninstitutions fall into bankruptcy, adopting the minority leader's \napproach, the horrors our economy would have faced would make the \nrealities of the past 2 years pale in comparison.\n  I certainly don't want to rely on bankruptcy to break the boom-bust-\nbailout cycle. I believe Congress should break the cycle today. We \nshould not follow an abdication of regulatory responsibility with an \nabdication of democratic government. As representatives of the people \nmost hurt by the financial crisis, Congress should act decisively to \nensure that we benefit again from decades of financial stability, not \ndo nothing, which most assuredly would leave us to live on the \nprecipice of financial disaster, as the minority leader would have us \ndo.\n  We need a full and straightforward debate in the Senate about what \nCongress must do. In my view, the mere existence of too-big-to-fail \ninstitutions perpetuates a long cycle of boom, bust, bailout. Instead \nof hopelessly trying to impose order and discipline in a chaotic \ncrisis, we need to clearly, decisively, and preemptively deal with the \nproblem of too big to fail now.\n  As Senator Levin pointed out this week, when he kicked off the \nPermanent Subcommittee's hearings on its investigation of the financial \ncrisis, there are many eerie parallels between this crisis and the one \nin the late 1920s and early 1930s. In both cases, bankers were derelict \nin their duties, while drawn to disruptive and excessive speculation, \nfueled in part by their compensation arrangements. Does that sound \nfamiliar? Bankers were derelict in their duties, while drawn to \ndisruptive and excessive speculation, fueled in part by their \ncompensation arrangements.\n  In the 1930s, in response to these problems, we built an enduring \nregulatory framework that put our entire financial system on stable \nfooting for decades. We simply cannot afford another financial \nmeltdown. The choice is clear. But it is also clear that the worst \nthing we can do is to take the dangerous risk of doing nothing. To me, \nthe choice that is best for the American people is clear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I also rise to discuss financial reform \nand, to be blunt, to try to set the record straight about some \nmisleading statements that have been made on this floor about both the \nprocess and the substance of the bill that the Banking Committee \nreported out recently.\n  Under Chairman Dodd's leadership and working with ranking minority \nmember Senator Shelby, I have worked hard, since coming to the Senate, \nto understand the root causes of the crisis we are only now beginning \nto emerge from economically but to recognize that we have to have a \nrobust solution in place to make sure we are never again confronted \nwith the type of crisis and the lack of preparation this Nation faced \nback in the fall of 2008.\n  I also come to this body, as you know, as someone who spent an awful \nlot of time around the capital markets. Quite candidly, I will put my \nfree market, procapitalist credentials up against anybody's in this \nbody. But I come to the floor as well as someone who has tried to \nrecognize that the financial crisis--perhaps more than any other issue \nwe have addressed--doesn't have a Democratic or a Republican root of \norigin, nor does it have a partisan solution set. We have to recognize \nthat, perhaps on this piece of legislation more than ever, we have to \nhave a bipartisan basis to establish a long-term financial framework \nfor the next hundred years.\n  I am very proud of the fact that we have worked so far in a \nbipartisan way. I have particularly appreciated, over the last year, \nthe partnership I have built with Senator Corker of Tennessee, where we \nboth recognize that while we both have backgrounds in business and both \nhave experience and exposure to the capital markets, there is a great \ndeal of complexity in trying to rewrite the financial rules in the \nsense that it will be not only for this country but because the rest of \nthe world will follow what America does, for the whole world. So it \nwill require a great deal of humility and a recognition that we have \nmore to learn.\n\n  Because of that, Senator Corker and I, starting early in 2009, began \nholding a series of seminars, in fact, where we brought in established \nfinancial leaders and invited members of both parties to come and learn \nwith us as we tried to put in place rules and regulations governing the \nfinancial system. While I have been disappointed, particularly by the \nRepublican leader's comments yesterday, I am not naive. I still believe \nthere is a path to a bipartisan bill. What we need to do is to simply \nlower the rhetoric and do what is needed for the American people.\n  Let's put in place a robust set of rules and a robust regime of \nreform that will ensure that never again will the American taxpayer \nhave to bail out firms that are too big to fail. While there were \ndifferences that we had on how we approached health care reform, this \nis one area where--whether it is a liberal blogger group or a tea party \nconvention--there is a unanimity of opinion that never again should the \ntaxpayers be put at risk because of the financial interconnectedness of \nlarge firms.\n  Soon, the Senate will consider the bill Chairman Dodd has put \ntogether. While there are bits and pieces that different folks will \ndisagree with, this is a strong bill that vastly improves regulation \nand the structure of our financial markets. Let me repeat that Senator \nDodd has put together a strong bill. One part of the bill Senator \nCorker and I have been particularly engaged in deals with systemic risk \nin ending the notion of too big to fail. That was the subject yesterday \nof some wildly inaccurate statements on this floor, which I am here to \naddress.\n  I have to admit I am deeply invested in this section, and that \ninvestment comes in no small part because of the months of work Senator \nCorker and I put into this area. Let me acknowledge at the front end \nthat there are parts of this section that both Senator Corker and I \nwill want to change and amend. Those changes and amendments we would \nprobably reach agreement on in perhaps 5 or 10 minutes, but the basic \nstructure we set up is one I believe will lead to meaningful financial \nreform.\n  Now, let's go to what we are talking about. We recognized at the \noutset that never again could we allow the financial system and the \ninterconnectedness of this financial system to come to the brink of \ncrisis and, in effect, the regulatory system and the legal system have \nno recourse and rules on how we deal with an impending crisis.\n  One of the things we recognized at the outset was that in the past \nthere was very little collaboration and coordination between different \nregulators. You might have a Prudential supervisor who is looking at \nthe depository institution and having one view of an institution; and \nyou might have the regulator looking at the bank holding structure and \nhaving another view. Because these complex institutions may also have \nsecurity aspects, the SEC is over here. But there was no coordinated \nplace where this collaborative view, beyond the stovepipes and beyond \nthe silos, could all come together and recognize that while the \ninstitution's single actions in a single sector might not pose a \nsystemic risk, that in toto these risks, when aggregated together, put \nour financial system in jeopardy.\n  So what do we propose? Along with Senator Corker and experts from the \nindustry, we propose creating a Systemic Risk Council that would, in \neffect, be the early warning system for our overall financial system to \nspot these large, systematically important institutions and, in effect, \nput some speed bumps in their path.\n  I may not even agree with some of the Members of my own side of the \naisle that we ought to go out proactively and break up these \ninstitutions just because they are too large. Size, in and of itself, \nwas not the problem. It was the interconnectedness of their activities \nand the fact that if you started to pull on the string of some of these \nactivities, the effect that had basically collapsed the whole house of \ncards. It was not size alone, it was interconnectedness and recognizing \nhow to spot that interconnectedness at the front end, and putting some \nspeed bumps on these systemically large institutions that is important.\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\n  One of the things we found was that oftentimes the regulators did not \nhave current, real-time data on the extent of these transactions and \nthis interconnectedness. So a part of the bill that has received very \nlittle attention is the creation of the Office of Financial Research, \nwhich will aggregate, on a daily basis, all the status of transactions \nof all these institutions and allow us to have at least the \ntransparency at the regulator level to know what is going on and allow \nthe regulators never again to say: Well, the last piece of data we had \nwas the last quarterly report. This information will flow up to the \nSystemic Risk Council, and the Systemic Risk Council will then be able \nto put in place what I call speed bumps on these systematically large \ninstitutions.\n  Increase capital. One of the questions that comes back time and again \nfrom financial experts, we need to increase the capital reserve levels \nof many of these large institutions. We have to look at their liquidity \nability. In many cases the institutions that failed during the crisis \nwere not insolvent but there was a rush because of fear in the system \nand the liquidity crisis this caused, so how do we be sure we use \nliquidity in a better way?\n  Leverage, traditional additional financial institutions--I look at \nour neighbors in Canada, about a 20-to-1 leverage ratio. We saw on some \nof the off-balance sheet operations not 10- or 20-to-1 traditional \nratios, but 50- or 100-to-1 leverage ratios.\n  We put in place as well something that has been advocated by folks at \nNew York Fed--it originally comes out of the University of Chicago--a \nwhole new set of financial structure in these large institutions that \nwill convert to equity in the precursor, before a crisis takes place. \nIn effect, shareholders will be diluted by this contingent capital \nrequirement, putting again more pressure on management not to make \nundue risks.\n  We believe these speed bumps, while they may not prevent any future \ncrisis, will be huge impediments to these large systemically risky \ninstitutions taking undue risks and outrageous actions.\n  We have also put a new requirement in place, one that again has not \ngotten a lot of review. We will literally require the management of \nthese large institutions to put in place their own funeral plans, their \nown plans on how they will unwind their institutions through an orderly \nbankruptcy process.\n  I believe there were large systemically important institutions in the \nfall of 2008 that in effect came to the regulators and in effect said \nwe are so big and interconnected that we do not know how to unwind \nourselves.\n  Never again should we allow that to happen. We allow the regulators \nto work, and in effect bless the funeral plans these systemically large \ninstitutions will put in place.\n  We think we have put in place these appropriate barriers that will \nrestrict some of the unduly risky activities from these large \ninstitutions, but you cannot predict and cannot foresee every crisis. \nSo what we need to do is set a framework on how we would address the \ncrisis if these speed bumps and this early warning system does not \nfully function. I do not, actually, candidly, completely agree with my \ncolleague from Delaware. I do believe we need a strong, robust \nbankruptcy process that gives predictability to investors so they know \nwhat will happen through the normal dissolution of a firm that has made \nmistakes in the marketplace. We need to ensure that bankruptcy becomes \nthe normal default process. Again, as I mentioned, having these large \nfirms write their own funeral plans, write their own bankruptcy plans \nthat have to be approved by the regulators, will give us guidance on \nthat path.\n  But we also have to realize when there may be a management team that \ndoes not see the handwriting on the wall or when a firm is, even with \nall of these checks, falling into the potential of its failure causing \nsystemic risk, we still have to have the ability to act.\n  Let me state very clearly, the resolution process that was put in the \nDodd bill, no rational management team would ever elect to choose \nbecause resolution will not lead to conservatorship, resolution will \nlead to receivership and extermination of the firm. The firm's common \nshare equity will be wiped out, the firm's management will be wiped \nout--resolution will never be chosen as a preferred route. Bankruptcy \nwill be the preferred route.\n  Even in that case, we still put additional protections in place so \nthat no future administration, having seen the blowback from the public \non using resolution in 2008--I cannot imagine any future administration \nactually wanting to use this mechanism, but to ensure, again--Senator \nCorker and I spent a great deal of time on this--that we have, again, \nprotections so resolution is not misused, we put very strict criteria \nin before it can be implemented. We require three keys, in effect, to \nbe turned simultaneously--in effect the nuclear option analogy of \ndifferent keys being turned before this tool could be used.\n  We require the Chair of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the \nTreasury Secretary in consultation with the President to all agree that \nwe have to act, to move a firm into resolution rather than going \nthrough bankruptcy.\n  But that, again, is not all. Senator Corker, I think rightfully, \npointed out that we need, in case there were an overly aggressive \nadministration, a judicial check as well. So we put an additional \njudicial check in place before resolution could be implemented--\nresolution only as the last resort, only as a path that makes sure that \nthe parts of this systemically important firm can be transferred to \nsome other existing entity, not preserved. The firm will be wiped out, \nbut the functions that are important do not bring down the overall \nfinancial system.\n  One of the most curious comments of the Republican leader yesterday \nwas the critique that, if you invoke resolution, the question becomes \nwhere is the money going to come from and who is going to pay for it? \nWhat I found very curious in the Republican leader's comments yesterday \nwas that we--and this was by no means set in stone--put in place a $50 \nbillion fund that would be prefunded by the industry; not the $150 \nbillion that was in the House bill that could rightfully create moral \nhazard, but in effect a dollar amount up front. It could go down lower. \nThat would basically keep the lights on at these institutions until the \nFDIC could go out and, in effect, borrow against the unencumbered \nassets of this firm to get the real dollars in place to keep the \nresolution process going in an appropriately functioning way.\n  Is $50 billion the right number? It may not be. Reasonable people can \ndisagree; $25 billion might be the right number. There might be other \npaths. Senator Corker and I worked on the notion of a trust that could \nbe created. But what I find curious is no one in the financial sector \nthat we have spoken to thinks this dollar amount is a bailout. No one \nin the financial sector has said this will be an adequate amount of \ncapital to resolve a whole crisis. The funding to resolve the whole \ncrisis will come from the ability we give the FDIC to borrow against \nthe unencumbered assets.\n  If there is a better way to get there, we are all for it. At least I \ncan say for my side, I am willing to look at any other option. But what \nI find curious is, I believe if we had not put up this industry \nprefunded amount, in effect a bridge until we can actually get the FDIC \nprocess in place, we would hear criticisms, at least from some, saying \nnot putting up any industry prefunding would allow taxpayer exposure. \nOne of the things we want to make sure is that taxpayers, again, are \nnever, ever exposed to the kind of risk that took place in 2008.\n  I would also add that whatever these prefunds, trust instruments, or \neven the funding that would come from borrowing against the \nunencumbered assets, we need to buy a little time so it is not done in \na haphazard way so any of these funds will be ultimately recouped after \nthe crisis from the industry based on those institutions that \nbenefited, those institutions that also were part of the causation.\n  Again, let me stress all of these funds, whatever will be repaid--and \nagain whatever funds that are invested in these institutions in the \ninterim will not go in, as what happened in 2008, as common equity as \nan effort to, in effect, prop up the systemically important firms. But \nit will go in as, in effect, top in the creditor process, debtor-in-\npossession financing.\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\n  Did we get this perfect? No, perhaps not. There are ways, again, that \nwe can improve. But the framework we put in place, the almost uniform \nresponse we have received, has been we have taken a gigantic step \ntoward ending too big to fail in a rational, thoughtful approach.\n  I see my colleague, the Senator from Tennessee, has arrived on the \nfloor. I again compliment him for his work, for the fact both of us \nsaid at the outset for neither of us was this religion. We just need to \nget it right. If we have to ruffle a few feathers on both sides of the \naisle so that never again are the American taxpayers put in the \nposition they were in 2008, then so be it.\n  I appreciate the good work of the Senator from Tennessee on this \neffort. I appreciate our working together on the preference toward \nbankruptcy, on the recognition that we have to have that judicial \ncheck, that we cannot go out and grab firms willy-nilly that are not \ndepository, that are systemically important. I think we have taken \ngiant steps forward.\n  I ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to lower the \nrhetoric a bit, to recognize this can and still should be a place where \nthis Senate can work in a bipartisan fashion to put in place a set of \nrules so we can, with the appropriate speed bumps in our financial \nsystem for those firms that are systemically important--that we do put \nin financial rules of the road for the 21st century, that we do allow \nAmerica to continue to be the financial capital of the world and the \ninnovation in financial products capital of the world. I think we can \nstill get there.\n  I look forward to work not only with my friend from Tennessee but \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to get it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2265-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \nwill be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I appreciate it. I had not planned to come \nto the floor today, but my great friend, Senator Warner from Virginia, \nis here. I did want to clarify a couple of things. I did not hear all \nof his comments.\n  I very much appreciate the partnership we have had, the work we have \nbeen able to do together. I think what is happening on this financial \nregulation bill is a lot like what happened during the health care \ndebate in many ways. There is something that is being focused on. Some \nof it is sort of being blown out of proportion.\n  I did want to clarify something. Senator Warner spent a lot of time \ntalking about a couple of titles in the bill that Senator Dodd has put \nforth. There are other places in this bill that do, in fact, create an \nopportunity for large institutions that fail to continue on. Treasury \ngot involved in this bill a couple of weeks before--about a week before \nit came to committee. There are some loopholes in this bill that give \nTreasury and the FDIC the ability to allow large institutions to \ncontinue on without failing. My sense is the Senator from Virginia \nknows what those are. My sense is the Senator from Connecticut, who is \nthe chairman of the committee, knows what those are. And my sense is \nthat on those topics--and they do exist, so criticisms about the Dodd \nbill allowing potentially creation of loopholes for large institutions \nnot to go through an orderly liquidation or bankruptcy, are valid. But \nthe fact is I think we can fix those in about 5 minutes.\n  My point is I think everyone understands what Treasury did. I think \neveryone understands what the FDIC did. I think we can come to a \nconclusion in solving that very quickly. But I wanted to clarify that \nwas not part of the title that Senator Warner came up with.\n  The focus, then, has been on this $50 billion fund. I think Senator \nWarner eloquently talked about the fact this was a lot of debate. The \nFDIC wanted $50 billion as a debtor-in-possession fund to be operating, \nto figure out what the assets of these firms were worth before they \nsold them off. Treasury wanted no fund.\n  My guess is that at the end of the day, on one hand you are \nprotecting taxpayers more fully, on the other hand you are not--but my \nguess is, the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Connecticut \nmight drop that in about 5 minutes--not that the Senator from Virginia \nis actually advocating, he is just trying to solve that problem. My \npoint is I think that is something that in about 5 minutes could be \nsolved.\n  So I do think what Senator Warner has said is true; that is, the \nrhetoric around this, an issue that could be dealt with literally in \nabout 5 minutes, is probably overheated. The fact is, what we need to \ndo is figure out a way to focus on this issue in an intelligent way.\n  I think that, as the Senator from Virginia mentioned, people on both \nextremes want to make sure that if a large institution in this country \nfails, it is just like the small institutions in this country--they go \nout of business. And I think we are united on that. Are there some \nflaws that exist? Yes. Did the bill get a little sideways at the end? \nYes. But do people understand the way we can deal with this in an \nintelligent, thoughtful way and fix that? Yes.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Virginia would wish to not maybe get \ninto specifics but agree that there are some flaws that need to be \ncorrected, but we know what they are, and they can be corrected pretty \nquickly, can they not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me just acknowledge that we may--the Senator from \nTennessee and I may differ slightly on how large some of the things the \nTreasury and FDIC put in at the end--because clearly one of the things \nthat I think the Senator from Tennessee--and we can very quickly get \ninto the weeds, but the weeds are important on this--the so-called 13-3 \nauthority of the Fed would no longer be used for specific institutions, \nbut the ability to help supplement around a liquidity crisis so that we \ndon't have firms move from a liquidity crisis into a solvency crisis \nwas an important tool, but it was perhaps misused in the past in terms \nof targeted at specific firms rather than issue-wide.\n  There are certain other aspects that I believe can be corrected, but \nthe overriding point that I think Senator Corker and I both want to \nmake is I\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\nthink we put together, at least in title I and title II--and I think \nthere has been good work done in other parts of this bill as well, but \nin title I and title II, systemic risk, too big to fail resolution--we \nhave put the framework in place that while some on both ends of the \npolitical extremes may be attacking, the overwhelming response has been \nthat this is a good framework. Like any piece of legislation, it needs \nsome fine-tuning, but the fine-tuning ought to be preserving this \nframework, perhaps moving back from some of the pieces the FDIC and \nTreasury put in place. But we can get there, and this is too important \nto allow this piece of legislation to be drawn by the aisle that \nseparates this body into Republican and Democratic camps. We need to \nput a piece of legislation and solution in place that sets the \nfinancial framework and predictability for the next century, and I \nthink we have gone a long way toward doing that.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to speak for 60 more seconds and \nthen stop. I thank the Senator from Montana and the Senator from \nFlorida for allowing me to do this. I want to be clear and say we have \nhad a great partnership, numbers of us have. Some of the claims in this \nbill about preserving too big to fail are legitimate because of some \nchanges that occurred about 10 days before the bill came to committee, \nmaybe a week. But the fact is, they can be very easily fixed, and I \nthink we all know how to fix them, and they can be fixed very quickly.\n  The prefunding issue is an issue that, to me, is a legitimate debate. \nIf it needs to go to zero, the framework, as Senator Warner just talked \nabout, is still intact. It still works exactly the same way. It is a \ndebate as to whether you want to absolutely make sure taxpayers are \nprotected. But if people think this prefund is something that looks \nlike a bailout, let's drop it, let's get rid of it, let's end it. Let's \nlet borrowing capacity at the FDIC be the only avenue.\n  But my point is, these are all--in the scope of things, they are \nbeing made into really big things, when, in essence, a couple of \nsemithoughtful people could solve these things in just a few minutes \nand we could move on to other aspects of the bill that do need to be \ncorrected.\n  The one place I think the Senator from Virginia and I might differ \nmore greatly is that I do think there are other issues in this bill \nthat create problems that need to be resolved, and I hope the spirit we \nhave shown with each other will emanate on both sides of the aisle--I \nthink it will--and that we will work through those, too, and end up \nwith a good bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on this extenders \nbill that we will vote on here on a point of order that I will make in \njust a few minutes. The purpose of this point of order is this: Not too \nlong ago in this Congress, we passed legislation called pay-go, and \nwhat pay-go is supposed to mean is that we will pay as we go in this \nCongress; that when we create a new program, we extend a current \nprogram, we will pay for it; that we will not continue to borrow \nagainst our children's future. I was here in the Senate when we had \nthat debate. It was a debate that came down to a purely party-line \ndecision.\n  I am new to this body, and I wanted to vote for this because I \nbelieve pay-go might actually be something that limits the out-of-\ncontrol spending of Washington. I talked to my colleagues, and some of \nmy colleagues who have been around longer than I said: Look, Senator, \nit is not really going to do anything. They are just going to move to \nwaive it every time it comes into effect. They are not going to play by \nthe rules. They are not going to pay for things as you go. It is just \ncover.\n  I wanted to vote for it. I struggled with it. In the end, I did not \nvote for it. And here we are just a few months--2 months past February \n12 when the President signed this pay-as-you-go legislation--only 19 \ndays after that, we waived it on a bill very similar to this, and now \nwe are going to seek to waive this legislation again to spend $19 \nbillion and put it on the tab of our children and our grandchildren.\n  Let's talk about what this bill is. It would extend unemployment \ncompensation and it would extend COBRA, which is health care benefits \nfor people who lose their jobs. If we were to vote on this and pay for \nit, I think 100 Senators would vote for it. Shortly before the recess \nfor the holiday break, there was an agreement in this Chamber between \nRepublicans and Democrats that we would find the money to pay for this \nso that we wouldn't have to put it on the backs of our children, so \nthat we would not have to borrow the money from China, so that we \nwouldn't have to increase our growing debt and deficit.\n  Our national debt is now nearly $13 trillion. It has gone up $1 \ntrillion in the short time I have been here in the Senate. To give you \nreference on that, it took until 1980, from the founding of this \ncountry until 1980 for us to amass our first trillion dollars in debt.\n  The system of spending is unsustainable. I spoke on the floor this \nmorning about it. But don't just take my word for it; take Ben \nBernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who testified today \nbefore the Joint Economic Committee of Congress and said this \ngovernment must begin to make difficult choices to address its deficits \nand warned that postponing them will only make them more difficult. So \nhere today we are going to spend another $19 billion and put it off on \nour children, and they will have to pay for it because we are going to \nhave to borrow this money.\n  We are not supposed to be able to waive this rule, this legislation, \nunless it is an emergency. This is no emergency, and that is the basis \nof my point of order I will make here in just a few minutes.\n  What is an emergency? Well, most of us think it is what Merriam-\nWebster says it is: an unforeseen combination of circumstances \nresulting in a state that calls for immediate action--an unforeseen \ncombination of circumstances. Has it been unforeseen that we were going \nto have to extend unemployment compensation? Was it unforeseen that we \nwere going to have to extend COBRA? Of course, it is not. We knew we \nwere going to have to do this, but there is an unwillingness in this \nCongress to pay for things. There is a willingness to put the debt upon \nour children and our grandchildren.\n\n  The Budget Act of 1974 that we operate under says that an emergency \nis necessary, essential or vital, sudden, quick coming into being and \nnot building up over time, urgent, pressing, compelling, unforeseen, \nunpredictable, not permanent, temporary in nature. None of those \nrequirements are met by this attempt to waive the pay-as-you-go \nrequirements. Why do we have pay-go if we are just going to waive it \nevery time we think we need to spend more money?\n  This is no emergency. This is just part and parcel of the problem we \nhave in Washington of continuing to spend in an unsustainable way. And \nwhen, 5 years or 10 years from now, we are in the same situation Greece \nis in; when we have failed this country for our children; when we have \n$900 billion in interest payments alone in 2020 on our current course, \nwhich will not allow us to spend money on anything else because that \nplus mandatory spending will be all there is in the budget; when our \neconomic system fails because we have failed to make the decisions to \ncontrol our spending, you will know why--because of the decisions that \nare being made today, in 2010, in April, decisions to add another $19 \nbillion to our national debt.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve my right to speak shortly before the \nvote is called at 12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, shortly, the Senate will vote on the \nmotion to waive the Budget Act for the consideration of my amendment \nand this important bill to extend unemployment\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\ninsurance benefits and other vital safety net programs.\n  We need to waive the Budget Act to allow this bill to move forward. \nWe need to waive the Budget Act for the people who depend on \nunemployment insurance benefits.\n  We need to waive the Budget Act for people like the Montanans from \nwhom I have heard.\n  We need to waive the Budget Act for Bonnie from Whitefish, MT. Bonnie \nlost her job in property management last year, and has been scraping by \non unemployment benefits ever since. Bonnie has already sacrificed \nmuch, but she is still falling behind on her rent. She is unable to \nafford many necessities. Unemployment benefits help her get by from day \nto day.\n  We need to waive the Budget Act for people like Richard from Bozeman. \nUnemployment insurance has helped keep Richard afloat as he searches \nfor a job. So far, Richard has applied for more than 150--think of it! \n150--jobs and has had only 2 temporary part-time positions to show for \nhis effort. Though his financial situation is grim, it would be even \nmore so without unemployment benefits.\n  We need to waive the Budget Act for people like the single father \nfrom Missoula. He has been out of work for weeks. He exhausted his \nState benefits, and is now receiving Federal extended benefits. He \nrecently called the Montana Unemployment Insurance Claims Processing \nCenter for additional help because he does not know how he can take \ncare of his daughters.\n  Unemployment benefits help these Montanans to pay the bills. \nUnemployment benefits help these Montanans and millions of Americans \nwho, through no fault of their own, have fallen victim to this Great \nRecession.\n  The average unemployment benefit is $335 a week. These days, $335 \nonly stretches so far.\n  Benefits have lapsed for 200,000 Americans. Since Authority expired a \nfew days ago. If we do not pass this bill this week, another 200,000 \nAmericans could lose their benefits.\n  Responding to recessions is the very definition of an emergency. \nResponding to this kind of need is why the Budget Act built in motions \nto waive the budget in the first place. The budget needs to have \nflexibility to address truly unusual circumstances like today's \neconomy.\n  Extending unemployment insurance benefits is a good investment to \nmake now. It is an investment, in our economy.\n  Unemployment benefits help our unemployed neighbors. And in helping \nour neighbors, unemployment benefits also help to keep open the \nneighborhood grocery store, and the neighborhood gas station.\n  In helping our unemployed neighbors, unemployment benefits also help \nthe economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that \nextending additional unemployment benefits would have one of the \nlargest effects on economic output and employment per dollar spent \ncompared with any other action we could take. CBO says for each dollar \nspent, increasing aid to the unemployed could increase the gross \ndomestic product by up to $1.90. That is 2 to 1. For every dollar spent \non unemployment benefits, that could increase gross domestic product by \n$1.90. Households receiving unemployment benefits spend their benefits \nright away. That is very important. They don't save it; they spend it. \nThat spurs demand for goods and services. That boosts production and \nleads businesses to hire more employees.\n  Some critics insist that emergency spending to address the recession \nis busting the budget. Some critics blame emergency spending and the \nRecovery Act for the huge budget deficits we face today.\n  We do need to address our Nation's fiscal circumstances, of course, \nwe do. We are currently laboring to reach an agreed-upon package of \noffsets to pay for much of the long-term extension in unemployment \ninsurance and other programs the Senate passed on March 10.\n  And on a larger level, we also need to balance the Nation's revenues \nand outlays. The President's fiscal commission will begin its work a \nweek from Tuesday. We will need to think about fundamental tax reform \nas part of that exercise. And we will need to make sure that we get a \ndollar's worth of value for every taxpayer dollar the government \nspends.\n  But let me set the record straight. Emergency spending like this bill \nand the Recovery Act is responsible for only a small share of the \ndeficit.\n  In fact, the cost of the Recovery Act is projected to be less than 10 \npercent of the total deficit legacy over the next 10 years.\n  The chart behind me tells the story. The majority of the deficit we \nwill face over the next 10 years stems from inherited policies. The tax \ncuts enacted under the previous administration, the wars in Afghanistan \nand Iraq, and the economic downturn itself explain nearly $11 trillion \nof our deficit over the next 10 years.\n  These policies were enacted before the current administration and \nbefore this Congress. Because these policies were not paid for, we are \nnow facing huge deficits.\n  Unemployment benefits are not the cause of the deficit. We should not \nbalance the budget on the backs of the unemployed.\n  Right now, it is essential we pass a temporary extension of \nunemployment benefits. It is essential we help Americans put food on \nthe table. It is essential to pay the bills, while they continue to \nlook for work.\n  So let us waive the Budget Act for Bonnie from Whitefish.\n  Let us extend unemployment insurance benefits for Richard from \nBozeman, MT.\n  Let us extend this vital lifeline for the single father from Missoula \nand for his daughters who depend on him.\n  And in this great recession, let us waive the Budget Act to enact \nthis temporary extension of unemployment insurance for the hundreds of \nthousands of Americans struggling, through no fault of their own, just \nto get by.\n  It is true that very soon we must significantly address the budget \ndeficit. The real test will be the degree to which this country, the \nPresident, and the Congress buckle down and start to reduce the budget \ndeficit during times of prosperity; that is, after we get out of this \nrecession and when unemployment levels start to reach sensible, lower \nlevels. That is when we face the true test of whether we reduce the \nbudget deficit. It is our responsibility to do so. We should let \nunemployment benefits be extended. We should not have to pay for those \nnow. But soon, when the unemployment rate falls, when the country comes \nout of the recession, then it is up to us to go the extra mile to make \nsure we, in a responsible way, start to address the huge deficits. When \nwe do, it will keep interest rates low, and other countries will have \nmore confidence in the United States. I daresay they have confidence \nnow, but they will have even more confidence. I very much expect and \nhope that this body will exercise that effort responsibly to begin to \ntackle huge deficits.\n  Now is not the time. Soon we will face the time. It is not now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that time \nunder the quorum be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee. I appreciate his comments about the need for this \nbody to enter into a discussion about fiscal discipline. I offered \nlegislation today to have a requirement that we would have a debate \nevery year to talk about bringing spending back to 2007 levels, prior \nto the stimulus, prior to the recession, certainly a time when this \ncountry had a much better economy than now. If I asked Floridians if \nthey could live off of what they had in 2007, they would be happy to \nhave that much money. Whatever the architecture is, we need to get into \nthat. Our budget deficit and the debt are cascading out of control.\n  I disagree with my colleague that we can wait until the recession is \nover. While I am optimistic that we will soon be turning the corner, \ntimes are very tough in my State. I don't know if it is\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\ngoing to be next year or the year after that we are out of this \nrecession. We have the worst unemployment we have had since we have \nbeen keeping records in Florida, 12.2 percent. I don't know that we can \nwait, especially when we hear the Chairman of the Federal Reserve say \nwe must act now.\n  Recently, we were in a situation where bonds went out to issue, and \nthe Wall Street Journal reported that the yield rate the Federal \nGovernment had to offer on those bonds, the interest rate was more than \nWarren Buffett had to offer. Warren Buffett was a better investment \nthan the United States. Why is that? It is because the world is \nbeginning to believe the United States can't manage its debt. Places \nsuch as Brazil have had their stock market increase 100 percent in the \nlast year because they are now seen as a better investment than this \ncountry.\n  We can't wait. We can't wait for 6 months or a year from now. Perhaps \nthe time has already gone too far.\n  I raise a point of order pursuant to section 4(g) of the Statutory \nPay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I raise a point of order against the emergency \ndesignation in the pending substitute amendment and note this is not a \nbudget point of order. It doesn't kill this provision. It only requires \nthat it be paid for by the end of the year. Everybody is for extending \nunemployment compensation. Everyone is for paying for COBRA. The point \nis, pay for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to raise a point of \norder?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I have raised a point of order. I repeat, pursuant to \nsection 4(g) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I raise a \npoint of order against the emergency designation provision in the \npending substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nand section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act, I move to waive \nall applicable provision of those acts and applicable budget \nresolutions for consideration of the pending amendment, No. 3721, as \nmodified, and the underlying bill, and I ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been previously ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to get back \ninto morning business. A number of my freshman and sophomore colleagues \nand I have come to the floor to discuss an important issue. We also \ncame to the floor during the final throes of the health care debate. We \nare here to raise the issue that, while we are enormously proud to be \nMembers of the Senate and respect the traditions of the Senate, \nsomething seems a little strange when 15 months into this President's \nadministration, we still have approaching 100 nominees who have not \nbeen voted up or down so that they can serve in these most important \npositions to make sure we get our country back on the right path.\n  We are going to reiterate these issues, and we will come back to try \nto urge Senators who have concerns about nominees to come to the floor \nand make their case against the nominees. They ought to be voted up or \ndown, and if they are not approved, the administration can move on to \nsomeone else. But 15 months is a long time. As a former CEO in business \nand a former Governor, I think this President ought to have his team in \nplace.\n  First, this is an issue that a number of us have raised over a period \nof time. We all have previous experience before coming on this body. I \ncall on my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar, to \nmake a few comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have seen what is going on \nhere. We get these nominations through our committee, and then they \nvanish into thin air. You can look at the numbers with what is going on \nhere. You have a situation where President Bush had 100 circuit and \ndistrict court confirmations during the first 2 years of his \nPresidency. To date, President Obama has only 18. There are literally \ndozens of nominees waiting.\n  Why does this matter? We can spend the whole morning spouting numbers\n\n[[Page S2270]]\n\nand talking about the times and differences between the months. Why \ndoes it matter? This is about a drug dealer who doesn't get prosecuted, \nsomeone who is running a drug ring, because there is not a judge to \nbring the case in front of. I was a prosecutor running an office of 400 \npeople, and I saw what would happen if we didn't have judges. It is \nalso about a felon in possession of a gun, and they can't bring up his \ncase because they have a heavy docket of criminal, civil, and corporate \ncases, and because of this you cannot get criminals off the street. Or \nthis is about complicated white-collar crimes such as the one with \nBernie Madoff. In a recent case in Minnesota, there was a lengthy trial \ninvolving a guy who got a 50-year sentence. If we don't have the judges \nto handle these things, criminals will be out there committing crimes. \nThat is what this is about.\n  I will say this before I turn it over to my colleague, the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. President Bush had 100 circuit and district court \nconfirmations during the first 2 years of his Presidency. Today, \nPresident Obama has 18. If we are going to hit this hundred number and \nget 82 more judges confirmed, we are going to have to do nearly 3 per \nweek.\n  The new Members of the Senate are here to say let's get this done \nbecause justice delayed is justice denied.\n  I turn this over to Senator Shaheen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am here to join my colleagues to \nraise our concerns about what is undoubtedly a deliberate attempt to \nkeep President Obama's nominees from getting through the Senate and \ntaking over their jobs, regardless of whether it is a court justice or \nwhether it is the Director of the Office of Violence Against Women. I \nwas on the floor a couple months ago because the Director of the Office \nof Violence Against Women, from New Hampshire, had been held up 2 \nmonths after unanimously being approved in the committee. She was held \nup not because it had anything to do with her qualifications but \nbecause somebody objected to something else--who knows what. The person \nwho objected never had to tell why they were objecting.\n  That is the situation we are in now. We have 94 nominees being held \nup by the other side of the aisle, and they are not telling us why they \nare holding up these nominees. They have to come forward and allow a \nvote. It is time for us to move forward on the judiciary nominees--on \nall of those 94 nominees--and get a vote and keep government moving.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the Senator. She realizes the \nimportance of getting a team in place, whether it is judicial or \nadministrative.\n  Somebody who feels very passionate about this and a lot of other \nissues is the Senator from Vermont. He wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I think most Americans understand that \nin the Senate, and in government in general, honest people will have \nhonest differences of opinion. They debate issues, represent \nconstituencies, and vote. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. I \nthink there is a growing anger and frustration when a lot of what takes \nplace on the floor has nothing to do with an honest debate on the \nissues but simply obstructionism, obstructionism, obstructionism.\n  The American people have a hard time understanding when you have \nwell-qualified nominees for the judicial positions, when some of these \nnominees have gotten out of committee with unanimous or almost support, \nit takes months and months to get these nominees approved so they can \ndo their job.\n  As the Senator from Minnesota said a moment ago, the issue is that \njustice delayed is justice denied. We have some dangerous people out \nthere who should be tried and found guilty and sent to jail. We have \nordinary citizens who have claims before courts and they want their day \nin court. Right now, they cannot get that day because the courts are \nbacked up because we don't have enough judges. So I hope very much that \nwe can get moving and do what has to be done, and that is to appoint \nthese judges. I hope we can get an up-or-down vote on them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, again, there are judicial nominees and \nthere are administrative nominees. I ask my friend, the newest Member \nof the Senate, who comes from a different business than I--I came from \nthe telecom business and he comes from a different business.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I kind of came from telecom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I am going to tie together judicial \nnominees and administrative nominees. You heard from my colleague, \nSenator Klobuchar from Minnesota. She talked about how President Bush \nhad, during his first two years in office, about 100 judicial nominees \nconfirmed, and it is 18 judges so far for President Obama. The district \ncourt nominees who have been reported out of committee are waiting \nalmost twice as long to be confirmed as during the Bush administration, \nand circuit court nominees are waiting five times longer. I have heard \nmy colleagues from the other side say, well, the President isn't \nnominating judges as fast as President Bush did. First, you would think \nif that were the case, they would have to wait less time because there \nare fewer of them. The reason he has been nominating fewer is because \nthey are holding up Christopher Schroeder, from the Office of Legal \nPolicy at DOJ. He is the guy who vets nominees for judgeships. He was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee in July of 2009. We could not \nget him a vote on the floor. Then he wasn't carried over. The \nRepublicans objected, so now he has been renominated earlier this year \nand reported out again. We cannot get a vote on him. He is the guy who \nhelps the President vet the people for the judgeships.\n  I don't want to hear complaints from my friends on the other side \nabout the pace of the judgeships being nominated, when they are holding \nup the guy who helps the President vet the judgeships.\n  This is a perversion of the filibuster. The whole point of the \nfilibuster was that our Founders said the Senate was the saucer to cool \nthe passions of the House of Representatives, right? We wanted to \nprevent the tyranny of the majority. This isn't about that--not when \nyou are holding somebody up, and then when you have the vote, it is 99 \nto 0. That has nothing to do with what the purpose of the filibuster \nis. Do you know what this is? This is running out the clock. This is \nused to stop business before the Senate.\n  The American people ought to be incensed about this, because what \nthis is doing is slowing down anything from getting done on jobs, on \nWall Street reform, and on energy. That is what this is about. This is \nabout not letting this President and this Congress achieve anything. \nThis is about obstructionism.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague from Minnesota. In his case in \npoint, we had a judicial nominee endorsed by a Republican Governor, \nreported out unanimously, filibustered, and then she was confirmed 99 \nto 0.\n  I respect the traditions of the Senate, but something is broken. I \nnow ask the Senator from Colorado to speak. He is actively talking with \nthe people of Colorado who hired him for this position. He hears the \nfrustration they express about why can't you get things done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, there is not a person in this Chamber, I \nguarantee you, who does not go home at the end of the week and hear \nfrom people of their State--Democrats, Republicans, or unaffiliated \nvoters--``what in the world are you guys doing back there? What's with \nall the political games being played? Why can't people act in a \nbipartisan way?''\n  I think it is important to say that we are talking about a bunch of \nnominations that actually have broad bipartisan support. Most of them \npassed out of committee by voice vote--certainly on a bipartisan basis.\n  As the Senator from Virginia was saying, there is instance after \ninstance where there has been delay, delay, delay, only to see somebody \npass 97 to 0 or 98 to 0. That is not about partisanship or about \nRepublican versus Democrat. To me, that is about Washington\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\nbeing completely out of touch with the real world. The real world \ndoesn't act this way. They don't use rules to make excuses for not \ngetting their work done. The real world doesn't say we are frightened \nto debate these issues. The real world doesn't take people who are \nqualified for their jobs and prepared to serve this country at an \nenormously difficult time in our history and say: Let's put it off \nuntil next week or the week after that or the week after that. Nobody \nhere is saying we should not have a vote. Nobody here is saying we \nshould not have a debate. We are saying that the American people \ndeserve better than that. By the way, people may not know this. In this \ninstitution, it is actually possible to put a hold on somebody and not \nsay who you are.\n  I say to the Senator from Virginia, as the Governor of the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, how could you ever have gotten anything done \nif that were the case?\n  It is possible to put a hold on somebody in this institution and \nnever explain why you did it. You do not know what the issue is. That \nis why we need to have this debate and move forward.\n  Everybody in this Chamber has an obligation, whether they are \nDemocrat or Republican, to look at the merits of the nominees and to \nvote their conscience on those nominees. But the American people are \nenormously frustrated with the current state of affairs. They want an \nopen and sensible conversation about the policy choices we face as a \ncountry, and I think they want an end to the political games.\n  It is important we are all here today. I hope there are others who \nwill join us in the days ahead. I thank the Senator from Virginia for \norganizing this discussion.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, again, this should not fall on partisan \nlines. We welcome those Senators on the other side of the aisle who are \nfrustrated by this process and want to bring, while respecting the \ntraditions of the Senate, rationality back to the process.\n  My good friend from Delaware, while he is a freshman Senator, has \nserved in this institution longer than most of us and has watched the \ntransformation of this institution. I would love to have Senator \nKaufman's comments on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, some things have changed. I came here \nin 1973 working for now-Vice President Biden. Back then, if you asked \nthe American people what they most disliked about Washington, they \nwould say partisan bickering, the back-and-forth. That is what they \nreally do not like about what goes on.\n  My basic reaction is, and I have said to people that today what looks \nlike a lot of partisanship--basically, Senators like each other. This \nis not about people not liking each other. There is not a Senator on \nthe Republican side of the aisle whom I do not have a positive \nrelationship with and feel good about. You can say that about the \nissues. What I say is there is a difference on the issues. Basically, \nwe disagree about the issues. But I do have a hard time, when it comes \nto judicial nominations especially, on the rationale for the argument \nbecause it is not a matter of issues.\n  We have differences about some judges, but the vast majority of \njudges still being held are judges we all agree are competent judges. \nSo why is it they are not being confirmed, especially when we talk \nabout the two areas about which most Americans are so concerned? One is \ncrime, that we deal with crime and deal with it in a quick manner; that \npeople are given a fair trial, but then if they are guilty, they are \nput in jail. All Americans agree to that. To do that, one of the key \nchokepoints for us is the judges. We need the judges to be confirmed in \norder to deal with crime.\n  The other area, as I know my friend from Virginia is so aware, is the \nbusiness side. If you are a businessperson, you need certainty. You \nneed the ability to know, if you have a dispute, that you can get it \nhandled in a court and that you get prompt action. That is what \neveryone wants. With many of these things, it isn't as important that \nyou win as it is that you get an answer. When we have vacancies in \ndistrict and circuit courts, that holds up everything.\n  The final point is, there were always differences of opinion, but \nstarting about the 1980s, the judges became a football. They just \nbecame a football. When I hear about the old wars--it is like the \nHatfields and McCoys. Who was the first Senator to hold up the most \nnumber of judges and when did it happen? Our judge did this. You did \nthis. We did that. It really sounds like the Hatfields and McCoys on \nthe floor sometimes.\n  I am saying it is time to put that behind us. It is time to put that \nbehind us, especially when it comes to these judges whom we know are \ncompetent; where there is agreement, there is no disagreement. I defend \nthe right of the minority to hold up judges they think are not \ncompetent. We had three judges in a row who were confirmed by unanimous \nvotes of the Senate.\n  What I am saying is it is time to put that behind us. The American \npeople are looking to us to behave in a bipartisan manner. Again, we \nare going to have partisan differences on some judges, but when we have \njudges where there is bipartisan agreement, the American people are \nstymied to understand why in Washington we are behaving this way. I \ncall on my colleagues to work together and see if we cannot get these \njudges confirmed.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Delaware for his comments and \nperspective.\n  Again, while many of my colleagues talk about this related to judges, \nwe have, as the Senator from Minnesota said, members of the DOJ who are \nheld up. We have a very qualified and talented individual up for \nTreasury Under Secretary for International Affairs. They are enormously \nimportant positions.\n  I know my friend and colleague, the Senator from Maryland, wishes to \nspeak on this subject matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner for taking this \ntime to bring to the attention of our colleagues a very serious \nproblem.\n  One of the most fundamental responsibilities for a Member of the \nSenate is to advise and consent on the President's nominations. There \nare literally hundreds of appointments that are going to require our \nconfirmation--more than that; thousands, actually, that we have to \nconfirm. Our responsibility is to take the appointments the President \nhas given us, to evaluate them, and then to act, either to confirm or \nnot confirm.\n  The American people depend on these individuals being in office to \nperform the services they need, whether it is services that come \nforward in the Department of the Treasury in dealing with the economic \nissues of this Nation, the regulatory functions that are important to \nprotect consumers in America, to be able to give those who have been \nwronged an opportunity in our judicial system to have courts that can \nhandle their dockets in a timely way. All that is dependent upon the \nSenate carrying out its responsibility to advise and consent to take up \nthe nominations of the President.\n  Look at what has happened in this Congress. Let me point out the \ndistrict court judges. District court judges are the judges who hear \nthe overwhelming number of cases. If you have a problem and you go to \nFederal court, you go to district courts. That is where 99 percent of \nthe cases are going to be heard.\n  In 2002, when George Bush became President, 35 of his district court \nappointments were confirmed. They waited on average 13 days after being \nreported by the Judiciary Committee for confirmation votes on the floor \nof the Senate. On this date, there were no further pending district \ncourt appointments that required the confirmation of the Senate. We had \nacted on every one of them.\n  Now let's take a look at the current situation. This Senate has only \nconfirmed 11 of President Obama's district court nominations, and they \nwaited on average 43 days. There are 17 district court nominations that \nhave been reported out by the Judiciary Committee. Most have been \nreported by voice vote, by unanimous vote, no controversy at all with \nmost of these nominations, and they have been pending on average 46 \ndays.\n  This is an intentional action by the Republicans to block the ability \nof\n\n[[Page S2272]]\n\nPresident Obama to place his appointees either in the courts or in his \nadministration. That is just wrong. If you have a disagreement, let's \ndebate it. If there is a legitimate concern, let's talk about it. But \nthat is not what is happening here.\n  The people of Maryland, the people around this Nation are being \ndenied essential services because of a partisan strategy to block this \nbody from timely considering the appointments by the President. That is \njust wrong. It is time we bring an end to it. It is time the Democrats \nand Republicans work together in the best interests of the American \npeople.\n  I yield my time to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for his \ncomments. Again, we want to be respectful of Senate traditions, but it \njust seems at this moment in time, with so many issues our country is \nconfronting, we need a rational process. We need to be able to explain, \nas the Senator from Colorado said, to the American folks why we are not \ngetting business done. Part of the reason we are not getting business \ndone is the President does not have his team in place, judges are not \nin place, and a lot of time is wasted on the Senate floor with needless \nfilibusters.\n  There is another freshman Senator with whom I have had a number of \nconversations, my good friend from North Carolina. This is a little \ndifferent from the way she operated as State senator in Raleigh, NC. I \nwould love to hear her comments.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nhelping us come together to talk about this issue because it is of \ncritical importance.\n  In North Carolina, we have two justices for the Fourth Circuit Court \ncoming before this body. They were heard in the Judiciary Committee \nback in January. They are ready to go. However, once again, the \nindividual who is to vet justices has not been heard, Chris Schroeder. \nWe need to bring him up. Although both of these individuals, Judge Wynn \nand Judge Diaz, have come out of the Judiciary Committee, they are \nwaiting to come up for a vote. They are behind in the queue from all \nthe other district court judges who have not come forward. I will say \nthat my colleague, Republican Senator Burr, is in total agreement with \nboth of these nominees. We need to bring them forward for a vote. The \ninteresting fact is that one of these positions has been open since \n1994. Talk about justice delayed is justice denied. It is high time \nthis body had an opportunity to vote to put forward Judge Diaz and \nJudge Wynn to represent our State on the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her comments, \nagain recognizing that some of the judges she is talking about have had \nbipartisan support. If this was a question of qualifications, it ought \nto be legitimately questioned and debated.\n  I know there are other colleagues showing a little bit of the radical \ntransformation we are making. Having freshmen Senators speak is part of \nthat.\n  I now call on my good friend from Pennsylvania to add his comments. I \nbelieve the Senator from Pennsylvania has judges in Pennsylvania and \nother appointees who have been pending.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Senator from Virginia for getting us together \nto talk about something that is fundamental. Basically, we are talking \nabout our system of justice. We heard the number of days, when we \ncompare this administration to the prior administration, it takes to \nconfirm a judge on the appellate court or on the district court.\n  It is important for people to realize that we are not talking about \nsaying they on the other side should be voting for all of our judges or \nthey should be endorsing them, even though when they come to the \nJudiciary Committee we have had tremendous bipartisan votes on a lot of \nthese judges.\n  Here is a lot of what the American people do not understand. They can \nunderstand that when Senators are making their minds up about how to \nvote on a particular nominee to be on a district court or on an appeals \ncourt, we might have a difference of opinion as it relates to judicial \nphilosophy, for example, or the experience of this particular \nindividual or their character, their ability to serve with integrity. \nAll of those basic considerations we have to weigh and I think by \nextension the American people weigh when they are deciding whether or \nnot someone is fit to serve on a district court or appellate court. All \nof those considerations are considerations Democrats and Republicans \nwill weigh, but we cannot do that unless we can get a vote, unless we \ncan put a nominee in front of the Senate for an up-or-down vote based \nupon their record, based upon their views and philosophy. But this idea \nof obstructing purely for political reasons, sometimes to slow down the \nPresident's agenda for no good reason, sometimes to bottle up things in \nthe Senate, makes no sense as all. Why don't our colleagues want these \nnominees for various positions in our system of justice to go before \nthe Senate to have an up-or-down vote, and then we can have a debate as \npart of that about their qualifications or about their educational \nbackground or their ability. We can certainly do that. This idea of \nobstructing for political and partisan reasons makes no sense to us, \nand I am sure it makes no sense to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. What we have heard in the case of Pennsylvania, as we \nheard from all of us, is frustration. As the Senator from Colorado \nsaid, folks who have legitimate complaints about an individual, whether \nthey are a judge or a Presidential appointee, ought to bring them to \nthe floor and debate them. While we want to be respectful of Senate \ntraditions, I think allowing the process to go along without using the \nexisting rules to try to force us to confront these issues does not \nmake any sense when our country faces many enormous challenges.\n  I call on my good friend from Colorado who, while he served in the \nother body, has obviously had a longtime family tradition of public \nservice. I am sure the folks in Colorado are scratching their heads \nabout the rules under which we operate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I thank Senator Warner.\n  I did want to touch on the concerns of the people of Colorado with \nrespect to the discussion we are having today. I want to start by \nsaying that one of the fundamental roles of the Senate is to advise and \nconsent the President of the United States. We do not even have a \nchance to advise the President, much less consent, because of the \nanonymous holds and the slowdown tactics that have been utilized when \nit comes to all these important nominees.\n  We ought to have a chance to debate on the floor of the Senate, which \nis the advisory role, and we may find some judges do not pass muster, \nbut they deserve an up-or-down vote on the floor of the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, the U.S. Senate. That is not happening.\n  I note that some of my colleagues pointed out two cases where Judge \nThompson from Rhode Island for months was stalled on the Executive \nCalendar. There was no reason given. When she was finally brought to \nthe floor, there was a 98-to-0 vote, a unanimous vote. What was the \nproblem? Why couldn't she be confirmed earlier?\n  With Judge Keene from the State of the Senator from Virginia, we had \nto have a cloture vote to bring her to the floor--4 months. She was \napproved 99 to 0. There was no objection expressed to her sitting on \nthe circuit court. This is senseless. This is absurd.\n  In Colorado, we have had two vacancies on our district court for many \nmonths, going on years now. That bench is undermanned right now. Those \njudges are appealing to Senator Bennet and me to get two more judges \nfor reinforcements so that docket can be reconsidered. Those district \ncourt judges are not being moved on the floor of the Senate so that we \ncan advise and then, hopefully, consent.\n\n  We have a Federal attorney whom we need to see confirmed. There has \nbeen no movement there as well. So for me, the Senate is not keeping \nfaith with the people of our respective States and not keeping faith \nwith the people of the United States.\n  I know we can do better. I know the American people, when they look \nhere to Washington right now, wonder why we are behaving like children. \nChildren\n\n[[Page S2273]]\n\nhave an excuse, don't they, Senator? They are children. We are not. We \nhave greater responsibilities. I hope we can set aside our differences, \nbring these nominees to the floor, across the board, and have an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  I would suggest that perhaps we ought to bring a block of nominees to \nthe floor under a unanimous consent request. They have all been vetted. \nThe President needs to have a full complement of people in his \nadministration to do the work of the American people.\n  Again, I thank Senator Warner. We will continue to beat these drums \nuntil these nominees have had a chance to be voted upon. This is \ncrucial to me and to the challenges our country faces here today.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Colorado for his comments and \nhis great perspective on this issue, and again, part of what he is \nraising is that we want to consider the rules and traditions. Today, we \nhave all these freshmen and sophomore Members coming to the floor and \nsaying the process seems to be broken. We want to urge our colleagues \non the other side to allow the process to move forward and to suggest \nthat we are not going to let business as usual continue to go on. We \nwant to give them appropriate notice. There is no attempt to ambush on \nprocess here, but we are saying enough is enough. We owe it to this \nbody and we owe it to the folks across the country.\n  Madam President, someone who comes to this floor regularly to talk \nabout health care and a series of other issues has these same issues \nfacing him in his great State of Ohio, and he wishes to make some \ncomments on this as well.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I appreciate the work Senator Warner is doing, \nalong with Senator Hagan and Senator Udall. I came to the Senate 3\\1/2\\ \nyears ago. I am personally not a lawyer, and I have, obviously, never \nsat as a judge, but I understand the custom here is that, typically, if \nthere is a Senator from a State with the same party affiliation as the \nPresident, that Senator makes a recommendation to the President for a \nFederal judgeship or a district Federal judgeship, and normally the \nPresident will accept that. My senior Senator, my colleague from Ohio, \nis a Republican. So rather than block him out of the appointment \nprocess, the confirmation process, I asked him to join with me and we \nput together a committee for the northern district in Ohio for a judge \nvacancy. Actually, there were two, one in the northern district and we \ndid one in the southern district. We had a panel of, I believe 17 \npeople. The northern district panel was actually majority Republican. I \nam a Democrat; the President is obviously a Democrat. The southern \ndistrict was a majority Democrat, barely. The panel did lengthy \ninterviews of about 20 potential judges each--Federal judges--for the \none vacancy in the northern district and the one in the southern \ndistrict. In these interviews were people who were active in their \ncommunities, who donated their time and spent 2 or 3 full days.\n  The panel then submitted to me the top three candidates in both the \nnorthern and southern districts, and I interviewed each of the three \nand chose who I thought would be the best Federal district judges. I \nthen spoke with Senator Voinovich and he signed off on them. Both of \nthese candidates were then submitted to the President, who in turn \nsubmitted them to the Senate and the Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary \nCommittee voted overwhelmingly for each of them. Yet they still haven't \ncome to a vote on the Senate floor.\n  I couldn't have done this in a more bipartisan and fair way to make \nit happen, and I know Senator Voinovich wishes to move on these judges. \nHe signed off on them, and on the day we announced them we put out a \njoint statement where we said these were important judgeships and that \nwe had selected the right people.\n  As Senator Cardin said, this is wrong. There are backlogs in these \ncourts and, as Senator Hagan of North Carolina said, we need to fill \nthese positions. As has been said, justice delayed is justice denied. \nThere are backlogs both in the northern and southern district and we \nhave these two ready to be voted on. We could do it today. It could be \ndone by unanimous consent request, as Senator Udall of Colorado \nsuggested. We could do that.\n  There are now two new vacancies in Ohio, and so we will start that \nprocess. But it doesn't make sense that President Obama's district \ncourt nominees have waited twice as long after being favorably reported \nby the Judiciary Committee to be voted upon. So in addition to the \nother judges who have been vetted by a whole process--from the State \nsenator to the FBI, to the President, to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee--it is time now for a vote. And most of these will be \nunanimous or close to it.\n  I think there will be overwhelming support for Judge Pearson in the \nnorthern district and Judge Black in the southern district. They have \nproven they are ready to go and they would be good judges. Both are \nU.S. magistrates now, so they have gone through other vetting processes \nfor those jobs. I hope my colleagues will decide to accept these and \nmove on, because we have so many other things to do. This delay and \nobstructionism on judges is wrong and we need to move on.\n  Madam President, I thank Senator Warner for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Ohio. A lot of my colleagues and \nI talk about judges, but this goes way beyond judges. As a matter of \nfact, a Senator who has been a leader on this issue, my friend, the \nSenator from Montana, has come to this floor on other occasions by \nhimself to talk about certain other nominees the President has put \nforward, and my understanding is that some of these nominees were held \nup because of totally unrelated issues.\n  I don't know about the folks in Montana, but the folks in Virginia \nare scratching their head and saying: What do Canadian tobacco laws \nhave to do with a Presidential nominee for a totally different type of \njob that has nothing to do with Canada or tobacco? So I would like my \ngood friend, Senator Tester, to speak to these issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I thank my colleague for the recognition \nand for his leadership and his ability to see through the fog that has \nbeen created here in the Senate.\n  You know I am a farmer. Most folks in this body know I am a farmer \nand I have been my entire life. One of the things farmers can't deal \nwith is idle hands. When there is work to be done, you roll up your \nsleeves and you get out there and you get the work done. In Montana, \nright now it is planting season, and the folks there who are in \nagriculture--as with small businesses and working families, but in \nagriculture particularly--are looking at either getting their fields \nready or they are in the field putting seeds in the ground because the \nwork is there and it has to be done. You have an opportunity to do it, \nand you do it.\n  Well, it is planting season in the Senate all the time. Whether it is \ncreating jobs or turning the economy around or fixing health care or \nwhatever it may be, we have important work to do. The folks on the \nother side of the aisle, I guess, are watching the clouds roll by, \nbecause the fact is, it is time to go to work. Obstructionism is not \nsomething that takes a lot of skill, but getting things done requires \nhard work, and it is time to get things done.\n  These judicial appointments we have to do right now in the Senate are \ncritically important. They are critically important for this country \nand for the process to work, and yet they are being held up for \nliterally no reason whatsoever or just because they can be held up.\n\n  Let me give a quick statistic, because we always compare what goes on \nin past administrations. I can tell you that in the first 2 years of \nthe Bush Presidency he had 100 circuit and district court nominations \nconfirmed. To date, President Obama has had 18 over 2 years in. This is \nidle work. Idle hands get nothing done. It is time to go to work in the \nSenate, it is time to do away with the obstructionism, and it is time \nto put the Senate back on the side of the people.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator for those comments, and in the \ninterest of full disclosure, I might try to use that line about idle \nhands--as a matter of fact, in a speech later this afternoon.\n  I know we have been joined by one more of our freshman colleagues who\n\n[[Page S2274]]\n\nmay not have grown up as a farmer but who understands equally as well \nthe importance of this body getting its work done, and that is my \nfriend, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Burris.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. I thank my colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, who \nhas taken a leadership role on this important and crucial issue in the \nSenate.\n  At a time when we are looking at trying to move all this major \nlegislation and solve problems for the people of America, we find \nourselves stymied with regard to our third branch of government. The \nupcoming vacancy on the Supreme Court has already started a lot of talk \nacross the Nation, despite the fact that we don't even have a nominee \nas yet. But let's forget about that. We must still focus on a number of \nimmediate judicial nominations.\n  My Republican friends continue to delay and obstruct, and for what \nreason, I have no idea. Take, for example, my home State of Illinois. \nThere are currently five judicial vacancies, two in the central part of \nthe State and three in the northern part, which is, of course, where we \nhave Chicago. The caseload is tremendous on those current judges and so \nthere are all these delays. If you want to know why it takes so long to \nbring someone to trial, that is because the judges there are overworked \nand the numbers there need to be brought up to par with what the \nrequirements call for.\n  Illinois is not alone. This is happening all over the country. So the \nnumbers are such that we have all of these nominees who have been \nnominated, and some have been cleared by the committee unanimously. On \nsome of the other judges, whom we did get confirmed, we had to go \nthrough cloture. They cleared the committees, they were blocked, but \nthen, when we got to vote on them, the result was 99 to 0. That is \nuncalled for. So we must do what we can in order to make sure that the \njudicial process is not being delayed. That is, after all, our third \nbranch of government. That is where justice is rendered for individuals \nwho have violated any of the Federal laws.\n  My Republican friends are holding these up. They are blocking these \nimportant nominations and stopping the Senate from performing its \nconstitutional duty to advise and consent. We cannot consent because of \nthe delay tactics they are using. As a former attorney general of my \nState, I have a deep understanding of how this obstructionism brings \nour justice system to a standstill, and justice delayed, of course, is \njustice denied. It is simply inexcusable.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to stop blocking these qualified \nnominees, stop playing political games at the expense of our court \nsystem--the third branch of our government--and let's bring all of \nthose nominees to a vote.\n  I thank the Senator, and I yield to him.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Madam President, I think we have had more than a dozen Senators speak \nthis afternoon. I appreciate all of them coming out on relatively short \nnotice.\n  We raised these issues before we went on recess, because we want to \nbe respectful not only of traditions but to our colleagues on the other \nside. We recognize, as the Senator from Colorado has said, that there \nare rules that allow us to ask unanimous consent to bring these folks \nup, and in future days and weeks we will use those rules to try to urge \na full-fledged debate, and not just on judicial nominees. As the former \nCEO of a business, and the former CEO of a State, I know there are a \nwhole host of administrative nominees which are part of the \nadministration that this President needs to get in place.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time we have had to share our \nconcerns about this process. Again, I encourage my colleagues and \nfriends on the other side to allow us to get this fixed, to get back to \nthe substantive debates that are so important--financial reregulation, \nenergy, and jobs--and that the American people deserve and demand.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2274-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2274-S2275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CENSUS 2010\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, in 1790, Secretary of State Thomas \nJefferson became the first government official to perform the essential \nduties laid out in Article One Section Two of the U.S. Constitution.\n  He oversaw a team of marshals, who fanned out across all 13 United \nStates to conduct the very first U.S. census.\n  In those days, it took quite a long time to gather an accurate count \nand certify the results.\n  But, in many ways, that first census laid the cornerstone of our \ndemocracy.\n  It codified the principle that our system of government depends upon \naccurate representation of the people.\n  And, even today, that's exactly what the census is all about.\n  It determines the size of the House of Representatives, and ensures \nthat congressional districts and electoral votes are distributed \naccurately.\n  It helps target Federal funding for schools, hospitals, community \ncenters, infrastructure projects, and a whole host of other programs.\n  In short, it helps our government work the way it is intended in each \ncommunity, so everyone's voice can be heard.\n  It is about nothing less than who we are as a country.\n  It is about enfranchisement, and civic duty, and ensuring the success \nof the American system of self-government.\n  That is why our Constitution mandates that the census take place \nevery 10 years.\n  And that is why, 220 years after Thomas Jefferson started this \ntradition, we are once again asking all Americans to stand up and be \ncounted.\n  Our country has grown by leaps and bounds since Jefferson's time. \nMaking sure we get an accurate count can be a complicated process, but \nit has never been more important, especially for low-income and \nminority communities, which are in the greatest need for the resources \nthat will be allocated based on this census.\n  The problem is that many of these communities also have low \nparticipation rates--so they are often undercounted, and receive less \nfunding than they deserve.\n  That is why we need make a special effort to reach out to these \ncommunities.\n  We need to let everyone know how important it is to participate, so \nwe can get a clear, accurate snapshot.\n  Fortunately, unlike in Jefferson's day, the 2010 census will not take \nseveral months to complete--it will take about 10 minutes.\n  This year's form is one of the shortest in history--and it bears a \nclose resemblance to the original questionnaire that was used in 1790.\n  Filling it out will be quick and easy--but it will make a world of \ndifference.\n  I ask my fellow Americans to join me in doing their civic duty, as \nrequired by the Constitution. Take 10 minutes to fill out and return \nthis census form. It could be the most productive 10 minutes of the \ndecade. It will make your vote count for more on election day. It will \nmake sure hospitals, fire departments, and police departments are up to \nthe task of serving your community. It will secure adequate funding for \nroads, bridges, rail lines, and other important infrastructure. And it \nwill help us reaffirm the unwavering commitment shared by all \nAmericans--to a representative government--a government of the people, \nby the people, and for the people; a government that serves not only \nthe best interests of this great country but of the world.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise as a result of the \nresolution offered earlier today commemorating the tragic deaths of so \nmany Polish leaders, especially the death of Tomasz Merta, who is the \nMinister of Culture in Poland.\n  I worked with Tomasz Merta a couple times over the last 25 years. In \nthe early 1990s, he was a very young man, was still in his twenties, \nand he worked with Ohio State's Mershon Center, where I worked, helping \nhis country's government transition from communism to democracy. We \nworked on everything from curricula writing to training teachers.\n  I worked with him again when I was a Member of Congress. This time I \nwent to Ukraine, and he helped us train Ukrainian teachers, helped \nwrite curriculum, and help those Ukrainian teachers teach government \ncourses on civic education in Kiev.\n  So Tomasz Merta, born in 1965, graduate of Warsaw University, got a \nPh.D. His whole career was all about love of country, all about \ndemocracy, all about doing the right thing. He, in the nineties and \nsince, was a prolific writer. He wrote articles about democracy, \narticles about teaching democracy, articles about building democracy. \nHe was so important to this country. He was one of the youngest leaders \nwho was killed on this terrible, tragic flight.\n  He had a terrific future. He was the Secretary of State and the \nMinister of Culture and National Heritage. We will all miss him. \nTomasz, as his nickname was--Tomek is his real name. Tomasz is like \nThomas and Tommy. Tomasz was a devoted husband, the father of three \ndaughters.\n  I last saw him several years ago in Kiev. I so appreciate what he \ndid. As I will say now in Polish: I offer my deep condolences to the \npeople of Poland for this tragic loss.\n  Tomasz and some of his friends taught me some Polish. I must admit I \nread it, but the pronunciation he helped me with--he and Alicija and \nothers in Poland. I am so sad about his loss. I am so sad for his \ncountry. I am so sad for his wife and his three beautiful daughters. I \nknow that country will mourn his loss as it mourns the loss of so many \nother Polish patriots.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senate will resume \nconsideration of H.R. 4851.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3723\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, if anybody has been watching the Senate \ntoday, there was a point of order made that the spending we are going \nto pass to pay for unemployment insurance extension benefits and \nbenefits for health insurance for those people, in terms of buying \nthrough their former employers, as well as the sustainable growth rate \nformula, failed to be overriden.\n  We will have another vote on that because the majority side was \nmissing one Member, and they will eventually win on that. What that \nsays is, we are once again back to the point where we refuse to make \nthe hard choices to pay for things we need to do today by eliminating \nthings that are not as important.\n  The point of order was on the fact that it is an emergency so, \ntherefore, we can say: Time out. But those who voted to override it \nfail to recognize the other major emergency that is happening in our \ncountry. We have $12.8 trillion worth of debt as of today. We are going \nto add another $1.4 to $1.5 trillion this year, this calendar year; \nthat the increase in the cost of that debt over the last 12 months will \nrequire an additional, next year, $125 billion worth of expenditures.\n  There has to come a point in time when we grow to the responsibility \nthat has been given to us; that is, make hard choices. It is very easy \nto pass an unemployment insurance bill by charging it to our children. \nThe majority leader has graciously agreed to give me an opportunity to \noffer three different ways to pay for that. I am going to put those out \ntoday. One amendment now, which we will vote on, another amendment \nlater, and then a third amendment later.\n  Most of the ideas for cutting spending, quite frankly, have come from \nmy colleagues on the other side, and many of them you have already \nvoted for. So it is going to be an interesting exercise today. The \nmajority leader also spoke to me before lunch saying it did not matter \nbecause I was going to lose anyway.\n  That sends a signal. The leadership of our Senate today says: We do \nnot have to pay for things.\n  Prior to leaving here, we agreed on a compromise of tax loophole \nclosures that would have paid for this for a period of 30 days. The \nbill we voted on back then was for 30 days. We have now before us an \nidentical bill before us for 60 days. It is going to cost $18.2 \nbillion. That is what CBO says. The question I have to ask is, is it \nmorally right for us to steal that money from our children's future or \nmake hard choices about wasteful spending today? The choices are not \nhard other than in our stubbornness that we don't want to agree.\n  When businesses are taken over, when a larger business buys a smaller \nbusiness, the first thing they do is become great cash managers of the \nbusiness. In other words, they make sure the money in the business is \nalways working for the business. So if there is excess cash lying \naround in accounts, they take that money and reduce whatever \noutstanding debts they have or forgo borrowing money and use that cash \nin a more efficacious and serious manner. The first amendment I will \noffer is asking us to do nothing but the same.\n  At the end of last year, the Federal Government had on its books \nmoney it borrowed but had not spent of $676 billion. That is what is \nsitting in accounts, money we have borrowed that is not being utilized \nefficiently. At the end of next year, at the end of fiscal 2011, \naccording to the OMB, it will be $614 billion. That is almost half of \nthe debt we will borrow this year. This first amendment simply says: \nLet the administration utilize its executive prerogatives and instead \nof us borrowing $18.2 billion from our children and then paying \ninterest on that--and, by the way, the interest on that $18.2 billion \nthat will go on in perpetuity, because we are not retiring any debt, is \nabout $900 million, almost $1 billion a year. Why would we borrow money \nwhen we have money sitting there that is not being utilized effectively \nand pay almost $900 million every year? Why would we borrow again next \nyear an extra billion to pay for the money we are going to borrow to \nfund this program?\n  Let me give an example of where this money lies. In our own accounts \nto run the legislature, we have $1.450 billion sitting there. In other \nwords, it has not been promised to do anything. It is sitting there. It \nwas sitting at $1.876 billion at the end of last fiscal year. It is \nprojected to be $1.481 billion next year. We are keeping that money in \nthe bank and not using it.\n  The Department of Agriculture has $20 billion and is estimated in \n2011 to have still $12 billion sitting in an account that we are paying \ninterest on that is not being utilized, not obligated for anything at \nthe time, unobligated.\n  What all these figures show when you total them up is that we are \nsending money so fast to agencies, they can't spend it. In other words, \nwe are throwing money at the agencies far faster than they can spend \nit, and it would be wise and prudent of us to send less money--still \nwith the same rules, still with the same instruction, to utilize their \nmoney better.\n  The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Congressman\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\nObey, has already agreed to do that on the summer jobs program in \ncertain accounts.\n  The idea behind this amendment is to take some of the $1 trillion \nthat is sitting in accounts that is not obligated--in other words, it \nwill not be utilized this year; it won't be utilized for at least 2 \nyears--and utilize that rather than charge our children.\n  I have used Madeline's picture a lot, but I don't think you can \noverutilize this picture. This little girl was caught on the street \noutside of Washington protesting. Obviously, her parents put her up to \nit. At the time she was wearing a sign that says: I am already $38,375 \nin debt and I only own a dollhouse. At the end of this fiscal year, she \nwill be $45,000 more in debt, and she will still only own a dollhouse. \nWhy would we want to do that?\n  This bill adds $500 for every man, woman, and child in this country. \nWhy wouldn't we want to not charge it to them and utilize what we have \nin excess now, the inefficient use of the cash balances we have, to pay \nfor something we all agree we want to pay for but the disagreement is \nover whether we should steal it from our children or actually make hard \nchoices? These are not even hard choices. These are easy choices. We \nwere told, when we came to an agreement prior to the April recess, that \nthe reason this wasn't acceptable in the House is they didn't want to \nset the precedent of starting to pay for things when we are spending \nmoney. I would put forth that the American people are ready for us to \nstart doing that. They are ready for us to start making tough choices. \nThey think we need to make tough choices.\n  Out of every dollar we spend, we are borrowing 43 cents against the \nfuture. That is what happened last year. It will actually be probably \nhigher this year. Maybe not. But somewhere about 43 cents out of every \ndollar the Federal Government spends is borrowed. Is there a time that \nwe should stop and pause and say: Maybe a review is in order of our \npriorities, looking at the priorities of the Federal Government? I know \nthat builds a lot of resistance in this body. But what I would like \nsomebody to tell me is, when is that time? Is it when the Chinese won't \nbuy our bonds anymore? Do we wait for the firestorm to come where we \nare at critical mass and then the choices are limited and few? Or do we \nstart making the proper decisions now and live up to the authority and \nresponsibility given to us?\n  There is a saying that the easiest thing in the world is to spend \nsomebody else's money. I also think it is the most addictive thing in \nthe world. We can see that. It doesn't matter whether it is Republicans \nin charge or Democrats. We have not seen the kind of behavior in \nCongress that will get our Congress out of the financial problems we \nface.\n  In terms of an almost $4 trillion budget, $18 billion doesn't seem \nlike a lot, but if you keep doing that every 60 days, in a year you \nhave done over $120 billion that you will add to the debt. Our kids \nwill get to pay it back, but they will get to pay it back on compounded \ninterest.\n  The interesting thing is what the OMB and CBO agree to. Actually, CBO \ncame out with the latest numbers. We are going to borrow $9.8 trillion \nif we don't change things over the next 9 years, and fully 50 percent \nof that will be borrowed money to pay interest on the money we have \nalready borrowed. Should we not do what is right for the unemployed but \nalso what is right for the Madelines of this world in terms of \nprotecting their future?\n  I call up amendment No. 3723 and ask for its consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment No. 3723.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To pay for the full cost of extending additional unemployment \n  insurance and other Federal programs by rescinding unspent federal \n                  funds not obligated for any purpose)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESCISSION OF UNSPENT AND UNCOMMITTED FEDERAL FUNDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, of all available unobligated Federal funds, the greater \n     of $20,000,000,000 and the amount determined necessary under \n     the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-139; \n     124 Stat. 8) to offset the budgetary effect of this Act, \n     excluding this section, in appropriated discretionary \n     unexpired funds are rescinded.\n       (b) Implementation.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall--\n       (1) identify the accounts and amounts rescinded to \n     implement subsection (a); and\n       (2) submit a report to the Secretary of the Treasury and \n     Congress of the accounts and amounts identified under \n     paragraph (1) for rescission.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Here is a fairly painless way--just more efficient \nmanagement of the money we have--of paying for this needed program \nwithout charging it to the children. We don't have to go to the bond \nmarket to borrow more. We don't have to incur an additional $900 \nmillion a year of debt, a tremendous benefit to those who follow us. \nThe question is, when will we decide to start being responsible?\n  I am going to be offering two other amendments, if this one is not \nagreed to, that will give specific choices. Wait to hear the howling. \nIn other words, nothing is less important than unemployment insurance. \nSaid the other way, everything is more important. In other words, we \ncan't cut anything to pay for unemployment insurance.\n  Let's talk about that for a minute. Just through competitive bidding, \nif we had mandatory competitive bidding in the Federal Government--in \nother words, we will not buy things that are not competitively bid--we \nwould save $62 billion a year. But we have sweetheart deals out the \nkazoo. We have earmarks that have noncompetitive bidding. We have \ncontracts that the government does without competitive bidding. We \ncould save $62 billion a year by instituting competitive bidding.\n  Here are examples. It was recently reported that the Defense \nDepartment rewards no-bid work to small contracts for repairs at \nmilitary bases costing taxpayers $148 million more than they were \ncompeted for. This is in 1 year on repair contracts. That is just on \nthe repair of small items on military bases. We could save $148 million \na year. Federal funds were spent by the State of Wisconsin, $47.5 \nmillion, on two Spanish-made passenger trains, no competitive bid. The \nLegal Services Corporation, 37 out of 38 consultant contracts had not \nbeen competitively bid. The Department of Interior inspector general \nissued a report on sole-source contracting within the Department of \nInterior total savings; $44.5 million, had they used competitive \nbidding.\n  If we go through all of the agencies, what we come up with is a \npotential savings of billions and billions of dollars; as a matter of \nfact, enough to extend this same bill for 7 months, if we use \ncompetitive bidding. But that will not be considered important. It is \ngoing to be too important to do that so we will borrow the money from \nour children.\n  Let's look at ourselves. In 2010, the legislative branch received \n$4.7 billion in discretionary funding, a 6-percent increase over last \nyear. Do we know of any other people who got those kinds of increases \nwho work in small business or private enterprise in a down economy? \nLast year and this year alone, every day without this bill we are \nadding $4.3 billion to our debt a day. Is that an emergency? I think \nthat is the real emergency, that we are absolutely stealing opportunity \nfrom our children and grandchildren.\n  When Members of the Senate or the House don't utilize all their \nfunds--and I average turning back about $600,000 a year--that money \ndoes not go back to the Treasury. It is consumed in other areas of the \nlegislative branch. There is a disincentive for Members to be efficient \nwith the dollars they are allotted as they represent their individual \nStates. We ought to change that. There ought to be an incentive to be \nefficient. We ought to change it to where whatever we turn back goes to \nretire the debt, not goes back to spend on something that is not a \npriority.\n\n  If you look at the Department of Agriculture, for which one of my \namendments will have some recommended eliminations, there are hundreds \nof millions of dollars that are wasted every year. But when we offer an\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\namendment that is going to have a program that both the Bush \nadministration and the Obama administration have recommended be \nremoved, we are going to have people say: Oh, no, you can't do that \nbecause maybe 1,000 people or 1,500 people want that gravy train, when \nwe have 10 million people unemployed. So we are going to keep the gravy \ntrain for the small numbers and borrow the money from our children and \ngrandchildren to take care of unemployment benefits.\n  In 2009, the Department of Agriculture made errors in payments and \noverpaid by $4.2 billion in that year alone. Think about that. That is \njust the Department of Agriculture. Should we not eliminate that to pay \nfor unemployment insurance or should we borrow from our children? Which \nis it we should do? Should we make the hard choice and force the \nDepartment of Agriculture to clean up its act or should we borrow the \nmoney from our kids? It is a lot easier to just borrow it from our \nkids. Then we do not have to work. Oh, by the way, we do not get any of \nthe complaints from the administration that: You are making our job too \nhard--let alone the fact that they are not efficient and oftentimes not \neffective.\n  In 2008, the Agriculture Department had 7,000 different employees \nattend conferences around this country. There was $22 million of \nexpenditures in 2005 alone. The USDA is ranked among the four worst \nFederal agencies in paying its travel credit bills on time. As a matter \nof fact, they get charged interest because they cannot even pay their \nbills on time. Ten percent of their travel cards are in delinquent \nstatus. They have embezzlement cases on their credit cards. But have we \ndone the work to clean that up? No. Have we gone after the $4.5 billion \nin overpayments? No. Mr. President, $4.5 billion a year for 10 years is \n$45 billion. Just cleaning up one aspect of improper payments at only \nthe Department of Agriculture will pay for this bill for 4 months. But \nwe will not do the hard work. We do the easy work. And the easy work is \nto put the credit card into the machine and not think about how that is \ngoing to steal opportunity and potential from those who follow us.\n  The Department of Defense--everybody says: Well, you can't go after \nthe Department of Defense. My question is, Why not? It is the only \nFederal Government agency that cannot even come close to an audit \nanywhere. We cannot even audit their books they are in such a mess. But \nwhat we do know is we can save at least $36.5 billion from the \nDepartment of Defense by putting in competitive bidding, by making \ncogent management changes that every small business in this country \nruns on in the practices that are there. But it has not been changed. \nWe have not insisted it be changed. We have not limited funding in \nareas that are noncritical to our troops to force the Department of \nDefense to come up and save this $36.5 billion.\n  Mr. President, 10 to 15 percent of everything that is spent in the \nPentagon is wasted. Why wouldn't we go after that? Because somebody \nwill accuse us of not supporting our troops? Well, what are our troops \nfighting for? They are fighting for the future of their kids and our \ncountry. Yet we refuse to look where the payments can be made in a way \nthat is more efficient in the elimination of waste and fraud, with the \ninstitution of competitive bidding so we are not borrowing $18.2 \nbillion against our kids and grandkids. Why do we refuse to do that? Is \nit too hard? Do we love our jobs so much that we love our jobs more \nthan our children and our grandchildren? I do not think that is the \ncase. I think the case is that we are focusing on the wrong emergency.\n  The emergency in front of us is that in 2020 we are going to have a \ndebt-to-GDP ratio of 90 to 100 percent. Every economist in the world \nwill agree that will suppress our potential growth by at least 2 \npercent a year. So we will go in a downward spiral. When you have that \nkind of a debt-to-GDP ratio, what happens is the debt service--the \nmoney that pays the interest--is not available to invest in capital and \nequipment to grow jobs, to improve efficiencies, to expand our Nation's \neconomic base. We are adding to that problem by being irresponsible in \nterms of paying for an $18.2 billion program.\n  Over the past 4 years, I have identified in the Federal Government \nwaste, fraud, abuse, and duplication in excess of $350 billion a year. \nWhen I bring those amendments to the floor, they get voted down--not \nbecause they disagree with them but because we do not have the \npolitical will to make the hard choices.\n  The Congress, in a historic move, passed the health care bill that is \ngoing to continue to allow $150 billion of fraud a year to come out of \nMedicare and Medicaid. We did not do anything to fix it. There are no \nsignificant changes in the health care bill that will address a source \nof $150 billion in losses. Why? Because it is too hard? Kids are not \nimportant?\n  We are at a turning point in our country like we have never been \nbefore. We have never been walking into a financial situation that will \ntotally limit our ability to get out of a situation. We can come out of \nthis recession. But if we do not change the trajectory of the way we \nspend money and put the government back within the limited role the \nConstitution says it is to have, then the future will not only be \neconomically not bright but not bright from a standpoint of liberty.\n  I have told my colleagues--and we are going to have this on every \nbill that comes before the Senate--it does not matter if it is a \nsupplemental spending bill for the war, we ought to be paying for it. \nRather than borrowing it from our kids, we ought to be paying for it. \nWe ought to be making the hard choices about what is not as important \nas supporting our troops rather than charging the extra funding to our \ngrandkids. So we are going to go through at least three cycles of votes \non every bill that comes to the floor that is not paid for, that will \nadd to the debt. I am not going to serve my last year in the Senate and \nsay I did not do everything I could to try to put us back on track. So \nwhen we vote that this is an emergency and we do not have to pay for \nit, we are not hurting us. You are not hurting Tom Coburn. You are \nhurting the generations that follow us.\n  It would be different if we had an efficient, effective, well-run \nFederal Government that was within the bounds of what the Constitution \nsaid we were supposed to be doing. But we are not anywhere close to \nthat. There is so much fraud, so much waste, so many well-connected \ngoodies going to the well-endowed and well-heeled in this country \nbecause they have a connection politically, and we need to clean it \nout.\n  Everything ought to be competitively bid. There is no reason for it \nnot to be competitively bid. To pass up that $65 billion a year because \nwe do not do it--there is another thing we do. We spend $8 billion a \nyear maintaining properties the Federal Government does not want. Think \nabout that. For 3 years, I have tried to get through real property \nreform and cannot get it through. We either need to tear these \nstructures down so we quit spending money on them or sell them, but we \nshould not continue to spend $8 billion a year on buildings and \nproperties we do not need. We have not done a thing to solve that \nproblem in the last 3 years.\n  I have a book full of further examples. Just think about this: We \nwant people to go into math, engineering, science, and technology. \nEverybody agrees with that. We know if we can get our younger students \ngoing into those areas, that is where they are going to have their \ngreatest benefits of having a wonderful living in utilizing those \nskills.\n  The Federal Government has 105 different programs through six \ndifferent agencies to incentivize math, engineering, science, and \ntechnology. The administrative cost for 105 different programs is \nridiculous, and not 1 of them has a metric on it of whether it is \nworking. So every time somebody raises the issue, some Senator comes \nand creates another new program, and we pass it, and we never look at \nwhat we are doing already. We do not eliminate things that are not \neffective. We do not put metrics on it to say we are going to look at \nthis every year, and if it is not working we are going to get rid of it \nor we are going to fix it, and we are not going to create another \nprogram. Yet we have 105 different programs.\n\n  In the month of December, my staff found 640 separate instances just \nlike that where we have duplication of programs across government \nagencies. In\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\nthe last debt limit extension, we passed one of my amendments that said \nthe GAO must report to us a governmentwide assessment of all the \nduplications in all the programs because Congress does not know it. We \ndo not know what is out there. So we see another problem. It does not \nmatter that we may have 105 programs working on it; we go create \nanother one. That is called incompetence. It is also called laziness.\n  Just inside the Department of Education are 230 duplicative programs \nand $10 billion in waste, fraud, and mismanagement--230. Why? Because \nwe refuse to do the hard work of oversight.\n  So when we vote on this amendment, what we are going to be voting on \nis whether we have the courage to start making choices. If you vote to \ndefeat this amendment, what you are saying is you lack the courage to \ndo the hard work to pay for something out of waste today and \nmismanagement of Federal funds and you think the Madelines of this \nworld ought to pay for that lack of integrity and lack of hard work. \nAnd there is not another reason for it.\n  We are going to hear why you should not vote for this. We are going \nto hear why it is going to be hard if we take $18.2 billion out of the \nmanagement accounts of all these agencies. It is just going to be, out \nof what is there, about 3 percent of the cash that is sitting idle--\nabout 3 percent of what will be idle in 2011. What is idle this year, \nit will be less than 3 percent; it will be about 2.5 percent. Yet we \nare going to vote it down. We are going to vote it down because we care \nmore about making a political point than doing the hard work of getting \nour country back on track.\n  We do not have forever to get our country back on track. If we get to \n90 to 100 percent of our GDP, the job of making these decisions becomes \n3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 times more difficult because we will have \nless growth. We have a precarious economy right now. It is coming out \nof a recession. We want that growth to boom. We want those jobs to be \ncreated. When we borrow more money, we are putting a brake on that.\n  So if we can utilize the money we already have, we get the \nstimulatory effect of getting people unemployment insurance that buys \nthe necessities of life, but we are not adding to the debt, which \ndepresses the economy.\n  I will close for right now on this amendment. I will ask for the yeas \nand nays at a time that is agreeable to the majority leader.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we seem to be muddling along here with \nshort-term extensions and incremental stimulus bills to deal with a \nfailure as this Congress decides what we are going to do about \nunemployment insurance and physicians' pay and things of that matter \nthat are in the bill.\n  I believe this is an important discussion, I do, and I am worried \nabout where we are. This legislation before us would add another $18.1 \nbillion to the national debt. Just like that, another $18 billion. \nOddly, that is almost the same amount of money that was tacked on to \nthe Defense bill last year, and I produced a chart about it and \ndemonstrated what happens when we get into that mode of appropriating, \nwhen we forget what our budget is and we treat everything as an \nemergency and just ignore our budget and spend. The truth is, this \ncannot continue.\n  Every witness we have had before the Budget Committee--every one--\ntwo-thirds of which are usually called by our Democratic leader, and \nusually about one-third are Republican witnesses--have all said our \nspending and our debt is at an unsustainable rate. They didn't say that \nlightly. What they meant was it is unsustainable. We cannot continue to \nspend like this and to borrow this amount of money on top of the $800 \nbillion that is now being spent that we appropriated last year--$800 \nbillion. Every penny of that $800 billion is borrowed because we don't \nhave the money. We are already in debt to fund another $800 billion in \nstimulus, and we will have to, of course, borrow that.\n  I think a lot of people haven't understood that. People tell me, when \nI am in my State, that they are shocked, stunned, and worried about our \nspending. They know we are spending too much, but I don't think they \nknow how much we actually are spending and how much we are adding to \nour debt and that it can threaten the future viability of the American \neconomy for a short-term benefit.\n  I will just remind my colleagues that the history of stimulating an \neconomy with borrowed money has not been too good. If it was, Japan \nwould have a booming economy today. They have been trying this year \nafter year and it has not worked for them.\n  We were told we would have an unemployment rate that would stop at 8 \npercent if we would just pass this $800 billion and borrow the money \nand spend it today to stimulate the economy. It sounds so good. It \nsounds so tempting. But I didn't believe it was an appropriate \nallocation of that much money, No. 1; and No. 2, that the money we were \nbeing asked to spend was going to be spent in ways that would stimulate \nthe economy and create jobs.\n  I cited here before the vote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal by \nGary Becker, the Nobel Prize winner from the University of Chicago. Mr. \nBecker said that, in his opinion, the bill fell far short of being the \nkind of stimulative spending that would create jobs and help this \neconomy bounce back and, therefore, he had to oppose it. Mr. Becker is \nin his seventies and he was just sharing his experience. He had another \nperson participate with him in the research that led them to that \nrecommendation. Was Mr. Becker proven right or not?\n  The great tragedy--the biggest tragedy with the stimulus package--was \nwhat little stimulus we got. If you spend $800 billion, it is \nbreathtaking how much that can be done with it. The Alabama general \nfund budget for the entire State, including State government and State \ntroopers and all of that is less than $2 billion. But $800 billion? \nThat is huge. So I am worried about what we are doing.\n  At the time the legislation passed--this stimulus package that added \nso much to our debt--the Congressional Budget Office, whose Director is \nhired by our Democratic majority, had good people working in that \noffice. They try to do a good job. They have some economists who I \nthink have been successful in years past at predicting things. They \nsaid: Yes, if you spend $800 billion in the next 2 to 3 years, you will \nhave an economic benefit during that period, there is no doubt. They \ndidn't predict a lot--not nearly as much as a lot of people said it \nwould do--but they predicted some benefit. But do you know what they \nsaid? They said over 10 years that this economic spending, this \nborrowing to spend, would actually weaken the economy and the total \ngrowth over 10 years would be less than if we did not pass the stimulus \npackage at all. It does appear if they were in error, their error was \nthat we did not get as much growth as they predicted in the short run. \nBut when you spend $800 billion, surely you are going to get some \nbenefit--some, economically. But we have not gotten what we need. It \nwas not crafted in that way.\n\n  It was a bill that said it was going to fix crumbling infrastructure, \nand what happened? We spent less than 4 percent of this money on \nbridges and roads. We spent it mostly on social spending, we spent it \non State aid, we spent it on a lot of different things. But at least \nwhen you build a road you have a highway that is there and it will be \nthere for another 50 or 100 years, making the Nation more productive \nand efficient. But this other kind of spending has produced so little \nfor us. I express my concern about that.\n  All of this is where we are. The point is simply this. The spending \ntrack we are on is unsustainable because in 2008 our total public debt \nwas $5.8 trillion. It is more than that if you consider the gross debt, \nthe internal debt, but this is what is held by private investors from \naround the world and in the United States--$5.8 trillion. By 2013 it \nwill double to $l1.8 trillion; by 2019 it will be $17.3 trillion, and \nthere is no plan to pay it down. But in 2019, 2020, we are talking \nabout deficits of almost another $1 trillion a year. So we are not even \nclose to moving to a balanced\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\nbudget, much less paying down this debt.\n  Where does the money come from? As I said, we borrow that. This chart \nshows what the borrowing costs are. When you borrow money, people pay \ninterest, you pay them interest on the money they give you. They loan \nyou money, you pay them rent on the money. They do not give you money \nfor no good reason.\n  In 2009 we paid $187 billion in interest that 1 year. Remember, \nAlabama's general fund budget is $2 billion; the Federal highway bill a \nyear or so ago was $40 billion. We spent $187 billion, almost five \ntimes the highway bill. But look what happens in 2020 after we spent \nall this money and run up our debt--$840 billion in interest payments \nin 1 year. That exceeds the Defense bill, it exceeds any other bill in \nour budget. It is a stunning number. These are Congressional Budget \nOffice numbers based on the President's budget. Surely something will \nintervene. We will elect somebody, somewhere--in this Senate, \nprobably--who is going to say no to this because the American people \nare getting hot about it. Some people are going to be wondering why \nthey are no longer here, if they keep up with this kind of stuff.\n  They say don't worry about this, it is just $18 billion, and after \nthe $800 billion, $18 billion may look small. But let me show you what \nI demonstrated previously with $18 billion when you cheat, or you add \nit and bust the budget by one $18 billion expenditure.\n  In 2010 we slipped another $18 billion on the Defense appropriations \nbill, and added it to the debt. People said don't worry, it is just $18 \nbillion. But it goes into the baseline. It goes into your basic funding \nof the government. So what happens next year when you say OK, we are \nnot going to spend this $18 billion. They say: You are cutting \nspending. We cannot do that. You can't cut spending. Besides, we need \nan increase in spending--inflation was 2 percent. We need at least 2 \npercent.\n  The State Department got a 30-percent increase in funding this past \nyear. The Environmental Protection Agency got a 30-percent increase in \nfunding.\n  Look at that. What if you do it another year? You come up with \nanother $18 billion. You got around the budget, you declared it an \nemergency event and you spent another $18 billion. It is not just $18 \nbillion because you have $18 billion in the first baseline, you add \nanother to it and that year it has cost the taxpayers $36 billion. \nLet's say the next year, 2013, now you are adding $18 billion to $36 \nbillion and it is $54 billion in your baseline. You have another budget \ngimmick to add $18 billion and you end up with $72 billion that year.\n  This is how we get out of control. And you end up, that $18 billion, \nwhen it goes into the baseline and we do not understand how it \noccurred, increases our spending to a degree that we should not do. So \nthat ends up, if you add it up, to $990 billion from an $18-billion-a-\nyear gimmick, manipulation, violation of the budget.\n  What I want to say is this bill before us today violates the budget. \nIt is for unemployment compensation, it is for other things that are \nnot emergencies. They are part of our governmental operation that needs \nto be paid for. Luckily, we have some money to pay for it. We have it \nin an unspent stimulus package. We have some opportunities that our \nDemocratic colleagues have said they could take money from in the past. \nIf we put all those together we could pay for this, fund this bill \nwithout having to borrow it all.\n  I am at a point where I am not inclined to go along with this \nanymore. I think the American people are of the same mind. What we have \nto do is we have to lead and we have to be responsible like our \nGovernors. They are having to face challenges. Our mayors are having to \nface challenges. They are making tough decisions. But not us. We spend \nmore, not less. We are spending more. I believe we have done enough. We \nhave gone beyond what is logical and reasonable. We are in the realm of \nreckless and dangerous and it is time for us to begin having a national \ndiscussion in this country and in this Congress about how much we can \nborrow to spend today to make our life better today and then shift that \ndebt to the future.\n  The reason CBO said that the $800 billion would not advance the \neconomy over 10 years, it actually would hurt the economy over 10 \nyears, is that you crowd out investment. If the government borrows $800 \nbillion, it is not available for private people who need to go out and \nborrow money. It has already been loaned to the government. It crowds \nout, the economists said, private borrowing.\n  Also, we have an interest on it that we have to carry and pay every \nyear that is a burden on every generation. Every young person after us \nwill carry that interest burden. It hurts them and makes them less able \nto prosper and to have economic growth. So it is a moral question: How \nmuch can we afford to benefit ourselves this very day and shift it to \nour children and to what extent do we need to be responsible? I think \nit is time to get responsible, so reluctantly I feel an obligation to \nvote no to this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand in strong support of the comments \nof my distinguished colleague from Alabama. Of course I agree with \nvirtually every single Member of the Senate that these programs need to \nbe extended. But I also agree with many Members here, and the huge \nmajority of the American people, that we need to pay for it. We cannot \nkeep running up the deficit as though it had no consequence to us and \nour economy and our children and grandchildren. The American people get \nit. Certainly my constituents in Louisiana get it. They say of course \nyou need to extend necessary programs and of course you cannot run up \nthe deficit to do it every 2 months.\n  Mr. President, $18 billion--the distinguished Senator from Alabama \nhas used the figure over and over, and he is right, $18 billion, but it \nis $18 billion for 2 months of extension. So we are supposed to come \nback every 2 months and put another $18 billion on our kids' and \ngrandkids' tab? It is $108 billion over a year of increasing deficit \nand debt that is already at historic levels. That is crazy.\n  We can do better. We can meet both of those commonsense objectives of \nthe American people. We can extend necessary programs and we can do it \nin a way that does not add to deficit and debt. We have several ways to \ndo that. We have a menu of proposals. We will have votes a little later \non about doing that. In fact, before the recess we had discussions on \nthe floor of the Senate and we had come to agreement here in the Senate \nabout an extension without increasing the deficit and debt. \nUnfortunately it was rejected by the Speaker of the House. So it is not \nas though this goal of achieving both of those important objectives is \nimpossible. It is absolutely possible and many different Members have \nlaid out how to get there.\n  Let's follow the common sense of the American people. Let's follow \nthe common sense of folks all across Louisiana who say of course you \nneed to extend necessary programs and of course you cannot add to the \ndeficit and debt every month, every 2 months that you need to do this, \n$18 billion a pop, $108 billion. That is a good part of $1 trillion \nover 1 year.\n  I want to focus on a particular part of this package that is \nparticularly galling, quite frankly, for someone such as me from \nLouisiana. A tiny part of this overall bill is extending the National \nFlood Insurance Program. Again, I hope everyone agrees we need to \nextend the National Flood Insurance Program. I certainly agree with \nthat. I have certainly fought for that. It is about 1 percent of this \nbill.\n  Do you know what percent it is of the debt increase, the deficit \nincrease? It is zero percent of that because that extension does not \neven increase the deficit or debt in any way. So it should not be held \nup by this debate in any way, shape, or form--a necessary program, 1 \npercent of the bill in terms of dollar figures, zero deficit and debt \nincrease, zero impact on that central issue. Why can't we at least come \ntogether and extend that necessary program immediately and not have \nthat held up at all? It never should have been held up before the \nrecess. It should not be held up now. There is a simple way to fix that \nand the simple way is to take that portion of the bill out; to extend \nit immediately. I do not think there is any opposition to the \nunderlying extension of the program. It has zero impact on the deficit \nand debt\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\nso there is no reason for it to be caught up in this other debate.\n  With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of S. 3203. That is a bill I have \nintroduced that extends the National Flood Insurance Program for the \nsame amount of time as this underlying bill but does it separately. I \nask that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I might \nnote that the Senator seeks to take up and pass one of the specific \nprovisions in the underlying bill, section 7 in the underlying bill. \nSince the Senator seems to be endorsing a part of the underlying bill, \nand the pending Baucus amendment, I might ask the Senator to amend his \nrequest to provide for the passage of all of the underlying bill and \npending Baucus amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. I will be happy to do that in a version that is paid for, \nincorporating the very sensible, commonsense objections that have been \noffered to pay for all of this extension. So I would be happy to amend \nmy request in that manner if the Senator would agree to it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So the Senator is not willing to amend his request for \npassage of all of the underlying bill containing the section 7?\n  Mr. VITTER. Not if it increases the deficit and debt $108 billion a \nyear. No, sir, I am not. And the American people are not. And the \nAmerican people are getting fed up with it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am constrained to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reclaiming my time, the suggestion was pretty simple. \nThere is the one element of this bill which is a necessary program for \nall of the United States, particularly for flood-prone areas. It is 1 \npercent of the overall bill, but it is zero percent of the deficit and \ndebt increase. It has no impact on deficit and debt. So the suggestion \nwas pretty simple: Why don't we take that out? Why have that stalled \nbecause of this broader debate? Let's take that out and pass it. There \nshould be no objection to that. Everybody is for the program. It does \nnot increase the deficit and debt. Unfortunately, there is objection \nfrom the Democratic chairman.\n  I hope we have given the chairman and other Members of the majority \nthe detailed proposal. It is, as the chairman said, taking section 7 \nout and passing it separately because it has no deficit and debt \nimpact. I would urge the chairman and others to look at that and to \nhopefully agree to that because--I heard the objection. I don't \nunderstand the basis for the objection, and I would be happy to hear \nthe basis for the objection because I just don't understand it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana supports part \nof the bill. I would just ask the Senator to broaden his mind to \nsupport all of the bill. That way, we can get this done.\n  Mr. VITTER. Sort of like the ``Louisiana purchase'' with health care \nreform. Let's put one sweetener in the bill to pass something really \nbad--a $108 billion debt increase over a year. Let's take one hostage, \nincluding folks who are held hostage who need this insurance, to pass a \ndebt increase that big because otherwise that is a stinker.\n  I get it. I have seen that deal played out over and over, including \nwith the ``Louisiana purchase'' for health care reform. I am not taking \nthat offer, no offense. I hope the Senator will reconsider my very \nreasonable proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are a number of reasons to oppose \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. First, it would \nreverse the considered judgment of the Congress as expressed through \nthe annual appropriations process. Congress has spoken on \nappropriations that are authorized and obligated, and his amendment \ndefers that considered judgment. I will defer, frankly, to the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee to address these concerns in greater \ndetail when he arrives on the floor.\n  Second, the House of Representatives has made it clear that it views \nunemployment insurance and the other provisions in this bill as \nemergency provisions. The House has made clear that it would send the \nbill back to us again if we adopted the amendment by the Senator from \nOklahoma. That is clear. I have had conversations with the House. It is \nclear that it would be sent back, and that would needlessly delay much \nneeded aid to the people receiving unemployment insurance benefits. \nLet's not forget that there are so many people--200,000 people, in \nfact--who are not receiving benefits because we let the legislation \nexpire. It has expired. So 200,000 people today who are entitled to \nunemployment insurance payments are not getting them, and if we send \nthe bill back to the House again, that is further delay. It will not be \nlong before that number of 200,000 is going to double to 400,000. That \nis just playing games with the lives of unemployed Americans.\n  Third, and perhaps most dramatically, the amendment would delegate \npowers to rescind $20 billion to the unelected Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget. This would be a breathtaking abdication of \nCongress's power of the purse. In the Federalist Papers, the power of \nthe purse is described as the most singular power to protect the rights \nof the free people. We should not quickly surrender that power, and the \nSenator's amendment would surrender that power to the tune of $20 \nbillion. The Senator's amendment would give the Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget a blank check. It would give him the power to \ncut whatever unobligated balances he should choose. This is truly a \nsweeping grant of power, and it is truly a dramatic surrender of that \npower.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma talked about budget deficits. He and I \nagree. We do, as a nation, need to address the budget deficits. As a \nrhetorical question, he asked: When is the time to make the changes to \nbalance the budget? The Senator asked the question as if the answer \nwere self-evident, but the answer is not self-evident.\n  A wise person once said: For every difficult question, there is \nusually a very simple answer and it is usually not true. This is an \nexample of that maxim at work.\n  The simple answer in this case would be to require the government to \nbalance the budget every year, year-in and year-out. That is pretty \nsimple. That answer, even though it sounds nice, would be wrong. The \nNation should balance the budget over the course of a business cycle. \nWe should spend in a recession and exercise more discipline when the \ncountry is very prosperous to get the budget under control.\n  But the Nation should not attempt to balance the budget in the grips \nof a recession. Why is that? That is because in a recession, business \nslows down. People actually pay less tax revenue to the government. In \na recession, spending on automatic stabilizer programs automatically \nincreases, like unemployment benefits, food stamps, and many others. \nThat is what should happen during a recession. To do otherwise would be \neconomically disastrous.\n  To try to balance the budget in the grips of a recession would mean \nraising taxes or cutting spending even more than is automatically \noccurring. That would reduce the amount of demand in the economy, and \nthat would further slow economic growth and put even more people out of \nwork. So most reputable economists would say you should not try to \nbalance the budget in a recession. There is pretty broad agreement on \nthat point among reputable economists.\n  So that is why it does not make sense to try to balance the budget \nthis year. Yes, we should balance the budget over the business cycle, \nbut we should not try to raise taxes and cut spending even more to \nbalance the budget right now. And that is why it does make sense to \nspend money on unemployment insurance benefits as an emergency matter.\n  As the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said, spending on \nunemployment insurance benefits is one of the most effective things \nCongress can do to increase economic growth. It is one of the most \neffective things we can do to save and create jobs. For every dollar we \nspend on unemployment insurance benefits, the Congressional Budget \nOffice says economic growth is increased by up to $1.90; it is\n\n[[Page S2281]]\n\nalmost a 2-to-1 return on our investment. That is a pretty sound \ninvestment.\n  That is the economic reason why it makes sense to spend now on \nunemployment insurance benefits and to balance the budget over a longer \nperiod, but even more compelling is the human reason. The human reason \nis people such as the single dad in Missoula, MT, who depends on the \nextra unemployment insurance benefits to support his daughters and put \nfood on the table. He called the Montana unemployment office, and we \nlearned that this fellow said he honestly did not know how he was going \nto make ends meet without these benefits. The Senate should not be \nplaying games with the lives of people like this man and his daughter \nin Missoula and all of the other men and women around the country who \ndesperately depend on unemployment payments to make ends meet. Congress \nshould not balance the budget on the backs of the unemployed.\n  Last of all, we must reject amendments like these. That is why we \nshould pass the underlying bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this is the third time we find ourselves \ndebating the same rescission amendment that sounds like good policy on \nfirst blush but in fact is not.\n   Members need to understand that this amendment is irresponsible \ngoverning, and causes harm to our national and international security, \nand to our economy.\n   Members on the other side of the aisle have frequently criticized \nthe majority party for asking them to vote on measures that they have \nnot had a chance to thoroughly read or comprehend.\n   But that is certainly what Members are being asked to do today.\n   It is irresponsible to vote in support of this amendment that \nindiscriminately cuts $20 billion from discretionary projects and \nservices given that we do not know what programs are impacted by such \nsignificant cuts.\n   On January 27 of this year I spoke at some length about an almost \nidentical amendment offered by the junior Senator from Oklahoma, and \nagain on March 3 about an almost identical amendment offered by the \njunior Senator from Kentucky. Today it is the junior Senator from \nOklahoma's turn to offer the amendment again.\n  I would like to take just a few moments to remind my colleagues of \nwhy they voted against this amendment twice already, and why I hope \nthey will again choose to vote against this financially irresponsible \nand harmful amendment.\n  The majority of unobligated balances are not eligible for rescission \nunder this amendment because they are, in fact, mandatory funds.\n  Second, because of the small amount of unobligated funding eligible \nfor rescission, this amendment indiscriminately rescinds prior year \nunobligated funding from certain critical programs, jeopardizing our \nnational defense, and our homeland security.\n  I have mentioned this before, but need to mention it again because \nnothing has changed between January, March and today.\n  While we cannot say with certainty which programs are impacted by \nthis amendment, here are some of the expected impacts based on current \ndiscretionary unobligated balances available.\n  We require the Department of Defense to budget up front for all the \ncosts required to procure military equipment such as ships or aircraft. \nBut it takes several years to complete construction.\n  For shipbuilding specifically, funds provided to the Department of \nDefense are available for obligation for 5 years.\n  Rescinding unobligated funds now could require the Navy to cancel \ncontracts for ships under construction and layoff thousands of workers \nacross our Nation's shipyards.\n  In terms of our veterans who have returned from war or have fought \nbravely in past wars, this amendment could impact the construction of \nnew hospitals by the Veterans Administration. It takes a few years to \nbuild a hospital. The Veterans Administration requests full funding for \na construction project in the first year. As a result, the VA has 43 \nactive major construction projects at various stages of completion \ntotaling over $1.6 billion in unobligated balances. This could be wiped \nout. Over 49,000 construction jobs would be terminated with the loss of \nthat funding, further delaying critical services to our brave men and \nwomen who have served. We made a solemn promise to them.\n  Rescinding unobligated balances in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity could stop the construction of the Coast Guard national \nsecurity cutter and would rescind funding for the purchase of explosive \ndetection systems. Rescinding unobligated balances in NOAA could create \na minimum 6-month gap in coverage for the geostationary weather \nsatellite system which focuses directly over the United States and \nconstantly and accurately monitors storm conditions. Over 200 employees \nwould lose their jobs.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma argues that if funding is not spent \nimmediately, then it is not necessary. This reasoning is irresponsible \nwhen it comes to overseeing taxpayers' dollars and the capitalization \nof large projects such as ships, hospitals, and satellites. I am \ncertain everyone in this Chamber knows that a ship is not built in a \nyear. I hope everyone knows that a hospital is not built and equipped \nin a year. I hope everyone knows that satellites are not built and \nlaunched every year.\n  In addition to the potential impact on large procurements, this \namendment could impact the funding of programs the Congress voted on \nand agreed to provide only a few months ago. The impact of these cuts \ncould have significant consequences for many critical services such as \nHUD programs providing affordable housing to our Nation's low-income \ncitizens--we had a great debate on that here--or funding for climate \nchange research or funding to purchase explosive detection equipment \nfor airports.\n  This is a bad amendment with bad consequences. It is time for us, the \nMembers of the Senate, to act responsibly. We have a well established \nprocess for funding the Federal Government. It involves the Budget \nCommittee that sets our allocations. It involves the consideration and \napproval by the Senate of every appropriations bill. I can assure my \ncolleagues in this Chamber that the Appropriations Committee takes this \nresponsibility seriously. Every agency budget is reviewed and oversight \nprovided throughout the year. Each year the Appropriations Committee \nrecommends rescissions of funds that are not needed, but those \nrescissions are based on detailed oversight and understanding of the \nprograms, not indiscriminate action such as this amendment.\n  This amendment is not based on careful review, would harm many \nworthwhile programs, and fails to meet the test of proper oversight.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3723, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I send to the desk a modification of the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify his \namendment at this time.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESCISSION OF UNSPENT AND UNCOMMITTED FEDERAL FUNDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, of all available unobligated Federal funds, the greater \n     of $40,000,000,000 the amount determined necessary under the \n     Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-139; 124 \n     Stat. 8) to offset the budgetary effect of this Act, \n     excluding this section, in appropriated discretionary \n     unexpired funds are rescinded.\n       (b) Implementation.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall--\n       (1) identify the accounts and amounts rescinded to \n     implement subsection (a); and\n       (2) submit a report to the Secretary of the Treasury and \n     Congress of the accounts and amounts identified under \n     paragraph (1) for rescission.\n\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am prepared for the vote anytime the \nchairman of the Finance Committee is ready to proceed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to table the Coburn amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), and the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican leader and I have discussed \nthis vote that will take place at 5:45, if the unanimous consent \nrequest is granted, and we are going to keep the vote open for a while. \nThere are a number of things people have to do this evening, and there \nis one Senator, because of the funeral of his best friend, who is going \nto be getting here late, so we will keep the vote open until he returns \nfrom the funeral. Everyone knows that. I have spoken to the Republican \nleader and he is fine with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:45 p.m. \ntoday the motion to proceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich the Budget Act was not waived be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be agreed to, and the Senate then proceed to a vote on the \nBaucus motion to waive all applicable Budget Act points of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Cobell v. Salazar Settlement\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I want to speak \nabout two issues. First is something called the Cobell settlement, \nwhich perhaps many will not know about. It is the settlement of a class \naction lawsuit against the federal government for mismanaging the trust \naccounts of American Indians for well over a century.\n  The trust accounts for American Indians come from property that \nbelonged to the Indians that the federal government holds in trust. The \ntrust was managed by the U.S. Interior Department and many accounts \nover a long period of time were mismanaged. Revenue from oil wells, \nfrom extraction of minerals, and revenue from leasing lands for cattle \nnever showed up in the accounts or mailboxes of the Indians who owned \nthe property. Many of these Indians and members of the class action \nhave long since passed away, not having survived the 14 years of this \nlawsuit. The lawsuit has been ongoing for some 14 years now, and the \nFederal court has become very impatient while waiting for Congressional \napproval.\n  At long last, the Interior Secretary, Secretary Salazar, negotiated \nan agreement to settle the Cobell suit. Friday, April 16th, is the \nthird date which the court set for Congress to act on this settlement. \nWe will miss this date just as we missed the first two dates. The court \nhas just now indicated that it will approve a fourth date by which the \nCongress must act to approve this settlement of Indian claims. The \njudge has also indicated that if Congress does not act, he will invite \nsome Members of the Congress to his court to talk about why action was \nnot taken. That would probably be an interesting constitutional issue.\n  In any event, the judge in this case is very impatient and wants to \nsee the settlement approved by Congress.\n  The first Americans, Indians who are owed this money and for whom the \nsettlement was acceptable and, the Interior Secretary, who has called \nme many times urging approval of the settlement, are also very \nimpatient. I hope we will not miss a fourth deadline established by the \nFederal court.\n\n       Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber and in the House \n     of Representatives have an obligation. Literally, money was \n     stolen from American Indians, from property they owned and \n     the income from that property that was supposed to go for \n     their assistance and living conditions because it was owned \n     by them, and in many cases these accounts were mismanaged, \n     and in some cases the money was stolen.\n\n  This settlement, which will be paid from the United States Judgement \nFund, is fair and is long overdue. It will settle a lawsuit that has \nlanguished for about 14 years. I hope, in working with the House of \nRepresentatives, we will not miss another deadline. Perhaps if we do, \nthe judge will ask some Members of Congress to visit with him. We will \nsee what happens as a result of that.\n  Mr. President, on another matter, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor 5 more minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Brigadier General Michael J. Walsh\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would not criticize another Member of \nthe Senate on the floor of the Senate--certainly not by name--unless I \nfirst had told the Senator I was intending to do so. I have done that, \nand I will shortly explain why.\n  There is a man named GEN Michael Walsh, a commander in the Corps of \nEngineers. He is an extraordinary general. He is a one-star general, a \nbrigadier general, and he has been recommended for the rank of major \ngeneral. That recommendation was made nearly 6 months ago.\n  Six months ago, the Armed Services Committee, with the support of \nSenator Levin, the chairman, and Senator John McCain, the ranking \nmember, unanimously approved the promotion to major general for Michael \nWalsh. Six months ago that action was taken in the committee. There has \nbeen no major general rank for General Walsh because it has been held \nup on the Senate floor, with what is called a hold, by a Member of the \nSenate, Senator Vitter from Louisiana.\n  The fact is, this is an extraordinary general, a general who has been \nto war. This is a general who went to Iraq to fight for this country. \nThis general has 30 years of distinguished service to America, a \npatriot. He doesn't make the policy at the Corps of Engineers. This is \na commander who executes the policy at the Corps of Engineers.\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\n  My colleague, in letters to the Corps of Engineers, is upset with the \nCorps of Engineers and is demanding they do certain things that the \nCorps in some cases cannot and in other cases will not do because it is \nunwise. Some of the demands have been met where the Corps believed it \nwas appropriate, although it has not been funded yet because that has \nto be done by the Appropriations Committee. The Corps cannot meet other \ndemands. I opposed one of the significant ones brought to the \nAppropriations Committee, and upon my opposition, the full \nAppropriations Committee voted against it. So it is not going to \nhappen.\n  But to hold up a general's rank to major general, hold up his \npromotion and have him now 6 months behind other generals both in pay \nand promotion and opportunity is just unfair. It is just not fair. This \nis not someone who can fix the aches and pains and ills and concerns of \nmy colleague from Louisiana.\n  This is a general who is a patriot and has served this country for 30 \nyears. I don't think he ought to be used as a pawn in some concerns \nabout water policy or concerns about issues in New Orleans or Louisiana \ndealing with flood control and responding to the needs of that city and \nthat State. As chairman of the committee that funds energy and water \nprograms, I can tell you that we have sent billions and billions of \ndollars down to Louisiana and to New Orleans--I am proud to have done \nit--in order to say, after Hurricane Katrina and during the rebuilding, \nto the people of Louisiana: You are not alone, we are with you. We have \nspent a lot of money doing that. I am proud to have been a part of \nthat.\n  But the demands that are required now by Senator Vitter in order for \nhim to lift a hold on the move to the rank of major general for a one-\nstar general who has served this country for 30 years and fought in \nIraq, in my judgment, are unfair. We should not hold a general's \npromotion and career hostage to the demands of one Member of the \nSenate. That is exactly what has happened for 6 months.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a January 13 \nletter from my colleague to the Corps of Engineers. It is a letter from \nmy colleague, Senator Vitter; a March 12 letter in response to that \nletter by the Corps of Engineers to Senator Vitter; a March 16 letter \nto the Corps of Engineers from Senator Vitter; and, finally, a March 19 \nletter back to Senator Vitter from the Corps of Engineers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 13, 2010.\n     Brigadier General Michael J. Walsh,\n     Commander, Mississippi Valley Division, United States Army \n         Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg, MS.\n       Dear General Walsh: Here is a detailed brief of the issues \n     I would like you to address for me to release my current \n     nomination hold. This list was also hand delivered to you and \n     your staff in our meeting November 5, 2009.\n       Issues for Resolution:\n\n\n                    Outfall Canals/Pump to the River\n\n       Request: Corps provide a formal commitment to complete a \n     comprehensive risk analysis associated with the three options \n     laid out in the Corps pumping station report within 18 \n     months, suspend any activity unless the activity is \n     consistent with options 2 and 2a described in the Corps \n     report, and conduct a feasibility level of analysis \n     (including a cost estimate) for the project.\n\n\n                            Ouachita Levees\n\n       Request: Corps performs bank stabilization or levee \n     setbacks as needed to stabilize the flood control structures.\n       Cite past practice by the Corps in performing levee \n     setbacks under FCA of 1928 and the MR Program, or,\n       Raise the issue that much of the bank caving has been \n     caused by barge wakes, which are the result of the federal \n     navigation channel project, or,\n       Use P.L. 84-99, 33 USC 701, Flood Emergencies.\n\n\n                                 agmac\n\n       * * *\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of the Army, Office of the Assistant \n           Secretary, Civil Works,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2010.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: This letter is in response to your \n     letter of January 13, 2010, and follow up to meetings held on \n     November 19, 2009 and March 2, 2010, regarding issues that \n     you would like the Army Corps Engineers to address in order \n     for you to release your current nomination hold on Brigadier \n     General (P) Michael J. Walsh. We have thoroughly analyzed all \n     nine issues. Our response to each issue raised in your \n     January 13, 2010 letter follows below. We have made every \n     effort to provide you the best way forward within the limits \n     of existing law, funding and policy for each of the nine \n     issues.\n\n\n               Issue 1: Outfall Canals/Pump to the River\n\n       REQUEST: Corps provide a formal commitment to complete a \n     comprehensive risk analysis associated with the three options \n     laid out in the Corps pumping station report within 18 \n     months, suspend any activity unless the activity is \n     consistent with options 2 and 2a described in the Corps \n     report, and conduct a feasibility level of analysis \n     (including a cost estimate) for the period.\n       In fulfillment of the requests of the Louisiana Coastal \n     Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA), the Southeast \n     Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East, Jefferson Parish, \n     and the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans, which you \n     have supported, the Corps previously agreed to construct the \n     permanent structures and pump stations with adaptability \n     measures that will facilitate addition of Options 2 or 2a \n     features should either option be authorized and funded by \n     Congress for construction or undertaken and funded by non-\n     Federal interests in the future. In light of the limited \n     service life of the existing temporary pumps (estimated to \n     expire in 2011-2013), it is vitally important for the \n     protection of the citizens of New Orleans that a permanent \n     pumping solution be implemented as quickly as possible, and \n     suspension of any activity not consistent with Options 2 and \n     2a would create an unacceptable risk to the citizens. The \n     Corps will conduct a supplementary risk reduction analysis as \n     part of the detailed engineering feasibility study, including \n     the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance \n     documentation, for Options 2 and 2a, if Congress appropriates \n     funds for the study. When completed we would transmit the \n     study to the Office of Management and Budget for \n     consideration of submission to Congress for appropriate \n     action. This study would provide the information necessary to \n     allow the Congress to make an informed decision on \n     authorization of Option 2 or 2a. As we discussed, we estimate \n     that it will cost $15.6 million and take approximately 36 \n     months to complete this study (including NEPA compliance).\n\n\n                     Issue 2: Ouachita River Levees\n\n       REQUEST: Corps performs bank stabilization or levee \n     setbacks as needed to stabilize the flood control structures.\n       At you urging, the Corps is using Public Law (PL) 84-99 to \n     address bank caving associated with recent flood events. We \n     have identified 8 to 9 discrete sites, addressing bank caving \n     along approximately one percent of the Ouachita River and \n     Tributaries project, where it appears that damages have \n     occurred as a result of flood events during the period of \n     October 2009 to January 2010. We anticipate that the cost of \n     pursuing the repair work at these sites will cost \n     approximately $10-$20 million.\n       The Corps' assessment indicates that the bank caving along \n     the Ouachita River is not attributable to vessel wash. In \n     addition, the bank caving is not associated with features of \n     the Mississippi Rivers and Tributaries (MR) project. The \n     authorization for the Ouachita River and Tributaries projects \n     specifies that levee maintenance is a non-Federal \n     responsibility. Congress has not enacted a general provision \n     of law that would supplant this non-Federal responsibility or \n     that would allow the Corps to correct levee damages that are \n     not associated with flood events.\n\n\n         Issue 3: Acadia Gulf of Mexico Access Channel (AGMAC)\n\n       REQUEST: Corps work with the state (CPRA) using existing \n     CWPPRA projects along Freshwater Bayou to develop a plan to \n     build significant bank stabilization and spoils build-up \n     within the 902 limit before January 1, 2010.\n       The AGMAC request envisions the placement of dredged \n     material along the Freshwater Bayou and refers, directly or \n     indirectly, to two distinct authorities: 1) the Port of \n     Iberia navigation project authorized in Water Resources \n     Development Act (WRDA) of 2007 at a total cost of \n     $131,250,000; and 2) the CWPPRA authorization that provides \n     for the creation, protection, restoration, and/or enhancement \n     of wetlands to provide for the long-term conservation of such \n     wetlands and dependent fish and wildlife populations. The \n     Port of Iberia authorization directs the Corps to ``use \n     available dredged material . . . [on] the west bank of the \n     Freshwater Bayou to provide incidental storm surge protection \n     . . .'' This authorization would allow the Corps to place \n     available dredged material from the Port of Iberia navigation \n     project along the west bank of the Freshwater Bayou provided \n     this work provides incidental storm surge protection and is \n     within the applicable section 902 cost limitation. You are \n     correct that CWPPRA provides independent authority to create \n     wetlands along the Freshwater Bayou. The Corps will work with \n     the State and others to explore use of CWPPRA authority to \n     implement a project along the Freshwater Bayou. The CWPPRA \n     Task Force identifies and selects which projects will be \n     pursued under this authority. If the project is selected as a \n     nominee, then the CWPPRA Technical Committee will consider it \n     at an April 4, 2010 public meeting for further evaluation as \n     a Priority Project List 20 Candidate Project.\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\n                     Issue 4: Morganza to the Gulf\n\n       REQUEST: Corps restart the lock design on the Houma \n     Navigation Canal, provide separate authority for the Houma \n     Navigation Lock project or the next WRDA bill, and help \n     expedite the 404 permitting process on existing projects.\n       The Houma Lock is part of the Morganza to the Gulf \n     hurricane and storm damage risk reduction project, which was \n     authorized in WRDA 2007 at a total cost of $886,700,000. \n     Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the levee design \n     criteria for this project changed and, as a result, the \n     project can no longer be built for the amount envisioned by \n     the Congressional authorization. Some design work on the \n     Houma Lock had been completed based on the design criteria \n     used in the original project plan, but because this criteria \n     had changed, the Corps halted further design work on the Lock \n     pending the redesign of the overall project plan that takes \n     the new criteria into account. The Corps is not authorized to \n     construct the Houma Lock as an independent, freestanding \n     project or as a separable element of the Morganza to the Gulf \n     project, and additional authorization will be required to \n     construct the Morganza to the Gulf project in accordance with \n     the new design criteria. The Post Authorization Change report \n     required to support the request for additional authorization \n     is scheduled to be completed by December 2012. The Corps is \n     willing to resume design of the Houma Lock using the new \n     criteria, but has insufficient funds to resume this effort \n     and complete the overall project plan. The Corps will work \n     with others to expedite the Section 404 permitting process. \n     Additionally, enclosed, as a legislative drafting service, is \n     draft legislation for separate authority for the Houma \n     Navigation Lock.\n\n\n                    Issue 5: West Bank and Vicinity\n\n       REQUEST: Corps provide for O costs associated with \n     proposed navigation project on the Algiers Canal. Corps \n     policy states: (1) ``If the waterway users are subject to \n     fuel taxes paid into the IWTF, there are not any non-Federal \n     cost sharing requirements in connection with the Federal \n     project improvements to the waterway (not for LERRD, \n     construction, or OMRR)''; (2) Section 206 of the Inland \n     Waters Revenue Act of 1978, as amended, (33 U.S.C. Section \n     1804) contains the listing of inland waterways subject to \n     fuel taxes paid in to the IWTF. The Gulf Intracoastal \n     Waterway, from St. Mark's River, Florida, to Brownsville, \n     Texas, is included on that list; and (3) The Corps' decision \n     to provide, in lieu of raising the Algiers Canal Levees to \n     100-year level of protection, works along the Algiers Canal \n     and the construction of a navigation closure structure \n     complex on the GIWW does not preclude this according to its \n     internal policy associated with navigation and section 206 of \n     the Inland Waters Revenue Act of 1978.\n       The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) closure structure \n     across the Algiers Canal is part of the West Bank and \n     Vicinity project. Its purpose is to provide hurricane and \n     storm damage risk reduction. The GIWW closure structure will \n     only be operated when needed to prevent damages from storm \n     surge, or during maintenance exercises of the structure and \n     pumps. When Congress authorized this project, it specified \n     that the non-Federal Sponsor is responsible for the costs of \n     operation and maintenance. Additional authority and funding \n     would be required for the Corps to operate and maintain the \n     hurricane and storm damage reduction closure structure across \n     the Algiers canal.\n\n\n    Issue 6: New Orleans to Venice, Jesuit Bend 100-year protection\n\n       REQUEST: Formal commitment to Local Preferred Plan (LPP), \n     with milestone schedule, and a minimally visible closure at \n     Oakville.\n       The Corps is receptive to implementing a LPP for Jesuit \n     Bend as part of the incorporation of non-Federal levees into \n     the Federal New Orleans to Venice project. To date, the State \n     and Plaquemines Parish have not identified a specific LPP \n     that they are certain they want to pursue. They have asked \n     the Corps to assist them in the analytical effort necessary \n     to determine the cost of the plan and whether or not it \n     should be pursued at non-Federal expense. The State and \n     Parish must enter into a written agreement with the Corps in \n     which the State and Parish agree to pay for this analysis. \n     Once the agreement is executed, the Corps will complete the \n     analysis within four months. If the State and the Parish \n     determine that they want to pursue a LPP, the LPP must be \n     approved by the ASA(CW). Our offices will work expeditiously \n     to approve an LPP when presented. The Corps plans to \n     construct a swing gate for closure at Oakville for the West \n     Bank and Vicinity project. This closure option was considered \n     along with several other closure options, including a \n     minimally visible closure option. The Corps has determined \n     that the swing gate option was a superior closure option from \n     a risk, reliability, and operation and maintenance \n     standpoint.\n\n\n      Issue 7: Lower Atchafalaya Basin Backwater Flood Protection\n\n       REQUEST: Corps produce the study on the backwater flood \n     issue, as committed in writing to Mayor Matte on Nov 2007 and \n     Dec 2008. Because the issue pertains to the Atchafalaya River \n     and the Floodway Basin, such a study clearly should be \n     covered under MR Furthermore, the original solution to the \n     backwater flooding, the Avoca Island Levee Extension, was \n     deemed to be under MR so should any other solution to be \n     studied or proposed.\n       The Corps has the authority to conduct a study addressing \n     this backwater flooding issue and is working with the local \n     representatives on scope and schedule. The study would \n     determine if there is Federal interest and would determine if \n     the recommended solution can be implemented within existing \n     MR project authority or if additional authority would be \n     required. The Corps is willing to pursue this study effort. \n     However, since this study is a new activity, an appropriation \n     is required to initiate this effort.\n\n\n                    Issue 8: Louisiana Highway 3241\n\n       REQUEST: Corps create a significantly accelerated \n     Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or other timetable \n     compared to the current timetable.\n       Similar EIS's typically take two to three years to \n     complete. The Corps is working with the Louisiana Department \n     of Transportation and Development to streamline this process \n     and to expedite completion of the Louisiana Highway 3241 EIS. \n     Significant progress has been made on this front and the \n     current schedule for completing this effort already has been \n     reduced to 18 months. The Corps will adopt other streamlining \n     proposals provided they are acceptable under applicable law \n     and regulation. The Corps will provide your office with \n     monthly reports advising you of further schedule adjustments.\n\n\n               Issue 9: Louisiana Water Resources Council\n\n       REQUEST: Corps create and fund the Louisiana Water \n     Resources Council, as mandated in WRDA 2007.\n       The Corps previously planned to establish the Louisiana \n     Water Resources Council with appropriations specifically made \n     available for this purpose. The Corps will now use existing \n     appropriations. The Corps has developed a proposed draft \n     charter that was forwarded to the State of Louisiana on \n     February, 26, 2010, and has received initial comments that \n     are under consideration.\n       We trust that it is evident the Corps and the Army have \n     listened to you carefully and are providing the answers in \n     this letter as our best attempt to address your concerns. We \n     both look forward to resolving the nomination hold on a very \n     able and deserving General Officer in the very near future.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Jo-Ellen Darcy,\n                    Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works).\n\n                                            R. L. Van Antwerp,\n\n                                      Lieutenant General, US Army,\n     Chief of Engineers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 2010.\n     Hon. Jo-Ellen Darcy,\n     Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), Washington, \n         DC.\n     Lieutenant General Robert Van Antwerp,\n     Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Washington, DC.\n     Re Brigadier General Walsh Issues.\n       Dear Secretary Darcy and Lieutenant General Van Antwerp: \n     Thank you for our most recent meeting two weeks ago and the \n     commitments you made, including to have the Louisiana Water \n     Resources Council operating within four months of that \n     meeting.\n       I identified a finite number of follow-up questions/\n     requests at that meeting. Although you always underscore how \n     time-sensitive Brigadier General Walsh's promotion is, you \n     still have not responded to those questions/requests, \n     including in your letter of March 12, 2010.\n       In one final effort to resolve this impasse, I offer the \n     following very short list of three items, some of the details \n     of which are different from our last discussion. Please \n     indicate in writing if the Corps can honor all of these \n     requests.\n\n\n                  1. Outfall Cauals/Pump to the River\n\n       Request: Corps conduct within 18 months a formal cost/\n     benefit analysis, using existing Corps' authority and money, \n     of previously cited project options 1, 2, 2a, and any other \n     options the Corps deems advisable to consider. This cost/\n     benefit analysis to be peer reviewed by the soon-to-be \n     operational Louisiana Water Resources Council. The Corps \n     clearly has the authority for this study under previous \n     language and can find the money for it if it wants to. \n     Regarding Lieutenant General Van Antwerp's suggestion at our \n     last meeting that this must be a full feasibility-level \n     analysis, the Corps was given broad authority to do post-\n     Katrina work without full feasibility studies and in an \n     expedited manner, and has not even performed feasibility-\n     level analysis on Option 1.\n\n\n                                2. AGMAC\n\n       Request:\n       Option A--Corps provide containment areas for the \n     deposition of spoil material using O funds which should be \n     constructed to provide embankment stabilization and \n     reestablish the berm that historically provided storm surge \n     attenuation benefits to Vermilion Parish. Thus, Corps O \n     authority can be used to help solve the 902b cost issue. This \n     would be directly analogous to O work done on the MRGO. If \n     O funds are not available, the Corps/Administration would \n     proactively request and support the appropriation of such O \n     funds as are necessary.\n       Option B--Corps successfully obtain final approval at the \n     state level of a CWPPRA program which, when combined with the \n     Corps' WRDA authority, accomplishes the bank build-up as \n     authorized and intended in WRDA. This will require some type \n     of special/emergency CWPPRA meeting.\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\n                        3. Morganza to the Gulf\n\n       Request:\n       Option A--Corps restart the lock design on the Houma \n     Navigation Canal using existing authority and move the lock \n     forward as an independent project. In 1998, a Chiefs Report \n     established authority to move the lock forward outside of the \n     overall Morganza Project in response to a WRDA 1996-directed \n     study. The Corps would either use this existing authority to \n     move the lock forward independently or proactively support \n     language in the next WRDA to do so. (The reason I am not \n     pursuing Lieutenant General Van Antwerp's suggestion at our \n     most recent meeting that we work on full project \n     authorization language for a 2011 WRDA subject to a Chief's \n     Report, is because the re-study of the project is not due \n     until December 2012, and contingent authorizations for \n     projects have only been granted up to December 31 of the year \n     of a WRDA's passage.)\n       Option B--Corps outline any other way the entire Morganza \n     to the Gulf project or a significant portion of it is \n     authorized and moves forward under the new WRDA, assuming a \n     new WRDA is passed in 2011. If Corps cannot do this, then you \n     are admitting that you plan on our missing the next WRDA \n     train yet again regarding this vital and long-suffering \n     project, which is completely unacceptable.\n       These three goals can clearly be met under the Corps' \n     significant existing authority and flexibility. If you truly \n     want to do so but need to explore the above methods more \n     fully before transmitting a written response, please have \n     your staff contact Glen MacDonald of my office and Garrett \n     Graves of the State of Louisiana. If, on the other hand, \n     these three goals are not going to be met by the Corps, I \n     look forward to moving on with an existing Major General for \n     the position in question.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of the Army, Office of the Assistant \n           Secretary, Civil Works,\n                                    Washington DC, March 19, 2010.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: This letter is in response to your \n     letter of March 16, 2010. On March 12, 2010, we responded to \n     your previous letter and to questions raised in several \n     meetings addressing nine specific issues. In your letter of \n     March 16, you posed three follow-on questions, which are \n     addressed below. In summary, the responses we provided on \n     March 12, 2010 represent the best way forward within the \n     existing law, funding and policy. The new requests in your \n     most recent letter either require changes to law or changes \n     to policy which, given current legal and fiscal constraints, \n     we regretfully cannot support.\n\n\n                  1: Outfall Canals/Pump to the River\n\n       REQUEST: Corps conduct within 18 months a formal cost/\n     benefit analysis using existing Corps' authority and money, \n     of previously cited project options 1, 2, 2a, and any other \n     options the Corps deems advisable to consider. This cost/\n     benefit analysis to be peer reviewed by the soon-to-be \n     operational Louisiana Water Resources Council. The Corps \n     clearly has the authority for this study under previous \n     language and can find the money for it if it wants to. \n     Regarding Lieutenant General Van Antwerp's suggestion at our \n     last meeting that this must be a full feasibility-level \n     analysis, the Corps was given broad authority to do post-\n     Katrina work without full feasibility studies and in an \n     expedited manner, and has not even performed feasibility-\n     level analysis on Option 1.\n       Following Hurricane Katrina, the Administration requested \n     authorization and funding for the work referred to as Option \n     1 for the purpose of reducing exposure of the interior of the \n     City of New Orleans to surge from Lake Pontchartrain. \n     Congress authorized and funded Option 1 in the 4th \n     Supplemental, P.L. 109-234 and the 6th Supplemental, P.L. \n     110-252. This construction work is being completed under a \n     design/build contract, which incorporates ongoing planning \n     and design while the project is being built.\n       Your new request is that the Corps complete a formal cost/\n     benefit analysis of Options 1, 2, 2a, and other possible \n     appropriate options, within 18 months. Determining whether \n     and how the City's interior drainage facilities could be \n     improved is a complex and extensive undertaking. As we have \n     stated previously, the Corps is willing to proceed with such \n     a study; however, we estimate that it will take approximately \n     36 months to produce a cost/benefit analysis that would \n     provide Congress with adequate information to make an \n     informed decision on whether to authorize construction of \n     Option 2, 2a, or some other option.\n       You also suggested that we complete the study with existing \n     appropriations. The appropriations provided by Congress were \n     for the purpose of hurricane and storm damage risk reduction. \n     Options 2 and 2a would address interior drainage issues \n     without providing additional storm surge protection. The \n     Administration's focus is on providing the storm surge \n     protection for the City of New Orleans that Congress expected \n     us to provide on a priority basis. It would not be \n     appropriate to divert existing appropriations away from this \n     high priority objective.\n\n\n                                2: AGMAC\n\n       REQUEST:\n       Option A--Corps provide containment areas for the \n     deposition of spoil material using O funds which should be \n     constructed to provide embankment stabilization and \n     reestablish the berm that historically provided storm surge \n     attenuation benefits to Vermilion Parish. Thus, Corps O \n     authority can be used to help solve the 902b cost issue. This \n     would be directly analogous to O work done on the MRGO. If \n     O funds are not available, the Corps/Administration would \n     proactively request and support the appropriation of such O \n     funds as are necessary.\n       Option B--Corps successfully obtain final approval at the \n     state level of a CWPPRA program which, when combined with the \n     Corps' WRDA authority, accomplishes the bank build-up as \n     authorized and intended in WRDA. This will require some type \n     of special/emergency CWPPRA meeting.\n       Your new AGMAC request envisions using Operation and \n     Maintenance (O) funds to construct containment areas for \n     the deposition of spoil materials to provide embankment \n     stabilization and reestablishment of the berm that \n     historically provided storm surge attenuation benefits to \n     Vermilion Parish. You believe that this would help to solve \n     the section 902 of WRDA 86 cost issue related to the Port of \n     Iberia navigation project authorized in Water Resources \n     Development Act (WRDA) of 2007 at a total cost of \n     $131,250,000. The Corps does not have authority to use O \n     funds to construct projects or separable elements of \n     projects, nor does the Army have authority to reprogram O \n     or any other Civil Works funds to initiate a previously \n     unfunded project. This is not analogous to O work done on \n     the MRGO. In that case, Congress specified that the Corps \n     undertake certain enumerated activities with appropriations \n     made available for O\n       There is an established nomination process under the CWPPRA \n     program, as outlined in the CWPRRA project standard operating \n     procedure manual dated June 3, 2009, whereby agencies, \n     parishes, landowners, and other individuals may confer to \n     further develop projects. The guidelines suggest that \n     nominated projects should be developed to support one or more \n     ``Coast 2050'' strategies to create, restore, protect or \n     enhance coastal wetlands. Should this project make it through \n     the CWPPRA nomination process, the Corps, as a member of the \n     Task Force, will support its inclusion in the CWPPRA program.\n\n\n                        3: Morganza to the Gulf\n\n       REQUEST:\n       Option A--Corps restart the lock design on the Houma \n     Navigation Canal using existing authority and move the lock \n     forward as an independent project. In 1998, a Chief's Report \n     established authority to move the lock forward outside of the \n     overall Morganza Project in response to a WRDA 1996-directed \n     study. The Corps would either use this existing authority to \n     move the lock forward independently or proactively support \n     language in the next WRDA to do so. (The reason I am not \n     pursuing Lieutenant General Van Antwerp's suggestion at our \n     most recent meeting that we work on full project \n     authorization language for a 2011 WRDA subject to a Chief's \n     Report, is because the re-study of the project is not due \n     until December 2012, and contingent authorization for \n     projects have only been granted up to December 31 of the year \n     of a WRDA's passage).\n       Option B--Corps outline any other way the entire Morganza \n     to the Gulf project or a significant portion of it is \n     authorized and moves forward under the new WRDA, assuming a \n     new WRDA is passed in 2011. If Corps cannot do this, then you \n     are admitting that you plan on our missing the next WRDA \n     train yet again regarding this vital and long-suffering \n     project, which is completely unacceptable.\n       The Corps does not have authority to implement the Houma \n     Navigation Lock as an independent project. Section 425 of \n     WRDA 1996 authorized a study of an independent lock, but did \n     not authorize construction. Section 425 in part reads . . . \n     ``The Secretary shall conduct a study of environmental, flood \n     control, and navigation impacts associated with the \n     construction of a lock structure in the Houma Navigation \n     Canal as an independent feature of the overall damage \n     prevention study being conducted under the Morganza, \n     Louisiana, to the Gulf of Mexico feasibility study.'' The \n     Corps conducted a study in response to Section 425, but that \n     study did not recommend construction of an independent Houma \n     Navigation Lock feature due to uncertainties of benefits and \n     concerns over justification of an independent lock structure. \n     As a result, a Chief's Report was not completed for the Houma \n     Navigation Lock project.\n       The Army understands the importance of completing the \n     Morganza to the Gulf project reanalysis, and will continue to \n     look for ways to move forward as expeditiously as possible on \n     the Post Authorization Change report required to support a \n     request for additional authorization. As noted previously, \n     our best estimate is this report will be completed by \n     December 2012. You have our commitment that we will continue \n     to seek ways to accelerate this schedule.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Jo-Ellen Darcy,\n                    Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works).\n\n                                            R. L. Van Antwerp,\n\n                                      Lieutenant General, US Army,\n                                               Chief of Engineers.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Simply, GEN Michael Walsh is someone I have known for a\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\nlong time. He is an extraordinary soldier and a patriotic American who \ndoesn't deserve, and never deserved, to have his promotion derailed for \n6 months by one Member of the Senate. That is not fair. That is using \nthis person, this patriot, as a pawn in trying to extract from the \nCorps of Engineers something the Appropriations Committee has already \nvoted against, in one case.\n  In other cases, it is something that the Corps of Engineers cannot \nlegally do without authorization from Congress. We cannot do that to \nsoldiers who have served their country. That is not fair.\n  I am not going to ask consent today because my colleague, Senator \nLevin, previously asked consent, and Senator Coburn from Oklahoma, on \nbehalf of Senator Vitter, the other day objected to this promotion. But \nI will ask my colleague from Louisiana to stand down on this and give \nthis soldier the respect and honor and the due that is owed him by the \nCongress.\n  The Armed Services Committee, with its chairman and ranking \nRepublican member, unanimously decided that this good soldier should be \npromoted to the rank of a two-star general. That was 6 months ago. Six \nmonths later, he is a pawn on the floor of the Senate held by one \nperson trying to extract from the Corps of Engineers some things that \nthe Corps cannot possibly do, and some things that are not wise to do, \nand I would not support in any event.\n  As I said when I started, I would not come to the floor of the Senate \nand criticize a colleague without first informing him of that \ncriticism. I did that. I don't take any measure of satisfaction in \ncriticizing a colleague. But I will tell you this: What happened to \nthis general is just flat wrong. There is no way for anybody in this \nCongress to justify holding this general hostage for 6 months in his \npromotion to major general.\n  I ask my colleague from Louisiana to end this hold, to give this \nsoldier his due. This soldier has earned his second star, and 6 months \nago this Congress should have voted in response to the unanimous vote \nby the Armed Services Committee to give this soldier his second star. I \nhope that soon my colleague will delete that hold so my colleague from \nMichigan can seek unanimous consent to do right by GEN Michael Walsh.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague wishes to offer an amendment. \nI want to make sure there is time available to him.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am only going to take 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3726 to Amendment No. 3721\n\n(Purpose: To pay for the full cost of extending additional unemployment \n                 insurance and other Federal programs)\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for giving me a short \ntime to deal with these two amendments. I have an amendment at the desk \nthat I call up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3726 to amendment No. 3721.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3727 to Amendment No. 3721\n\n(Purpose: To pay for the full cost of extending additional unemployment \n                 insurance and other Federal programs)\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and my next amendment be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3727 to amendment No. 3721.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I again ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Internet\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we just completed a hearing moments ago in \nthe Senate Commerce Committee on something that has received some \nheadlines recently, although in the scheme of things, it is not ranking \nwith health care or energy or education reform. It is the issue of a \ncircuit court decision a week ago in the Comcast case dealing with the \nFederal Communications Commission and its ability or inability to be a \nreferee with respect to the free market system and the Internet.\n  The Internet is an extraordinary innovation in our lives. We tend to \ntake it for granted, I suppose, because it is so normal for all of us \nevery day to use the Internet, whether it is a wireless device or a \nlaptop computer, or whatever. We use the Internet in so many different \nways.\n  The question is: What is the regulatory approach to the Internet? We \nknow what we have done for telephones over the many years, the many \ndecades of regulatory capability. What is it for the Internet?\n  What we have always had for the Internet from its origin is what is \ncalled a free and open Internet, the open architecture. Anybody can get \non the Internet with their Web site, and anybody from the rest of the \nworld who has broadband capability or Internet capability can access \nthat site.\n  A man named Larry and a man named Sergey in a dorm room in California \nconceived of something which 10 years later we know as Google. What if \nsomebody had said to Larry and Sergey: You know what, you are in a dorm \nroom, you are not much of a business; you only have two employees. We \nwant to charge you for being able to get on our system so others can \nsee you. There would not have been Google, would there?\n  Free and open architecture of the Internet means anybody, anyplace, \nany time can access anything. I told a story in the Commerce Committee \nabout going to the home I grew up in in a town of slightly less than \n300 people. I had not been back to my boyhood home since I was a \nteenager. I knocked on the door in my hometown and asked the woman if I \ncould see the home I grew up in. She said: Of course.\n  In the shed where you walk in first, there was cardboard and tape. \nAnd in the kitchen just off the shed, the woman had a camera and a \nlittle arm that stuck out of a little appendage she had by the kitchen \ncounter. She was taking a picture of a bracelet that was hanging from \nthis arm. I said: What are you photographing?\n  She said: I am photographing a bracelet because I sell jewelry on the \nInternet.\n  From a town of 250 or 300 people in my little two-bedroom white house \nin that small town, this woman has an Internet business. Her Web site \ncan be accessed by anybody in the world. She is not a big business \nperson. She makes some money. It could not have happened years ago but \ncan happen now in that small town. It can happen in any town. Anybody \naround the world can access her Web site. But what if somebody said: We \nare going to decide which Web sites are going to get on our system. \nThat is a gatekeeper, a provider\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\nthat is deciding we are going to pick winners and losers.\n  We do not do that. We let the marketplace pick winners and losers on \nthe Internet. That is why the Internet grew. Its origin and growth was \nunder something called a nondiscrimination rule. You cannot \ndiscriminate. Just like telephone service, you cannot discriminate.\n  The FCC, under former Chairman Powell, moved the Internet from a \ntelephone service to an information service, and that is what the \nlawsuit was about. Comcast brought a lawsuit and said under Title I of \nthe Communications Act, as an information service, the FCC does not \nhave the authority with respect to Internet freedom as I call it, to \nimpose net neutrality rules. The circuit court said the FCC does not \nhave that authority under Title I. That gets very technical and very \nlegal.\n  The question is: What does the FCC do now? The question is what \nshould we aspire to achieve for the Internet in the long term? Some say \nhands off, let's have what is called in the hearing today a light \ntouch. I said: I am not interested in a light touch; I am interested in \nthe right touch by regulators. I have just seen a decade in which \nregulators at the SEC and the CFTC and others who engaged in financial \nregulations said: We are engaged in light touch. In fact, we are \nengaged in no touch. We will be blind for 8 years. We will not even \nlook. We are regulators, but we intend to get paid. We do not even care \nwhat you do. That is the ultimate light touch, but I have had a \nbellyful of that. I want regulators to regulate effectively to make \nsure the market remains open and free and fair. That is the job of a \nregulator. That is the job of the FCC.\n\n  We are going to have a big debate about this in the Congress. But \nfirst and foremost, I hope the Federal Communications Commission takes \naction under its own authority because it has plenty of authority to \nrespond to this decision. It has authority under Title II of the \nCommunications Act, and it has other authorities it can use. I \nencourage it to proceed. I hope that is the case.\n  Second, Senator Snowe and I and others on a bipartisan basis will \ncontinue to press the Congress to enact net neutrality, what I call \nInternet freedom, legislation, because if the FCC does not do it, let's \nmake sure we do it in law.\n  This is a very important issue. The issue of the Internet and the \nquestion of who controls the Internet, if anybody, is very important.\n  At town meetings when somebody says, The Federal Government cannot do \nanything right, I say there are a number of things it cannot do right, \nbut answer the question, Who invented the Internet? Who created the \nInternet? The Federal Government did that. It started here. It is a \nwonderful innovation that has changed our lives in so many wonderful \nways. I just described one with the woman living in my former boyhood \nhome. It changed her life. But that is multiplied a billion times \naround this world.\n  We need to make certain the Internet remains open and free. The free \nmarket system is the best system I know with which to allocate goods \nand services. I know none better. But I also understand that the free \nmarket system needs referees to make sure it remains free and open, to \ncall the fouls, to wear the striped shirt with the whistle and call the \nfouls when necessary. It did not happen in the financial area. It did \nnot happen at all. When people traded things that did not exist, buying \nthings from people who did not have them, making money on both sides, \nall of a sudden there should have been regulators saying: Wait, this is \ngambling. You can't do that. You are putting the American people at \nrisk. On the telecommunications side, we need effective regulatory \ncapability, not to stifle or injure the free market but to protect it.\n  This is a very important issue in the wake of the circuit court \ndecision. I believe Chairman Genachowski has the capability and \nauthority to move forward in the Federal Communications Commission to \ndo the right thing, and I encourage him to do that.\n  I know as well going forward that legislation, perhaps not this year \nbut legislation in future Congresses will reaffirm the opportunity for \nthe FCC to protect and nurture a free and open architecture of the \nInternet. I believe it is critically important.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before the Senator yields, in the form of \na question, I deeply appreciate the Senator's statement. He is on the \nright track. I believe the Internet should be free and open, too. I was \nstunned by the circuit court decision.\n  I ask the Senator if he could tell us how he thinks the FCC can \nremedy the situation now without legislation, and if the FCC cannot, we \nneed legislation. But I am asking for the Senator's view again. He \nalready stated it once. Maybe he can expand on it further.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana. Let me \nstate the reason for the urgency. I described it today, but it has been \nsaid in other venues. Mr. Whitacre from AT most famously said it: \nThese are my pipes. I want Google to pay for the use of my pipes. That \nwas a famous statement by Mr. Whitacre. Yes, those pipes belong to the \nproviders, but there is a requirement there be a nondiscrimination \napproach to the use of those pipes. We do not want providers to set up \ntollbooths or gates to say: OK, you are a big site out there. We are \ngoing to charge you to use this. Maybe that person cannot pay the \ncharge. The billions of people who would access that site now will not \nhave access because there is a gatekeeper who said: We are only going \nto allow these folks to be on our site. That is the point of it.\n  There is, it seems to me, a potential problem that could not have \nexisted previously when the nondiscrimination rules existed. But now \nthat the nondiscrimination rules were obliterated, we need to restore \nthem.\n  The Senator from Montana asked the question how can the Federal \nCommunications Commission do this. I believe there are general powers \nin the Federal Communications Commission Act, and I believe the \nCommission itself has general powers that will allow it to act in a \nmanner that the court would view to be in compliance with the law.\n  The FCC is not interested in doing something that it does not have \nthe legal authority to do. I believe they have the capability. They \ncertainly have the capability to determine that the Internet is \nregulated under Title II in which they would have the capability to \nenforce the nondiscrimination rule.\n  Again, this is not going to be one of those headline issues, but \nnonetheless it is a very important issue and one we need to get right. \nThe last time we had a discussion about this issue in the Commerce \nCommittee, it was a very contentious discussion. Senator Snowe and I \noffered an amendment that lost on an 11-to-11 tie. This is not an easy \nissue. There are a lot of people who feel strongly on both sides, but I \ncome down on the side of saying the way the Internet was conceived and \nthe way it grew and the way it flourished was with nondiscrimination \nrules that say anybody--it is the ultimate democracy--anybody anywhere \ncan set up a site and anyone in the world can access that site. That is \nthe genius of this great innovation in our lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate just rejected the previous \nCoburn amendment by a vote of 51 to 46. The Senate, I might say, \nrejected an attempt by the Senator from Oklahoma to give the Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget sweeping powers to cut \nunobligated balances by billions of dollars.\n  The Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, explained why that would be unwise. Essentially, there are \nmany contracts which take more than 1 year to be fulfilled--building \nships, for example, aircraft carriers, and so on. It takes a good \nnumber of years to build them, and it would make no sense to rescind \nall those unobligated balances.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has two more amendments. One in particular \nis virtually the same amendment. It gives the Director of OMB powers to \ncut unobligated balances by billions of dollars, so the arguments of \nthe Senator\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\nfrom Hawaii would apply there as well. So the same reasons given for \nopposing the Coburn amendment just a short while ago--and the one that \nwas defeated--should be the same reasons that would apply with respect \nto this next Coburn amendment that we will be voting on in the not-too-\ndistant future.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has another amendment which would reverse \ndecisions of the Congress through the appropriations process, and it \nalso would, I might say, affect some tax provisions that would be \ninappropriate if we were to pass them now.\n  I would remind my colleagues if the Coburn amendment were to be \nadopted, there is another problem with it; that is, the delay of the \nextension of unemployment benefits. Because if it were to pass, it \nwould have to go over to the House, and I am not quite sure how quickly \nthe House would accept the Coburn amendment. They have said many times \nthey would not accept it; that they would send it back, probably as is, \nwithout the pay-fors on the extension of unemployment benefits. So we \nwould just be delaying unemployment benefits to people who were cut off \na few days ago because of the failure of Congress to act on the \nextension.\n  So I would suggest to my colleagues that the other two amendments the \nSenator from Oklahoma has offered are very similar to the first \namendment he offered. The Senate defeated that first amendment by a \nvote of 51 to 46, and I suggest that these other two amendments be \ndefeated when they are brought up because then we can give needed \nunemployment benefits to people who need it during this time of \nrecession.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, not to belabor the point, but at a hearing \nI held in the Finance Committee this morning, we heard from Mark Zandi, \nwho is the chief economist and cofounder of Moody's Analytics, and he \nwas talking about unemployment benefits.\n  In fact, part of the hearing was to determine ways to improve the \nefficiency and effectiveness of unemployment benefits. Actually, the \npanel came up with a lot of very interesting ideas. Different States \nare, frankly, using the unemployment program to help create jobs as \nwell as make payments.\n  Anyway, at this hearing, Mr. Zandi volunteered, frankly, that now is \nnot the time for extension of unemployment benefits to be paid for. He \nsaid that is self-defeating. It is unproductive. He said, now that we \nare in a recession, frankly, unemployment compensation benefits should \nnot be paid for.\n  Who is Mark Zandi? Mark Zandi is a moderate economist, very well \nrespected by Senators on both sides of the aisle. He also was the \nadviser for Presidential candidate John McCain--Mark Zandi was. The \npoint is, clearly, he is not a liberal, leftwing economist. I don't \nknow even now if he is a moderate economist. But whatever he is--\nmoderate, leftwing or liberal--he is an economist, and he has worked \nfor Presidential candidate John McCain. He volunteered today on the \nrecord at the Finance Committee hearing that it would not be wise to \npay for unemployment benefits at this time because that would be self-\ndefeating.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise tonight for a very specific purpose. \nIt is to speak about a person I have known a long time--25 years or \nmore--who is currently the President of the Pennsylvania State AFL/CIO, \na great labor leader in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I will submit \na longer statement for the Record due to the late hour, but I did wish \nto say a few words about him. His name is Bill George, and anyone who \nknows anything about organized labor in Pennsylvania, anyone who knows \nanything about the topic of battling on behalf of working men and \nwomen, knows the name Bill George. He has been the President of our \nState AFL/CIO since 1990, 20 years in that position. Prior to that, he \nwas a great leader with the United Steelworkers of America and someone \nI came to know long before I was a candidate for public office, and \ncertainly in the 15 years or so that I have been either a candidate or \na public official he has been a source of great inspiration and a great \nfriend.\n  Even beyond the work he has done for candidates and for causes, this \nis someone who understood, at a very young age, what it means to \nbattle--to fight the battles for working men and women, to work \ntogether with people to collectively bargain for wages and benefits, \nmaking sure that working men and women have a voice, and someone who \nunderstood what an election means. At the end of the process of \nconducting an election, you elect someone to public office--or a group \nof candidates--and their votes and their actions have an impact on \nworking men and women. Bill George has always understood that. He has \nalways understood that those in our society who do not have a voice \nneed people like him to stand and fight battles.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is well aware that organized labor--and \nI think Bill George has been a great example of this--often has been \nbattling the hardest on issues from which they do not necessarily \nbenefit directly. The case in point, the minimum wage. We know that \nthose who are represented by unions in almost every circumstance have a \npretty solid wage compared to those who may be making a minimum wage or \nless. We know organized labor, thankfully over many generations now, \nhas been able to bargain collectively for health care benefits. But \neven despite that, they have battled for those who do not have health \ninsurance. Bill George has been one of the leaders in Pennsylvania for \n20 years, making sure the voice of working men and women have been \nheard but also making sure the poor had a voice, the vulnerable, the \nforgotten, the people who have been left out. To use a line from \nScriptures, ``The least, the last and the lost'' have been \nbeneficiaries of his great voice and his strength of personality, his \ncommitment to fighting for justice and especially fighting for economic \nand social justice.\n  Tonight, as we are here in Washington and voting, there is a huge \ncrowd of Pennsylvanians at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, a \nconvention center named in honor of one of our greater Governors, a \nnative of Pittsburgh. The AFL/CIO tonight is paying tribute to Bill \nGeorge and also Dan Rooney, the great owner of the six-time Super Bowl \nPittsburgh Stealers and now the Ambassador to Ireland. So I wish to \ncompliment both Dan Rooney and Bill George on their award tonight at \nthe AFL/CIO dinner in Pittsburgh.\n  But in a very particular way, I wish to commend and salute the work \nBill George has done over so many years in our Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, culminating in the last 20 years as President of the \nPennsylvania AFL/CIO. Congratulations to Bill George. I know he will \nstay active in Pennsylvania and beyond, but we want to commend him \nespecially tonight.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I listened intently to the \nPresiding Officer's remarks just before I took the floor, and I, too, \nwanted to add my congratulations to Bill George and associate myself \nwith his remarks.\n  I was particularly moved by the comments the Senator made about often \norganized labor in this country works on behalf of all Americans, all \nworking Americans, and organized labor often does not receive \nacknowledgment. Sometimes it receives absolutely the opposite, slings \nand arrows that are often sent toward organized labor.\n  There is much that organized labor has done over the years that we \ntake for granted in the workplace, everything from workplace safety to \npension protection to the 40-hour workweek. Children do not work in our \nfactories anymore because of what organized labor did for many decades.\n  So, again, that was very moving for me to hear. I salute Mr. George. \nI also took note of the mention of the six-time world champion \nPittsburgh Steelers. In my State we have a two-time world champion \nfootball team, the Denver Broncos. It always seemed, though, we had to \ngo through Pittsburgh. Often we fell short, but on two occasions we \nwere able to make it to the Super Bowl itself. We also had to pass the \ntest that the Steelers presented.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Udall of Colorado pertaining to the introduction \nof S. 3201 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2289-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                          Sergeant Sean Durkin\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I want to close and take advantage of another \nminute or two to speak on a separate note but a related note.\n  I wish to talk about Sean Durkin. He was a soldier from Fort Carson \nwhom we just lost from wounds that he suffered in Afghanistan in a \nroadside bomb attack. Those are the most casualty-ridden attacks that \nour forces have faced over and over, not only in Afghanistan but in \nIraq.\n  Last week, Army SGT Sean Durkin died at Walter Reed because of his \nwounds. He had been one of three Fort Carson soldiers who were \npresented a Purple Heart from President Obama when he visited Kabul and \nwent to the military hospital when he was there.\n  On his Facebook page, he included a quotation from an unnamed marine. \nThis quotation said:\n\n       This is my charge to you. Tell everyone of the heroism of \n     the soldiers who lost their lives and of the soldiers who are \n     fighting to recover what they have lost.\n\n  I wanted to tell everyone here, everyone listening, everyone watching \nof Sergeant Durkin's heroism and ask that we keep in our prayers and \nour thoughts all of our service men and women and their families as \nthey serve us all over the world.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Sexual \nAssault Awareness Month. During the month of April, I urge my \ncolleagues and Americans around the country to reflect on the effects \nof sexual assault and domestic violence in their communities and to \njoin me in making a commitment to end this stain on our society. In \nconjunction with Sexual Assault Awareness Month, our country will \nobserve\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week on April 18-24, 2010. This year's \ntheme, Crime Victim's Rights: Fairness, Dignity, and Respect, is a \nreminder of the progress our country has made as well as the work that \nstill must be accomplished.\n  As a former U.S. Capitol Police Officer, I understand the effects \nviolent crime can have on a family and community. I recognize the \nsignificant role government and other supporting agencies must play in \nassisting victims of sexual assault and preventing violence. We must \nnever forget that sexual assault is a violent crime with devastating \nimplications.\n  One in six women and one in thirty-three men reported experiencing \nrape or attempted rape in the United States. In 2008, an estimated \n222,000 rapes or sexual assaults on individuals age 12 and older were \nreported. One in four women will experience domestic violence from a \npartner in their lifetime. Each year, an estimated 1.3 million women \nare victims of physical assault by an intimate partner. These numbers, \nwhile terrible, grossly underestimate the problem. Many cases of sexual \nassault and domestic violence are not reported because victims are \nafraid to tell the police, their family, or their friends about the \nabuse.\n  Such violence affects not only the victims of abuse, but their \nfamilies, communities, and, most unfortunately, their children. Women, \nmen, and children throughout our country suffer the long-lasting \neffects of sexual assault and domestic violence through the emotional \nand physical scars they carry each day.\n  It is clear we must do more to prevent these crimes and help those \nwho are victimized. I have long supported efforts to recognize, \nprevent, and combat violent crimes committed against women and \nchildren, and I am always seeking to improve Federal laws and programs \nregarding this issue. In 1990, I was a cosponsor of the original \nViolence Against Women Act, VAWA, proposal, and I supported passage of \nthe bill when it became law in 1994. Additionally, I support the Family \nViolence Prevention and Services Act, FVPSA, and I am pushing for \ngreater funding for FVPSA programs and grants.\n  Countless organizations throughout our country are helping victims of \nabuse every day, thanks in part to VAWA and FVPSA. It is essential to \nrecognize the organizations committed to providing victims of abuse the \nassistance they need to overcome the trauma of violence. Please join me \nin commending the dedicated efforts of the individuals who work \ntirelessly to stop violence in our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2290-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO MARK LEET\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the TRICARE \nDependent Coverage Extension Act.\n  Last month, President Obama signed the health care reform bill into \nlaw. It was a historic day. For the first time in American history we \ncommitted to ending the abuses of the insurance industry. We committed \nto covering every single American. It extends the solvency of Medicare \nfor nearly a decade. It ends the punitive practices of insurance \ncompanies that deny coverage based on gender, age, or race. It expands \nuniversal coverage to 32 million Americans who have been without \ninsurance. And we pay for it with an emphasis on wellness and quality. \nWe say goodbye to quantity medicine by emphasizing quality medicine. It \nwas a very big deal. But there is more to do.\n  I voted for health care reform because I listened to the people of \nMaryland at diners and in the grocery store, at roundtables, tele-town \nhalls, in hearings, and in letters and emails. Time and again I heard, \n``Save my Medicare.'' I heard, ``Don't take my mammograms away.'' I \nheard, ``They turned me down for health insurance because I had a C-\nSection.'' I voted for health care reform because I listened to the \nstories of the people. I know that the best ideas come from the people.\n  Over the recess I heard from another group in Maryland. I met with my \nwonderful Veterans Advisory Board. They represent Vets from World War \nTwo to Desert Storm. They are my eyes and ears in the veterans' \ncommunity. One of my board asked me a question. He said, ``We think \nhealth care reform is great but we think there is a problem.'' The part \nof the health care bill that extends parents' health insurance to kids \nage 26 and younger left out military families. I promised him that if \nthere was a problem, that I would fix it! Wow was he right. Military \nfamilies in the TRICARE system were left out.\n  TRICARE is a critical benefit for our military and their families. It \ncovers active duty military, retired military, Coast Guard, National \nGuard and Reservist in a certain status, and the uniform corps of the \nPublic Health Service and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric \nAdministration. They were all left out. That is why I am here today--to \nright this wrong.\n  I am proud to join Senator Udall and my colleagues in introducing the \nTRICARE Dependent Coverage Extension Act. This bill says that if \nmilitary children can't get insurance through an employer that their \nparents can keep them on their TRICARE insurance until they reach age \nof 26. This is the right thing to do. If the kids of a hedge fund \nmanager can stay on their parents' health care until they are 26, then \nkids in military families should be able to be covered to age 26 too.\n  I am so proud of the men and women of our military. I stand here \ntoday saluting them for their honor, courage, and commitment to our \ncountry. Make no mistake. I have my marching orders. I commit to making \nthis right for them. I will fight to see this bill signed into law. \nBecause promises made must be promises kept.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2290-5", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2290-S2291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE PETER M. GOODRICH MEMORIAL FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure to call the Senate's \nattention to the inspiring work of Donald and Sarah ``Sally'' Goodrich \nof Bennington, VT, through their efforts to turn their own devastating \npersonal tragedy into new opportunity and hope for children and \nfamilies a world away in Afghanistan.\n  Confronted by the death of their son Peter aboard the flight that \nstruck the south tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, \nDon and Sally\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\nGoodrich channeled their grief and energy into a foundation established \nin his memory--a foundation with a unique and uplifting purpose.\n  The Peter M. Goodrich Foundation provides food, clean water, shelter \nand educational opportunities to Afghan children facing extreme \nhardship, dismal circumstances and little hope for the future. The \nfoundation's mission is far broader than offering basic humanitarian \nservices to a country torn by conflict; its work recognizes the \nuntapped potential of a generation of Afghan children, helping them to \nrise above hate and to embrace values based on understanding, tolerance \nand respect.\n  With this vision and this goal, the Goodrich Foundation supports \nexchange programs that bring Afghan students to the United States and \nvocational programs that allow them to put their knowledge and skills \nto use upon their return to Afghanistan.

BISHOP\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to \nWalter ``Wally'' Bishop, general manager of the Contra Costa Water \nDistrict--CCWD--as he retires after 18 years of dedicated service.\n  A native of Washington DC, Mr. Bishop started his career in 1973 as \nan engineer for the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. Upon \narriving in California, he went to work as an engineer for the Ventura \nRegional County Sanitation District in 1975 before moving to northern \nCalifornia, where he worked for the East Bay Municipal Utility District \nfrom 1983 to 1992.\n  The CCWD serves over 550,000 people in Central and Eastern Contra \nCosta County and carries a large influence on the direction of \nCalifornia water policy, given its location on the Delta's edge. \nStarting as CCWD's general manager in 1992, Mr. Bishop continually \nadvocated for a customer-first, entrepreneurial approach throughout the \ndistrict. Under his leadership, CCWD's Los Vaqueros Reservoir Project \nwas permitted, designed, and completed. It was the first major \nreservoir to be permitted and constructed in more than a decade.\n  A well-known leader in both State and national water issues, Mr. \nBishop has been recognized by numerous organizations for his commitment \nto water issues and policy. He was recently awarded the Edward J. \nCleary Award from the American Academy of Environmental Engineers for \nhis leadership in environmental engineering and management. He has also \nbeen a two-term member of the National Drinking Water Advisory Council, \nwhich advises the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator on \neverything that EPA does relating to drinking water.\n  I commend Mr. Bishop for his 18 years of dedicated service to the \nCCWD. Along with his friends and colleagues throughout Contra Costa \nCounty and the San Francisco Bay Area, I thank him for his efforts and \nwish him the best as he embarks on the next phase of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2291-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE ASSOCIATED: JEWISH COMMUNITY FEDERATION OF BALTIMORE\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to honor The Associated: Jewish Community Federation of \nBaltimore on its 90th anniversary. The Greater Baltimore Area is \ncomprised of more than 90,000 Jews, many of whom rely on The Associated \nto provide support and resources to a vibrant Jewish community in the \nregion. The Associated was officially formed in 1920 by the merger of \ntwo community organizations, the Federated Jewish Charities with the \nUnited Hebrew Charities. The Associated and its agencies have worked \nhard to better the lives of Jewish Baltimoreans for almost a century.\n  The talents, commitment, and compassion of Baltimore's Jewish \ncommunity activists, philanthropists, volunteers, and professionals \nhave created and sustained The Associated. From Harry Greenstein to \nMarc Terrill, from Jacob Epstein to Jimmy Berg, men and women have \nprovided their experience and expertise to help turn the organization \ninto one of the most powerful and cohesive Jewish federations in the \ncountry today.\n  Through its Jewish Community Services program, The Associated helps \nsupport and serve the needs of the entire Baltimore Jewish community. \nIt provides a wide array of counseling programs to help with substance \nabuse, relationship problems, depression, and grief. Its social workers \nalso offer outstanding support for parents, caregivers, job seekers, \nteenagers, and senior citizens. All of these programs and initiatives \nhave been vital in helping many Jewish individuals and families improve \nboth their economic and mental health situations while still \nmaintaining a positive connection to the Jewish community.\n  The Assocaited's international outreach also has been just as \nprofound and important as its local impact. Since the early years of \nthe federation, it has played an active role in the relocation of Jews \nto Baltimore. It helped more than 3,000 German Jews flee the Nazi \nregime and settle in the Baltimore area and has provided support for \nboth Iranian Jews and Russian Jews to resettle in Baltimore in recent \nyears as well.\n  The federation has also played an integral part in strengthening the \nbond between Baltimore and Israel through its new sister city \npartnership with the Israeli city, Ashkelon. This relationship has \nalready spurred initiatives that will help educate Jewish leaders in \nboth communities on economic and leadership development. A different \npartnership with the Ukrainian city of Odessa complements the one with \nAshkelon by promoting cross-cultural exchange and education as well.\n  In honor of its 90th anniversary, the federation is doing what it \ndoes best: helping people. The Associated has called on its community \nto log 90,000 volunteer hours together--1,000 hours for every year of \nexistence. This is just one more act of generosity among countless \nothers The Associated has sponsored throughout the years.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing The Associated: Jewish \nCommunity Federation of Baltimore for its continued commitment to \ntikkun olam--repair of the world--and gemilut chasadim--acts of loving-\nkindness--as well as all the work it has done to better the lives of \nBaltimore Jews throughout the past 90 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2291-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2291-S2292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING CLIFFORD HARDIN\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a great \nNebraskan and great American. Last week, we lost a visionary figure \nwho, through years of service, made lasting contributions to our \nsociety: former University of Nebraska chancellor and later U.S. \nSecretary of Agriculture Clifford Hardin.\n  I was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Cliff Hardin. His \nlifetime of service both in government and academia provides a shining \nexample of the impact one person can have.\n  As chancellor of the University of Nebraska, Cliff was the steady \nhand that guided the University through a turbulent era. He was \nappointed to the position in 1954 at the age of 38--the youngest \nuniversity president in the country at the time. His tenure at Nebraska \nlasted 15 years.\n  In reading the many tributes to Cliff over the last week, I was \ntouched by one particular story that showed his true colors. Upon \nlearning that a rival university had plans to place Nebraska's Black \nfootball players in one hotel and the White players in a separate \nhotel, he refused to let the team even board the plane to go to the \ngame. It wasn't long until the other school changed course and offered \nthe same accommodations for all players.\n  As Secretary of Agriculture, Cliff was a results-oriented advocate \nfor farmers and ranchers in my home State of Nebraska and across the \ncountry. He put a premium on bipartisanship, and his\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\ndistinguished record of accomplishments set a wonderful example for me \nduring my time as Secretary of Agriculture. As Congress works this year \nto reauthorize child nutrition programs, his impact is still felt. It \nwas then-Secretary Hardin who established the Food and Nutrition \nService within the Department of Agriculture to administer nutrition \nprograms.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to the entire Hardin family. Cliff \nleaves behind a legacy of service and leadership. He will be missed but \nnot forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2292-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. RICHARD J. PAPPAS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Dr. Richard \nJ. Pappas, who assumed the presidency of Davenport University in August \n2009 and was formally installed in this role on March 31, 2010. This \ninvestiture ceremony was surely a significant milestone for Dr. Pappas \nand his family, and is the result of many years of dedication and hard \nwork. Indeed, Dr. Pappas is poised to lead this fine institution to new \nheights as he builds on Davenport University's proud tradition.\n  With 14 campuses located across Michigan and an enrollment of more \nthan 12,000 students, Davenport University is an important part of the \neducational landscape of Michigan. With his ``Vision 2015,'' Dr. Pappas \nhas embarked on an effort to reshape and sharpen the focus of the \nuniversity. Vision 2015 emphasizes academic programming, market \nposition, and financial strength, three aspects critical to the success \nof a college or university. This is a comprehensive plan, one that will \nposition Davenport University for success for many years.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Pappas has proven to be a talented \nadministrator and leader in the field of higher education. Before \nassuming the presidency of Davenport University, Dr. Pappas served as \npresident of three other institutions: National-Louis University, Lake \nMichigan College, and Harford Community College. With Dr. Pappas at the \nhelm, Davenport University will benefit from a leader that brings more \nthan three decades of experience in higher education to this position, \nincluding 20 years as the head of an institution of higher education. \nThis broad knowledge of the needs of students at both 4-year and 2-year \ninstitutions will be especially helpful.\n  In addition to leading two institutions in Michigan, I am proud to \nsay that Dr. Pappas is a native Michiganian. After growing up in \nMichigan, he earned his undergraduate degree from Eastern Michigan \nUniversity and his master's and doctoral degrees from the University of \nMichigan. He is committed to civic and community endeavors, which is \nevidenced by his years of involvement in charitable organizations and \ncivic boards. As a result of his many efforts, Dr. Pappas has received \nseveral prestigious awards over the years, including the University of \nMichigan's Norman C. Harris Alumni Award and the National Council for \nMarketing and Public Relations Pacesetter Award. And above all, Dr. \nPappas is a family man and is buoyed by his wife, Pam, and his three \nchildren.\n  Again, I am privileged to have an opportunity to honor Dr. Pappas as \nhe embarks on a wonderful journey. There is no more noble cause than \neducating our next generation of leaders. His imprint on the lives of \nthese young people will be tremendous, and I know he is well-suited and \neager to undertake this challenge. I look forward to hearing about \nDavenport University's many successes in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2292-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2292-S2293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING BRANNON WOODHAM\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Brannon Woodham was one of the \nfinest people I have ever known. He combined a deep and mature \nChristian faith, a love of family that constantly showed itself in his \nconversations and actions, a rich appreciation of the exceptional \nnature of his country which he had faithfully served for so many years, \nand a loyalty to his friends and church.\n  We were in the same Sunday School class for over 30 years. Ever \npositive and welcoming, he was one of the constants--a rock really--\nthat set the class's tone and direction. This fellowship and spiritual \njourney meant much to him and enriched his classmates.\n  That on this day Brannon would want no pomp and circumstance, there \ncan be no doubt. But, if it were done, he would say better it be done \nquickly, and, importantly, honestly because he was indeed an honest \nman. In fact, I think he would want me to express his love to all of \nyou and to note--what we already know--that if his honesty had offended \nanyone, he would ask pardon, shaking his head ruefully saying he \ncouldn't help it, that was just the way he was made.\n  In Sunday School class, he was a wise and perceptive participant. He \nhad great spiritual depth, Scriptural knowledge, and mature beliefs. He \ndid not speak too often but when he had something to say, he said it--\nin plain words. Often his wit brought a burst of laughter--usually \nbecause he had hit the nail on the head. As Jesus might say, ``You are \nclose to the kingdom, brother.'' Importantly, those beliefs that he \nstated, he lived.\n  Mary and I were honored to be among his friends and were always \npleased to have his invitation to his home in the woods when he hosted \nhis storied church supper club. That was a special time of food and \nfellowship, on his bridge, getting a tour of his workshop--to be at \n``his place,'' which he had shared with his beloved Ursula, his partner \nfor 48 years, and to have a direct look into the heart of a great man \nwho lived a good life.\n  Mary and I often enjoyed lunch with Brannon after church at the \nWhistle Stop or some such place. In those conversations, his principles \nshone through and he would talk with pride and joy of his children, \ngrandchildren, the baseball games, going to Auburn, working together. \nThey had a unique bond.\n  Brannon believed in honesty and hard work--the Protestant ethic, if \nyou will, for which he made no apology.\n  Politically, he was not a party man, following, I suppose, the best \ntraditions of good civil servants. But he was an encourager to me. He \nwanted me to be a ``statesman,'' not a politician. I would indeed feel \nvery badly if I had failed him in this regard.\n  You may not know that he was an excellent writer. He wrote me many \nhandwritten letters--long ones--that I cherish. They were filled with \nwisdom, good values, sound policy ideas, and what he was hearing from \nthe community. A year or so ago, he gave me a copy of a plan he helped \nwrite some 40 years ago as part of a committee for the development of \nMobile. He was proud of their work, and indeed their concepts and \nvision are still valid today.\n  His accomplishments are many. One of his most important was the \ncritical role he played in the 'growth and character of Ashland Place \nUnited Methodist Church for four decades.\n  As a Southeastern Conference champion wrestler at Auburn, he \ndemonstrated courage, strength, and discipline. There are just two in \nthe ring and only one winner. He was a consistent winner.\n  I have come to understand the importance of our top civilian \npersonnel at our military bases. Generals come and go but able \ncivilians keep the bases running. Our civilian leaders are crucial to \nour military's success, and they are promoted on merit and on \nperformance. At Robbins Air Force Base, Brannon led the avionics \nsection that consisted of some 2,300 personnel. A place where errors \nare not allowed.\n  I visited him in the hospital, not long after his heart surgery. I \nthought he looked good, and he felt confident. But Brannon was no \nPolyanna. He was a realist. His words and manner conveyed that he well \nknew that he had had serious surgery, that nothing was guaranteed, and \nin the scheme of things life is short--``but a vapor'' the Scripture \nsays.\n  Daughter Ursula says later on during his final illness, and as he \nweakened, he knew the end was near and he was at peace. Of that I have \nno doubt. See, he knew he had had a good life of family and friends. He \nhad done his best to be true. He was confident in his salvation. He \nfelt blessed. And right he was.\n  So we celebrate honestly this remarkable and good man: a champion and \nfearless wrestler; a great leader at one of our Nation's military \nbases; a\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\npillar of his church; a faithful and loving husband; an example to all \nin love of family; a man of principles and conviction; a man of \ncourage, honesty, and honor; but humble, encouraging, and loving.\n  His values represent the highest and best of our faith, and of our \nNation. His family has received a great legacy--which to their credit \nthey fully recognize--and we, his friends, a true lesson in how to live \na ``good'' life.\n  Well done, good friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2293-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING VARNEY'S STORE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, we frequently hear stories of small \nbusinesses across our Nation that are struggling to survive, a trend \nwhich has only been exacerbated by the present economic recession. \nFacing numerous challenges, too many small firms simply end up closing \ntheir doors. Yet fortunately, thanks to the generosity of one man, the \nstory has a different ending for one small business in my home State of \nMaine. Today I honor Varney's Store, a longstanding fixture in the \ncentral Maine town of Windsor, that recently reopened to the approval \nof the store's many loyal customers.\n  Shirley Varney has been running Varney's Store, a traditional, \nfamily-owned convenience store at the corner of Routes 17 and 32 in \nWindsor, for the past 73 years. Over these many years, she has \nexperienced times of terrible burden and significant difficulty, such \nas when her husband and business partner sadly passed away 60 years \nago. Additionally, Mrs. Varney suffered a stroke several years ago, \nwhich has left her confined to a wheelchair. As a result, it became \ndifficult for Mrs. Varney to run her store, which she recently had to \nclose.\n  The closing of Varney's Store left a noticeable void in the \ncommunity. Not long after, Mike Richardson, a Maine State trooper and \nlocal patron of the store for 35 years, stepped forward to offer a \nhelping hand. Mr. Richardson had developed a lengthy relationship with \nthe Varney family through his patronage of the store, and often came to \nMrs. Varney's aid throughout the years. Displaying a true act of \nkindness, Mr. Richardson petitioned to become Mrs. Varney's legal \nguardian, committing to look after her and her son, who is also \nwheelchair bound.\n  Furthermore, Mr. Richardson had the desire to resurrect the fabled \ngeneral store, and embarked on an ambitious plan to make significant \nrenovations and reopen the establishment to its dedicated customers. \nAlong with his son Corey, now the manager of the store, Mr. Richardson \ngutted and revamped the inside, adding new and improved hardware and \nfurnishings. The duo also incorporated a brand new grill area, tables, \ncoolers, counters, and restrooms, and added a new parking lot outside. \nMr. Richardson insisted that the unique character and ambiance be \nmaintained, and so the store contains the original wood interior, \nseveral old tools, pictures of the original store, and many of the \nnotable antiques that have made this institution so famous in the eyes \nof its clients. The store still boasts its famous swinging doors, which \nhave been standing for the past 73 years.\n  Thanks to the hard work and commitment of Mike Richardson, the new \nVarney's Store hosted a friends and family night on February 20 to \ncelebrate the grand reopening of this famous locale, and the store was \nback in operation early the next morning, serving breakfast to longtime \ncustomers who had awaited its return.\n  For nearly three-quarters of a century, Varney's Store has offered \nthe people of Windsor and surrounding towns the goods they need for \neveryday living, but more significantly, it has provided them with a \nfeeling of hospitality. I thank Mrs. Varney for her numerous years of \ndedicated service to make her store such a welcoming environment. \nAdditionally, the story of Varney's Store resurgence is exemplary of \nhow a neighbor's kindness can give hope to a family and an entire \ncommunity. It is through the compassionate and gracious deeds of Mike \nRichardson and his family that Varney's Store has been refurbished and \nreopened, and I wish him and everyone at Varney's Store much success as \nthey aim to continue its tradition of excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2293-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2293-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2293-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 10:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 4887.

A bill to require a plan for the safe, orderly, and \nexpeditious redeployment of United States Armed Forces from \nAfghanistan; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould require the President to establish a flexible timetable for the \nresponsible drawdown of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Rep. McGovern and \nRep. Jones are also introducing companion legislation in the House.\n  This bicameral, bipartisan legislation would make clear our timeframe \nand our intention to focus on a global counterterrorism strategy that \nis essential to our efforts to combat al Qaeda. As we were reminded \nagain by the nearly successful attack on Christmas day, al Qaeda is an \nagile enemy with affiliates operating and recruiting around the world. \nSending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan this year will not help us \ndeter or thwart attacks by al Qaeda's increasingly dangerous regional \naffiliates, nor will it eliminate al Qaeda's safe haven in Pakistan. \nThe costly, military-centric, nation-building campaign currently \nunderway in Afghanistan is unsustainable, unrealistic and unnecessary \nfor our counterterrorism goals.\n  This bill would require the President to set a timetable for drawing \ndown our forces in Afghanistan and identify any variables that would \nrequire an extension of that timetable. While I am disappointed by his \ndecision to expand our military involvement in Afghanistan, I commend \nthe President for setting a start-date for redeployment, namely July \n2011. Our allies have stated that it has helped ``focus the minds'' of \nour partners in Afghanistan and around the world. Having a start date \nis essential, but alone it is insufficient--it should be accompanied by \nan end date, too. The President should convey to the American and \nAfghan people how long he anticipates it will take to complete his \nmilitary objectives. So long as our large-scale military presence \nremains open-ended, al Qaeda will have a valuable recruiting tool and \nour partners in Afghanistan will have an incentive to take the back \nseat, leaving U.S. troops and U.S. taxpayers on the hook.\n  As our own ambassador to Afghanistan has reportedly stated, sending \nmore troops for an indefinite period of time will only increase Afghan \ndependency upon the international community, exacerbate misconceptions \nabout why we are there and further enable Afghan leadership to shun \nresponsibility. I do not know what led the ambassador to ultimately \nendorse the open-ended commitment of additional troops, but I believe \nhis concerns remain valid today. Indeed, President Karzai's recent \nstatements before a variety of audiences only raise more questions \nabout his willingness to take the necessary steps to address corruption \nand security.\n  This bill does not itself set a specific date for the withdrawal of \nU.S. troops. Rather, it requires the President to set a timeline by \nwhich the redeployment of U.S. troops will be completed and to identify \nwhat variables, if any, would warrant the alteration of that timeline. \nWhile the President has set detailed objectives and metrics for \nAfghanistan, many of our objectives are dependent upon the conduct of \nofficials in the Afghan and Pakistani governments, both of which have \nbeen unreliable partners for many years. We must make clear to our \npartners in both countries that our support is not unconditional and \nthat we will not continue to bear the burden of our current military \ndeployment indefinitely.\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that we should give the \nPresident's new strategy in Afghanistan a ``chance'' to succeed. After \nover eight years of war, after so many lost lives and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars spent, I think we need to ask ourselves instead to \nconsider whether an open-ended military presence makes sense. To me, \nthat answer is clearly ``No.'' We will be putting at risk the lives of \n100,000 U.S. troops and spending tens of billions of dollars on a \nmilitary effort that is neither necessary for the national security \nimperative of pursuing al Qaeda's global network, nor likely to succeed \nin remaking the situation on the ground in Afghanistan to a meaningful \nextent.\n  Addressing the threat from al Qaeda and its affiliates around the \nworld\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\nmust be our top national security priority. The attempted terrorist \nattack on Christmas Day serves as a reminder that we have not put \nadequate resources into this priority, especially in safe havens such \nas Yemen. We are spending in Yemen only a tiny of a fraction of what we \nare spending in Afghanistan even though, according to the President's \ntop terrorism advisor, ``al Qaeda has several hundred members in \nYemen.'' We need major adjustments in our global counter-terrorism \nstrategy if we hope to defeat our enemy. Rather than investing a \ndisproportionate amount of our resources in Afghanistan, where al Qaeda \nhas a minimal presence, we need to shift resources to the urgent need \nof pursuing al Qaeda's global network.\n  We do not need to maintain a massive military presence in Afghanistan \nin order to prevent al Qaeda from having freedom of movement in that \ncountry. Instead, we need a sustainable counter-terrorism strategy for \nthe region that will also enable us to target any members of al Qaeda \nthat make the mistake of returning. Drawing down U.S. troops from \nAfghanistan and better investing some of the billions needed to support \nthem there would allow us to increase our ability to pursue al Qaeda as \nit continues to establish footholds in other locations around the \nworld.\n  I also continue to be concerned that our massive military presence in \nAfghanistan has a destabilizing effect, both there and in Pakistan, and \nthat our current strategy is overly dependent on actions by these two \npartners that have often proved unreliable. As our own ambassador \nreportedly noted, the last time we substantially increased forces in \nAfghanistan, namely the deployment of 33,000 additional troops in 2008 \nand 2009, overall violence and instability increased.\n  Our troop presence in Afghanistan has also provoked greater \nmilitancy. The reality is, our presence has driven militants across the \nborder into Pakistan, and may be driving militant groups which normally \nhave tense relationships closer together, compromising our ability to \ndivide al Qaeda from its hosts in Pakistan.\n  Furthermore, our current military strategy is unlikely to succeed in \nthe face of the ongoing safe haven in Pakistan. The Director of \nNational Intelligence recently testified that unless the Taliban's safe \nhaven in Pakistan ``. . . is greatly diminished, the Taliban insurgency \ncan survive defeats in Afghanistan.'' He went on to state that \n``Islamabad has maintained relationships with other Taliban-associated \ngroups that support and conduct operations against U.S. and ISAF forces \nin Afghanistan.'' Until this sanctuary problem is fully addressed, any \ngains from sending additional U.S. forces may be fleeting.\n  Some have argued that we must pursue an open-ended military campaign \nin Afghanistan if only to prevent instability in Afghanistan from \nspreading into Pakistan. I, too, am concerned about instability in \nPakistan, but I strongly disagree that sending troops to Afghanistan \nhas helped or will improve the situation. According to our intelligence \ncommunity, instability in Pakistan is driven primarily by poor \ngovernance and lack of socioeconomic reform in Pakistan. Even if we \nincrease stability in Afghanistan, Pakistan remains at risk if these \nissues are not addressed. We must convey to those in Pakistan who \nsupport reform that they have our long-term support. That doesn't mean \nspending many billions of dollars for several years on military \noperations in Afghanistan. It means making a sustainable commitment to \nreforms in Pakistan.\n  We have to be realistic about our goals in Afghanistan. Without a \nlegitimate Afghan partner, our tactical victories will likely be \nsquandered. We may build outposts throughout Helmand and Kandahar but \nthis has little meaning if we are unable to distinguish friend from foe \nand the Taliban is able to maintain shadow structures throughout the \nregion. It does no good to ``clear'' an area of insurgents to be held \nby the Afghan police if the police are perceived to be corrupt or \nunreliable. Nor can military operations address the sense of alienation \namong the population in the South.\n  Indeed, such operations may actually undermine long-term stability as \nthey contribute, despite our best efforts, to civilian casualties. In \nregards to casualties from operations related to things like \ncheckpoints and convoys, for example, Gen. McChrystal recently \nacknowledged that ``[w]e've shot an amazing number of people and killed \na number and, to my knowledge, none ha[ve] proven to have been a real \nthreat to the force.'' This only reinforces the image of the United \nStates as a hostile, occupying force.\n  Rather than spending $100 billion in Afghanistan in one year, \nprimarily on military operations, it would be far better to make a \nsustainable commitment to this country. Long-term, gradual change is \nfar more realistic than attempts to radically transform Afghan society \nat the point of a gun, especially when we have lost the support of key \nsections of the population. We must also prioritize efforts to promote \nthe rule of law. Without the rule of law, our development efforts are \nvulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse and will further feed into the \ncorruption that is alienating the population from the government. \nIndeed, Secretary Clinton has testified that ``siphoning off \ncontractual money from the international community . . . [is] a major \nsource of funding for the Taliban.''\n  For too long, we have prioritized short term security goals at the \nexpense of the rule of law. We have prioritized quantity over quality \nin the Afghan National Security Forces. We have compromised the state's \nmonopoly over the use of violence by partnering with--in Gen. \nMcChrystal's words--``polarizing and predatory'' powerbrokers. We have \nturned a blind eye to corruption and human rights abuses. If we get \nserious about these issues, it will do more to stabilize the situation \nthan anything we can accomplish by conducting military operations. \nAfter so many years in which our military efforts have been \nshortchanged by the focus on Iraq, we cannot simply turn back the clock \nand assume that what may have been achievable militarily in Afghanistan \nyears ago is still achievable today.\n  Even if my colleagues support the President's strategy in \nAfghanistan, they should acknowledge the need to set a goal for when it \nshould be brought to a close. While I have serious doubts about the \nwisdom of the current approach, as I have explained, and about pursuing \nan expansive nation-building agenda in the face of the economic \nproblems facing our own country and the rising casualty rates in \nAfghanistan, this bill does not dictate a particular strategy for \nAfghanistan. Rather, it simply requires the President to inform the \nAmerican people about how long his military strategy is expected to \ntake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Begich, Mrs. \n        McCaskill, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Warner, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \n        Mr. Bennet, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Bayh, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Casey, Mr. Menendez, \n        Mr. Cardin, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 3201. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to extend \nTRICARE coverage to certain dependents under the age of 26; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak about health \ninsurance reform. I wanted to remind all of us that last month we \nsuccessfully passed health insurance reform, upon which I think we will \nhave a very strong foundation to build, improve, and strengthen access \nto health care all across America.\n  Throughout the long and critically important debate on how best to \nfix our system, I came to the floor on many occasions, as did the \nPresiding Officer and a lot of my freshman Senators, to discuss the \nneed for reform. I believe the bill that President Obama signed into \nlaw will help struggling Colorado families and hopefully our struggling \neconomy as well.\n  So I think you and I agree there is a lot of work left to be done, \nand no bill of this magnitude and importance is perfect. To implement \nthis new law is a major undertaking that will require us in the \nCongress to revisit and improve upon what we have already done.\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\n  In that spirit, I come to the Senate floor to introduce a bill that I \nbelieve is a great way to start making those improvements. I thank \nSenators Begich and McCaskill for working with me to develop a bill, \nand Senator Mikulski for her hard work and energy and support as well.\n  Our legislation is entitled ``The TRICARE Dependent Coverage \nExtension Act.'' It would help fulfill this important goal of the \nhealth insurance reform that the Presiding Officer and I support; that \nis, giving young adults the opportunity to remain on their parents' \nhealth care plan until the age of 26.\n  Young adults across our country are struggling to enter the job \nmarket as we get our economy back on track, and this legislation will \nensure that the families of our military servicemembers are not left \nbehind when this benefit goes into effect later this year for millions \nof civilian families and their children.\n  Currently, the TRICARE Program, which provides health insurance for \nmilitary servicemembers, retirees, and their families, covers children \nup to the age of 21, or in some cases up to the age of 23 if they are \nfull-time college students.\n  The TRICARE Dependent Coverage Extension Act will give young adults \nof these military families who have not been able to find health care \ninsurance through an employer the opportunity to pay a reasonable \npremium and remain covered until their 26th birthday on their parents' \nplan.\n  Health reform, I think we agree, is meant to ensure that all \nAmericans have access to affordable health care coverage. I cannot \nthink of any of our countrymen more deserving of the peace of mind \nenvisioned by this new law than members of our Armed Forces and their \nfamilies.\n  They, in countries all over the world, make tremendous sacrifices \nevery day for our Nation. I think it is over 60 different countries \nthat we have servicemembers serving around the world. They deserve \nbenefits that will keep them healthy and secure.\n  In addition to the three Senators I mentioned, Begich, McCaskill, and \nMikulski, there are 19 of our Democratic colleagues who have also \njoined in supporting this legislation. I think this outpouring of \nsupport on short notice is indicative of how beneficial the bill will \nbe for the families of our armed servicemembers.\n  Now, we have had our disagreements with the other side of the aisle \non how best to reform our health care system as a whole. But I think \nthere are certain areas of common interest we can still find and come \ntogether on to improve the lives of the people we are here to serve. I \nthink this is one of those instances, and I want to offer my hand to \nour Republican friends and hope they will join a group of us in \ncosponsoring this important piece of legislation.\n  I sit on the Armed Services Committee in the Senate, and I served on \nthe Armed Services Committee in the House. I would like to think I \nlearned how to spot a good deal for our Nation's soldiers and their \nfamilies, and this is a good deal.\n  Again, I would encourage all 100 Senators to consider joining us in \nthis important, straightforward, cost-efficient idea that I am \npresenting today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2298-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2298-S2299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 479--EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR THE PEOPLE OF POLAND IN \nTHE AFTERMATH OF THE DEVASTATING PLANE CRASH THAT KILLED THE COUNTRY'S \nPRESIDENT, FIRST LADY, AND 94 OTHER HIGH RANKING GOVERNMENT, MILITARY, \n                  AND CIVIC LEADERS ON APRIL 10, 2010\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nVoinovich, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Reid, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \nKyl, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nBegich, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, \nMr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. \nBurris, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, \nMr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker, Mr. \nCornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \nEnzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \nGraham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, \nMrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nKaufman, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. LeMieux, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, \nMr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Murkowski, \nMrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Pryor, \nMr. Reed, Mr. Risch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Sanders, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \nSpecter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Udall of Colorado, \nMr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize America's public \nservants, who provide so many of the vital services upon which this \nnation relies. As the Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, I am \npleased to once again introduce a resolution honoring these employees \nin celebration of Public Service Recognition Week.\n  Every day, Americans rely on our hardworking and talented government \nemployees. Public servants deliver our mail, educate our children, care \nfor our veterans, guard our prisons, protect our borders and \ncommunities, and defend our country and the principles of liberty and \nfreedom that we hold dear. They influence the lives of people around \nthe world as diplomats, promoting peace, prosperity, and democracy in \nconflicted regions, and providing critical assistance to developing and \nimpoverished communities.\n  Just as President John F. Kennedy did in his 1961 inaugural address, \nPresident Obama has called on Americans to make a renewed commitment to \npublic service. Public Service Recognition Week allows us not only to \nhonor and celebrate the works of federal, state and local public \nemployees, but also provides an opportunity for all Americans to \nexplore the many possible careers in public service. Throughout the\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\nnation, public employees use the week to educate their fellow citizens \non how government serves them, and how government services make life \nbetter for all of us. It is my hope that through these events, many \nyoung professionals will decide to pursue a career in public service.\n  As a former teacher and a life-long public servant, I am proud to \nhighlight the importance of Public Service Recognition Week. The many \ndomestic and global challenges we face make this a critical time for \nour Nation. Although we have designated a week to pay tribute to \ngovernment employees, it is also important that we honor the invaluable \nservice of public servants throughout the year. Our way of life--and \nthe strength of our country--would not exist without the work of public \nemployees.\n  This is the 26th year we have honored our public servants with Public \nService Recognition Week during the first full week of May. Each year \nwe use this week to recognize and honor the men and women who serve \nAmerica as federal, state, and local government employees, and commend \ntheir dedication to serving others. I encourage my colleagues to \nrecognize the public servants in their states and join me in this \nannual celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2300-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 482--DESIGNATING APRIL 2010 AS ``NATIONAL 9-1-1 \n                           EDUCATION MONTH''\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. Burr) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 482\n\n       Whereas 9-1-1 is nationally recognized as the number to \n     call in an emergency to receive immediate help from police, \n     fire, emergency medical services, or other appropriate \n     emergency response entities;\n       Whereas in 1967, the President's Commission on Law \n     Enforcement and Administration of Justice recommended that a \n     ``single number should be established'' nationwide for \n     reporting emergency situations, and other Federal Government \n     agencies and various governmental officials also supported \n     and encouraged the recommendation;\n       Whereas in 1968, the American Telephone and Telegraph \n     Company (AT) announced that it would establish the digits \n     9-1-1 as the emergency code throughout the United States;\n       Whereas 9-1-1 was designated by Congress as the national \n     emergency call number under the Wireless Communications and \n     Public Safety Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-81; 113 Stat. \n     1286);\n       Whereas section 102 of the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 (47 \n     U.S.C. 942 note) declared an enhanced 9-1-1 system to be ``a \n     high national priority'' and part of ``our Nation's homeland \n     security and public safety'';\n       Whereas it is important that policy makers at all levels of \n     government understand the importance of 9-1-1, how the system \n     works today, and the steps that are needed to modernize the \n     9-1-1 system;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is the connection between the eyes \n     and ears of the public and the emergency response system in \n     the United States and is often the first place emergencies of \n     all magnitudes are reported, making 9-1-1 a significant \n     homeland security asset;\n       Whereas more than 6,000 9-1-1 public safety answering \n     points serve more than 3,000 counties and parishes throughout \n     the United States;\n       Whereas dispatchers at public safety answering points \n     answer more than 200,000,000 9-1-1 calls each year in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas a growing number of 9-1-1 calls are made using \n     wireless and Internet Protocol-based communications services;\n       Whereas a growing segment of the population, including the \n     deaf, hard of hearing, deaf-blind, and individuals with \n     speech disabilities are increasingly communicating with \n     nontraditional text, video, and instant messaging \n     communications services and expect those services to be able \n     to connect directly to 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the growth and variety of means of communication, \n     including mobile and Internet Protocol-based systems, impose \n     challenges for accessing 9-1-1 and implementing an enhanced \n     9-1-1 system and require increased education and awareness \n     about the capabilities of different means of communication;\n       Whereas numerous other N-1-1 and 800 number services exist \n     for nonemergency situations, including 2-1-1, 3-1-1, 5-1-1, \n     7-1-1, 8-1-1, poison control centers, and mental health \n     hotlines, and the public needs to be educated on when to use \n     those services in addition to or instead of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas international visitors and immigrants make up an \n     increasing percentage of the United States population each \n     year, and visitors and immigrants may have limited knowledge \n     of our emergency calling system;\n       Whereas people of all ages use 9-1-1 and it is critical to \n     educate those people on the proper use of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas senior citizens are at high risk for needing to \n     access to 9-1-1 and many senior citizens are learning to use \n     new technology;\n       Whereas thousands of 9-1-1 calls are made every year by \n     children properly trained in the use of 9-1-1, which saves \n     lives and underscores the critical importance of training \n     children early in life about 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is often misused, including by the \n     placement of prank and nonemergency calls;\n       Whereas misuse of the 9-1-1 system results in costly and \n     inefficient use of 9-1-1 and emergency response resources and \n     needs to be reduced;\n       Whereas parents, teachers, and all other caregivers need to \n     play an active role in 9-1-1 education for children, but will \n     do so only after being first educated themselves;\n       Whereas there are many avenues for 9-1-1 public education, \n     including safety fairs, school presentations, libraries, \n     churches, businesses, public safety answering point tours or \n     open houses, civic organizations, and senior citizen centers;\n       Whereas children, parents, teachers, and the National \n     Parent Teacher Association contribute importantly to the \n     education of children about the importance of 9-1-1 through \n     targeted outreach efforts to public and private school \n     systems;\n       Whereas we as a Nation should strive to host at least 1 \n     educational event regarding the proper use of 9-1-1 in every \n     school in the country every year;\n       Whereas programs to promote proper use of 9-1-1 during \n     National 9-1-1 Education Month could include--\n       (1) public awareness events, including conferences and \n     media outreach, training activities for parents, teachers, \n     school administrators, other caregivers and businesses;\n       (2) educational events in schools and other appropriate \n     venues; and\n       (3) production and distribution of information about the 9-\n     1-1 system designed to educate people of all ages on the \n     importance and proper use of 9-1-1; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States deserve the best \n     education regarding the use of 9-1-1: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2010 as ``National 9-1-1 Education \n     Month'';

A motion to reconsider the \n     vote by which the motion is disposed of shall not be in \n     order.\n       (B) Consideration.--The 2007 spending bill shall be \n     considered as read. The previous question shall be considered \n     as ordered on the 2007 spending bill to its passage without \n     intervening motion except 50 hours of debate, equally divided \n     and controlled by the proponent and an opponent. A motion to \n     limit debate shall be in order during such debate. A motion \n     to reconsider the vote on passage of the 2007 spending bill \n     shall not be in order.\n       (C) Appeals.--Appeals from decisions of the chair relating \n     to the application of the Rules of the House of \n     Representatives to the procedure relating to the 2007 \n     spending bill shall be decided without debate.\n       (D) Application of house rules.--Except to the extent \n     specifically provided in this paragraph, consideration of an \n     2007 spending bill shall be governed by the Rules of the \n     House of Representatives. It shall not be in order in the \n     House of Representatives to consider any 2007 spending bill \n     introduced pursuant to the provisions of this subsection \n     under a suspension of the rules pursuant to clause 1 of House \n     Rule XV, or under a special rule reported by the House \n     Committee on Rules.\n       (E) Amendments.--It shall be in order to offer amendments \n     to the 2007 spending bill, provided that any such amendment \n     is relevant and would not result in an overall outlay level \n     exceeding the level included in the 2007 spending bill.\n       (F) Vote on passage.--Immediately following the conclusion \n     of consideration of the 2007 spending bill, the vote on \n     passage of the 2007 spending bill shall occur without any \n     intervening action or motion and shall require an affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. \n     If the 2007 spending bill is passed, the Clerk of the House \n     of Representatives shall cause the bill to be transmitted to \n     the Senate before the close of the next day of session of the \n     House.\n       (4) Fast track consideration in senate.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding rule XXII of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate, it is in order, not later than 7 days of \n     session after the date on which an 2007 spending bill is \n     reported or discharged from all committees to which it was \n     referred, for the majority leader of the Senate or the \n     majority leader's designee to move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the 2007 spending bill. It shall also be in \n     order for any Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the 2007 spending bill at any time after the \n     conclusion of such 7-day period. A motion to proceed is in \n     order even though a previous motion to the same effect has \n     been disagreed to. All points of order against the motion to \n     proceed to the 2007 spending bill are waived. The motion to \n     proceed is not debatable. The motion is not subject to a \n     motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by which \n     the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in \n     order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the \n     2007 spending bill is agreed to, the 2007 spending bill shall \n     remain the unfinished business until disposed of.\n       (B) Debate.--Consideration of an 2007 spending bill and of \n     all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith \n     shall not exceed a total of 50 hours. Debate shall be divided \n     equally between the majority and minority leaders or their \n     designees. A motion further to limit debate on the 2007 \n     spending bill is in order. Any debatable motion or appeal is \n     debatable for not to exceed 1 hour, to be divided equally \n     between those favoring and those opposing the motion or \n     appeal. All time used for consideration of the 2007 spending \n     bill, including time used for quorum calls and voting, shall \n     be counted against the total 50 hours of consideration.\n       (C) Amendments.--It shall be in order to offer amendments \n     to the 2007 spending bill, provided that any such amendment \n     is relevant and would not result in an overall outlay level \n     exceeding the level included in the 2007 spending bill.\n       (D) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall occur \n     immediately following the conclusion of the debate on the \n     2007 spending bill and a single quorum call at the conclusion \n     of the debate if requested. Passage shall require an \n     affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen \n     and sworn.\n       (E) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate to the procedure relating to a 2007 \n     spending bill shall be decided without debate.\n       (5) Rules to coordinate action with other house.--\n       (A) Referral.--If, before the passage by 1 House of an 2007 \n     spending bill of that House, that House receives from the \n     other House an 2007 spending bill, then such proposal from \n     the other House shall not be referred to a committee and \n     shall immediately be placed on the calendar.\n       (B) Treatment of 2007 spending bill of other house.--If 1 \n     House fails to introduce or consider a 2007 spending bill \n     under this section, the 2007 spending bill of the other House \n     shall be entitled to expedited floor procedures under this \n     section.\n       (C) Procedure.--\n       (i) 2007 spending bill in the senate.--If prior to passage \n     of the 2007 spending bill in the Senate, the Senate receives \n     an 2007 spending bill from the House, the procedure in the \n     Senate shall be the same as if no 2007 spending bill had been \n     received from the House except that--\n\n       (I) the vote on final passage shall be on the 2007 spending \n     bill of the House if it is identical to the 2007 spending \n     bill then pending for passage in the Senate; or\n       (II) if the 2007 spending bill from the House is not \n     identical to the 2007 spending bill then pending for passage \n     in the Senate and the Senate then passes the Senate 2007 \n     spending bill, the Senate shall be considered to have passed \n     the House 2007 spending bill as amended by the text of the \n     Senate 2007 spending bill.\n\n       (ii) Disposition of the 2007 spending bill.--Upon \n     disposition of the 2007 spending bill received from the \n     House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the 2007 \n     spending bill originated in the Senate.\n       (D) Treatment of companion measures in the senate.--If \n     following passage of the 2007 spending bill in the Senate, \n     the Senate then receives an 2007 spending bill from the House \n     of Representatives that is the same as the 2007 spending bill \n     passed by the House, the House-passed 2007 spending bill \n     shall not be debatable. If the House-passed 2007 spending \n     bill is identical to the Senate-passed 2007 spending bill, \n     the vote on passage of the 2007 spending bill in the Senate \n     shall be considered to be the vote on passage of the 2007 \n     spending bill received from the House of Representatives. If \n     it is not identical to the House-passed 2007 spending bill, \n     then the Senate shall be considered to have passed the 2007 \n     spending bill of the House as amended by the text of the \n     Senate 2007 spending bill.\n       (E) Consideration in conference.--Upon passage of the 2007 \n     spending bill, the Senate shall be deemed to have insisted on \n     its amendment and requested a conference with the House of \n     Representatives on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \n     and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part \n     of the Senate, without any intervening action.\n       (F) Action on conference reports in senate.--\n       (i) Motion to proceed.--A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of the conference report on the 2007 spending \n     bill may be made even though a previous motion to the same \n     effect has been disagreed to.\n       (ii) Consideration.--During the consideration in the Senate \n     of the conference report (or a message between Houses) on the \n     2007 spending bill, and all amendments in disagreement, and \n     all amendments thereto, and debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith, debate (or consideration) shall be \n     limited to 30 hours, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the majority leader and minority leader or \n     their designees. Debate on any debatable motion or appeal \n     related to the conference report (or a message between \n     Houses) shall be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided \n     between, and controlled by, the mover and the manager of the \n     conference report (or a message between Houses).\n       (iii) Debate if defeated.--If the conference report is \n     defeated, debate on any request for a new conference and the \n     appointment of conferees shall be limited to 1 hour, to be \n     equally divided between, and controlled by, the manager of \n     the conference report and the minority leader or his \n     designee, and should any motion be made to instruct the \n     conferees before the conferees are named, debate on such \n     motion shall be limited to one-half hour, to be equally \n     divided between, and controlled by, the mover and the manager \n     of the conference report. Debate on any amendment to any such \n     instructions shall be limited to 20 minutes, to be equally \n     divided between and controlled by the mover and the manager \n     of the conference report. In all cases when the manager of \n     the conference report is in favor of any motion, appeal, or \n     amendment, the time in opposition shall be under the control \n     of the minority leader or his designee.\n       (iv) Amendments in disagreement.--If there are amendments \n     in disagreement to a conference report on the 2007 spending \n     bill, time on each amendment shall be limited to 30 minutes, \n     to be equally divided between, and controlled by, the manager \n     of the conference report and the minority leader or his \n     designee. No amendment that is not germane to the provisions \n     of such amendments shall be received.\n       (G) Vote on conference report in each house.--Passage of \n     the conference in each House shall be by an affirmative vote \n     of three-fifths of the Members of that House, duly chosen and \n     sworn.\n       (H) Veto.--If the President vetoes the bill debate on a \n     veto message in the Senate under this subsection shall be 1 \n     hour equally divided between the majority and minority \n     leaders or their designees.\n       (6) Rules of the senate and house of representatives.--This \n     subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed \n     to be part\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\n     of the rules of each House, respectively but applicable only \n     with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in \n     the case of bill under this section, and it supersedes other \n     rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with such \n     rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 204\n\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect is \n     one of the most prevalent, life-threatening birth defects in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect is \n     a severe, often deadly birth defect that has a devastating \n     impact, in both human and economic terms, affecting equally \n     people of all races, sexes, nationalities, geographic \n     locations, and income levels;\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect \n     occurs in 1 in every 2,000 live births in the United States \n     and accounts for 8 percent of all major congenital anomalies;\n       Whereas, in 2004, there were approximately 4,115,590 live \n     births in the United States, and in approximately 1,800 of \n     those live births, the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth \n     defect occurred, causing countless additional friends, loved \n     ones, spouses, and caregivers to shoulder the physical, \n     emotional, and financial burdens the congenital diaphragmatic \n     hernia birth defect causes;\n       Whereas there is no genetic indicator or any other \n     indicator available to predict the occurrence of the \n     congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect, other than \n     through the performance of an ultrasound during pregnancy;\n       Whereas there is no consistent treatment or cure for the \n     congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect;\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect is \n     a leading cause of neonatal death in the United States;\n       Whereas 50 percent of the patients who do survive the \n     congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect have residual \n     health issues, resulting in a severe strain on pediatric \n     medical resources and on the delivery of health care services \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas proactive diagnosis and the appropriate management \n     and care of fetuses afflicted with the congenital \n     diaphragmatic hernia birth defect minimize the incidence of \n     emergency situations resulting from the birth defect and \n     dramatically improve survival rates among people with the \n     birth defect;\n       Whereas neonatal medical care is one of the most expensive \n     types of medical care provided in the United States and \n     patients with the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth \n     defect stay in intensive care for approximately 60 to 90 \n     days, costing millions of dollars, utilizing blood from local \n     blood banks, and requiring the most technically advanced \n     medical care;\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect is \n     a birth defect that causes damage to the lungs and the \n     cardiovascular system;\n       Whereas patients with the congenital diaphragmatic hernia \n     birth defect may have long-term health issues such as \n     respiratory insufficiency, gastroesophageal reflux, poor \n     growth, neurodevelopmental delay, behavior problems, hearing \n     loss, hernia recurrence, and orthopedic deformities;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms and outcomes of the \n     congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect and the limited \n     public awareness of the birth defect cause many patients to \n     receive substandard care, to forego regular visits to \n     physicians, and not to receive good health or therapeutic \n     management that would help avoid serious complications in the \n     future, compromising the quality of life of those patients;\n       Whereas people suffering from chronic, life-threatening \n     diseases and birth defects, similar to the congenital \n     diaphragmatic hernia birth defect, and family members of \n     those people are predisposed to depression and the resulting \n     consequences of depression because of anxiety over the \n     possible pain, suffering, and premature death that people \n     with such diseases and birth defects may face;\n       Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States want \n     treatments and cures for disease and hope to see results from \n     investments in research conducted by the National Institutes \n     of Health and from initiatives such as the National \n     Institutes of Health Roadmap to the Future;\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect is \n     an example of how collaboration, technological innovation, \n     scientific momentum, and public-private partnerships can \n     generate therapeutic interventions that directly benefit the \n     people and families suffering from the congenital \n     diaphragmatic hernia birth defect;\n       Whereas collaboration, technological innovation, scientific \n     momentum, and public-private partnerships can save billions \n     of Federal dollars under Medicare, Medicaid, and other \n     programs for therapies, and early intervention will increase \n     survival rates among people suffering from the congenital \n     diaphragmatic hernia birth defect;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology, the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge, and better management of \n     care for patients with the congenital diaphragmatic hernia \n     birth defect already have increased survival rates in some \n     cases;\n       Whereas there is still a need for more research and \n     increased awareness of the congenital diaphragmatic hernia \n     birth defect and for an increase in funding for that research \n     in order to provide a better quality of life to survivors of \n     the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect, and more \n     optimism for the families and health care professionals who \n     work with children with the birth defect;\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide \n     dedicated to expanding research,\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\n     fostering public awareness and understanding, educating \n     patients and their families about the congenital \n     diaphragmatic hernia birth defect to improve their treatment \n     and care, providing appropriate moral support, and \n     encouraging people to become organ donors; and\n       Whereas volunteers engage in an annual national awareness \n     event held on March 31, making that day an appropriate time \n     to recognize National Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia \n     Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 31, 2010, as ``National Congenital \n     Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Day'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of a national day to \n     raise public awareness and understanding of the congenital \n     diaphragmatic hernia birth defect;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure \n     for the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support National Congenital \n     Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Day through appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities, to promote public awareness of the \n     congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect, and to foster \n     understanding of the impact of the disease on patients and \n     their families.\n\n

Res. 468\n\n       Whereas, on April 8, 2010, the Blackstone Valley Tourism \n     Council will celebrate the 25th anniversary of its founding;\n       Whereas, since 1985, the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council \n     has been at the forefront of sustainable destination \n     development, community building, resiliency, education, and \n     scholarly research;\n       Whereas the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council is a non-\n     profit corporation registered as a 501(c)(3) educational \n     organization and is authorized under Section 42-63.1-5 of the \n     Rhode Island General Laws as the State-designated regional \n     tourism development agency for the Blackstone Valley of Rhode \n     Island;\n       Whereas the development region of the Blackstone Valley \n     Tourism Council follows the length and width of the \n     Blackstone River Watershed, from the many tributaries in \n     southern Massachusetts, to the end of the river at the \n     headwaters of the Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island;\n       Whereas the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council represents \n     the Rhode Island cities of Pawtucket, Central Falls, and \n     Woonsocket, and towns of Cumberland, Lincoln, North \n     Smithfield, Smithfield, Glocester, and Burrillville;\n       Whereas the Blackstone Valley is the birthplace of the \n     American Industrial Revolution that began in 1790 in \n     Pawtucket, Rhode Island, when Samuel Slater began textile \n     manufacturing in a wooden mill on the banks of the Blackstone \n     River;\n       Whereas, since its beginning, the Blackstone Valley Tourism \n     Council has worked to develop, promote, and expand the \n     economic and community development base for the cities and \n     towns in the Blackstone Valley to create a viable visitor and \n     cultural destination that preserves the historic heritage of \n     the region;\n       Whereas the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council works as an \n     interpreter and educator of the history and ecology of the \n     Blackstone River, initiates ongoing international \n     relationships of major importance to the region, provides \n     input on future riverfront and economic development, and \n     develops various recreational activities;\n       Whereas the work that the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council \n     accomplishes benefits from its partnerships with local social \n     and community development organizations, municipalities, \n     regional and State economic development organizations, \n     educational institutions, and National and international \n     entities;\n       Whereas the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council was the first \n     recipient of the Ulysses Prize from the United Nations World \n     Tourism Organization (UNWTO) that merits distinction for \n     innovative contributions to tourism policy, sustainable \n     tourism planning, environmental protection and new \n     technologies, and in 2006, the Council received the \n     UNWTO.Sbest Certification in tourism governance, the only \n     organization in the United States to earn this certification; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 2008, the World Travel and Tourism Council \n     (WTTC) recognized the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council with \n     its Tourism for Tomorrow Destination Award, a prestigious \n     sustainable tourism development award, in recognition of the \n     integrated, community-centered, resilient approach of the \n     Council to tourism development and community building: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council on the \n     celebration of its 25th anniversary; and\n       (2) wishes the Council continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2326-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2326-S2327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL 9-1-1 EDUCATION MONTH\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Res. 482\n\n       Whereas 9-1-1 is nationally recognized as the number to \n     call in an emergency to receive immediate help from police, \n     fire, emergency medical services, or other appropriate \n     emergency response entities;\n       Whereas in 1967, the President's Commission on Law \n     Enforcement and Administration of Justice recommended that a \n     ``single number should be established'' nationwide for \n     reporting emergency situations, and other Federal Government \n     agencies and various governmental officials also supported \n     and encouraged the recommendation;\n       Whereas in 1968, the American Telephone and Telegraph \n     Company (AT) announced that it would establish the digits \n     9-1-1 as the emergency code throughout the United States;\n       Whereas 9-1-1 was designated by Congress as the national \n     emergency call number under the Wireless Communications and \n     Public Safety Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-81; 113 Stat. \n     1286);\n       Whereas section 102 of the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 (47 \n     U.S.C. 942 note) declared an enhanced 9-1-1 system to be ``a \n     high national priority'' and part of ``our Nation's homeland \n     security and public safety'';\n       Whereas it is important that policy makers at all levels of \n     government understand the importance of 9-1-1, how the system \n     works today, and the steps that are needed to modernize the \n     9-1-1 system;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is the connection between the eyes \n     and ears of the public and the emergency response system in \n     the United States and is often the first place emergencies of \n     all magnitudes are reported, making 9-1-1 a significant \n     homeland security asset;\n       Whereas more than 6,000 9-1-1 public safety answering \n     points serve more than 3,000 counties and parishes throughout \n     the United States;\n       Whereas dispatchers at public safety answering points \n     answer more than 200,000,000 9-1-1 calls each year in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas a growing number of 9-1-1 calls are made using \n     wireless and Internet Protocol-based communications services;\n       Whereas a growing segment of the population, including the \n     deaf, hard of hearing, deaf-blind, and individuals with \n     speech disabilities are increasingly communicating with \n     nontraditional text, video, and instant messaging \n     communications services and expect those services to be able \n     to connect directly to 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the growth and variety of means of communication, \n     including mobile and Internet Protocol-based systems, impose \n     challenges for accessing 9-1-1 and implementing an enhanced \n     9-1-1 system and require increased education and awareness \n     about the capabilities of different means of communication;\n       Whereas numerous other N-1-1 and 800 number services exist \n     for nonemergency situations, including 2-1-1, 3-1-1, 5-1-1, \n     7-1-1, 8-\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\n     1-1, poison control centers, and mental health hotlines, and \n     the public needs to be educated on when to use those services \n     in addition to or instead of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas international visitors and immigrants make up an \n     increasing percentage of the United States population each \n     year, and visitors and immigrants may have limited knowledge \n     of our emergency calling system;\n       Whereas people of all ages use 9-1-1 and it is critical to \n     educate those people on the proper use of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas senior citizens are at high risk for needing to \n     access to 9-1-1 and many senior citizens are learning to use \n     new technology;\n       Whereas thousands of 9-1-1 calls are made every year by \n     children properly trained in the use of 9-1-1, which saves \n     lives and underscores the critical importance of training \n     children early in life about 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is often misused, including by the \n     placement of prank and nonemergency calls;\n       Whereas misuse of the 9-1-1 system results in costly and \n     inefficient use of 9-1-1 and emergency response resources and \n     needs to be reduced;\n       Whereas parents, teachers, and all other caregivers need to \n     play an active role in 9-1-1 education for children, but will \n     do so only after being first educated themselves;\n       Whereas there are many avenues for 9-1-1 public education, \n     including safety fairs, school presentations, libraries, \n     churches, businesses, public safety answering point tours or \n     open houses, civic organizations, and senior citizen centers;\n       Whereas children, parents, teachers, and the National \n     Parent Teacher Association contribute importantly to the \n     education of children about the importance of 9-1-1 through \n     targeted outreach efforts to public and private school \n     systems;\n       Whereas we as a Nation should strive to host at least 1 \n     educational event regarding the proper use of 9-1-1 in every \n     school in the country every year;\n       Whereas programs to promote proper use of 9-1-1 during \n     National 9-1-1 Education Month could include--\n       (1) public awareness events, including conferences and \n     media outreach, training activities for parents, teachers, \n     school administrators, other caregivers and businesses;\n       (2) educational events in schools and other appropriate \n     venues; and\n       (3) production and distribution of information about the 9-\n     1-1 system designed to educate people of all ages on the \n     importance and proper use of 9-1-1; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States deserve the best \n     education regarding the use of 9-1-1: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2010 as ``National 9-1-1 Education \n     Month''; and\n       (2) urges Government officials, parents, teachers, school \n     administrators, caregivers, businesses, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the people of the United States to observe \n     the month with appropriate ceremonies, training events, and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/14/senate-section/article/S2327-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, APRIL 15, 2010\n\n  Mr. CASEY.
