Mr. President, following leader remarks, there will be a \nperiod of morning business for 1 hour, with Senators permitted to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes each. The Republicans will control the first half, \nthe majority will control the final half-hour.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nH.R. 2996, the Interior appropriations bill. At 12 o'clock, the Senate \nwill proceed to a vote in relation to the Feinstein amendment. The \nSenate will then recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly caucus \nluncheons.\n  The official Senate photograph of the 111th Congress is at 2:15 p.m. \ntoday. Senators should be seated at their desks in the Chamber promptly \nat 2:15.\n  Several things. No. 1, on the Interior appropriations bill, today is \nthe day for Members to offer amendments. They had Thursday, yesterday, \nand today, so this is the time they should act because I am not sure \nwhat we will do after today, but we are not going to spend more time on \nthis bill. We shouldn't, at least. I hope we don't have to because we \nhave to get to the Defense appropriations bill at the earliest possible \ndate.\n  As to the photograph, normally what we do is we come in and convene \nat 2:15 and recess until the photograph is completed, and that is what \nwe will do today, more than likely.\n  I would also say that, as we speak, the Finance Committee has been \ninvolved in a markup of that important piece of legislation for 1 hour \nnow. They started at 9 o'clock. They probably will only make opening \nstatements this morning before the weekly caucus luncheons. After that, \nthe amendment process will start.\n  There will be a decision made, hopefully within the next several \ndays, as to how we will proceed on this legislation. It is my hope we \nwill have a bill reported out of that committee that will be brought to \nthe floor, and then my responsibility will be to meld that bill with \nthe HELP bill so we can have a piece of legislation on the Senate floor \nin the near future.\n  This is an important step in the process. It is a step I am confident \nwill bring results that will be favorable to the country. If we can't \nwork this out--to do something within the committee structure--then we \nwill be forced to do the reconciliation. Of course, that will be a last \nresort. I know a number of steps we can take before we do that, but a \nreconciliation bill is there for us. It was put there by the Budget \nCommittee.\n  If we can't come up with a bipartisan bill with the help of a few \nRepublicans, then we will have to go the route of reconciliation. On \nreconciliation, under the order, there is only 20 hours of debate. It \nwould be a free amendment process, which would take some time. We have \ndone reconciliation on many different issues in recent years. We have \ndone it on a number of health care issues, including the Medicare \nlegislation. But it remains to be seen as to whether we will have to do \nreconciliation. I am confident and hopeful we won't have to do that but \nonly time will tell.\n\n[[Page S9626]]\n\n  I would also say, we have scheduled the recess for the Columbus Day \nweek. The reason that is done is because if we don't have that break, \nthere would be 11 weeks until Thanksgiving and that is difficult. The \nSenate has changed over the years. Many Senators' families are in \nplaces other than Washington and 11 weeks is difficult not to have a \nweek you can go home. But whether we will be able to keep that whole \nweek depends a lot on when we get to health care legislation. It is \nobvious that if we are in the middle of health care, we can't take a \nrecess for 1 week. So we will see as time goes on.\n  We have CBO scoring and that will take a little bit of time and there \nare always difficulties that arise when you have a major piece of \nlegislation such as this. But the schedule is as we have outlined it. \nWe have given all interested parties the days that there will be no \nvotes, and we do have that week scheduled now for a recess, but when \nthat was done, we did it indicating it may not come to be. It is \naccording to what happens with the schedule.\n  We have a number of must-do things, and hopefully some of those will \nbe done before the end of the month. We have to make a decision on the \nhighway bill, we have postal reform, and we have a continuing \nresolution because we won't be able to complete all the appropriations \nbills prior to the end of the month. So there are a lot of things to \ndo, and we will do our best to get them all done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/S9626-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today, the Senate Finance Committee \nwill start to amend the health care proposal that its chairman, Senator \nBaucus, released last week. Before that work begins, I think it is \nimportant to remind Americans what this plan would mean for them.\n  Put simply, this plan calls for more and more government intrusion \ninto the health care system and pays for it with $350 billion in new \ntaxes and hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare cuts. So in the \nname of cutting costs, this plan raises taxes on virtually every \nAmerican who uses our health care system.\n  Here are some of the tax increases in this plan: If you have \ninsurance, this plan taxes you in the form of a new tax on insurance \ncompanies, which will then be passed on to consumers.\n  If you don't have insurance, this plan taxes you, too, by saying that \nthe consequence of not maintaining insurance is an excise tax that \ncould run as high as $3,800 a year.\n  If you use a medical device--such as a hearing aid or an artificial \nheart--this plan taxes you, and it also includes new taxes on \neverything from MRIs to contact lenses.\n  If you need laboratory tests for prevention, screening or diagnosis, \nthis plan taxes them too.\n  If you are an employer who can't afford to provide health insurance \nto your employees, this plan taxes you--a tax that businesses across \nthe country have warned could kill more jobs in the middle of a \nrecession.\n\n  If you, similar to tens of millions of other Americans, take \nprescription drugs, this plan taxes you too.\n  This plan also increases taxes on about 1 in 10 family insurance \npolicies, according to one policy group, and this tax will extend to \nmore and more plans over time.\n  In short, if you have health insurance or you don't, you are taxed. \nIf you seek preventive care, you are taxed. If you need a medical \ndevice, well, that is taxed too. At a time when Americans are demanding \nlower health care costs, this plan would drive them even higher.\n  As I said earlier, this plan also contains hundreds of billions of \ndollars in Medicare cuts, which will hurt America's seniors. It \ncontains $130 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage, a program that \ngives 11 million seniors more choices and options when it comes to \ntheir health care. One Democratic Senator described these cuts as \n``intolerable.''\n  The President recently said that seniors currently on Medicare \nAdvantage would be able to get coverage that is ``just as good.'' \nSeniors, however, want to keep the insurance they already have.\n  This plan contains nearly $120 billion in Medicare cuts for hospitals \nthat care for seniors--cuts that organizations such as the Kentucky \nHospital Association have warned against because of the negative effect \nthey would have on services to seniors in Kentucky and in other States.\n  This plan includes more than $40 billion in cuts to home health \nagencies that let seniors receive care in their homes rather than \nhaving to go into a nursing home. This plan contains $8 billion in cuts \nto hospice care, a service that provides dignity and comfort to seniors \nat the end of life.\n  Everyone agrees that Medicare needs reform but, instead of trying to \naddress the problems at hand, this plan uses Medicare as a piggy bank \nto pay for new government programs that could very well have the same \nfiscal problems Medicare does.\n  Americans want reforms that make care more affordable and keep \ngovernment out of health care decisions. They do not want a so-called \nreform that would actually make care more expensive and would put \ngovernment bureaucrats in charge of health care decisions.\n  Americans have sent a clear message to lawmakers in Washington over \nthe past months: No more trillion-dollar programs, no more debt, and no \nmore taxes. This plan for health care fails all these tests. That is \nwhy it is so important for the Finance Committee to give this proposal \nserious and careful consideration. I have listed just a few of the \nthings that concern people about this plan. With 564 amendments filed \nfrom both Democrats and Republicans, it is clear we need to slow down \nand take the time necessary to address the serious bipartisan concerns \nabout the plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/S9626-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I don't think we can say it too often--\nthough some people may tire of hearing Republican Senators saying it--\nwe have too much debt and too many Washington takeovers. Today, we want \nto talk about the latest Washington takeover, the latest huge addition \nto the national debt, which is the voluntary takeover of the Federal \nFamily Education Loan Program.\n  Rather than describe the situation myself, let me go to the New York \nTimes article, on September 14, to paint the picture.\n\n       Between financial rescue missions and the economic stimulus \n     program, government spending accounts for a bigger share of \n     the nation's economy--26 percent--than at any time since \n     World War II. The government is financing 9 out of 10 new \n     mortgages in the United States. If you buy a car from General \n     Motors, you are buying from a company that is 60 percent \n     owned by the government. If you take out a car loan or run up \n     your credit card, the chances are good that the government is \n     financing both your debt and that of your bank. And if you \n     buy life insurance from the American International Group, you \n     will be buying from a company that is almost 80 percent \n     federally owned. Mr. Obama plans to argue, [the Obama \n     administration says], that these government intrusions will \n     be temporary.\n\n\n[[Page S9627]]\n\n\n  If that is true, then why is the Obama administration insisting and \nthe Democrats in the Senate and the House are insisting that we take \nthe Federal student loan program which works very well and turn it \nwholly into a government-run program; borrow a lot more money, maybe \n$500 billion or $600 billion over the next 5 or 6 years, and turn the \nSecretary of Education into a competitor for banker of the year instead \nof educator of the year?\n  Just the size of this undertaking is enough to stagger the \nimagination. There are 19 million new student loans every year. They \nare made through 2,000 lenders at 4,421 schools. At 1,600 schools, one \nout of four of the student loans, you can get the money directly from \nthe Federal Government. But ever since I was U.S. Secretary of \nEducation in the early 1990s, students have preferred their local \ninstitutions. Now the President comes along and says we are going to \nhave a lot of savings, we are going to have $87 billion in savings over \nthe next 10 years, so we should end the student loan program as we know \nit and turn it all over to the government and have people stand in line \nat the U.S. Department of Education each year to get 19 million loans.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is the former chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, perhaps the \nleading Senator in this body on budgetary matters. I would ask him this \nquestion: Is there really $87 billion in savings over the next 10 years \nwhich the President and the Democratic majorities should be able to \nspend?\n  Mr. GREGG. Let me first congratulate the Senator from Tennessee for \nbringing this matter to the attention of the Senate because if there \nwere ever a shell game being played on the American people, this is it.\n  The administration has alleged they are going to save $87 billion. \nThen they have gone out with great zeal and enthusiasm and spent every \ncent of it--spent every cent of it. It turns out there is not $87 \nbillion saved. CBO, when it looks at this and does so in a forthright \nway, using standard accounting procedures which we would use in most \ninstances, determines the savings are closer to $47 billion.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may interrupt the Senator for a moment, you mean \nthe Congressional Budget Office, whose Director is appointed by the \nDemocratic majority, has said that instead of $87 billion in savings, \nit is $47 billion; is that correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. But they are subject to very arcane \nrules. They came up with the $87 billion using the arcane rules. I \nasked them to look at this in an honest way, using standard accounting \nrules, the same rules used by the Congressional Budget Office for other \ncredit events. They concluded that if we use those and were able to use \nthose and were not bound by the arcane score-keeping rules--it is not \ntheir fault, they are bound by law to use a different standard here--\nthe real savings is $47 billion. That is what they said. They said that \nusing the proper accounting methods for looking at this, the true \nsavings is $47 billion, which, of course, begs the question of, what \nare you going to use that for? They are going to spend $87 billion, so \nactually they are going to run up a deficit on this whole exercise of a \nlot of money on the taxpayers in the claim that they are saving money.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. This $47 billion, just so I follow this, is the actual \nsavings. Let me see if I can understand the figures a little better. \nThe government's basic argument here is it can borrow money cheaper \nthan banks can borrow money and then re-lend it to students, which is \ntrue. I think the government can borrow money at one-quarter of 1 \npercent. But the government is lending the money to students at about \n6.8 percent depending on the loan. So even if it is $87 billion or $47 \nbillion over 10 years, doesn't that mean the government is overcharging \nstudents who are getting student loans and then using that money for \nnew programs?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is going to the essence of what really drove \nthis decision. This is not a decision about saving money, this is a \ndecision about spending money. That may seem counterintuitive, but what \nyou have to understand is that if the administration could get a score \nfrom CBO that says they are going to save $87 billion or they are going \nto save $47 billion, then they get to spend that money. So no money is \nbeing saved--none. The money is being spent on different programs.\n  What should have happened here, if they were going to have integrity \nabout their proposals, is exactly what the Senator from Tennessee is \nbasically suggesting, which is the whole $87 billion should have been \nsaved. It should not have been spent, it should have been saved and \nadded to reduce the debt.\n  There is no reason the government should be making $47 billion off \nour students any more than they should be making $87 billion off our \nstudents, if they are going to go solely to a Federal direct loan \nprogram.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. These 19 million loans every year, we know who these \npeople are. They are our sons and daughters. They are people in our \nfamilies. Sometimes they have two jobs while they try to go to school. \nMaybe they have no job; they have gotten laid off and they are going \nback to school. They can get a student loan. But the government has \nborrowed the money at one-quarter of 1 percent and loaned it to them at \nnearly 7 percent and is taking that profit, whatever the amount is, and \nspending it on something else.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Tennessee is absolutely right. It truly \nis a cynical act because basically they are claiming savings when they \nare actually creating a capacity to spend more money, which they spend. \nThis is Washington-speak at its worst. It reflects the attitude, \nreally, of this administration, which is that they are not interested \nin controlling spending or reducing the debt. When they find $87 \nbillion, which they claim they have--they actually only have $47 \nbillion--they want to spend it as soon as they can, and they have. This \nspending has already occurred even though the program has not been put \nin place to save this money. They have already outlined how they are \ngoing to put this money out the door, not using it to reduce the debt.\n  But the Senator from Tennessee is right on a second point too. It \nshould have been zero. In other words, there is no reason, if you are \ngoing to take this course of action and you are going to maintain \nintellectual integrity, that there should be any money being spent \nhere. The full $47 billion should flow to the benefit of the students.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am not ready to say there is $47 billion of savings. \nThat assumes the U.S. Department of Education, which makes about a \nfourth of the current student loans in the country--which is 3 million \nloans a year, and it spends about $700 million a year on that--can make \n18 or 19 million student loans a year from the same amount of \nadministrative costs. That doesn't sound likely to me. If that is true, \nthen even the $47 billion is a wrong number.\n  Mr. GREGG. No one is more expert in this area than the Senator from \nTennessee, having served as one of the leading Governors on the issue \nof education when he was Governor of Tennessee and then going on to be \nthe Secretary of Education. He understands how the Department of \nEducation works. I certainly subscribe to his view. It does not smell \nright. Clearly, if they are going to increase their activities by this \nsize, they are going to have a massive increase in cost.\n  Another question on which I would be interested in the thoughts of \nthe Senator from Tennessee is, what happens to the students? I know \nsome people get a little frustrated just trying to get their driver's \nlicenses renewed in this country. Can you imagine having to go find the \nDepartment of Education and getting a student loan from that \nDepartment? I would be interested to get the Senator's thoughts on what \nkind of nightmare that is going to be for our students.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is a pretty big nightmare. The Senator and I both \nworked on ways of simplifying the Free Application for Federal Student \nAid or FAFSA. There are millions of individuals and families this year \nin America who have to get this government form, fill it out, and tell \nall about themselves in order to get a Pell grant or apply for a \nstudent loan, one way or the other. That is very complicated. I have \nbeen trying to imagine how the U.S. Department of Education, one of the \nsmallest departments in the country, which has\n\n[[Page S9628]]\n\nin its higher education part of its division simply a mechanism for \nsending money out--Pell grants, paying bills--how it is going to make \n19 million new loans a year.\n  In my State of Tennessee, the nonprofit provider of student loans, \none of the 2,000 lenders that exist in the country to serve students in \nNew Hampshire or everywhere--these are some of the things they do. They \nhave five regional outreach counselors to canvass Tennessee to provide \ncollege and career planning; they made 443 presentations through \ncollege fairs; they worked 12,000 students to improve their \nunderstanding of college admissions and financial aid; they provided \ntraining to over 1,000 school counselors so they could work with \nstudents; they sent out 1.5 million financial aid brochures for \nTennessee students. I cannot imagine the Department of Education having \nthe capacity to do that.\n  I think the Senator is right. I think we are going to see long lines \nof very upset students, starting in January--because that is when they \nstart filling out those forms--saying: What has happened here? I have \nto line up at the U.S. Department of Education to get my student loan, \n19 million of us?\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from Tennessee has hit one of the core \nissues here, independent of the fact that this is just a scam to create \nmore room to spend more money to spend on other programs, and it is \nscamming the students by hitting them with $47 billion of interest \npayments which they should not have to pay if this is followed. But the \nSenator has raised another valuable question here, which is obviously \nstudents were reasonably comfortable with the system the way it worked \nbecause 75 percent of the students had opted to pursue the private \nsector loan process. Granted it was a little more expensive for them--\nnot dramatically by student; obviously cumulatively it was, but not \ndramatically by student. But I think they took that option because it \nwas so much more convenient.\n  In our society, which is reasonably capitalistic--but becoming less \nso under this administration; obviously we are moving down the road \ntoward a Socialist state--but independent of that, people often pay a \nlittle more for the convenience of it, for the convenience of having an \nefficiently delivered loan, for the convenience of knowing whom to talk \nto when you have a problem, for the convenience of basically being able \nto go get answers quickly to your questions. Essentially, that is what \nthese higher education authorities created in every State. Tennessee \nhas one. New Hampshire has one. They are really good people. They are, \nfor the most part, except for their executive director, volunteers. \nTheir purpose is to make sure students have very prompt access to \nstudent loans which are significant enough for them to pay for their \neducation and that it is also done in a way that is convenient so they \ndo not have to end up just getting lost in a massive bureaucracy. I \nsuspect every congressional office is going to have to become a massive \nclearinghouse for student loan problems. We don't have that now. We \nhave problems with a lot of programs and agencies, but student loans is \nnot one of them.\n  It really is a big issue of the marketplace having voted with their \nfeet, so to say. The students in this country voted to use the \nguaranteed loan system, pay a little bit more for the purposes of the \nconvenience they were being given by having that sort of easy access \nand substantive information right at hand, versus going to the \ngovernment and getting overwhelmed by a government bureaucracy which is \noften indifferent to consumer issues and is difficult to deal with.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I appreciate the comments of the Senator.\n  In President Obama's address to us on health care the other day, he \nsaid:\n\n       My guiding principle is and always has been, the consumers \n     do better when there is choice and competition. That is how \n     the market works.\n\n  I guess he means except when we are talking about student loans.\n  Twenty years ago, we set up a system to give people a choice, and, as \nyou said, they voted with their feet. This past year, 14 million \nstudents made a choice to be under the regular student loan program. \nThey are at 4,000 campuses, went to 2,000 lenders, they got a lot of \nextra services, I assume, or they could have come to the Department of \nEducation, which about 4.5 million students chose to do. The Senator \nhas made it clear that the excuse for doing--but, well, let me say \nthis.\n  I guess the Senator has heard many times the President and people on \nthe other side of the aisle say: Well, we inherited this problem. The \nreason we own General Motors, or 60 percent of it, is because we \ninherited it from President Bush. Or: The reason we are dealing with \nthe American International Group Insurance Company is because we \ninherited that problem. Or: The reason we had to take over the banks is \nwe inherited that problem.\n  Well, this is a completely voluntary Washington takeover, if I am not \nmistaken.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is once again correct. There is a macro issue \nof economics here. Although it is tangential to the Senator's primary \nconcern, which is the very legitimate concern of: Why are we taking all \nof this money from students if we are going to do this type of program? \nAnd why are we spending all of this money even before we take it in? \nAnd why are we putting students through having to stand in line like at \nthe DMV to get a loan?\n  There is a macro issue here, which is for the government to take over \nall of this debt means we are going to add $500 billion to $600 billion \nto the government ledger. We are now nowhere near that in the student \nloan area because we are not primarily responsible for the debt.\n  As a result, you are going to have some significant crowding out. It \ncould easily aggravate our ability to borrow money for the purposes of \nfinancing these massive deficits the President wants to run, the \ntrillion-dollar deficits every year for the next 10 years that are in \nthe budget.\n  I do not think it will be a massive issue, but it will be a \nsignificant issue. It could affect the rate of interest which we have \nto pay as a government. It could affect other nations looking at us and \nsaying: Do we have too much debt on our books?\n  Most of this debt will go into a revolving fund, and hopefully it \nwill be repaid, as it is traditionally. But the initial debt will still \nhave to be put on the books at some point.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, I thank the Senator. I think what we have seen \nis getting to be too familiar around here, an action by the \nadministration, another Washington takeover, more debt, to the tune of \n$500 billion or $600 billion, more debt. You said on the $87 billion or \n$47 billion spending of money we do not really have.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, the $87 billion is what has been spent. That is what \nthey are going to spend.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. They are going to spend the $87 billion. As you have \neloquently said: There is no $87 billion. That adds to the debt.\n  Then there is the problem of 19 million students lining up at the \nDepartment of Education to get their student loans starting in January. \nPerhaps we need a piece of truth-in-lending legislation that would go \non every student loan application that says: Congratulations. Your \ngovernment is making you a student loan. We borrowed it at one-quarter \nof 1 percent, and we are going to loan it to you at 6.8 percent, and we \nare going to spend twice that much on new programs that we thought of \nwhile we take over the entire student loan program.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would say the Senator from Tennessee has hit on a very \nappropriate disclosure issue that should be on every one of those \nloans.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Unless the Senator from New Hampshire has further \ncomments, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, today President Obama told the \ncountries of the world thatthe United States is ready to lead on \nclimate change. But while he is reassuring world leaders, he has a lot \nof work to do with us in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S9629]]\n\n  Only yesterday in The Wall Street Journal, John Bruton, the European \nAmbassador to the United States, chided the Senate, saying:\n\n       Is the US. Senate really expecting all the other countries \n     to make a serious effort on climate change at the Copenhagen \n     Conference in the absence of a clear commitment from the \n     United States? Asking an international Conference to sit \n     around looking out the window for months, while one chamber \n     of the legislature of one country deals with its \n     otherbusiness, is simply not a realistic political position.\n\n  Now I understand the Ambassador's frustration, but I hope he \nunderstands that the Senate has work to do other than deal with climate \nchange and energy. Reforming health care involving one-sixth of our \nNation's economy is not somethingthe Senate is going to do in a hurry.\n  On the matter of climate change, however, he is asking a legitimate \nquestion. An even better question might be this: ``How can the United \nStates lecture other countries about climate change when we won't take \nadvantage of the one technology that shows the most promise of dealing \nwith it?'' I am talking, of course, about nuclear power, which produces \n19 percent of all our electricity but 70 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity.\n  Coal-fired powerplants produce 36 percent of the carbon dioxide; the \nprincipal greenhouse gas that most scientists believe contributes to \nglobal warming. Of the top five countries that produce carbon, indeed \nthat produce most of the carbon in the world, four, China, Russia, \nIndia and Japan, are committed to a bold program of expansion of \nnuclear power.\n  Only the United States is not. We are the country that invented \nnuclear power, and we have not started a new nuclear plant in 30 years \neven though the 104 reactors we built during the 1970s which produce 19 \npercent of all our electricity, and produce 70 percent of our carbon-\nfree electricity.\n  So, if climate change is the inconvenient problem, as my fellow \nTennessean Al Gore says, the other large carbon-emitting nations are \nposing a legitimate and truly inconvenient question: If we, they may \nsay, are building dozens of carbon-free nuclear powerplants in an \neffort to deal with climate change, why are you lecturing us when you \nhave not started a new plant in 30 years and yourPresident and everyone \nin his administration seems to become tongue-tied or get a stomach ache \nwhenever someone mentions the idea of nuclear power.\n  Everyone, that is, except the one member of the administration who \nknows the most about nuclear power, Dr.Steven Chu, the Nobel Prize \nwinning scientist who heads the Energy Department. We have heard many \nsay that the Bushadministration did a poor job of listening to \nscientists. Well, then, perhaps it is fair for me to suggest that the \nObamaadministration, including the President, might do more listening \nto their chief scientist, Dr. Chu.\n  In testimony before Congress, Dr. Chu has flatly said that nuclear \npowerplants are safe.\n  He has said that the used nuclear fuel from those plants,the nuclear \nwaste, can be safely stored on site for 40-60 years while scientists \nengage in a mini-Manhattan Project like the one we had in World War II \nto find the best possible way to recycleused nuclear fuel. Most likely \nthat will mean that the waste's massis reduced by 97 percent and it \nwill only be radioactive for 300 years instead of 1 million, or that it \nwill be continuously used over and over again so there is none of the \nplutonium that might be used to make bombs.\n  In an interview on National Public Radio the other day, Dr.Chu said \nthat he would rather live down the river from a nuclear plant than \nother forms of producing energy. ``There's less pollution we know about \nthat's very dangerous. The nuclear power plants' record in the United \nStates is really very, very good,'' he said.\n  Our whole fleet of 104 reactors is up and running 90 percent of the \ntime, which shows we know how to operate nuclear powerplants better and \nmore safely than any other country. Even France does not run its \nreactors as well and they have got plenty of experience, they get 80 \npercent of their electricity from nuclear power.\n  But if we have learned to run reactors in this country, we \nstillcannot bring ourselves to build any new ones. We have been stuck \nat about 100 reactors for 20 years now. We built those 100 reactors \nfrom 1970 to 1990 at a time when we had never built any before yet now \nthat we have got all that under our belt we cannot seem to get started \non the new generation.\n  But while we have not been able to start a new plant in 30 years, the \nrest of the world is taking the technology we invented and using it to \ncreate cheap, reliable, carbon-free electricity from nuclear plants. \nThere are 44 reactors under construction right this minute, most of \nthem in Asia. Asia? Yes, without most Americans realizing it, the \ncenter of gravity of nuclear innovation has moved to the Far East. \nChina has four reactors under construction and has announced plans for \n130 more. Russia intends to build two reactors a year in order to \nreplace the 30 percent of their electricity they get from natural gas \nso they can sell the gas to Europe at six times the price they get at \nhome. Japan already gets 36 percent of its electricity from nuclear, \nalmost twice what we get, and is building two more reactors. South \nKorea gets nearly 40 percent of its electricity from nuclear and is \nplanning eight more reactors by 2015. They have even got their own \ndesign now, a 1400-megawatt next generation reactor that evolved out of \nsomething they borrowed from us. India is developing thorium reactors \ninstead of uranium and has a design for a mini-reactor that they are \ngoing to market to developed countries.\n  Just look down the list of the ten top carbon-emitting countries as \nlisted in yesterday's Wall Street Journal. I have already mentioned \nthat of the top five, China, the U.S., Russia, India and Japan, we are \nthe only one that does not have an active nuclear construction program. \nOf the next four, Germany, Canada, the U.K., and South Korea, only \nGermany claims they do not want nuclear, but they are buying \nsignificant amounts of nuclear electricity from France.\n  Then there is the number 10 carbon emitter, Iran. Now that is an \ninteresting case. A few months ago, President Obama said it was OK for \nIran to develop a civilian nuclear power program, he did not have any \nproblem with that. But if it is alright for Iran to have a nuclear \npower program, why cannot we do the same thing over here?\n  Leading on climate change does not require passing a complicated cap-\nand-trade regime with renewable energy mandates that will impose a huge \nnew tax on energy, stifle economic growth, and leave us with \nintermittent and unreliable alternative energy sources such as wind and \nsolar. That is the wrong direction.\n  It is time to lead by example and not just words. It is time to \nembrace the one technology that truly has the possibility of powering a \nprosperous planet without ruining the environment or covering our \ntreasured landscapes with energy sprawl. It is time to build 100 new \nnuclear plants in the next 20 years.\n  And the bonus is we will get plenty of so-called green jobs out of \nit, twice as many as building the 186,000 wind turbines that it would \ntake to create an amount of electricity equal to 100 new nuclear \nplants. Building 100 new reactors is going to mean rebuilding a \nforgotten American infrastructure. We are going to have to build steel \nforges that can turn out these 600-ton reactor vessels, which is \nsomething we cannot do in this country right now. The Japanese and the \nChinese and the Russians are all working on it, but we are not. We are \ngoing to need scientists, we are going to need construction workers, \nand we are going to need a whole new generation of nuclear engineers \nand technicians to replace the last generation that is getting ready to \nretire.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  But the prize we are going to get for it is stable, reliable, low-\ncost, as well as carbon-free electricity, that will once again allow us \nto manufacture things in this country again instead of shipping all \nthose jobs overseas looking for cheap energy. We can put America back \nto work building a whole new infrastructure based on the greatest \nscientific discovery of the 20th century.\n  Then when our President visits the United Nations or Copenhagen, he \nmight be able to lead on climate change and he might not receive so\n\n[[Page S9630]]\n\nmany lectures from other countries that are busy building nuclear \npowerplants because they understand that if climate change is the \ninconvenient problem, nuclear power is the inconvenient but best and \nmost environmentally beneficial solution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I am happy that when morning business comes to an end we \nwill resume consideration of the fiscal year 2010 Interior \nAppropriations bill.\n  I have come to the floor today to support the significant increase in \nfunding for water infrastructure included in that legislation. We in \nMaryland have witnessed one more dramatic reminder that the water \ninfrastructure of this country is in dire straits and in desperate need \nof new attention and greater investment.\n  This past Friday afternoon, water surged for hours from a broken 6-\nfoot-wide water main in Dundalk, MD. The raging water covered streets, \npouring water into basements of many homes in Baltimore County, causing \nsignificant property damage. The raging water washed out main roads in \nthe area causing significant damage to the infrastructure of the \ncommunity. Here we see the road being washed out by the water that \nflowed through this community.\n  This past Friday I was in Dundalk for the groundbreaking of a new \nhousing development. This is a proud, historic community in Baltimore \nCounty. It was devastating, the damage that was done to this community \nas a result of infrastructure that failed. I would like to say this is \nan isolated episode but, unfortunately, this is not the first time in \nthe past year we have witnessed instances such as this. Last December, \na water main broke sending a 4-foot wall of water down a busy commuter \nroad in Bethesda, MD, just outside of Washington. Here we see the \nheadlines from the paper. Rescue workers were trying to rescue stranded \ndrivers. This was River Road that turned into a river as a result of \nanother water main break in Maryland. The water flowed with such force \nthat Maryland State emergency workers had to rescue some drivers by \nboat and even by helicopter. Here we see a dramatic rescue. \nFortunately, no one was injured, but we could have seen the loss of \nlife.\n  We need to deal with infrastructure, the pipes of our Nation. While \nthese incidents were perhaps some of the most dramatic, there have been \nhundreds of water main breaks, large and small, across Maryland over \nthe last year alone, and we are likely to see more instances such as \nthis in the future. According to the EPA's 2004 clean watershed needs \nsurvey, Maryland has nearly $6 billion in wastewater infrastructure \nneeds alone. But Maryland is not unique in facing a crisis when it \ncomes to water infrastructure. These episodes have been repeated \nthroughout the Nation. Our water infrastructure is reaching a tipping \npoint in many places, having long outlived its 50-year lifespan. The \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers rated both wastewater and drinking \nwater systems a D minus, the lowest rating of any infrastructure \ncategory.\n  These problems are compounded by a growing population and more \nfrequent cycles of floods and droughts affecting communities. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency estimates an additional $6 billion per \nyear will be needed to meet the Nation's wastewater infrastructure \nneeds, and $5 billion will be needed for drinking water needs.\n  This is a matter of protecting the safety of people. This is an issue \nof preventing property damage. Many don't have insurance to cover it \nbecause they didn't think they lived in a flood-prone area. They didn't \nexpect a water main to cause a flood in their homes. We need it to save \nwater. We are wasting a lot of water. We need it to save energy because \nwe transport water in an inefficient energy way.\n  The Interior appropriations bill, which we will be considering today, \nmakes a significant investment in our Nation's water infrastructure. It \ncontains $2.1 billion for improvements to wastewater infrastructure \nthrough the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. This amounts to $1.4 \nbillion more than Congress appropriated in the last fiscal year. The \nbill also contains almost $1.4 billion for the Drinking Water State \nRevolving Fund. This is almost $600 million more than Congress \nappropriated last year. These funding levels come on top of $6 billion \nfor water infrastructure that is going to States as part of the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Much of this new commitment is \nthanks to a new administration that has recognized the infrastructure \ncrisis and is doing something about it. That commitment is echoed by my \ncolleagues, Senators Feinstein and Alexander, who have included \ninvestments in the bill we are considering today. I thank them for \ntheir commitment, but new investment alone is not enough. That is why I \nhave introduced, along with Senators Boxer, Inhofe, and Crapo, S. 1005, \nthe Water Infrastructure Financing Act of 2009. This is a bipartisan \neffort, as it should be, to improve America's infrastructure.\n  The Water Infrastructure Financing Act of 2009 truly represents a \nwatershed moment in the legislative history of the Clean Water Act and \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act. First and foremost, the bill makes it \npossible for us to continue considerable investment in the Nation's \naging infrastructure by significantly increasing authorizations for \nclean water and drinking water. The bill provides $20 billion for the \nClean Water State Revolving Fund and nearly $15 billion for the \nDrinking Water State Revolving Fund over the next 5 years.\n  The bill goes further to develop new tools to address some of our \npressing and growing water infrastructure needs. It allows new and \nimportant types of projects to qualify for funding, including efforts \nto secure wastewater and drinking water facilities and green \ninfrastructure that is often more effective and less expensive than \ntraditional infrastructure. The bill provides additional flexibility in \nthe Clean Water State Revolving Fund to help poor communities by \nproviding loan forgiveness and improving financing, an ability that is \nespecially important as budget cuts make critical infrastructure \ninvestment beyond the reach of many communities.\n  The legislation creates nearly $2 billion in grant programs to make \ninfrastructure upgrades that will reduce the number of combined and \nsanitary sewer overflows. These overflows are estimated to contribute \n850 billion gallons of untreated sewage and storm water to the Nation's \nwaterways every year. There is a new $60-million-per-year nationwide \ngrant program to provide funding to States and municipalities to reduce \nlead in drinking water to protect our children. The bill also contains \na new $50 billion nationwide grant program to address water quality \nissues associated with agriculture. The bill gives new incentives for \nwater utilities to plan for the future so we don't face another crisis \nof failing infrastructure 20, 50, or 75 years down the road.\n  This legislation has the support of broad constituencies: utility \nconstruction contractors, engineers and manufacturers, labor \norganizations, environmental groups, the clean water agencies, \nregulators, academics, and local government.\n  The bill was reported out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee by a voice vote, a strong bipartisan vote. Americans have the \nright to clean water flowing through their streams, rivers, and bays. \nWe have the right to drinking water that is healthy.\n  While I proudly support H.R. 2996, the Department of Interior \nAppropriations Act of 2010, I hope the full Senate will have the \nopportunity to vote on the Water Infrastructure Financing Act of 2009 \nthis year. If so, we will be keeping faith with the American people by \nproviding the tools necessary to meet their basic human health and \nenvironmental needs. We will help provide water systems that can keep \nwater running through the pipes rather than down the streets, as we saw \nin Dundalk this past weekend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Maryland. The\n\n[[Page S9631]]\n\nissue he has spoken of is one we can address in every single State \nwhere aging infrastructure is taking its toll in terms of the public \nservices each family and business expects. It is something we can use \nto our advantage by channeling the resources of this country into \nbuilding and rebuilding infrastructure and creating much needed jobs.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland. I am more than happy to support \nhis efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/S9631-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9631-S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about an \nissue that looms over the Senate and the Capitol like no other. In the \nebb and flow of the history of the Senate, many issues come and go, but \nfew come before us with the importance of the issue of health care \nreform.\n  Earlier this month, the U.S. Census Bureau released data on the \nincome, poverty, and health coverage of Americans. The number of \nAmericans living without health insurance is staggering: 46.3 million \npeople were uninsured last year. The issue of the uninsured is not a \nquestion of us versus them. The uninsured are everywhere in America. \nMost of the people without health insurance today are working or are in \na family with someone who works.\n  Who are these people? They are not the poorest in America; we care \nfor the poorest. We provide them health insurance known as Medicaid. \nThey are not the fortunate ones such as myself or many others who have \nhealth insurance. They are folks who get up and go to work every day \nwithout the peace of mind of knowing that they have health insurance \nprotection for themselves and their families. These are the people who \nmade your bed and cleaned your hotel room this morning, the ones who \nfixed your breakfast and cleared the dishes off the table in the \nrestaurant. They are watching your children and your grandchildren even \nas you go to work. They are taking care of your mom in an assisted \nliving center and changing her bed linens. They include the realtor who \nhelped you find your new home or sell the home. They include many \nveterans who served our country with pride and now find themselves in \nan unfortunate circumstance. In fact, 8 in 10 of the nonelderly \nuninsured live in families where the head of the family goes to work \nevery single day. Not everyone who works for a large employer is lucky \nenough to have health coverage. Twenty-two percent of people in America \nworking for firms with 500 or more employees are uninsured.\n  Here is another important part to understand. Many people without \nhealth insurance are not among the poorest. One-third of the families \nwithout health insurance are making more than $44,000 a year. Despite \nmaking a moderate income, these individuals either work for an employer \nwho doesn't offer health coverage or they can't find coverage they can \nafford. For the average U.S. family who has coverage, the worker and \nemployer together paid an extra $1,017 last year in health care \npremiums to compensate for the uninsured.\n  When the uninsured people reach a stage in life where they \ndesperately need health care, they go to an emergency room. Hospitals \ndon't turn them away; they treat them. Their expenses are not paid for. \nThey are passed along to those with health insurance. It means those of \nus who pay health insurance premiums pay about $90 a month more to \ncover uncompensated care for the uninsured. That is a reality.\n  The lack of insurance is not only about dollars though; it is also \nabout lives. A study released last week by the American Journal of \nPublic Health revealed that nearly 45,000 annual deaths in America are \nassociated with lack of health insurance. In other words, the myth that \npeople without insurance ultimately get the same care as everyone else \nis not true. The uninsured in America are more likely to die. I will \ngive two examples. Things are getting worse for these families. This \nfigure linking ``uninsurance'' or lack of insurance with premature \ndeath is 2.5 times higher than an estimate from the Institute of \nMedicine for just 5 years ago. Deaths associated with lack of health \ninsurance now exceed those caused by many common killers. The increase \nin the number of uninsured and our Nation's eroding medical safety net \nfor the disadvantaged help explain the substantial increase we have \nseen in the number of deaths associated with the lack of health \ninsurance. The simple fact is that the uninsured are more likely to go \nwithout needed care, and that lack of health care coverage takes its \ntoll.\n  Is this what America has come to? We have too many people who are \nunable to get health care when they need it. My constituents know the \nstory well. Let me cite a story about a woman from Chicago. To protect \nher identity, I will call her Monica. Monica came to the State of \nIllinois after Hurricane Katrina destroyed her home and took her \nsister's life. Today she has a small tatoo of her sister's name on her \narm with a hurricane over it. She came to Chicago, lived in FEMA-funded \nemergency housing but became homeless when the FEMA funds ran out. She \nstayed in overnight emergency shelters for 2 years. She found herself \nin desperate need of help. But when she thought things couldn't get \nworse, she was stabbed outside one of these overnight shelters and \nadmitted to Sinai Hospital in Chicago. Sinai is one of the great \nhospitals that serves some of the poorest people in that great city. I \ncommend all of the people who keep that hospital's doors open and work \nto keep quality services available for even the poorest in the city.\n  As it turned out, that stabbing saved her life. In the hospital, the \nmedical team discovered she had hypertension and hepatitis C. The \nsocial worker enrolled Monica in a local program for the homeless and \nuninsured with chronic medical conditions. With help from this program \nand the hospital's social worker, she learned where to go for medical \ncare and how to find help to rebuild her life. That was last summer. \nToday Monica has her own apartment and is managing her health. She is \none of thousands of people who walk around with life-threatening \nchronic conditions such as hypertension and hepatitis C, conditions \nthat go undiagnosed and untreated because these people can't seek care \nwithout health insurance.\n  She is trying. Monica is doing her best. She wants to be self-\nsufficient. She wants to be a contributing member of society, a giver \nnot a taker. But she still lives in fear of being one accident, one \nillness, one diagnosis away from losing everything she has been able to \naccumulate in her life.\n  That is the fear people face when they don't have insurance. Let me \ntell you of another fear. It is a fear that many families face every \nday, and Verta Wells' children know this fear.\n  Verta is a constituent of mine from the downstate area--right near my \nhome in Springfield. She and her sister were adopted by loving parents, \nand she has grown up in the town I call home since she was 5 years old. \nVerta is a veteran of the U.S. Army. She raised two sons in Springfield \nand had a steady job. Health insurance was not a problem, and she was \nworking.\n  As the parent of two boys, Verta's medical care was covered by \nIllinois Children's Health Insurance Program. It covers just not the \nkids but also a single mom such as Verta. She was a young and healthy \nmother. She worked at the local Steak n' Shake, which in my part of the \nworld is the local restaurant to go for a hamburger and a milkshake. It \nis a great restaurant. It is clean and the help is always very good.\n  Working at that restaurant, she enrolled in school part time to \nbecome a medical assistant. She wanted to do better in her life. \nWithout a pressing illness, she took the insurance card for granted \nbecause she did not need it. As time went on, though, she learned how \nvaluable that insurance card could be.\n  One night, Verta, doing a self-examination, found a lump in her \nbreast. Her youngest son was then 17 years old, which meant Verta had 1 \nmore year of health insurance under the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. Thankfully, she was able to go to a doctor for a mammogram. \nThree days later, the doctors told her the sad news that the lump was \nmalignant.\n  The All Kids Program--the version of CHIP in our State of Illinois--\npaid for her treatment, and Verta was happy to come out the other side \nas a healthy breast cancer survivor. Her son graduated from high school \nand life looked good. Unfortunately, this is not where the story ended.\n\n[[Page S9632]]\n\n  For some time after her initial surgery for breast cancer, Verta \nexperienced a pain in her chest. There was just one difference. With \nher kids now grown and over the age of 18, Verta did not have any \nhealth insurance anymore.\n  The pain grew worse. Verta knew she had lost her insurance, but she \nwas aware of a program called the Breast and Cervical Cancer Early \nDetection Program--a program that provides free care to uninsured women \nin our community.\n  She enrolled in the program and went in for a mammogram. Despite the \npain, the doctor did not find anything. Given her history, the doctor \nrecommended, though, that she go see an oncologist at that point just \nin case, just to be absolutely sure.\n  Verta might have gone, but it worried her that the visit was not \ncovered by any health insurance. She was worried about the bills that \nwere starting to pile up. After all, that earlier mammogram was clean, \nand the program covers women with breast cancer, so she felt somewhat \nconfident she did not have to go any further.\n  She loved working with her oncologist. The last thing she wanted to \ndo was stick him with an unpaid bill. And she knew she could not pay a \nlarge medical bill on her waitress's salary. So she went on as if \neverything was OK.\n  But several months later, she felt another lump in her chest. Still \nthinking her mammogram was fine, still worried about medical care she \ncould not pay for, Verta did not check in with her specialist, her \noncologist--until one day when she felt so dizzy she was forced to go \nto the emergency room. They diagnosed Verta with metastatic cancer. \nThat was just a few months ago. Today, Verta is no longer with us.\n  Is this what we have come to in America--a hard-working young mother \nwithout access to health insurance, afraid to go to the doctor, \ndelaying care, and dying too soon? That is the reality.\n  So when we talk about health care reform, we talk about several needs \nhere. Earlier on the floor, the Republican leader came and talked about \nthe fact that we are talking about changes--basic changes--in the \nsystem, he said, that involved taxes, and certainly we have to be \nhonest about the cost of any reform. But, unfortunately, most on the \nother side of the aisle have not joined us in this debate. They are not \nsitting down with us and trying to work out a bipartisan bill. And, \nsadly, very few, if any, of them have any alternative to the current \nhealth care system in this country.\n  Even if you are happy with your insurance today, most people have \nthis lingering doubt about whether it will be there when they need it. \nWill that health insurance company turn you down when you absolutely \nneed to have them pay for a serious surgery or important medical work? \nAre they going to fight you over how much money they will pay? Will \nthey go through your application for insurance and say: Oh, you didn't \ndisclose a preexisting condition and, therefore, we are not going to \ncover you? That happens way too often. As it happens, more and more \npeople end up in debt--sometimes crippling debt.\n  In the last few years, the number of individuals and families in \nAmerica filing for personal bankruptcy because of medical bills has \ndoubled. It went from 31 percent to 62 percent in just a few years. Of \nthe 62 percent who filed for bankruptcy because they could not pay \ntheir medical bills, 78 percent of them had health insurance. It turned \nout to be health insurance that did not mean much. It was not worth \nmuch when they needed it.\n  That is the reality today. It turns out that many people who go to \nbed at night rest easy believing they have health insurance but find--\nbecause of that accident or that diagnosis--they are in a pitched \nbattle with the health insurance companies, which they often lose. \nLosing it destroys their life savings and everything they have ever \nworked for.\n  That kind of uncertainty, that kind of insecurity is why we are in \nthe midst of this important debate. It is why we should have both sides \nof the aisle looking for practical, commonsense solutions, focused on \nkeeping people healthy and well in America, and giving them security \nand stability when it comes to their health insurance. But, instead, \nthere is not enough conversation and dialogue in the Senate. \nUnfortunately, at many town meetings across America, there was much \nmore shoving and shouting than there was real conversation about how to \nsolve this challenge that faces America.\n  There are several things we need to do. We need to end insurance \ncompany discrimination. Insurance companies must be stopped from \ndenying coverage to Americans with preexisting conditions, such as \nheart disease, cancer or diabetes. No longer should they be free to \nraise premiums or drop coverage when it turns out you are sick and need \nyour health insurance.\n  We also need to lower health care costs and reduce the Federal \ndeficit because if we do not tackle health care, believe me, the cost \nof Medicaid and Medicare and the overall cost to governments at every \nlevel will continue to escalate, and those who are genuinely concerned \nabout the debt facing our country have to acknowledge this could drive \nAmerica's debt out of control, unless we do something about the cost of \nhealth care.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that one of the bills, \nbeing considered today in the Finance Committee, will lower premium \ncosts for Americans purchasing coverage in the individual and small \ngroup markets. They say the bill effectively slows the growth of \nFederal health care spending over the long term and could save us up to \n$49 billion over the next 10 years.\n  We need to also improve our focus on wellness and prevention. We need \nto work to change the focus of our health care from sickness to \nwellness, how we can avoid medical costs, keep people healthy, give \nthem the independence of living at home with the peace of mind to know \nthey are in good hands with a good doctor and good hospital, if they \nneed it, but they are doing important things, making personal decisions \nto improve their own health. We do this in most of the bills before \nCongress, focusing on preventive care and wellness.\n  We need to ensure quality health care coverage for millions of \nAmericans who go without every single day. This is not just a matter of \neconomics; it is a matter of justice. To think that we live in this \ngreat and prosperous nation--even struggling with this recession--that \nwe turn and find 46 million Americans without health insurance coverage \nhas to be unacceptable. I know what I am about to say some will \ndisagree with, but I think peace of mind and health care coverage \nshould be a right in America, not a privilege for those lucky enough to \nwork in the right place or have enough money.\n\n  We also need to cut down on fraud, waste, and abuse. There is a \nprogram called Medicare Advantage. The private health insurance \ncompanies came to us several years ago and said: Government, you are \nnot running this government program well. Let us offer Medicare \nbenefits, and we are going to show you something. We could offer more \ncoverage, better care, at a lower cost than the government.\n  So Congress said: Be our guest. Today, the Medicare Advantage \nProgram, which is supposed to be the private health insurance answer to \nMedicare, costs 14 percent more than the Medicare Program. We are \npaying a subsidy to private health insurance companies that set out to \nprove they could do it more cheaply than Medicare, when, in fact, they \nare charging us more.\n  Should we continue to subsidize these private health insurance \ncompanies to give them more profit or should we go back to the basic \nmodel, Medicare, that provides more cost-efficient care for most \nAmericans who have reached the age of 65 and face disability? There are \nother examples of fraud and abuse, too, in this system. We can clean it \nup, and with those savings we can start to do more to help America.\n  We need to improve choice and competition. The five largest health \ninsurance carriers in America have 82 percent of the business. In some \ncommunities, you do not have a choice. There is one dominant or two \ndominant health insurance companies, and if you do not like the way \nthey do business, you do not have any choice. That is what it comes \ndown to. Those of us in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program--\nMembers of Congress and 8\n\n[[Page S9633]]\n\nmillion Federal employees and their families--have real choice: open \nenrollment every year to choose from private insurance companies, to \npick the one right for our family and right for our pocketbook. That is \nwhat every American should have. That is not a luxury or something over \nthe rainbow.\n  For 8 million of us, Federal employees and Members of Congress, it is \na reality. Why can't we offer that to every American, to say: You can \nkeep the insurance you have if you want to. But if you want to look and \nshop, you should have some choices--some real choices--because of real \ncompetition. So we need reform that creates a competitive and \ntransparent market that allows consumers to compare plans and choose \nwhat is best for them.\n  Finally, we need to modernize our health care system, to bring \ncomputers and the electronics of our modern age into hospitals and \ndoctors' offices, so they have a complete record on each patient, so \nthey understand if there is something in your background that should be \nnoted and taken into consideration before they make a diagnosis and \norder a prescription or a test, to make certain in a hospital you are \nnot given drugs you are allergic to that could take your life, to avoid \nmedical accidents and death that is associated with them.\n  All these move us in a more efficient situation, a more competitive \nsituation, and one which will bring better care to America and improve \npatient safety.\n  Let me conclude by saying health care is too often a luxury. In Cook \nCounty, we struggle to provide patients with timely access to care. In \nthe area around Chicago, at the local public hospital, the waiting time \nfor some specialty services can range from 6 months to 1 or 2 years \nright now--too long to wait for critical services.\n  Those who criticize this health care reform debate and say it is \ngoing to lead to lines and waiting and rationing are not accepting the \nreality of the current system. There are many waits that are \nunnecessary and some of them dangerous today. The stories I gave \nearlier about Monica and Verta demonstrate the need to reform our \nsystem. But there are millions more like them.\n  Too many individuals and families bypass health care because they \ncannot afford it. The high cost of health care and the lack of \ninsurance for millions of people are more than a financial problem, \nthey are life threatening.\n  Today, about 11,000 Americans will lose their health insurance. Can \nyou imagine at the end of the day coming home and facing your children \nor your family saying: I have bad news. Because I lost my job or \nbecause my employer no longer can provide it or because we cannot \nafford it, we don't have health insurance anymore. Keep your fingers \ncrossed, folks, because this family is now living on the edge, just one \naccident or one diagnosis away from facing the grim reality of the cost \nof health care.\n  Every day in America, families are forced to choose a different \ndoctor when their health care plan is changed because their employer \ncannot afford to provide health insurance. Every day in America, \nfamilies see their health plan benefits erode because they cannot keep \nup with higher premiums, copays, and deductibles. Every day in America, \npeople decide to skip a doctor's visit, medication, and treatment \nbecause they cannot afford it.\n  Families are confronted with losing their health insurance altogether \nbecause their employers cannot afford it, and year after year health \ncare costs keep going up and up and up. Are we going to stand by and \nwatch this happen? Are the people who have been elected to this Senate \nand the House of Representatives going to accept their responsibility \nto those who sent us here to tackle one of the toughest, most \ncomplicated, most controversial issues of our time but one we cannot \nafford to ignore?\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will join us in that \neffort. It is time to tell our constituents across America: It does not \nmatter where you live, what you do or how much money you make, in the \nUnited States of America every American should have the opportunity to \naccess health care they can afford, to give them the peace of mind they \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California for \nthe time yielded to me.\n  In the halls of power and in living rooms across America, on cable \nnews and around the dinner table, everyone seems to be talking about \nhealth care reform. From coast to coast--and on both sides of the \naisle--there seems to be broad consensus. The American people and their \nelected leaders see the clear need for reform. But we often disagree \nabout how to meet such a challenge.\n  As we consider health care reform, and as we try to seek consensus, I \nbelieve we can find common ground on the need to address disparities in \nthe health care system. I say we need to address the disparities in the \nhealth care system.\n\n  In a country founded on the principles of freedom and equality, we \ncurrently possess a health care system that is anything but free and \nequal. This is simply not right. We need to ensure that quality, \naffordable health care is available to all Americans. We need to cut \ndown on the widening disparity between minority individuals and the \nwider population so no one is left behind because of their racial or \nethnic identity.\n  People of color make up about a third of the population in the United \nStates, but they represent half the Nation's uninsured. In Illinois \nalone, more than 21 percent of minorities do not have health insurance \ncompared with 12 percent of Whites. It is time to correct this inequity \nand move toward a sustainable system that serves every single American \nregardless of skin color or economic background.\n  This begins before birth. Only 76 percent of Black mothers and 77 \npercent of Hispanic mothers have access to prenatal care in the first 3 \nmonths of pregnancy. For White mothers, the number stands at more than \n88 percent. This is unacceptable. It demonstrates that minority \nindividuals are at a clear disadvantage even before they are born. This \nplaces them at a greater risk for problems down the road, problems \nranging from higher infant mortality to increased rates of chronic \ndiseases in later life. Combine these risks with a higher poverty rate \nand lower insurance coverage and we have a recipe for disaster.\n  For no reason other than the color of their skin, millions of \nAmericans are poor and uninsured. They have reduced access to health \ncare and an elevated risk of illnesses such as high blood pressure and \nheart disease. This leads to a shortage of preventive care and forces \nsome people to go to emergency rooms when they have nowhere else to \nturn. No wonder our health care system is strained to the limit. No \nwonder costs are through the roof, positive health outcomes are down, \nand we are unable to break this destructive cycle.\n  We must address these disparities as part of our responsible health \ncare reform package. We must work hard to make sure all Americans can \nbenefit from health care reform. This means eliminating barriers to \nFederal health programs for American Indian tribes. It means increasing \naccess to quality care for children, pregnant mothers, and every legal \nresident of this country--I say every legal resident. It means \nexpanding preventive care and screening programs so we can stop \ndiseases before they start. This is especially important for those who \nlive below the poverty line.\n  As we move forward, it is our responsibility to make sure we include \nevery member of society in our reform proposals. We must not rest until \neveryone is a part of the solution.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in these efforts. If we work \ntogether, we can extend the promise of prosperity to every single \nAmerican, regardless of race or ethic background. We can make sure this \ncountry is more free, more fair, and more equal.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I have come to the Senate floor pretty \nmuch every day since the start of the session--for the last couple of \nmonths--sharing letters from Ohioans about health care. I just did a \nbig townhall meeting in Cleveland yesterday and I did one in Columbus, \nCincinnati, Youngstown, and I have done other meetings in Dayton and \nCambridge and other places. But my office gets dozens--hundreds, \nreally, a week--of letters from people who oftentimes were very pleased \nand satisfied with their health insurance, and then when they got \nparticularly sick, they found out they lost their health insurance \ncoverage.\n  I just want to read a couple of letters my office has received in the \nlast couple of weeks or so.\n  James, from Hancock County, in northwest Ohio--in Findlay--writes:\n\n       When my kidneys began to fail, I was forced to leave my job \n     as an engineer for an electronics company. I went on dialysis \n     for several years and eventually had a transplant. I \n     currently have health care because of my wife's employment. \n     In trying to find a new job, I've had employers tell me my \n     preexisting conditions could drive up their health costs and \n     that they could find other workers without health issues. I, \n     and other people with chronic health problems, will never \n     find good paying jobs with benefits. Please, I want to work \n     and contribute to society. I didn't choose to get sick.\n\n  Several things are happening with James in this letter. First of all, \nwe are outlining the whole idea of preexisting conditions. As the \nPresiding Officer from New York State knows, insurance companies will \nno longer be allowed to deny care for a preexisting condition or \ndiscriminate based on gender, disability, or geography. Companies will \nnot be able to put a lifetime or annual cap on coverage.\n  The second thing is that this legislation will help those small \nbusinesses that too often have one employee who is very expensive so \nthat the small business will see its premiums jacked up so high they \noften have to cancel their insurance and then their other employees \nlose their insurance coverage. Our legislation will help those small \nbusinesses while eliminating these but through insurance company \nreforms, and then a public option, will help to enforce those rules.\n  Robert from Columbus writes:\n\n       Last year, I lost my job and, as a result, my wife, teenage \n     son, and I needed to pick up private health insurance. After \n     researching various companies, we applied to one insurer. My \n     son and I were accepted, but my wife was rejected. Her sin? A \n     preexisting condition. During a previous job while insured, \n     she was diagnosed with mild and treatable high blood \n     pressure. She had one office visit and one prescription a \n     couple of years ago and she gets turned down today.\n\n  How absurd, Madam President, that someone with a very treatable \npreexisting health care problem--high blood pressure, but not a problem \nso chronic that she missed work or spent time in hospitals and all \nthat, but a very treatable condition--was denied care as a result of \nthis preexisting condition and then couldn't get coverage that her \nhusband and her teenage son could get. Our legislation again, through \nthese insurance company reforms, would make sure that doesn't happen.\n  Let me share one more letter because I know Senator Alexander and \nSenator Feinstein are going to call a vote in a minute. Georgene from \nCuyahoga County, in the Cleveland area, writes:\n\n       My 52 year old sister inherited muscular dystrophy and has \n     been on total disability for a few years. She's also had \n     double knee replacement and hip replacement surgeries. Due to \n     her condition, she's fallen several times and damaged her \n     knees. The doctor recommended she get her leg amputated and \n     fit with a prosthetic. Her husband's insurance covers her and \n     approved the amputation surgery but is now denying her the \n     prosthetic and wheelchair. They had to file for bankruptcy \n     due mainly because of medical bills and now live in a small \n     apartment. I could go on with personal stories from my own \n     life or extended family, but you get the picture.\n\n  Madam President, this simply happens too much, where people such as \nGeorgene have not been well served by the system. They have insurance, \nand they were relatively happy with it, but it has now become \ninadequate. Insurance isn't real insurance, it is not adequate \ninsurance, if people get so sick or have such high costs that they get \nexcluded from their insurance.\n  What happens too many times is bankruptcy. The most common cause for \nbankruptcy in this country is because of huge health care costs. The \nmost common situation among those who declare bankruptcy is because of \nhealth care costs, and the most common situation is among people who \nhave insurance but their insurance simply doesn't cover everything. \nTheir expenses are such that their insurance gets canceled and they end \nup in bankruptcy.\n  Madam President, I again urge my colleagues to look seriously at this \nbill as we move forward--the bill that came out of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pension Committee, as it merges with the bill \ncoming out of the Finance Committee--in the next week or two to get \nthis bill to the President's desk this fall. In my State alone, 390 \npeople every single day are losing their insurance. And for people \naround here trying to delay this, it is simply wrong. We need to move, \nnot hurriedly, but at a steady pace to get this bill to the President's \ndesk this fall.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I thank Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Alexander.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that once \nthe Senate reconvenes at 2:15 today, it then stand in recess subject to \nthe call of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9635]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Obviously that is for the purpose of the Senate \nphotograph.\n  Madam President, I note that 12 o'clock has arrived. We will have a \nvote on the Feinstein-Alexander amendment No. 2460. I will take a brief \nmoment to describe it.\n  This is an amendment cosponsored by Senators Alexander, Levin, \nSchumer, Cochran, Bennett, Warner, and I ask unanimous consent to add \nthe name of Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, this amendment simply makes $250,000 \navailable so the Smithsonian can carry out activities under the Civil \nRights History Project Act of 2009. Obviously this means this has been \nauthorized. It is also paid for.\n  This is a joint project between the Library of Congress and the \nSmithsonian, which aims to collect video and audio recordings of the \npersonal histories and testimonials of individuals who participated in \nthe civil rights movement.\n  By coordinating the effort at the national level, the project will \nbuild upon and complement previous and ongoing documentary work on the \nAmerican civil rights movement. I think it is a very special effort \nbecause it essentially will mean that youngsters who are present in 20, \n30, 40, or 50 years, will be able to have audios and videos that \ncontain the actual photographs and actual wording of people who \nparticipated themselves in the great civil rights movement of this \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  If there are no other comments by the ranking member--would the \nranking member like to make a comment? Then we will ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from \nCalifornia for her leadership. We Americans are united by our founding \ndocuments and our language and our history, not by our race or \nethnicity or where we come from, so therefore we are very hungry for \nstories about ourselves. The great writers of American history, such as \nDavid McCullough, whose books are sold out immediately, would wish we \nhad the same sort of documentation the Senator from California has \nproposed here about the writing of the Constitution or the American \nRevolution or the Civil War or the great world wars.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for an evaluation of the aquifers in the area of \n          the Jungo Disposal Site in Humboldt County, Nevada)\n\n       On page 240, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 423. JUNGO DISPOSAL SITE EVALUATION.\n\n       Using funds made available under this Act, the Director of \n     the United States Geological Survey shall conduct an \n     evaluation of the aquifers in the area of the Jungo Disposal \n     Site in Humboldt County, Nevada (referred to in this section \n     as the ``site''), to evaluate--\n       (1) how long it would take waste seepage (including \n     asbestos, discarded tires, and sludge from water treatment \n     plants) from the site to contaminate local underground water \n     resources;\n       (2) the distance that contamination from the site would \n     travel in each of--\n       (A) 95 years; and\n       (B) 190 years;\n       (3) the potential impact of expected waste seepage from the \n     site on nearby surface water resources, including Rye Patch \n     Reservoir and the Humboldt River;\n       (4) the size and elevation of the aquifers; and\n       (5) any impact that the waste seepage from the site would \n     have on the municipal water resources of Winnemucca, Nevada.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to address a crisis \naffecting Native Americans served by the Indian Health Service's Schurz \nService Unit in Nevada.\n  This amendment to H.R. 2996, the Interior, Environment and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, would direct the Indian Health Service to \nuse any unobligated contract health service funds from fiscal year 2009 \nto pay the Service's obligations to private health providers who have \ntreated Nevadans. The Service's Schurz Service Unit administers \ncontract health funds for thousands of eligible Indian beneficiaries \nwho receive care from the Fallon Tribal Health Center, Reno-Sparks \nHealth Center, Pyramid Lake Health Center, Walker River Paiute Health \nClinic, and other tribal health clinics and stations.\n  I understand that it may difficult to coordinate care and referrals \nwhere the\n\n[[Page S9636]]\n\nIndian Health Service administers contract health funds and the tribes \nenter Federal contracts or compacts to provide all other health \nservices. But this arrangement does not relieve the Indian Health \nService of its responsibilities--to provide timely responses and \ncommunications between patients, primary physicians, private health \nproviders and specialists; to ensure that proper procedures and payment \nschedules are followed at the Indian Health Service Unit or the Phoenix \nArea Office or by the State of Nevada and private providers; and to \ncomplete payments and reimbursements in a timely and business-like \nmanner. At the Schurz Service Unit, these responsibilities have not \nbeen fulfilled, and individuals have suffered because they have been \ndenied care or decided not to seek care because they could not pay for \nthe service.\n  This amendment would provide immediate relief for some of the \nproblems identified by the Indian Health Board of Nevada, tribal \nleaders, and private health providers. It would direct the Indian \nHealth Service to pay outstanding contract health obligations incurred \nby the Schurz Service within 90 days of enactment of this bill. \nBriefly, these obligations cover debts that the Indian Health Service \nhas approved and date from fiscal years 2000, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 \nand 2009. The oldest obligations, those before October 1, 2008, total \nless than $1.4 million, while the current fiscal year includes more \nthan $5 million in outstanding bills. There are hundreds of providers \nwho have not been paid for services rendered--services that the Indian \nHealth Service has determined should be paid.\n  In my home State, Native Americans rely on private and community \nhealth providers for a range of services. These providers are critical \ncomponents in our Indian communities' network of health care. And, \nunlike other Indian Health Service Units in the Phoenix Area Office, \nthere are no Indian Health Service hospitals in Nevada and Nevada's \nIndians are expected to travel to the Phoenix Indian Medical Center to \nbe treated for serious health care problems. We must work with private \nproviders so they continue to serve IHS-eligible patients and prevent \nfurther erosion of the health care network serving some of our most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  I will continue to fight for our Native Nevadans and health providers \nwho are valued members of Indian country's health care team. This \namendment does both, by helping the Indian Health Service deal with a \ncritical problem at the federally operated service unit in Schurz and \nby honoring its obligations with our private care providers. And I \nbelieve that by directing this one-time payment, the Indian Health \nService, working with tribes and health providers, will be able to \nimplement necessary procedural and structural changes to better \ncoordinate care and manage contract health funds for fiscal year 2010.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the amendment for \nSenator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2461\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n2461 be called up and the pending business be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2461.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of appropriated funds for the Des Moines \n                    Art Center in the State of Iowa)\n\n       On page 135, line 2, insert before the period at the end \n     the following: ``: Provided, That none of the funds made \n     available under this Act may be used for the Des Moines Art \n     Center in the State of Iowa''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would simply prohibit the \nuse of funds for the Des Moines Art Center in Des Moines, IA--just one \nof the 308 earmarks contained in this bill which total $246 million. \nThis earmark is like most other earmarks posing as a national spending \npriority. Many of these earmarks were not authorized and were not \ncompetitively bid in any way, and no hearing was held to judge whether \nthese are worthy of scarce taxpayers' dollars.\n  Every summer we hear news of major wildfires destroying people's \nhomes and businesses across the country. According to the National \nInteragency Fire Center, over 5.5 million acres of land were scorched \nthis year so far. Spending bills such as this one are vitally necessary \nfor fire suppression activities and forest health programs--programs \nthat save lives and property. As we look for ways to pay for the \nescalating cost of wildfires, we must also address the mixed messages \nwe are sending to taxpayers about our spending priorities.\n  Buried in the committee report, as usual, is a $200,000 earmark for \nhistoric preservation needs at the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa. I am \nall for preserving our Nation's historic buildings, but good intentions \nor not, the process of earmarking is how appropriators steer taxpayers' \ndollars to pet projects that wouldn't otherwise win a grant competition \nor pass a prioritization formula. They are placed above more deserving \nprojects simply because of their ``connections'' in Washington.\n  According to an article in the Des Moines Register dated August 27, \n2009, entitled ``Look Out Below: Des Moines Art Center is Adding Space \nUnderground,'' the Art Center is embarking on a $7.5 million capital \nimprovement project which includes building a $3.5 million basement \nlevel ``storage addition and a new glass elevator.'' The Art Center \nraised this money as part of its ongoing $34 million fundraising \ncampaign launched in 2005.\n  The multimillion dollar underground addition will double as a ground \nlevel ``green roof,'' says the art center's director Jeff Fleming: \n``People can walk on it without even knowing it's a roof . . . a great \nspace for outdoor gatherings.''\n  The article also notes that the art center will gladly name the new \naddition to whichever benefactor closes out their $34 million \nfundraising campaign.\n  Americans are hurting. The unemployment rate is nearly 10 percent. \nThe deficit is estimated to be $1.6 trillion for this year, and the \nprojected 10-year deficit jumped from $7.1 trillion to $9 trillion, et \ncetera, et cetera. Obviously, it might be nice if we started thinking \nabout the future of America and the future generations who are going to \npay the tab for our continued spending.\n  I am offering this amendment on behalf of taxpayers who will \nrightfully question what makes the Des Moines Art Center a national \nspending priority. Why is the Des Moines Art Center allowed to bypass \nthe proper procedures for determining historic preservation spending? \nWhy can't the Des Moines Art Center cough up $200,000 from its $7.5 \nmillion capital improvement project? Why can't they address this \n$200,000 need in their $34 million fundraising campaign?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I spent, as did many of my colleagues, the last few days at home in \nArizona, traveling around my State. When this issue of earmarking and \nporkbarrel spending is brought up, there is a visible reaction. \nAmericans are sick and tired of it. Sooner or later, while those who \ncontinue to vote for and support this unnecessary, unneeded porkbarrel \nspending while we have a 10-year $9 trillion deficit, Americans are \ngoing to rise up in an even more vociferous fashion than they are \ntoday.\n  I believe what is going on around the country is not just the issue \nof health care. What is going on around the country is people are sick \nand tired of this unbridled spending in porkbarrel and earmark projects \nwhich have bred corruption here in our Nation's Capital. They figured \nit out. They have had enough of it.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote in support of this amendment, being aware \nthat those on the Appropriations Committee will probably vote to turn \ndown this amendment even though it is only a $200,000 unnecessary \nspending project. So do so. You have done it in the past. I am going to \ncontinue, and the American people are going to continue, to demand some \nkind of accountability for this outrageous, out-of-control spending \nwhich has mortgaged future\n\n[[Page S9637]]\n\ngenerations of Americans and, believe me, at least in the State of \nArizona, they are sick and tired of it.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment at a \ntime to be determined by the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to call my colleagues' attention \nto a truly disturbing development in the health care debate. A \ncolleague of ours--a colleague of ours--has called for an investigation \ninto a major health care company because this company informed its \ncustomers of its concerns about health care legislation that this \ncolleague of ours introduced. Let me say that again. A colleague of \nours has called for an investigation of a major health care company \nbecause this company disagreed with a bill our colleague introduced.\n  As a result, the Federal Government has now told all companies that \nprovide Medicare Advantage to stop communicating with their clients \nabout the effects of that legislation. Let me say that again. The \nFederal Government has now told these companies to stop communicating \nwith their clients about the effects of a piece of legislation that is \nbefore us, even telling them what they can and cannot post on their Web \nsites. This gag order, enforced through an agency of the Federal \nGovernment at the request of a Senator, is wrong.\n  It started when a company based in my hometown of Louisville, KY--\nHumana--had the temerity in the eyes of some of our colleagues to \nexplain to its customers that if Medicare Advantage is cut, as the \nchairman's mark requires, it may reduce benefits which, of course, is a \ncommonsense conclusion.\n  This is America, the United States of America. Citizens, either as \nindividuals or grouped together in companies, have a fundamental \nright--a fundamental right--to talk about legislation they favor or \noppose in this country.\n  This is the core of the first amendment's protections of speech. \nUnfortunately, this is part of a troubling trend of efforts to dismiss \nthe concerns raised by the American people over the past few months.\n  Over the summer, we saw American citizens who raised concerns about \nthe health care proposals before Congress dismissed--utterly \ndismissed--as somehow un-American by leaders in Congress. That is bad \nenough, but using the full weight of the Federal Government's \nenforcement powers to stifle free speech should trouble all Americans--\nand all of us--even more. We cannot allow government officials to \ntarget individuals or companies because they do not like what they say.\n  The latest effort to squelch free speech raises several serious \nquestions.\n  Is this what we have come to as a country; that an individual or \ncompany can no longer factually advocate their position on an \nincredibly important public policy issue? Is this what we have come to \nin America?\n  Shouldn't customers have a right to know the potential impact of a \ncongressional action?\n  Is this what we believe as a Senate; that this body should debate a \ntrillion-dollar health care bill that affects every single American \nwhile using the powerful arm of the government to shut down speech?\n  Is this how citizens and companies can expect to be treated if health \ncare reform passes; that any health provider that disagrees with a \npowerful Senator will be subject to an investigation and a gag order \nfor disagreeing with a powerful Senator?\n  How is this any different than what the Washington Post and the New \nYork Times have done in lobbying for a reporter shield law? Would we \nstand by if the Judiciary Committee asked the FBI to investigate the \nmedia for taking positions on pending legislation with which we do not \nagree? Of course not.\n  Humana is headquartered in my hometown of Louisville, and, yes, I \ncare deeply about its 8,000 employees in Kentucky. But this gag order \nnow applies to all Medicare Advantage providers. Shut up, the \ngovernment says. Don't communicate with your customers. Be quiet and \nget in line.\n  I remind my colleagues that I have spent a good part of my career \ndefending the first amendment rights of people to criticize their \nelected officials, including me. I would make the same argument if this \nwere a company based in San Francisco or Helena, MT, or Chicago.\n  The right to free speech is at the core of our democracy. Free \ncitizens have a first amendment right to petition their government for \na redress of grievances. This gag order on companies such as Humana and \nthose in all our States, in my view, is a clear violation of that right \nand it is wrong.\n  Employers who warn their customers about the effects of legislation \nare not the ones who should be getting warnings. They are not the ones \nwho ought to be getting warnings. Senators who threaten first amendment \nrights are the ones who should be getting the warnings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, before the Republican leader leaves, I \ncongratulate him for his statement. Over the years, he has been a \nconsistent defender of first amendment rights, even for a great many \nAmericans with whom he disagreed. Senator Byrd, who is the \nconstitutional conscience of the Senate, often encourages Senators to \ncarry with us a little pocket version of the Constitution.\n  I am reading the first amendment to the Constitution, which the \nSenator from Kentucky spent a great deal of his career defending:\n\n       Congress shall make no law--\n  No law--\n\n       respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the \n     free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or \n     of the press, or of the right of people peaceably to \n     assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of \n     grievances.\n\n  I ask the Senator through the Chair whether, as he understands the \nfirst amendment to the Constitution, it would be clearly \nunconstitutional for us to pass a law that would tell a major health \ncare company that if they objected to a piece of legislation by \ninforming their customers of its consequences that there would be some \npenalty?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Tennessee, he \nis absolutely correct. There are two obvious violations of the first \namendment here. One is the right to speak freely and the other is the \nright to petition Congress for a redress of grievances.\n  Here you have an industry, the health insurance industry, at least \none company of which is communicating with its customers the truth \nabout this legislation and being threatened by a powerful Senator and a \ngovernment agency to shut up.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as I understand it from reading it in \nthe newspapers some of the big drug companies are lined up with the \nObama administration with the Democratic health care bill. I wonder \nwhat the Republican leader would think if some Republican Senator \ncalled one of the big drug companies and said: You are going to suffer \nserious consequences or even went to one of the agencies of government \nand caused them to tell a big drug company that because of their \nspeeches and remarks, they were going to suffer some consequences.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, once again, I say to my friend from \nTennessee, to call an agency of the government for the purpose of \nimplementing a gag order against a company that is speaking freely \nabout the impact of legislation on its business and its employees is an \nastonishing thing to behold in the United States of America.\n  I assume the particular industry the Senator from Tennessee is \ntalking about, which has been out running millions of ads in support of \nwhat the administration is trying to do, is not getting such threats.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I assume, Mr. President, that the big drug companies \nthat are running ads against Republican Senators for questioning the \nhealth care reform bill, they have a right to do that. I know what is \nhappening in Memphis is people are seeing the ads and calling me and \ntelling me: Continue to oppose what is going on. But that is part of \nour system.\n\n[[Page S9638]]\n\n  I congratulate the Republican leader for bringing to the attention of \nall his colleagues this action.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Tennessee. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Delaware be permitted to speak in morning business not to \nexceed 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                          First State Robotics\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, imagine a robot that could play ball. \nImagine a robot that could actually pick up a ball from the ground, \nhold on to it, and then, when the time is right, successfully toss it \nto another robot. Finally, imagine that this robot was built by a group \nof high school students.\n  I recently met an extraordinary group of students who turned this \nvision into reality. As part of Delaware's Miracle Workers robotics \nteam, students designed and built this robot to compete in the For \nInspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, for FIRST, \nnational robotics competition.\n  The FIRST Program was founded in 1989 by inventor Dean Kamen to \ninspire young people to pursue careers in science, technology, \nengineering, and math, or STEM. Since that time, FIRST has grown \nsignificantly. In 2008, drawing from the support of thousands of \nvolunteers and mentors, sponsorships from some of the world's largest \nand smallest companies, educational institutions, and the Federal \nGovernment, FIRST introduced nearly 160,000 students from all 50 States \nand 37 countries to the joys of problem solving and engineering.\n  In Delaware, participating students spent an entire school year \nbuilding their robot, which is taller than some humans, decorated in \ngreen and black, and even wearing a bow tie. The first half of the year \nthe team was dedicated to learning the basics of engineering, \nprogramming, and project management. The remainder of the year was \nslated for designing, building, testing, and refining the robot for \ncompetition. Students worked in specific subteams, including \nelectrical, programming, mechanical, fundraising, publicity, scouting, \n3-D animation, Web team, and more. Students engaged with adult \nvolunteers--many of them engineering professionals--who helped train \nand mentor the team.\n\n  Incredibly, these types of programs are not just for those in high \nschool. Delaware's First State Robotics organization oversees several \nother programs and provides engineering experience for students from \nprekindergarten through college. First State Robotics aims to inspire \nin young people, schools, and communities an appreciation for science, \nengineering, and technology.\n  The results are remarkable. Ninety-seven percent of First State \nRobotics participants have attended college, with 82 percent pursuing \ndegrees in science and engineering. Many have earned credits at a local \ncommunity college for their participation in the program, and several \nhave earned scholarships applicable toward higher education.\n  Communities also benefit from these programs. Participating students \ntake part in book drives, blood drives, and mentoring. They give robot \ndemonstrations in local schools and community events to promote \nrecruitment and education.\n  It is clear that First State Robotics is having an incredible impact \non students. Alumni of the program are more interested in pursuing \ncareers in the sciences and engineering, and they are involved with \ntheir communities as volunteers. Many graduates say that participating \nin First State Robotics was the most positive and rewarding experience \nof their lives, and through these experiences they decided to pursue \nfurther study of engineering.\n  We must continue to encourage today's students to become tomorrow's \nengineers by highlighting and promoting programs such as First State \nRobotics. It is through comprehensive programs such as these that \nstudents learn that engineering can be a path to making a difference.\n  Through hands-on activities, students participating in First State \nRobotics are given the opportunity to learn that engineers, such as the \nPresiding Officer, are the world's problem solvers, do make a \ndifference in people's lives and quality of life, and can help us reach \nthe goal of clean water, lifesaving cures for cancer and disease, clean \nrenewable energy, affordable health care, and environmental \nsustainability.\n  The national FIRST Program shows how important it is that the \nAmerican people, the Federal Government, and industries united to \nsupport STEM initiatives. These educational programs will lead us not \nonly to new frontiers in health, energy, technology, and security but \nto new jobs and, ultimately, a sustainable economic recovery.\n  I know that if given the opportunity, a new generation of engineers \nand scientists will lead us into the new frontiers, and many FIRST \nalumni have already done so.\n  I commend the students of First State Robotics and dedicated mentors \nfor their shining examples of the miracles of engineering.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from \nDelaware. He did go 5 minutes.\n  I believe Senator Barrasso has an amendment he wishes to offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I wish to speak on amendment No. 2471.\n  On Friday, September 11, the Washington Times ran a front-page story \non an issue titled ``Forest Fire Aid Allotted to DC, Western States \nFeel Burned.''\n  That is about right. The story talks about the U.S. Forest Service \nplans to spend $2.8 million of wildland fire management funds in the \nDistrict of Columbia. This is ridiculous, it is outrageous, and we \nshould not stand for it.\n\n  Mr. President, just to read the first paragraph:\n\n       Even with forest fires raging out west, the U.S. Forest \n     Service this week announced it will spend nearly $2.8 million \n     of forest firefighting money in Washington--a city with no \n     national forests and where the last major fire was probably \n     lit by British troops in 1814.\n\n  The article continued:\n\n       The vast majority of the money--$2.7 million--is going to \n     Washington Parks & People, which sponsors park festivals and \n     refurbishes urban parks in the Washington area.\n\n  Mr. President, in Wyoming, we have over 9 million acres of national \nforest land. There are seven national forests in our State. We face \nmany management challenges in those forests. The agency struggles to \nmeet its basic responsibilities. Over 1 million acres are infested with \nmountain pine beetle in Wyoming. That is just one species of beetle--a \nspecies that has killed over 1 million acres of trees. The devastation \nstretches well beyond the horizon in many places. And where the beetle \ninfestation is at its worst--in the Medicine-Bow National Forest--the \naffected acres have doubled between 2007 and 2008. The problem is \nsevere. It is growing exponentially, and we are facing extreme risk of \nwildland fire in Wyoming.\n  So when the U.S. Forest Service recommended $500 million and received \nthat amount of money for Wildland Fire Management in the stimulus \npackage, one would think maybe the agency would use those funds to \ncombat threats to forest health in its lands nationwide. One would \nthink that maybe we would see some real results on the ground in \nWyoming and in the State of Colorado. Instead, Wyoming was awarded zero \ndollars in the first round of U.S. Forest Service projects under the \nstimulus, and only after the congressional delegation and the Governor \nof Wyoming appealed to the Department of Agriculture were funds awarded \nfor forest projects in Wyoming. Meanwhile, the agency wants to spend \n$2.8 million on wildland fire in Washington, DC?\n\n[[Page S9639]]\n\n  The people and forest communities in my State deserve better, and the \npeople of America demand better. Wyoming boasts incredible wildlife \npopulations, unique ecosystems, and breathtaking views. Over half the \nland in Wyoming is public land. One can see rangelands, alpine forests, \nglacial basins, and desert landscapes in Wyoming. We host millions of \nvisitors every year who will enjoy Wyoming's wilderness.\n  The District of Columbia is not under threat of wildland fire. In \nfact, the government's National Interagency Fire Center defines what \nqualifies as a wildland fire--and DC does not qualify. Clearly, the \nDistrict should not receive wildland fire management funds. The U.S. \nForest Service should not spend vital funds for wildfire fighting and \nfor prevention in Washington, DC.\n  I have introduced this amendment with a number of other Senators from \nthe West. Senator Kyl and Senator Ensign and Senator McCain are \ncosponsoring, and we want to make sure the U.S. Forest Service is not \nwasting management opportunities. We will not stand by and watch our \nState's burn when resources are available to prevent that, and I would \nask all Senators to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending business and call up amendment No. 2471.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Barrasso], for himself, Mr. \n     Kyl, Mr. Ensign, Mr. McCain, Mr. Risch, and Mr. Crapo, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2471.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of wildland fire management stimulus \n                   funds in the District of Columbia)\n\n       On page 240, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 423. PROHIBITION ON USE OF WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT \n                   STIMULUS FUNDS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the \n     funds made available under the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5; 123 Stat. 115) \n     for wildland fire management shall be used in the District of \n     Columbia.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming. He \nhas a very good point and a very good amendment. This was not the \nintention of the Interior part of the stimulus bill. It is not the \nintention of this bill. Therefore, I think the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Wyoming is completely in order. It has been called up, and our \nside is prepared to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from \nWyoming on his vigilance. There is no Senator--certainly on this side \nof the aisle, and I suspect not in this Chamber--who gets up earlier, \nworks harder, or keeps in closer touch with what is going on in Wyoming \nand in this country than Senator Barrasso, and he is exactly right on \nthis issue.\n  The chairman, Mrs. Feinstein, the Senator from California, has made \nfighting wildfires a major part of her effort this year. She and the \nadministration have included within this appropriations bill the \nfirefighting money that usually is set aside for emergency \nappropriations. So that money needs to be spent correctly, as it should \nbe. I think Senator Barrasso and the other Senators who cosponsored it \nare exactly right, and I agree with the chairman of the subcommittee \nthat it is a good amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So we will accept it, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2471) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and Senator \nAlexander for their gracious reception and acceptance of this amendment \nin the Chamber with that resounding voice vote in support of the \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2472\n\n  Mr. President, I also filed amendment No. 2472, and I wish to speak \non that amendment at this time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, is the Senator calling up that \namendment?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I am not at this point.\n  Mr. President, I have serious concerns about the recent Interior \nSecretarial Order No. 3289. This order will incorporate climate change \ninto all decisionmaking at the Department of the Interior.\n  Although I commend the Secretary for attempting to address this \nissue, I have concerns that we are getting the cart before the horse. \nCongress has not passed a climate change bill. Yet sweeping regulations \nare being proposed by the Secretary of the Interior. These regulations \nput into question the future and past land management agreements \nregarding oil and gas development, renewable energy development, \nrecreational use, and wildlife protection.\n  Under these rules, a dark cloud is placed over all existing \nagreements regarding these activities. In addition, all pending \ndecisions regarding both energy development and recreational use will \nalso be put on hold indefinitely. All this will occur through \nregulations that did not have the approval or the consent of the \nAmerican people.\n  I would ask my colleagues, no matter where they stand on the issue of \nclimate change, to vote for this amendment. We need to get the order \nright. First, a climate change bill that has the public's approval; \nthen after that is voted upon, and if approved, let the regulatory \nprocess at the agency level begin. That is what my colleagues are \nvoting on if they vote for this amendment.\n  So I urge adoption of the amendment at the point when it is called \nup.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2473\n\n  Mr. President, I also filed amendment No. 2473, and I will also speak \non that at this time. That amendment would prevent the Environmental \nProtection Agency's endangerment finding from going into effect until \nthe EPA grants the petition of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to have an \non-the-record, trial-like hearing on the scientific data behind the \nEPA's endangerment finding.\n  The chamber petitioned the EPA for a trial-like hearing on the \nscientific data behind the endangerment finding before an \nadministrative judge or EPA official. The chamber stated in their \npetition that:\n\n       An endangerment finding would give rise to the most far-\n     reaching rulemaking in American history. Before embarking on \n     that long, costly process, the EPA ought to do everything \n     possible to assure the American people of the ultimate \n     scientific accuracy of its decision.\n\n  The on-the-record proceeding would be a great opportunity for EPA to \nensure transparency. This administration claims to be the most \ntransparent administration in history. What better opportunity to \ndemonstrate this by authorizing the chamber's petition. The \nadministrative proceeding is allowed by law. It will be a short on-the-\nrecord proceeding. To deny this request is an admission by the EPA that \ntheir work on endangerment can't stand scrutiny. This should be a \nconcern for all Americans at this point.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2474\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to move on to another amendment which I \nhave filed--amendment No. 2474--and I will speak on it at this point.\n  This amendment would require the Environmental Protection Agency \ninspector general to complete an investigation into the treatment of \nDr. Alan Carlin by his superiors at the Environmental Protection \nAgency. Under this amendment, the endangerment finding could not \nproceed until the investigation is completed.\n  Dr. Alan Carlin and a colleague prepared a 98-page analysis arguing \nthat the EPA should ``take another look'' at the EPA's scientific data \nbehind the endangerment finding that carbon dioxide is a threat to \npublic health. According to a report by Kimberly Strassel with the Wall \nStreet Journal, a senior EPA official suppressed this detailed account \nof the most up-to-date science on climate change.\n  These reports raise serious questions about the process behind and \nthe substance of the EPA's proposed finding that greenhouse gases \nendanger public\n\n[[Page S9640]]\n\nhealth and welfare. On August 21, Inside Washington Publishers reported \nthat the EPA is considering scrapping the National Center for \nEnvironmental Economics' role in scientific analysis. Well, this would \nessentially eliminate the EPA office that Dr. Carlin has worked in for \nyears.\n  In an editorial in the Washington Times, the paper stated:\n\n       This attempt to marginalize a true whistleblower smacks of \n     insincerity . . . and . . . its implications for economic and \n     environmental policy are dangerous.\n\n  This is an administration that claims to put a premium on \ntransparency and openness. Their actions to date have demonstrated \nneither. My colleague, Senator Thune, has requested an inspector \ngeneral's investigation into this matter. I believe the investigation \nshould be conducted and completed before the EPA proceeds further with \nendangerment.\n  So, Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending business and call up amendment No. 2474.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am very concerned by what I am seeing \ntoday. My effort in offering this amendment is to promote transparency \nand good government. Dr. Carlin, a 38-year veteran of the EPA, wrote a \nreport critical of the EPA's process behind the endangerment finding. \nHe said the EPA relied solely on outside sources for their science. He \nalso pointed out that the scientific data they are relying on is 3 \nyears old.\n  The EPA tried to quash his report. Dr. Carlin's boss warned Carlin to \ndrop the subject altogether. He was told:\n\n       With the endangerment finding nearly final, you need to \n     move on to other issues and subjects. I don't want you to \n     spend any additional EPA time on climate change. No papers, \n     no research etcetera, at least until we see what EPA is going \n     to do with climate.\n\n  Mr. Carlin was ordered not to have any direct communication with \nanyone outside his small group at EPA on the topic of climate change \nand was informed that his report would not be shared with the agency \ngroup working on that very topic. To not even allow the Senate to have \na vote to decide whether to investigate this matter looks like \npolitical expediency. It is wrong and it should concern all of those \nwho claim to care about transparency.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to make clear that it would be \nmy intent, should the other two climate change amendments be called up, \nto object to them. However, this has nothing to do with the \ndistinguished Senator, whom I respect enormously. It does have \nsomething to do with putting climate change on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to talk about an issue that \nis very important to our country. It involves our food supply and it \ninvolves thousands of jobs. While it may appear to affect just one \nState, the input we are getting from around the country is that this is \nvery much a national issue.\n  I have an amendment to address it which I would like to discuss. This \namendment, I believe, if we would take the time, we could find \nagreement. It addresses a major problem in the State of the Senator \nfrom California, but it also addresses a problem that affects the \nNation's food supply by allowing us to focus on balancing jobs, the \neconomy, and food with environmental laws.\n  As the chairman knows, there is a major water problem in California's \nCentral Valley. Some very narrowly interested environmental groups have \nused the Endangered Species Act to shut off water to a region that \nproduces 13 percent of the Nation's food supply. The result has been \ndevastating. The land is dry, crops have been destroyed, and tens of \nthousands of jobs--tens of thousands of people are out of work. A \nrecent University of California, Davis, study found that up to 40,000 \njobs will be lost by the end of this year. In one city, the \nunemployment rate has reached 40 percent.\n  This is certainly a local water crisis, but it has also become a \nnational issue. The problem has been the subject of several national \ntelevision programs, and people across the country are beginning to \nrealize that this problem on the west coast could touch us all in the \nform of higher food prices if we don't address it. It is also another \nprecedent that affects my State, as environmentalists have really swung \nthe balance away from good economy and jobs to something that seems \nmuch more radical to us--the development of our port in South Carolina, \nthe passage of ships. And you see development all over the country \nbeing affected. So we need to focus on this issue in this bill. This is \na good place for the amendment.\n  It is almost impossible to overstate the value of California's \nagriculture to the Nation's economy, most of which is produced--most of \nthe food supply we are talking about--right in the Central Valley. This \nregion provides the lion's share of California's crops, which account \nfor, and I want to stress this, 94 percent of America's tomatoes, 93 \npercent of our broccoli, 89 percent of our carrots, 86 percent of our \ngarlic, 78 percent of our lettuce, 90 percent of our strawberries, and \n88 percent of our grapes, just to name a few. We can hardly say this is \nthe issue of one State. This is a national issue that we need to \naddress.\n  People are also coming to realize that if we do not begin to bring a \nmeasure of balance back to our environmental laws, special interest \ngroups and activist courts will be able to use this statute and others \nto destroy thousands of jobs at a time when our country is in \nrecession.\n  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for her work on this issue. \nThe senior Senator from California has been a leader. She has pledged \nto work with the Department of Interior to find a solution, and she \nrecently called for an independent review of the science underlying the \ntwo biological opinions that created this manmade drought.\n  My amendment today is very simple and represents a modest and \nbalanced approach. It turns the water back on for 1 year to provide \ntime for all leaders at the local, State, and Federal levels to find a \nlong-term solution.\n  It will also give farmers the predictability they need to plan for \nnext year's crops. They can't make the loans and get the seeds and plow \nthe fields if they know in December the water will be turned off again \nand won't be turned back on until after July. One cannot farm with that \ntype of unpredictability.\n  I know there are those who say there is no problem because the pumps \nare currently on. But those pumps are set to shut off in December, \nleaving Central Valley farms dry as planting season comes around.\n  My amendment has precedent. In fact, the last time this environmental \nprovision was waived was in 2003, when water was turned off in New \nMexico. That time the Senate voted unanimously for a bill that included \na complete waiver of ESA for 2 years, which was even more aggressive \nthan what I am proposing today.\n  I know this is a very important issue to the Senator from California. \nI hope she will support my amendment. I know many people are working on \nlong-term solutions, but we need to do something now. The provision in \nthe bill to study this is likely to take 2 years. We are likely to lose \nanother 2 years of farm products as well as thousands of jobs in the \nCentral Valley. This is not something I have made up on my own. A \nnumber of groups, farm groups in California, as well as the National \nCotton Council of America, the Tulare County Farm Bureau, Fresno County \nFarm Bureau, Kings County Farm Bureau, Families Protecting the Valley, \nWestland Water District--I have a whole page of large groups that \ninvolves many jobs and families in California and across the country \nsupporting this amendment which won't cost taxpayers anything but will \nactually create jobs, put people back to work, and expand the Nation's \nfood supply.\n  We cannot allow a judge or radical environmental group to cut off \nwater\n\n[[Page S9641]]\n\nto people who are producing the Nation's food supply. My amendment \nwould address this in a very reasonable way. I call on the Senator from \nCalifornia to work with me in support of this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and send \nmy amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. After the Senator completes his remarks, I would like \nthe opportunity to say why.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n               Motion to Recommit with Amendment No. 2500\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I am disappointed I was unable to offer \nthe amendment. Certainly it relates to the underlying bill. Since there \nare so many people and jobs across the country depending on us doing \nsomething quickly, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] moves to \n     recommit the bill H.R. 2996 to the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate with instructions to report the \n     same back to the Senate forthwith with the following \n     amendment No. 2500:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used by \n     the Secretary of the Interior to restrict, reduce, or \n     reallocate any water, as determined in--\n       (1) the biological opinion published by the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service and dated December 15, 2008; and\n       (2) the biological opinion published by the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service and dated June 4, 2009.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. I \nlook forward to more discussion, because I know there are many people \nin the Senate concerned about the same issue. There may be better ways \nto resolve the problem. I am certainly open to work with anyone. This \nis an immediate problem. We cannot continue to spend trillions of \ndollars of taxpayer money to create jobs while we allow government \nagencies to shut down jobs and jeopardize food supply. We need to be \nable to act as a body to solve some small problems instead of what we \nare doing here, which is to totally revamp the health care system or \nmajor changes that do not address the problems right in front of our \nface. I encourage my colleagues to consider this. Let's debate it and \ndiscuss it. I believe we can come up with a solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am rather surprised about this. I \ndon't think anyone in my State or in this body has spent as much time \nas I have on water in the State of California. The motion offered by \nthe Senator from South California surprises me since no one from \nCalifornia has called, written, or indicated they wanted this on the \ncalendar. No one has indicated to me, as chairman of the committee, in \nall of the time Senator Alexander and I have been working on this bill \nthat this is what they wanted. In fact, what this would do is prohibit \nthe Secretary of Interior from expending appropriate funds to restrict, \nreduce, reallocate water supplies from the Central Valley Project and \nthe California State Water Project under biological opinions issued by \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service of the United States and the NOAA \nfisheries.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is venturing into a very complicated \narea. This would prohibit the approval on two gates. It would prohibit \nwork on the intertie where water is now being transferred from one \nsystem, State-run, to Federal and back and forth based on need, water \ntransfers in the hundreds of thousands of acre-feet. It would prohibit \nInterior from working on the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. It would \nprevent Federal agencies from working on water quality issues in the \ndelta.\n  What is the delta? The delta is a large inland body of water in \nnorthern California. It is the drinking water for 16 million people. It \nis the source of water, some of which trickles down to southern \nCalifornia. The Metropolitan Water district, for example, in Los \nAngeles uses between 800,000 acre-feet and a million acre-feet a year \nof this water. Jurisdictions all over the State use some of this water. \nThe agriculture community uses 80 percent of the water in the delta. \nThere are enormous endangered species issues in the delta, the death of \ncertain kinds of fish, the nonnative species of fish, deteriorating \nlevees that when they deteriorate, the peat soil drifts into the water \nand creates all kinds of problems for treatment and would likely \ncollapse in the instance of a major earthquake.\n  What is happening is a whole effort to restore the delta, to develop \na management plan for the delta, how to rebuild it, how to shore it up, \nand also whether in fact there should be some conveyance around the \ndelta to bring some of the water south. This is a very hot issue in \nCalifornia. It is not a hot issue in South Carolina, trust me.\n  It is interesting to me that groups go to the Senator from South \nCarolina instead of to the chairman of the committee for something \nwhich is preemptive and would handcuff the Secretary of Interior. The \nSecretary of the Interior has appointed his No. 2 person, David Hayes, \nto handle western water. David Hayes has been in California. He has \nsolved many problems. He came with me in August to a meeting in the \nsouthern Central Valley to discuss these problems and say what the \nDepartment was prepared to do about them.\n  On September 30 of this month, the Interior Secretary is holding a \nmeeting to announce what actions he is going to take on 2 Gates, on the \nintertie, on water transfers. I don't understand why we would want to \nhandcuff the Secretary of the Interior by saying no money can go for \nany of these things, that water has to be released to the Central \nValley with no controls on it. This makes no sense to me.\n  I see a series of letters that have come in from people I have talked \nwith. I know there is a problem with the biological opinions. There are \n30 lawsuits against the biological opinions. I understand that. To that \nend, I have been asked to put $750,000 in this bill to allow the \nNational Academy of Sciences to come in and do an overarching but \nquick, within 6 months, look at the biological opinions and either say \nthe opinions are founded in sound science or they are not. That is in \nthe heart of this bill.\n  The ranking member has agreed to put this money in this bill for that \npurpose. Along comes something now which would totally handcuff the \nSecretary of Interior, which would mean no permits to move water \nbetween the California aqueduct and the Central Valley Project and back \nand forth and no permits for 2 Gates, two of the emergency solutions \nthat have been put forward.\n  If this passes, we can be sure there will be court action, and we \nwill most likely be enjoined. To my view, it makes no sense. We need \nthe help of Interior. I have asked the Department of Interior, in terms \nof Federal agencies, to take the lead in dealing with California water. \nA specific person has been designated, the No. 2 person in the \nDepartment, David Hayes. A whole process has been entered into now for \nthe administration, through the Secretary of Interior, to begin to put \nits hands on the problem and deal with it.\n  I cannot support legislation that says: Go ahead and release water, \nregardless of endangered species, regardless of any court that might \ncome down on top of you and say stop. I can't do that. It isn't \nresponsible to do so.\n  It is interesting to me--and I am looking at some of the letters--the \npeople who I meet with, whose phone calls I respond to, who have never \ncalled and said: Look, this is what we need.\n  I don't quite understand what is going on here. That is the reason \nfor my objection. I am not going to put the State of California and the \nbay delta in the threat of another lawsuit. We have enough already. \nWater is a huge, complicated, and difficult issue. No one cares more \nabout it than I do or has tried harder to sort out the problems.\n  In a way, this is a kind of Pearl Harbor on everything we are trying \nto do, which is to work together to put Interior in the lead, not to \nhandcuff Interior. That is the reason I objected to the amendment.\n  I understand on the motion there will be a vote. I urge a no vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9642]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2461\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the senior Senator from Arizona. The amendment by Senator \nMcCain singles out one instance of congressionally directed funding \nthat I had included in the bill now before us, fiscal year 2010 \nInterior appropriations. The Senator claims this earmark, which \nprovides $200,000 in funding for repair and renovation of the historic \nDes Moines Art Center, is somehow inappropriate and should be removed \nfrom the bill. Well, it comes as no surprise that I strenuously \ndisagree.\n  First of all, as a constitutional matter, I take issue with the \npremise underlying the Senator's amendment--the idea that Congress has \nno business directing the expenditure of Federal moneys to earmarks, \nthat there is something inherently wrong or evil in this traditional \npractice, and that only the executive branch should determine where \nFederal moneys are spent. Well, I beg to differ.\n  The Constitution, article I, section, 9, expressly gives Congress the \npower of the purse. The executive branch can't spend one nickel unless \nthis Congress gives it the authority to do so. Over the centuries, over \nthe last couple hundred years, we have given to the executive branch \nthe authority to make budgets, spend money on different things through \nall the different departments and agencies, but if Congress wanted to, \nwe could take it all back. We could take it all back because the \nConstitution gives Congress the sole power to spend money.\n  What is more, compared to executive branch individuals, Members of \nCongress have a much better understanding of where and how Federal \nfunds can be spent most effectively in their respective districts and \nStates, and that is certainly the case with the earmark in question.\n  I assume the Senator from Arizona doesn't know a lot about the Des \nMoines Art Center. Well, let me explain it for the Record. The Des \nMoines Art Center encompasses three nationally significant buildings, \ntwo of which have been listed on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces since 2004. One of these buildings was designed by the famous \narchitect, Eliel Saarinen, and another by the world renowned I.M. Pei. \nThese buildings are architectural gems but, unfortunately, they have \nsuffered from deterioration over the years.\n  So I secured the modest funding in this earmark--$200,000--for the \nspecific purpose of replacing windows that were causing inconsistent \ntemperatures and high condensation, resulting in damage to the \nbuilding's plaster, the wood paneling, and the floors. There is nothing \nthe least bit wasteful or frivolous about these renovations. In fact, \nthey will create jobs and put people to work.\n  I also wish to point out that this funding is awarded through an \nauthorized program called Save America's Treasures. This program was \nestablished within the National Park Service to protect:\n\n       America's threatened cultural treasures, including historic \n     structures, collections, works of art, maps and journals that \n     document and illuminate the history and culture of the United \n     States.\n\n  Money for the program is awarded both competitively through grants \nand through congressionally designated funding.\n  Over the years, the Save America's Treasures Program has helped to \nprotect many important buildings and artifacts across our country. \nThere is no question that the Des Moines Art Center is both worthy and \nin urgent need of this modest funding. The buildings of the center, as \nI said, are architectural masterpieces. They contribute mightily to \nmaking Iowa's capital city a livable, attractive urban center with a \nlively cultural scene.\n  Bear in mind that the Des Moines Art Center is a cultural institution \nin the State of Iowa, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors not \nonly from Iowa but from around the United States and from all over the \nworld every year. In the last 12 months, the center has served nearly \nhalf a million people. School kids from all over our State come into \nDes Moines in buses from their schools out in the countryside, out in \nthe small districts, to go to the art center to see these magnificent, \nwonderful works of art and the buildings themselves.\n  I wish to emphasize that in terms of fundraising for renovations and \noperations, the art center and the Des Moines community are more than \npulling their own weight. The center currently is in the midst of a $34 \nmillion fundraising campaign. However, only $7.5 million of that is for \ncapital and building improvement. The remaining $26.5 million is for \nthe center's operating endowment. That allows the art center to be free \nand open to the entire community all year-round. Moreover, the $200,000 \nin Federal funds will leverage $1.9 million in public and private \nchallenge grants--not a bad leveraging of Federal dollars.\n  The fact is, the Des Moines Art Center is struggling to meet its \nfundraising targets in any and all ways possible, including in \nrelatively modest increments. The center has received $275,000 from \nPolk County--that is the county encompassing our capital city of Des \nMoines. They received $25,000 from the city of Des Moines. At this \npoint, the center has exhausted their private fundraising options. So \nthe $200,000 grant from the Federal Government, along with the \nadditional $1.9 million that it will leverage, is critical to meeting \nthe center's goal of renovation.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to share with our colleagues my reasons \nfor including this earmark in the bill before us. I am proud of this \ncongressionally directed funding. It would go to a worthy and urgent \npublic purpose.\n  I believe the effort by Senator McCain to remove this money from the \nbill is misguided, and I urge my colleagues to vote against the McCain \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, earlier while I was arguing the \nopposite side of the question of the DeMint amendment which is now \nbefore this body, I mentioned that there were 30 lawsuits pending \nagainst the biological opinions having to do with the bay delta.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2498 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2498.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that no funds may be used for the administrative \n  expenses of any official identified by the President to serve in a \n     position without express statutory authorization and which is \n  responsible for the interagency development or coordination of any \nrule, regulation, or policy unless the President certifies to Congress \n that such official will respond to all reasonable requests to testify \n  before, or provide information to, any congressional committee with \n   jurisdiction over such matters, and such official submits certain \n                    reports biannually to Congress)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S9643]]\n\n                           FUNDING LIMITATION\n\n Sec. _. None of the funds made available by this Act or any other Act \nmay be used for the administrative expenses of any official identified \n   by the President to serve in a position without express statutory \nauthorization and which is responsible for the interagency development \n      or coordination of any rule, regulation, or policy unless--\n\n       (1) the President certifies to Congress that such official \n     will respond to all reasonable requests to testify before, or \n     provide information to, any congressional committee with \n     jurisdiction over such matters; and\n       (2) such official submits a report biannually to each \n     congressional committee with jurisdiction over such matters, \n     describing the activities of the official and the office of \n     such official, any rule, regulation, or policy that the \n     official or the office of such official participated or \n     assisted in the development of, or any rule, regulation, or \n     policy that the official or the office of such official \n     directed be developed by the department or agency with \n     statutory responsibility for the matter.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to call up an amendment to \nensure that the so-called czars appointed by this administration can be \nheld accountable to Congress and to the American people.\n  The effective functioning of our democracy is predicated on open \ngovernment, on providing a transparent process for the people we serve. \nIt cannot instill trust and confidence in its citizenry unless \ngovernment fosters accountability. It is against that backdrop I raise \nmy concerns regarding the administration's appointment of at least 18 \nnew czars to manage some of the most complex issues facing our country.\n  I am not talking about traditional offices within the office of the \nPresident. I am not talking about, for example, the position of his \nChief of Staff or the position of his press secretary. Similarly, I am \nnot talking about officials who have responsibility to coordinate \npolicy across agency lines that are specifically established in law. A \ngood example of that is the Director of National Intelligence. That is \na position that was established by Congress and whose head is nominated \nby the President and confirmed by Congress. So I am not talking about \nthose officials either.\n  What I am talking about are new positions not created in law that \nhave been established and which have significant policy \nresponsibilities, or so it seems. Part of the problem here is we don't \nknow exactly what the responsibilities are. As I, along with several of \nmy colleagues, including the ranking member of this subcommittee, \nSenator Alexander, recently expressed in a letter to the President, I \nam deeply troubled because these czars fail to provide the \naccountability, transparency, and oversight necessary for our \nconstitutional democracy.\n  The creation of czars within the Executive Office of the President \nand elsewhere in the executive branch circumvents the constitutionally \nmandated advise and consent role our Founding Fathers assigned to the \nSenate. They greatly diminish the ability of Congress to conduct \nmeaningful oversight to hold officials accountable for their actions, \nand it creates confusion about which officials are responsible for the \ngovernment's policy decisions.\n  For example, Nancy-Ann DeParle, an individual for whom I have great \nrespect, is the health policy czar within the White House. Kathleen \nSebelius is the Secretary of Health and Human Services. So who is \nmaking policy when it comes to health care? Who do we hold accountable? \nWell, we know we can call the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nbefore us to testify in open session at public hearings, but most \nlikely we cannot call Ms. DeParle before us to testify, even though she \nhas been great about coming up for private meetings.\n  Senators Alexander, Bond, Crapo, Roberts, and Bennett joined me in \nwriting to the President to raise these important issues. We have \nidentified at least 18 czar positions where reported responsibilities \nmay be undermining the constitutional oversight responsibilities of \nCongress or the express statutory assignments of responsibility to \nother executive branch officials.\n  Again, to be clear, I do not consider every position identified in \nvarious media reports to be problematic. Positions that are established \nby law or are subject to Senate confirmation, such as the Director of \nNational Intelligence, the Homeland Security Advisor, and the Chairman \nof the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board do not raise the \nsame concerns about accountability, transparency, and oversight.\n  Furthermore, we all recognize that Presidents are entitled to rely on \nexperts to serve as senior advisers. But those czar positions within \nthe Executive Office of the President and in some executive agencies \nare largely insulated from effective congressional oversight. Many of \nthe czars appointed by this administration seem either to duplicate or \ndilute the statutory authority and responsibilities that Congress \nalready has conferred upon Cabinet level officers and other senior \nexecutive branch officials.\n  Indeed, many of these new czars appear to occupy positions of greater \nresponsibility and authority than some of the officials who come before \nus for Senate confirmation. Whether in the White House or elsewhere, \nthese czar appointments are not subject to the Senate's constitutional \nadvise and consent role. Little information is available concerning \ntheir responsibilities and authority. There is no careful Senate \nexamination of their character and qualifications. We are speaking here \nof some of the most senior important positions within our government.\n  The appointment of so many czars has muddied the waters, causing \nconfusion and risking miscommunication going forward. We need to know, \nwith clarity: Who is responsible for what? Who is in charge--the czar \nor the Cabinet official? Who can the Congress and the American people \nhold accountable for government policies that affect their lives?\n  For these reasons, I offer an amendment that would prevent any more \nFederal funds from being made available for the administrative expenses \nof czars until two key conditions are met. I don't think these \nconditions are unreasonable. I don't think they are difficult for the \nPresident to meet, but they would make a real difference.\n  First, the amendment I am proposing would require the President to \ncertify to Congress that every one of these positions will respond to \nreasonable requests to testify before or provide information to any \ncongressional committee with jurisdiction over the matters the \nPresident has assigned to that individual.\n  Second, our amendment would require every czar to issue a public \nwritten report twice a year to these same congressional committees. \nThis report would include a description of the activities of the \nofficial and the office, any rule, regulation, or policy that the \nofficial participated in the development of, or any rule, regulation, \nor policy that the official directed be developed by the department or \nagency with statutory responsibility for the matter.\n  This amendment would represent a significant step toward establishing \nan oversight regime for these positions that would provide the \ntransparency and accountability our Nation expects from its leaders.\n  Beyond the specific requirements of this amendment, in the letter we \nsent to the President we implored the President to consult carefully \nwith Congress prior to establishing any additional czars or filling any \nexisting vacancies for these positions.\n  We stand ready to work with the President to address the challenges \nfacing our Nation and to provide our country's senior leaders with the \nauthority, accountability, and legitimacy necessary to do their jobs. \nIf there are problems, then the administration should come to us. We \ncan work on revamping organizational structures to help eliminate those \nproblems, but we must eliminate the serious problems with oversight, \naccountability, transparency, and vetting that are associated with the \nproliferation of these czars.\n  I urge my colleagues to support what I think is a very reasonable \napproach to this difficult issue.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from \nMaine for her leadership on this issue. She has shown great respect for \nthe President's authority under the Constitution. We all respect that. \nHe has the right to appoint his own advisers, period, and to take their \nadvice and, as\n\n[[Page S9644]]\n\na result, assert some executive privilege. And we don't inquire into \nthat. He is entitled to that.\n  But under the Constitution, article II, section 2, states that the \nCabinet officers and other appointments of significant policy positions \nshould be appointed by the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  It is true a number of Republican Senators have raised a question \nabout the 18 new czars appointed by President Obama who are not \nconfirmed by the Senate, all of whom are new. They didn't exist before. \nThis large number of new senior positions is of great concern.\n  Senator Collins, in her letter of September 14 to the President--\nwritten with great respect, signed by Senator Bond, Senator Crapo, \nSenator Roberts, Senator Bennett, and myself--basically made the \nargument she just made. She acknowledged the President's authority \nunder article II to appoint his advisers and to be the leader of the \ncountry. But in terms of these specific responsibilities, the letter \nasks for information about the responsibilities of these 18 new czars; \nof how they were picked and how they were examined and whether they \nwould be willing to testify before us.\n  In her remarks, Senator Collins pointed out if we have a Health \nSecretary and a health czar, who is in charge? If we have an Energy \nSecretary and an energy czar, who is in charge? Those are the big \nissues before us. Health care is nearly 20 percent of the economy. We \nhave town meetings all over the country about it. Right after that \ncomes energy and climate change, and those are going to be a massive \nissues for our country. So it is important for us to know who is in \ncharge so they can testify before the Congress and so we can effect \ntheir appropriations if we should choose to do so.\n  The main point I want to underscore is the fact that this is not just \na concern on the Republican side of the aisle. The senior Senator in \nthe Senate, and the senior Democrat--the President pro tempore--is \nRobert C. Byrd. Sometimes we call him the constitutional conscience of \nthe Senate. Senator Byrd was the first Member of this body to raise \nquestions about the czars. I am sure he would have done it if there had \nbeen a Republican President--he probably has many times before--but he \nalso did it even though there is now a Democratic President.\n  I think it is important to reflect upon what he said in his February \n23 letter to President Obama. Senator Byrd said:\n\n       As presidential assistants and advisers, these White House \n     staffers are not accountable for their actions to the \n     Congress, to cabinet officials, and to virtually anyone but \n     the President. They rarely testify before congressional \n     committees, and often shield the information and decision-\n     making process behind the assertion of executive privilege. \n     In too many instances, White House staff have been allowed to \n     inhibit openness and transparency, and reduce accountability.\n\n  In speaking about the lines of authority between these new White \nHouse positions--these czars--and their executive branch counterparts, \nthe Secretaries, Senator Byrd said this to the President:\n\n       Too often, I have seen these lines of authority and \n     responsibility become tangled and blurred, sometimes \n     purposely, to shield information and to obscure the decision-\n     making process.\n\n  Senator Byrd went on to say:\n\n       As you develop your White House organization, I hope you \n     will favorably consider the following: that assertions of \n     executive privilege will be made only by the President, or \n     with the President's specific approval; that senior White \n     House personnel will be limited from exercising authority \n     over any person, any program, and any funding within the \n     statutory responsibility of a Senate-confirmed department or \n     agency head; that the President will be responsible for \n     resolving any disagreement between a Senate-confirmed agency \n     or department head and the White House staff; and that the \n     lines of authority and responsibility in the administration \n     will be transparent and open to the American public.\n\n  Not only Senator Byrd, but Senator Lieberman, who is the chairman of \nthe committee on which Senator Collins is the ranking Republican, has \nexpressed his willingness to hold hearings on this issue. Senator \nFeingold of Wisconsin, a Democratic chairman of the Subcommittee on the \nConstitution, has written to the President expressing his \nconcern. Senator Feingold says:\n\n       The Constitution gives the Senate the duty to oversee the \n     appointment of Executive officers through the Appointments \n     Clause in Article II, section 2. The Appointments Clause \n     states that the President: ``shall nominate and by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint \n     ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of \n     the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \n     States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided \n     for, and which shall be established by law.\n\n  Senator Feingold goes on to say:\n\n       This clause is an important part of the constitutional \n     scheme of separation of powers, empowering the Senate to \n     weigh in on the appropriateness of significant appointments \n     and assisting in its oversight of the Executive branch.\n\n  Senator Feingold and Senator Byrd and Senator Collins, and several of \nus who signed Senator Collins' letter, and Senator Vitter of \nLouisiana--we all respect the President's authority to be the President \nand to appoint his Cabinet members and other executive branch officers. \nBut we expect that those officers, the people who are actually setting \nthe policy and running the departments, should be accountable to those \nof us in the Senate because the Constitution says so.\n  As a practical matter, we all know in Washington most people in the \nexecutive branch measure their power by the number of inches they are \nfrom the President of the United States. In the White House, most of \nthe scurrying around at the beginning of an administration is to see \nwho can get the office closest to the Oval Office. So it is always an \nissue about the amount of power that begins to accumulate in the White \nHouse. When it begins to take away accountability and authority and \nresponsibility and create confusion about whether the Cabinet \nSecretaries have the authority, that is the time that we begin to cross \nthe constitutional line.\n  That is what Senator Byrd talked about in February, what Senator \nFeingold talked about last week, and what Senator Collins is talking \nabout today. I congratulate her on her amendment. I think it is \nconstructive. I think it is respectful to the President. It \nacknowledges his role in the Constitution, but it reiterates the \nimportance of the role of the Senate in accountability and in \ntransparency. I look forward to supporting her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I listened to the comments of the \nranking member, the Republican manager of the bill. I agree with \neverything he said. I have great respect for the Senator from Maine. I \nfind this amendment reasonable and our side is prepared to accept it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we have one issue up right now, and \nthen we will be happy to call on the Senator from Georgia. I know he \nhas an amendment. I will ask unanimous consent that directly following \ndisposal of the amendment of the Senator from Maine we turn to the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum for \njust one moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Georgia, Mr. Isakson, and the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, \nbe added as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, \nthe Senator from California, and the Senator from Tennessee for their \nkind comments.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. To understand this correctly, the intention is to \ntake this by unanimous support. However, there is one thing that needs \nto be checked\n\n[[Page S9645]]\n\non. The clerks will do that, if the Senator from Maine is agreeable. In \nthe meantime, we will proceed with the Senator from Georgia? Hearing no \nobjection, I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2504\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent we set aside the pending \namendment and call up amendment No. 2504.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Isakson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2504.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask further reading of the amendment be dispensed \nwith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To encourage the participation of the Smithsonian Institution \nin activities preserving the papers and teachings of Dr. Martin Luther \n     King, Jr., under the Civil Rights History Project Act of 2009)\n\n       On page 219, line 5, before ``and including'', insert the \n     following: ``of which $5,000,000 may be made available to the \n     Secretary of the Interior to develop, in conjunction with \n     Morehouse College, a program to catalogue, preserve, provide \n     public access to and research on, develop curriculum and \n     courses based on, provide public access to, and conduct \n     scholarly forums on the important works and papers of Dr. \n     Martin Luther King, Jr. to provide a better understanding of \n     the message and teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.;''.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. First, I thank the chairman for the courtesy of allowing \nme to call up the amendment at this time and appreciate the courtesy of \nthe Senator from Maine. I have requested in appropriations the \ndesignation which is included in this amendment which says the \nSecretary may--underline the word ``may''--appropriate $5 million to \nMorehouse College for the purpose of the curation and the care of the \nMartin Luther King, Jr., papers in Atlanta, GA, for the civil rights \nmuseum of history.\n  Briefly, not to belabor the point, a number of years ago, as you may \nknow, the family of Martin Luther King put up the King papers for \nauction to the highest bidder. A number of people in the State of \nGeorgia and the city of Atlanta determined that those papers belonged \nto the world and raised $32 million amongst themselves to buy the \npapers to protect them forever for posterity. An issue came up in the \nU.S. House of Representatives to appropriate that money, and it didn't \nhappen. Without those bidders, those papers would have gone to the \nhighest bidder. Whether or not it would have remained in the public \npurview for posterity no one knows. But we do know because of the \npeople and the mayor of Atlanta, Shirley Franklin, the distinguished \nRepresentative of our State, had the courage and fortitude and \nforesight to raise the money, and those papers are now under protection \nfor the people of the world.\n  The money is being raised to build the civil rights museum, and it \nwill start in the not too distant future at Centennial Park in Atlanta. \nIt will house the papers of Martin Luther King, but there are 10,000 \nexhibits within the papers of Dr. King. Therefore, Morehouse College \nhas been designated to be the curator and protector of those papers, \nmuch as our archivists in the country do for the great historical \ndocuments of the United States. This money would go to assist Morehouse \nCollege as the curator to protect those papers, which will be in the \npublic domain forever.\n  I appreciate very much the distinguished chairman allowing me to \noffer the amendment. I hope at the appropriate time it will be adopted. \nI think it is an important contribution to the history of our country \nand future of civil rights and the world.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote in relation to the DeMint motion to recommit.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, both Senators from California, as \nwell as the managers of this bill, urge a ``no'' vote on the DeMint \namendment.\n  What this amendment would do is essentially prohibit the Secretary of \nthe Interior from expending appropriated funds to restrict, reduce or \nreallocate water supplies from the Central Valley Project and the \nCalifornia State Water Project. In essence, South Carolina is telling \nCalifornia how to handle its water issues.\n  To handcuff the Secretary of the Interior will essentially prohibit \ntransfers between the State and the Federal water projects, which \ntransfers are being done to facilitate additional water to go to a very \nneedy farm belt in the great Central Valley of California. To put a \nprohibition on the Secretary to use any of the funds in this budget to \nreallocate or transfer this water is a mistake.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote, and I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still time remaining. The Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, this issue shines a spotlight on the \nutter stupidity of what this body does so often. Lawsuits cut off water \nto one of the most fertile farming communities in our country that \nsupplies 13 percent of our food supply. About 40,000 people are now out \nof work because of this arbitrary lawsuit. Now President Obama has \ndeclared it a disaster area so we can spend more taxpayer money to bail \nout the small businesses we are putting out of business.\n  All this amendment does is restrict the use of funds to cut off water \nto the farmers in California that affect this whole Nation. It is not a \nCalifornia issue, it is an American issue. It makes no sense in a \nrecession to put people out of work and to arbitrarily, with no good \nscience involved here, cut off water from the farmers of America.\n  I have a list of farm bureaus throughout California, the National \nCotton Council, and people all over this country who are saying enough \nis enough. Let us use some common sense. Please support this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this will be the last vote of the evening. \nI will file cloture tonight on this bill and, hopefully, we can move \nimmediately to the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I move to table this motion to \nrecommit, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2454.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n               Motion to Recommit with Amendment No. 2508\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I find this very frustrating. As I \nunderstand it, the Chair who is handling the bill on the floor is not \nobjecting personally but on behalf of Senator Nelson of Florida. I find \nit frustrating because this is a completely germane amendment to the \nbill. It is a limitation amendment which is completely germane to the \nbill. I don't think there is any reasonable argument that something so \ndirectly pertinent and germane should not be open for discussion and \nvote on the Senate floor.\n  I think, quite frankly, it is unreasonable for Senator Nelson to \nblock an amendment in this way. Having been\n\n[[Page S9647]]\n\nforced to do this, I now send to the desk a motion to recommit with \ninstructions so that this amendment can be considered and heard in that \nmanner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] moves to recommit \n     the bill, H.R. 2996, to the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the Senate with instructions to report back the same to the \n     Senate forthwith with the following amendment No. 2508.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to delay the implementation of \nthe Draft Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program \n                               2010-2015)\n\n       On page 240, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 423. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUND TO DELAY DRAFT PROPOSED \n                   OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF OIL AND GAS LEASING \n                   PROGRAM 2010-2015.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used \n     to delay the Draft Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and \n     Gas Leasing Program 2010-2015 issued by the Secretary of the \n     Interior under section 18 of the Outer Continental Shelf \n     Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1344).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I will be happy to explain the substance \nof this amendment. Again, I am forced to file this motion to recommit \nsimply to have this germane, relevant amendment heard and voted on with \nregard to the bill.\n  What does the amendment do? The amendment is very straightforward. It \nsimply says:\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used \n     to delay the Draft Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and \n     Gas Leasing Program from 2010-2015 issued by the Secretary of \n     the Interior under section 18 of the Outer Continental Shelf \n     Lands Act.\n\n  We all know we face enormous energy needs in this country. That \nbecame particularly acute and particularly obvious last summer when the \nprice at the pump went through the roof and rose to $4 a gallon for \ngasoline. At that time, people rightly became enraged that we were not \ndoing more to control our own destiny and our own energy future. People \nstarted demanding that Congress act, that Congress do something with \nregard to oil and gas and other energy resources we have right here at \nhome.\n  That is when the petition began: Drill here, drill now. That is when \nevery Member of this Congress was deluged with calls and e-mails and \nletters saying: Let's get ahold of our own destiny and produce that \nenergy which we have right here at home.\n  In that time period last year, Congress heard that message loudly and \nclearly. So for the first time in years, the moratorium on offshore oil \nand gas production was lifted by Congress, and President Bush similarly \nlifted a more limited executive moratorium on offshore production. So \nthose barriers and those hurdles were finally lifted because of the \ndemands of the American people, when the American people said very \nloudly, very clearly: This is ridiculous. We have resources here at \nhome. We have domestic energy. Let's use that domestic energy rather \nthan being held hostage by foreign powers. That was real progress. That \nwas moving, certainly, in the right direction.\n\n  The problem is, the new administration and the new Secretary of the \nInterior have made it clear that--despite all of those actions, despite \nall of that clear communication by the American people, despite \nCongress taking that historic action of lifting the moratorium, despite \nthe previous administration lifting the executive moratorium--they are \nnot in any hurry and they are not going to take any action in the near \nfuture to move forward with the 2010 to 2015 offshore planning area and \nlease sales.\n  So what, unfortunately, Secretary Salazar has said pretty clearly is \nhe is not going to take action in the foreseeable future to actually \nmove forward with that going after domestic production and domestic \nresources. That is really a shame because, while the price at the pump \nhas stabilized somewhat from last summer, and that is a good thing, the \nneed--particularly the medium- and long-term need--is still there. Over \nthe next 20 years, U.S. demand for energy is only going to grow. It is \nparticularly going to grow as we get out of this recession and come \nback into a more normal economy. Overall, it is expected to grow at an \nannual rate of 1.4 percent. That is going to demand more energy. We \nneed to conserve. We need to develop new technology. We need to develop \nnew energy sources. But that need is still going to grow, so that short \nterm we will have increased demand for the types of energy we use.\n  We have enormous potential right here at home. The question which \nthis amendment poses is, are we going to tap that potential or are we \ngoing to use the resources we have so that we cannot be held hostage \nany longer by hostile foreign powers.\n  According to conservative estimates from MMS, there are about 288 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas and 52 billion barrels of oil in the \nOFC, off the lower 48 States. That is an enormous amount of energy as \nyet untapped. That is enough oil to maintain current production for 105 \nyears. That is enough natural gas to maintain production for 71 years. \nThat is enough oil to produce gasoline for 132 million cars and heating \noil for 54 million homes for 15 years. It is enough natural gas to heat \n72 million homes for 60 years or to supply current industrial and \ncommercial needs for 28 years or to supply current electricity \ngenerating needs for 53 years. Further, the MMS reports that the waters \noff Alaska's coast hold about 27 billion barrels of oil and 132 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas. That is in addition to all of the \npotential, all of the resources I was just talking about.\n  Make no mistake about it, we need to move to a new energy future. We \nneed to develop new technology. We need to develop new sources of \nenergy. But we need a bridge to get to that future, and certainly \ncurrent fuels--oil and natural gas, particularly natural gas, which is \na relatively clean-burning fuel--are an absolutely vital bridge to get \nto that future.\n  The American people are scratching their heads. We have enormous \nneeds, particularly the need to build an energy bridge to a new, \nexciting energy future. The good news is we have enormous domestic \nresources that can help get us there, particularly natural gas. So why \nare we not matching those two things that should match up so well? The \nAmerican people demanded that last summer. Because of their loud and \nclear voice, they got dramatic action out of Congress, lifting the \nmoratoria. The problem is, the new administration and the new Secretary \nof the Interior are simply saying: We are not in any hurry to get \nthere. We are not going to lift a finger to actually move forward with \nthe concrete work that needs to be done.\n  That is really inappropriate. That is ignoring the clear clarion call \nof the American people. So, again, that brings us to my amendment, \namendment No. 2454, which my motion to recommit would add to the bill. \nIt simply says:\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used \n     to delay the draft proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and \n     Gas Leasing Program for 2010-2015 issued by the Secretary of \n     the Interior under section 18 of the Outer Continental Shelf \n     Lands Act.\n\n  The American people have spoken: Drill here, drill now; build an \nimportant bridge to the future. No, it is not the future, but it is a \nnecessary bridge to get us there. Let's adopt that common sense of the \nAmerican people. Let's respond to that clear call of the American \npeople dating back to last summer. Let's pass this clear limitation \namendment, perfectly germane to this bill, so we can move forward with \ndeveloping our domestic energy resources right here at home to build a \nmore stable energy future.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last summer President Bush signed into \nlaw a $50 billion foreign aid--HIV/AIDS--bill. Included as part of the \nPEPFAR bill was a $2 billion authorization that I, and a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators, worked to include that focused on the critical \npublic safety, health care, and water needs in Indian country. All of \nthe Senators who worked to include this provision in the final package, \nincluding now Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Clinton, \nrecognized that there are great needs internationally, but that we have \nequal or maybe even greater needs here at home on our Nation's \nreservations.\n  The final PEPFAR bill created a $2 billion 5-year authorization, \nbeginning\n\n[[Page S9648]]\n\nin fiscal year 2009, for the emergency fund for Indian safety and \nhealth. Over the 5-year authorization, $750 million could be spent on \npublic safety, $250 million on health care, and $1 billion for water \nsettlements. The need for increased funding in these three areas cannot \nbe underestimated.\n  Nationwide, 1 percent of the U.S. population does not have safe and \nadequate water for drinking and sanitation needs. On our Nation's \nreservations this number climbs to an average of 11 percent and in the \nworst parts of Indian country to 35 percent. The Indian Health Service \nestimates that in order to provide all Native Americans with safe \ndrinking water and sewage systems in their home they would need over \n$2.3 billion.\n  The heath care statistics are just as startling. Nationally, Native \nAmericans are three times as likely to die from diabetes compared to \nthe rest of the population. In South Dakota, 13 percent of Native \nAmericans suffer from diabetes. This is more than twice the rate of the \ngeneral population, where only 6 percent suffer from diabetes. On the \nOglala Sioux Reservation in my home State of South Dakota, the average \nlife expectancy for males is 56 years old. In Iraq it is 58, in Haiti \nit is 59, and in Ghana it is 60--all higher than right here in America. \nIn South Dakota, from 2000 to 2005, Native American infants were more \nthan twice as likely to die as non-Native infants.\n  Tragically, there are also great needs in the area of public safety \nand justice. One out of every three Native American women will be raped \nin their lifetime. According to a recent Department of Interior report, \ntribal jails are so grossly insufficient when it comes to cell space, \nonly half of the offenders who should be incarcerated are being put in \njail. That same report found that constructing or rehabilitating only \nthose detention centers that are most in need will cost $8.4 billion.\n  The South Dakota attorney general released a study last year on \ntribal criminal justice statistics and found homicide rates on South \nDakota reservations are almost 10 times higher than those found in the \nrest of South Dakota. Also, forcible rapes on South Dakota's \nreservations are seven times higher than those found in the rest of \nSouth Dakota.\n  There is no better example of these public safety issues as Standing \nRock Sioux Tribe, which is located on the North and South Dakota \nborder. In early 2008, the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation had six \npolice officers to patrol a reservation the size of Connecticut. This \nmeant that during any given shift there was only one officer on duty. \nOne day, the only dispatcher on the reservation was out sick. This left \nonly one police officer to act both as a first responder and also as \nthe dispatcher. This directly impacted the officer's ability to patrol \nand respond to emergencies, and prevented him from appearing in tribal \ncourt to testify at a criminal trial.\n  Later in the year, I was able to work with my Senate colleagues and \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs to bring additional police officers to the \nStanding Rock Sioux Reservation through Operation Dakota Peacekeeper. \nThis effort increased the number of officers working on the reservation \nfrom 12 to 37. This operation, which was a success, was only possible \nbecause the Bureau of Indian Affairs was able to dramatically increase \nthe number of law enforcement officials on the reservation during the \nsurge. And this dramatic increase in officers was only possible because \nthe Bureau had been given additional public safety and justice funds in \n2008.\n  Since its enactment last year, I have been working with my colleagues \nto ensure that the emergency fund for Indian safety and health is \nfunded as quickly as possible. Earlier this spring, 13 of us sent a \nletter to the chairman and vice chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee asking that the committee increase the allocations in three \ndifferent bills, including the Interior appropriations bill that we are \ndebating today. As a result of that letter, the allocations in both the \nEnergy and Water Development and Interior appropriations bills were \nincreased by $50 million each, for a total of $100 million.\n  While this funding increase is a positive sign, neither subcommittee \ndirected this additional funding into the emergency fund as requested. \nInstead, the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee divided the \nadditional funding up between a variety of water settlement projects, \nand the Interior Subcommittee provided $25 million for public safety \nconstruction and $25 million for ``public safety and justice programs \nas authorized by the PEPFAR Emergency Fund.''\n  While I am pleased to see that there has been a $100 million increase \nin funding for Native American public safety and water projects, I \nthink more could be done if we deposited funds directly into the \nemergency fund, which would be allocated to the areas of greatest need. \nThe emergency fund, unlike general appropriations, is needed because \nthe fund allows the relevant Federal agencies to spend the additional \nresources in those places where there are actual emergencies. It would \nallow agencies, like the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to begin additional \noperations, like Operation Dakota Peacekeeper, and bring immediate \nsolutions to parts of our nation that are most in need.\n  That is why I filed my amendment, amendment No. 2503, today. I have \nfiled an amendment that would simply transfer the $50 million increase \nin public safety and public safety construction funding into the \nemergency fund. While I do not intend to seek a vote on this amendment \ntoday, I am committed to continuing to work in a bipartisan manner for \nthe much needed funding for the emergency fund. Toward that end, I am \nencouraged by the discussions I have had with several of my colleagues \nwho are willing to continue this effort.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of H.R. 2996, the Department of the \nInterior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for \nfiscal year 2010.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $32.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2010, which will result in new outlays of $19.7 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the bill will total $34.3 billion.\n  The Senate-reported bill matches its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and is $5 million below its allocation for outlays. No \npoints of order lie against the committee-reported bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a table \ndisplaying the Budget Committee scoring of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nH.R. 2996, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES\n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-reported bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               General\n                                                               purpose\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority.......................................       32,100\n    Outlays................................................       34,273\nSenate-Reported Bill Compared To:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:\n        Budget Authority...................................            0\n        Outlays............................................           -5\n    House-Passed Bill:\n        Budget Authority...................................         -200\n        Outlays............................................           85\n    President's Request:\n        Budget Authority...................................         -225\n        Outlays............................................          35\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE: Table does not include 2010 outlays stemming from emergency budget\n  authority provided in the 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L.\n  111-32).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me thank the Senator from California \nfor allowing me to go first in this group that I am sure will appear \ndown here to talk in morning business.\n  As the cap and trade continues to languish in the Senate, President \nObama is trying to salvage international climate change talks that are \non the brink of collapse. So he gave a\n\n[[Page S9649]]\n\nclimate change speech at the United Nations, hoping to inspire hope in \nthe process marred by failure. His speech, however, fell short of \nexpectations, offering only to talk of rising sea levels and climate \nrefugees, sort of resurrecting things that have been refuted in the old \nGore speeches.\n  President Obama's speeches have been delivered against a backdrop of \nconfusion and disagreement in the international community over climate \nchange. The European Union is angry that the Senate is stalling cap and \ntrade. China and India refuse to accept binding emissions cuts. The New \nYork Times admits that global temperatures ``have been stable for a \ndecade and may even drop in the next few years.'' In other words, we \nare actually in a cooling period right now, maybe not as dramatic as \nthe one I recall back so well in 1975, when they said another ice age \nis coming, nonetheless it is cooler. We are not involved in global \nwarming right now.\n  He was addressing the global economic recession that has taken \nprecedence over climate change in countries throughout the world. This \nglobal economic recession is one that has captured the interest of the \npeople all over the world and has them looking to see: Is this science \nreally there that they were talking about, going all the way back to \nthe late 1990s and the Kyoto treaty? This is deja vu all over again. \nThese are some of the same issues that have stymied climate talks ever \nsince Kyoto.\n  We were told all rancor and disagreement would evaporate once the new \nadministration assumed power in the United States. After all, the \nfailure to achieve an international climate pact was simply George \nBush's fault. President Obama would bring change and the ability to \npersuade the likes of China and India to transcend their national self-\ninterest for the global good. That has not happened and is not going to \nhappen.\n  I was surprised President Obama failed to define what success will \nmean in Copenhagen, so I will have to do it for him. From the \nstandpoint of the Senate, success will not mean a vague, open-ended \ncommitment on the emissions from India or China, the world's leading \nemitter. Success can only mean that China and other developing \ncountries agree to mandatory emission cuts comparable to those required \nin America and that any treaty or agreement that did not avoid causing \nharm to our economy would not be acceptable. Unless those conditions \nare met, no such treaty or agreement will be approved by the Senate.\n  I remember the Senate resoundingly rejected exempting developing \nnations such as China way back in 1997. That is still alive today. It \npassed 94 to 0. It said we will not agree to any treaty. At that time, \nVice President Gore had signed the Kyoto treaty. They were trying to \nencourage us to ratify that treaty. President Clinton never brought it \nto the floor. It is because we had spoken loudly and clearly with a \nunanimous vote in the Senate that said we are not going to ratify \nanything that either doesn't force the developing countries such as \nIndia and China to have the same requirements as we have or that hurts \nus economically. That is the position--it was then and is today--of the \nU.S. Senate. I think that still commands support in the Senate. Any \ntreaty the Obama administration submits must meet that resolution.\n  We hear that China is making progress in reducing emissions and that \nthe administration will persuade China to agree to more aggressive \nsteps in Copenhagen.\n  By the way, that is where they have the annual meeting, the big bash \nthe United Nations puts on. I went to one of those back in about 2003, \nI guess it was, in Milan, Italy.\n  The administrations's climate change envoy, Todd Stern, is saying \nsomething different. On September 2--he is the person from the Obama \nadministration--on September 2, he said: ``It is not possible to ask \nChina for an absolute reduction below where they are right now'' \nbecause, as he said, ``they are not quite at that point to be able to \ndo that. And, in that respect, developing countries are different''--\ntotally violating the intent of the 1997 agreement that this Senate \nhad.\n  This is the first time someone from the administration has said let's \ntreat developing countries different from developed countries.\n  Let me restate a bit. Stern is saying China simply can't make \nreductions that would be comparable to anything the United States \naccepts domestically. This is not a surprise considering China is now \nthe world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide while U.S. emissions have \nremained relatively stagnant. Make no mistake here, China is \nunapologetic for its refusal to accept binding emissions cuts, and it \nwill pursue an all-of-the-above strategy, including burning coal as it \ndeems necessary; all of the above: oil, gas, coal, nuclear; they are \nvery big in nuclear over there.\n  China also stated that before it accepts absolute, binding emissions \nreductions, developing countries must reduce their emissions by at \nleast 40 percent by 2020.\n  Let me say that again. China won't accept absolute reductions until \ndeveloping countries--that is, the United States, including the United \nStates--reduce their emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. \nThis is really astounding considering that the Waxman-Markey bill only \ncalls for a 14-percent reduction and they are saying they expect us to \nhave a 40-percent reduction.\n  Accepting the Chinese position would mean certain economic disaster \nfor the United States, for jobs and businesses--not to mention \nemissions--going to China.\n  Over the coming days and weeks, we will hear much about China's \nnational mitigation plan, its 5-year plan to reduce emissions. We will \nhear stern warnings that China is outpacing the United States on clean \nenergy. But this is a smokescreen to hide the chaos and failure of \ninternational climate change negotiations.\n  In the coming weeks, President Obama will reach some sort of \nbilateral agreement with China on climate change, but it won't require \nChina to do anything other than business as usual. We have gone through \nthis before. I can understand China's position. If I were in China, in \nthat government, I would say the same thing. I would say: Let's go \nahead and let's get the developed nations to have some kind of \nreductions so that will move manufacturing jobs to us, to China. I have \nto say this about the new Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, Lisa Jackson, in her honesty the other day in a public \nhearing--I asked her the question: If we were to pass one of these \nbills where we unilaterally pass something in the United States, like \nWaxman-Markey, if we did that, would that have any reduction in \nworldwide reductions in CO2? She said no, it would not have \nany effect. Obviously, it wouldn't.\n  Anyway, you could argue that if we were to pass Waxman-Markey, it \nwould have the effect of increasing worldwide emissions because our \nmanufacturing base would go to countries where they didn't have any \nemission requirements.\n  So, in the final analysis, President Obama's speech to the United \nNations was a failure to define success, a failure to provide real \nsolutions for international energy security, and a failure to sketch \nthe outlines of a meaningful international climate change agreement \nthat will pass the Byrd-Hagel test of 1997.\n  I think surely after the August recess, after so many people were \nbeaten up on the fact that they did not want to have any type of a \ngovernment-run health system, they certainly did not want to pass \nsomething that would be a cap and trade that would have the effect of \nproviding the largest single tax increase in the history of America, a \ntax increase in the range of $300 to $366 billion a year.\n  I can remember back when we passed that very large tax increase in \n1993. It was called the Clinton-Gore tax increase. It increased the \nmarginal rates, increased capital gains, it increased the death tax, \nall of the other taxes. I was pretty upset about it at that time. I \ntalked on the Senate floor. I said that was a $32 billion tax increase. \nThis would be 10 times that size. So I do not think it is going to \nhappen. This commission will listen to the speeches between now and \nCopenhagen. I plan to make a few myself.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9650]]\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/S9650-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9650-S9651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ANGRY AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, my impression is that the American people \nare angry. In my view, they have every right in the world to be angry \nbecause what we are seeing in our country today is the kind of economic \nsuffering and pain that we have not seen in this country since the \nGreat Depression.\n  Recently, last week, Ben Bernanke, who is the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, said he thought it ``very likely that the recession had \nended.''\n  I would suggest to Mr. Bernanke that before he makes statements like \nthat, he might want to talk to the tens and tens of millions of people \nin this country who are suffering economically and who, in many \nrespects, are not going to see a better day soon unless we as a \nCongress get our act together.\n  When you ask why the American people are angry, let me suggest to you \nwhy that is so. We went through 8 years which, in my view, were led by \nthe worst administration in the modern history of the country. This is \nwhat happened during those 8 years before the financial crisis of last \nyear. During the Bush-Cheney administration over 8 million Americans \nslipped out of the middle class and into poverty; median household \nincome declined by over $2,100; over 6.5 million Americans lost their \nhealth insurance; 5.4 million manufacturing jobs disappeared; and 4 \nmillion American workers lost their pensions. That is between 2000 and \n2008.\n\n  Colleagues may have seen the other day in USA Today on their front \npages unbelievable statistics which were geared toward age groups of \nyoung American workers seeing, during that 8-year period, huge declines \nin their median family income. That was before the financial crisis.\n  As we all know, about a year ago, Secretary of the Treasury Paulson \ncame before the Congress and essentially said: I know that for 7 years \nwe were telling you how robust and great the American economy was, but \nit seems we may have made a little bit of a mistake. If you don't give \nus $700 billion in the next few days, it appears that the entire \nworld's financial system might collapse. It seems we may have made a \nmistake.\n  Thank God the financial system of the country and the world did not \ncollapse. But on Wall Street, because of the greed, the \nirresponsibility, and the illegal actions of a handful of CEOs at the \nhead of huge financial institutions, we have seen the most significant \neconomic decline in this country since the 1930s. Since the beginning \nof the recession in December of 2007, 7.4 million Americans have lost \ntheir jobs. The official unemployment rate is 9.7 percent. Let me give \na statistic which I think is enormously powerful and extremely \nfrightening. If we count people who are officially declared as \nunemployed and if we add to that number those people who have given up \nlooking for work, who are no longer counted as unemployed, and if we \nadd to that number those people who want to work in full-time jobs but \nare now working part-time jobs, what we are looking at is 26 million \nAmericans who are unemployed or underemployed. That is 17 percent of \nworking-age Americans. As bad as the official statistic of 9.7 percent \nis, the reality is a lot worse than that. When we wonder why people are \nangry, I think when 26 million Americans are unemployed or \nunderemployed, when millions more have lost their homes, when they have \nlost their pensions, when they have lost their health insurance, those \npeople have a right to be angry.\n  In my view, we have been far too easy in terms of our response to \nwhat the people on Wall Street have done. It is beyond my comprehension \nthat we did not begin an investigation weeks or at least months after \nthe financial meltdown and ask what the cause of that meltdown was, who \nwas responsible, hold them accountable, and if they broke the law, they \ndeserved to find out what the American penal system is all about.\n  What we have to do right now--and I know there is an investigation \nbeginning--is a thorough investigation--it is already very late in the \nprocess, and we should have done it earlier--to start holding those \npeople who have caused so much suffering accountable, to understand \nthat they just can't get away with it. What amazes me is that we have a \nhandful of people whose greed and recklessness have caused this crisis. \nAnd have you heard one of them come before the American people to say: \nI am sorry. My greed, my recklessness, my illegal behavior has caused \nso much suffering in this country and around the world. I want to \napologize.\n  On the contrary, what I have heard is lobbyists all over this place \nand the financial institutions spending millions and millions of \ndollars trying to make sure we do nothing and that they are able to \ncontinue doing what they did, the same old ballgame which caused the \ncrisis in the first place.\n  The first thing I think we need to do is a real investigation of this \nfinancial crisis. If there are CEOs, who made hundreds of millions of \ndollars, responsible for this disaster, this financial crisis, they \nhave to be accountable. If they broke the law, they have to go to jail.\n  Second, in terms of real financial reform, I am more than aware that \nCongress passed legislation trying to bring more transparency and \nintegrity to the credit card industry. All of us have received \nprospectuses from credit card companies telling us if we sign on the \nbottom line, we will have zero-interest-rate credit. They have sent out \nbillions of these prospectuses every single year. Meanwhile, in tiny \nprint on page 4, it appears they could raise their rates to any level \nthey want for any reason. We have begun to deal with that, but we have \nnot gone far enough.\n  When major financial institutions are charging the American people 29 \npercent interest rates on their credit cards, 30 percent interest rates \nin terms of payday lending, 40, 50 percent interest rates, we have to \ncall it what it is. That is loan sharking. In the old days, a loan \nshark was somebody who lent you money and if you didn't pay it back on \ntime, they broke your kneecaps. Now we have these guys on Wall Street \nwho are doing exactly the same thing, and we call that providing \ncredit. But it is not. It is loan sharking. It is usury. We need to \nbring back usury legislation, which we used to have but was done away \nwith by a Supreme Court decision which allowed companies to go to \nStates that don't have usury laws to be protected in terms of being \nable to charge high interest rates all over the country.\n  I have introduced legislation which imposes a maximum of 15 percent \ninterest on credit cards. The reason I have done that is, in fact, \ncredit unions for many decades now have been operating under that law. \nIt is not the credit unions that are coming here for massive bailouts. \nIt is our friends on Wall Street. I think if it has worked for the \ncredit unions, it can work for private banks as well. We have passed \ncredit card legislation which was a step forward, but I think we have \nto take another big step. We have to say that there has to be a \nmaximum, a cap on interest rates. I believe an appropriate one is 15 \npercent.\n  Another issue we have to deal with is the phenomenon of too big to \nfail. The reason we provided hundreds of billions of dollars in a \nbailout to Wall Street is that the experts believed--the Secretary of \nthe Treasury and the head of the Fed--that if we allowed these huge \nfinancial institutions to fail, they would bring down the entire \nsystem. That was a year ago. Maybe you know more than I do, but I am \nnot aware that we have taken any steps to begin breaking up these large \nfinancial institutions. If they were too big to fail a year ago, they \nare too big to fail right now.\n  What we have seen--and there have been a number of articles on this--\nis that these huge financial institutions have become even larger. What \nsense is that? We have to begin to learn what Teddy Roosevelt did 100 \nyears ago. We have to start breaking up these guys. Because if we \ndon't, we will be back here again, except next time the bailout will be \neven larger, because the financial crisis will be that much more \nsevere.\n  Furthermore, it goes without saying that for years Alan Greenspan and \nBob Rubin and all of those people who told us that the secret to \nfinancial success in America was to deregulate Wall Street, that what \nwe really had to do\n\n[[Page S9651]]\n\nwas to get the government off of the backs of all of these big Wall \nStreet companies, we had to do away with Glass-Steagall legislation, we \nhad to allow investment houses to merge with commercial banks, to merge \nwith insurance companies--all of that was going to be wonderful in \nterms of creating wealth and prosperity for the American people.\n  Our friends on Wall Street spent billions of dollars on lobbying to \nget that through. I was one of those in the House vigorously opposed to \nthat approach. Needless to say, it is time to rethink that and, in a \nsensible way, to start the reregulation of Wall Street.\n  The bottom line is, these people on Wall Street are by and large \nconcerned about one thing, and that is making as much money as they \npossibly can for themselves. And they have done phenomenally well. Some \nyears ago 25 percent of all profits in America went to Wall Street, \nwhich has relatively few people. Obviously, as I think everybody knows, \nyou had hedge fund guys making a billion dollars a year, CEOs making \nhundreds of millions of dollars a year. They have done very well. They \ndon't care that manufacturing is disintegrating in America, that \nmillions of workers have lost their jobs. They don't care that small \nbusinesses can't get credit. They don't care about trying to build a \nproductive economy where working people are producing real products \nthat people can consume. That is not where these guys are at. They are \nat it for short-term gains. If anybody believes otherwise, they don't \nunderstand history.\n  We have to set out a number of rules by which they have to play or \nelse we are looking to bring back exactly what we just went through.\n  Another issue we have to deal with, as we get to financial reform, is \nthe Fed. I am a member of the Budget Committee. Last year, when Mr. \nBernanke came before the committee, I asked him very simply if he could \ntell me which financial institutions were the recipients of some $2 \ntrillion in zero interest loans. During the financial crisis, Mr. \nBernanke and the Fed provided $2 trillion to large financial \ninstitutions. I asked him a pretty simple question: Can you please tell \nme which financial institutions received that money? I don't think that \nis a terribly radical question, putting $2 trillion of taxpayer money \nat risk. And he said: No, I can't tell you.\n  On that particular day, I introduced legislation that would make him \ntell us. It is beyond comprehension that we are putting at risk \ntrillions of dollars going to institutions, and we don't know who they \nare, what kind of conflicts of interest exist. We don't know what the \nterms of payment are. It is beyond comprehension.\n  On this issue, I must confess, I am working with somebody whose \npolitics and ideology are very different than mine, my old friend Ron \nPaul, who is a very conservative Republican in the House. Ron and I \nworked on some issues when I was there. He and I are working together \non two pieces of legislation on the Fed. But one of them is going to \ntell the Fed they can't give away trillions of dollars with the \nAmerican people not knowing what it is. We need an order to the Fed. We \nneed transparency in the Fed, and we need accountability in the Fed.\n  There is another issue we want to deal with, and that is oil \nspeculation. I come from a cold weather State. Many people heat with \noil. Obviously, all over the country people are filling up their gas \ntanks to get to work. We have reason to believe that one of the causes \nof the volatility in oil prices has to do with speculation coming from \nWall Street where our friends there are investing in oil futures. We \nhave to begin to control that speculation so that people are not paying \noutrageous prices, heating their homes in winter or filling up their \ngas tanks.\n  Lastly, the issue of Wall Street in one sense is not radically \ndifferent from the issue of health care or many other important issues, \nthe incredible power these special interests have. The banking and \ninsurance industries have spent over $5 billion on campaign \ncontributions and lobbying activities over the past decade in support \nof deregulation, and they are spending even more to try to prevent \nCongress from seriously regulating their industries. The American \npeople want change. They want Congress to reform Wall Street. They want \nthose people who caused this economic crisis to be held accountable. \nThey want to make sure we prevent the country from ever going into a \nsituation such as we were in last year. Whether we can do it remains to \nbe seen, given the power of Wall Street and the incredible amounts of \nmoney they spend on campaign contributions and on lobbying.\n  Which brings me to the issue of campaign finance reform and my strong \nview that we need public funding of elections.\n  So, Mr. President, I just did want to say a word as to my perception \nof why the American people are angry, the fact that they have every \nreason in the world to be angry because in our great country what we \nare seeing, for the first time in our lifetimes, is the real likelihood \nthat our kids will have a lower standard of living than our generation, \nand that is not something we should be happy about.\n  We have to ask the question why. We have to ask what policies \ncontributed to that decline of the middle class, that increase in \npoverty. We have to ask why we are the only country in the world that \ndoes not have a national health care program guaranteeing health care \nto all people, why we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any \nmajor country on Earth, why we have the greatest gap between the rich \nand everybody else of any major country on Earth.\n  We have to ask those questions, and we need to stand up to powerful \nspecial interests in bringing about the kinds of reforms we need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/S9651-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9651-S9652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to give tribute to \nSenator Edward Kennedy.\n  It is impossible to sum up Senator Ted Kennedy in words or a speech. \nHis life and work touched so many diverse interests and issues. Senator \nKennedy was larger than life. He was a champion for the underdog--those \nin our society who just needed a hand up. For close to five decades, \nSenator Kennedy championed policies for American workers, minorities, \nparents, immigrants, gays and lesbians, people with disabilities and \nillnesses, among others. And I think I can safely say he was the \ngreatest legislator in the history of the Senate.\n  In the words of Senator John McCain during his presidential bid, ``I \nhave described Ted Kennedy as the last lion in the Senate . . . because \nhe remains the single most effective member . . . if you want to get \nresults.''\n  While he was known as a champion for liberal causes, Senator \nKennedy's hallmark was to reach across the aisle, passing legislation \nwith his Republican friends, such as Orrin Hatch and John McCain. He \nnever let partisanship stop him from doing what is right for the \nAmerican people.\n  But his most important role was that of the patriarch of the Kennedy \nfamily a family that faced tragedy that most of us never will \nexperience and can never fathom. Despite the loss of three brothers, \ntaken long before their time, and the loss of a nephew a rising star, \nTed Kennedy rose above the burdens of life and became the rudder of the \nKennedy ship, the driving force of the family a family dedicated to \npublic service. Fortunately for all of us, that dedication has been \npassed on to the next generation and it has influenced families across \nour Nation, including mine.\n  The Kennedy family and my own family first crossed paths decades ago, \nand our family stories continue to be intertwined. My dad, Mo Udall, \nand uncle, Stewart Udall, supported John Kennedy in his race for \nPresident. Ted Kennedy was JFK's man on the ground in the southwest \nstates.\n  In fact, the Udalls have been called the ``Kennedys of the West.'' \nAnd as my Aunt Elma says, ``we are flattered'' by that comparison.\n  In many ways we are as different as they come. Kennedys are the East. \nKennedys are the ocean. Kennedys are Catholic immigrants. Udalls are \nthe West. Udalls are the desert. Udalls are Mormon dirt farmers.\n  But it is true that my family was drawn to the Kennedys' deep \ncommitment to religious freedom and dedication to public service. My \nfamily also shares a commitment to public service. My Uncle Stewart \nserved as President\n\n[[Page S9652]]\n\nKennedy's Secretary of the Interior. And my father ran for and won in a \nspecial election in 1960 Uncle Stewart's congressional seat. Some claim \nthat his race was a referendum on the fledgling Kennedy administration, \nand that his victory was an affirmation of America's support for the \ngoals of his presidency.\n  Whether that is true, it has proved to be a connection that would \nkeep our families close for decades. And what binds the two families \nare the friendships that have been fostered over decades since \nfriendships that cross generations and hopefully will continue into the \nnext.\n  In 1971, my father ran for majority leader of the House of \nRepresentatives and lost. The same year, Senator Kennedy lost his bid \nfor Senate whip. Soon after came a note to my father from Senator \nKennedy which said, ``Mo, as soon as I pull the liberal knives out of \nmy back, I'll help you dig out the liberal buckshot from your \nbackside.''\n  My dad supported Ted Kennedy in his primary bid to become President \nin 1980.\n  He and Ted were friends for many decades, and in many ways, they were \nkindred spirits. They loved the outdoors, national parks, skiing in \nColorado, and family touch football. We all will remember the \nphotographs of Ted on his sailboat with his family his love of the \nocean and boating and sharing it with generations of Kennedy children.\n  A few years after my dad lost his battle with Parkinson's disease, \nSenator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona sponsored legislation to establish \nthe Morris K. Udall Foundation. Senator Kennedy joined in sponsoring \nthe measure. In speaking about my dad, he noted: ``He will rank as one \nof the greatest Members of the House of Representatives of all time, \nand also as one of the most beloved . . . Somehow, for 30 years, \nwhenever you probed to the heart of the great concerns of the day, you \nfound Mo Udall in the thick of the battle, championing the rights of \naverage citizens against special interest pressures, defending the \nhighest ideals of America, and always doing it with the special grace \nand wit that were his trademark and that endeared him to Democrats and \nRepublicans alike.''\n  If my dad were alive today, I think he would use the same words to \ndescribe Senator Kennedy. They both brought people together to do what \nis right for our country.\n  Recently, as I have thought about Senator Kennedy's legacy, I have \nremembered my dad's 1980 speech at the Democratic National Convention. \nAfter a tough primary battle, the Democrats were digging in and \nfighting among themselves. They needed to set aside their differences \nand join together to win the election. My dad rose to give the keynote \naddress to remind Democrats that they were in this fight together. ``We \ndo fight and we kick and yell and scream and maybe even scratch a bit, \nbut we fight because we are a diverse party and because we've always \ntried to listen up to new ideas.''\n  He concluded the speech with these comments: ``This nation that we \nlove will only survive, if each generation of caring Americans can \nblend two elements: change and the ability to adjust things to the \nspecial needs of our times; and second, stability, the good sense to \ncarry forward the old values which are just as good now as they were \n200 years ago.''\n  These elements epitomize Ted Kennedy's legacy. He knew when a person \nor group of people needed a change in their circumstances.\n  His strong Catholic faith was the compass that guided his life. It \nwas the driving force that led him to fight to make a difference in \nother people's lives, particularly those who were less fortunate.\n  Ted Kennedy's legislative successes are numerous and unquestionably \nhave changed lives for the better. He fought to pass the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. In the 1990s, he labored to \npass the Family and Medical Leave Act. And he and Senator Hatch worked \nacross the aisle to pass the Ryan White CARE Act. And it is his \nlifelong battle for universal health care coverage for Americans that \nhe is best known for today.\n  The Kennedy and Udall ideals can live on through the younger \ngeneration. My cousin Tom and I served in the House of Representatives \nwith Patrick Kennedy. Not only were we colleagues, but we are friends. \nWe grew up in political families and from an early age, public service \nwas a way of life. I was a proud supporter of Patrick's crusade to pass \nmental health parity legislation in the House. Fortunately, Senator \nKennedy lived to see his son's work come to fruition, keeping faith \nwith the special Kennedy credo: aid those who need a helping hand.\n  Tom, Patrick and I, as well as the rest of the Kennedy and Udall \nfamily members, have big shoes to fill. Whether we can actually fill \nthem remains to be seen, but we must certainly push the trail blazed by \nour aunts and uncles, fathers and mothers as far as our endurance \nallows.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy surely will be missed not only on the Senate \nfloor, but in our lives. I deeply regret I will not serve with him in \nthe Senate. He was a champion, a fighter, and a friend. I want to say \n``goodbye'' not only for me, but for my dad his friend. And I send my \nthoughts and prayers to Vicki, Patrick, and the rest of the Kennedy \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/S9652-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIMMY MEANS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I congratulate Mr. Jimmy Means \nof Massachusetts for the quality of his service with the Massachusetts \nHighway Department and his contributions to the beautification of the \nCommonwealth.\n  Mr. Means began his career with the department as a toll collector on \nthe Massachusetts Turnpike. And for the past 10 years, he has overseen \nthe department's programs for collecting litter and beautifying the \nroadways in his native Worcester County.\n  This kind of public service is vital, because we know all too well \nthat roadway litter remains a problem despite decades of antilitter \nefforts. Last year, more than 582 tons of litter were collected from \nalong State roadways--an expense in the millions of dollars to \nMassachusetts taxpayers.\n  Massachusetts, like most States, encourages volunteer efforts to keep \nState roads and highways litter-free. At least once a month, from April \n15 to November 15, volunteers ``adopt'' a 2-mile section of highway and \nremove litter.\n  But as important as the volunteers are, the beautification of \nMassachusetts highways depends largely on the work of people like Mr. \nMeans. And in Worcester County, Mr. Means' friends and colleagues \nreport that he in particular has built a reputation for responding \nquickly and efficiently to any highway blights, receiving praise from \nthe local officials and the office of the Governor.\n  I congratulate Mr. Means for his work on behalf of the Commonwealth \nof Massachusetts--work that all of us can take pride in and appreciate \neven more this time of year as tourists flock to New England to view \nour beautiful fall foliage. I applaud his efforts and his dedication in \nkeeping Massachusetts roadways clean and safe--and wish him many more \nyears of contributing to Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/S9652-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 7:23 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3548.

A bill to comprehensively regulate derivatives markets to \nincrease transparency and reduce risks in the financial system; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Comprehensive \nDerivatives Regulation Act of 2009, or the CDRA, which establishes for \nthe first time a comprehensive regulatory framework to prevent \nderivatives trading activities from ever again contributing to \ncatastrophic failures in our financial system. One year ago this month \nour nation found itself on the verge of a total financial meltdown with \ndecades-old financial institutions collapsing overnight and credit \nmarkets freezing up in large part because companies like AIG took huge \nand risky bets selling totally unregulated credit default swaps, bets \nthat backfired when the housing bubble burst.\n  Derivatives are financial contracts that investors use to manage \ntheir risks or grow their portfolios. They are called derivatives \nbecause they derive their value from other things such as the price of \ncorn at a future date, or whether a company fails to make good on its \ndebts. While most derivatives offer companies the ability to better \nmanage their risks, some irresponsible financial firms took huge risks \nin recent years using new, untested, and unregulated derivatives \nproducts. When these firms faltered, it sent shockwaves through our \nfinancial system and landed us in a recession. As a result, today \nfamilies in Rhode Island and throughout the country struggle to keep \ntheir jobs and stay in their homes.\n  I have been working over the past year with my Senate colleagues to \ndevelop a series of critical reforms to the financial sector to ensure \nthat we never face such a perilous situation again. As the Chairman of \nthe Securities, Insurance, and Investment Subcommittee of the Senate \nBanking Committee, I have introduced bills to greatly strengthen \noversight of credit rating agencies and hedge funds, which until now \nhave been subject to relatively little regulation.\n  Introducing the CDRA is another key step in filling the huge \nregulatory gaps in our financial system. This bill would put in place a \ntruly comprehensive framework for regulating all such products. \nDerivatives have been overseen by two market regulators, the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, SEC, which has broad responsibility for \nprotecting investors and ensuring the integrity of securities markets, \nand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, which regulates \ncommodity futures and the exchanges on which those products are traded.\n  In part because of this shared jurisdiction, large segments of the \nderivatives markets, such as credit default swaps, have gone entirely \nunsupervised by either agency. This bill will fill these regulatory \ngaps.\n  First, the bill would require standardized credit default swaps and \nother unregulated derivatives to be traded through a clearinghouse. \nThis would protect the companies and the financial system from the \nrisks posed by these instruments. Importantly, the bill also grants \nregulators the ability to oversee any new derivative product in the \nfuture, so dealers can no longer create products that fall into holes \nin the law.\n  Second, the bill establishes robust capital and margin requirements \nfor derivatives dealers and other major market participants, and \nsubjects them to higher standards for products that are not traded on \nclearinghouses.\n  Third, the bill subjects firms to new conduct requirements to protect \ninvestors from abusive practices in the market. It also includes new \nrecordkeeping and reporting requirements to ensure that regulators and \ninvestors have broad information about derivatives transactions and \npositions throughout the financial sector.\n  Fourth, the bill combats fraud and manipulation in derivatives \nmarkets by giving regulators new authority to set position limits and \noversee the marketing of products to certain investors. The bill \nstrengthens thresholds in place to ensure only sophisticated investors \nare engaging in certain types of trading.\n  Finally, the bill rationalizes the sharing of jurisdiction between \nthe SEC and CFTC, and establishes a process for quickly assigning \nresponsibility for new products so they do not fall through the cracks. \nSpecifically, the bill provides the SEC with jurisdiction over all \nderivatives that are securities or can be used as synthetic substitutes \nfor securities, because without such authority over products that can \naffect securities markets, the SEC cannot accomplish its mission to \nprotect investors and ensure the integrity and fairness of markets. The \nbill provides the CFTC with jurisdiction over all other derivatives. \nThe bill also provides a fast and efficient process for the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to resolve any \ndifferences in views between the agencies that might arise.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in improving the oversight of \ncredit default swaps and other derivatives products by cosponsoring \nthis legislation and supporting its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1691\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in recent years, the over-the-counter derivatives \n     market has grown rapidly, but regulators have lacked key \n     information and adequate authority to address systemic and \n     other risks posed by unregulated derivatives trading;\n       (2) excessive risk taking among market participants, \n     combined with limited regulatory oversight of such products, \n     was a significant cause of the recent financial crisis;\n       (3) lack of transparency in the markets has contributed to \n     market instability and uncertainty, and has resulted in a \n     less efficient marketplace;\n       (4) customized derivative products provide key benefits to \n     certain market participants and should be permitted under \n     comprehensive regulation, but all derivatives activities \n     should be accompanied by appropriate risk management and \n     prudential standards; and\n       (5) the trading of derivatives on regulated exchanges \n     should be encouraged because of the significant associated \n     market efficiencies.\n\n           TITLE I--REGULATION OF SECURITY-BASED DERIVATIVES\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to extend the sunset of certain provisions of the USA \nPATRIOT Act and the authority to issue national security letters, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, security and liberty are both essential in \nour free society. Benjamin Franklin wrote: ``Those who can give up \nessential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither \nliberty nor safety.'' I have been mindful of this since the devastating \nattacks of September 11, and each time we have considered the USA \nPATRIOT Act. The American people of today and those of tomorrow--our \nchildren and grandchildren--depend on us to do our best to ensure both \nsecurity and the preservation of our essential liberties.\n  After September 11, the Government's power to gather information \nabout those suspected of, or connected to, potential terrorists \nincreased. Because such surveillance may, sometimes by mistake, sweep \nin U.S. citizens, we must vigilantly monitor these laws to ensure that \nthey are implemented appropriately. This calls for public, judicial and \ncongressional oversight to make sure we maintain the proper respect for \nsecurity and liberty.\n\n[[Page S9674]]\n\n  After September 11, I introduced the USA PATRIOT Act, Patriot Act, to \ngive the Government the tools needed to defend this country and \naggressively pursue those who would do us harm. Even in those dark \ndays, I insisted on oversight. Working with the then House Majority \nLeader, Republican Dick Armey, we included sunsets for some of the \nprovisions of the bill that had the greatest potential to directly \naffect Americans.\n  We debated the reauthorization of the Patriot Act for several months \nin 2005 and 2006. I again fought to protect the civil liberties and \nconstitutional rights of Americans. Unfortunately, after a series of \nshort extensions, the reauthorization of 2006 lacked sufficient \nconstitutional protections over the vast authorities it granted to the \nGovernment. I had worked to secure increased oversight and to include \nnew sunsets in the bill.\n  With those sunsets expiring on December 31, 2009, we must once again \nconsider the Patriot Act. Three provisions of the Patriot Act are \nslated to expire at the end of this year, including the authorization \nfor roving wiretaps, the ``lone wolf'' measure, and orders for tangible \nthings, commonly referred to as the ``library'' provision.\n  In March, I sent Attorney General Holder a letter requesting the \nadministration's views on these expiring provisions. I reiterated that \nrequest at a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing in June. I \nhave recently received a letter from the Attorney General urging us to \nextend the expiring authorities. I appreciate the President and the \nAttorney General's emphasis on accountability and checks and balances, \nand their willingness to consider additional ideas.\n  Today I am introducing a bill with Senators Cardin and Kaufman that \ndoes just that. It will extend the authorization of the three expiring \nprovisions. The bill also updates checks and balances by increasing \njudicial review of the use of Government powers that capture \ninformation on U.S. citizens, and augments congressional oversight. We \npropose increasing Government accountability through more transparent \npublic reporting of the use of surveillance, and by requiring audits of \nhow these vast authorities have been used since they were last \nreauthorized. In addition, we propose that, given their extensive use \nabuse and intrusiveness, we include a sunset for National Security \nLetters, NSLs. I introduced a bill in 2006, after the most recent \nPatriot Act reauthorization, to impose a sunset on NSLs. This sunset \nprovision, combined with a comprehensive audit by the Inspector \nGeneral, will help to hold the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, \naccountable in its use of this authority.\n  In developing this bill, I worked closely with Senators Feingold and \nDurbin to protect the rights and privacy of Americans, and to expand \noversight. Senators Feingold and Durbin have worked tirelessly over the \nyears to protect the civil liberties of Americans, from the first \ndebate over the Patriot Act in 2001, to the reauthorization in 2006, to \nthe FISA Amendments Act enacted last year. I am pleased that Senators \nCardin, Kaufman and I have adopted some of the concepts they proposed \nin the SAFE Act of 2005, and that were included in the broader Patriot \nAct reauthorization bill they introduced last week, the JUSTICE Act.\n  I have long been concerned over the issuance and oversight of NSLs. \nNational Security Letters are, in effect, a form of administrative \nsubpoena. They do not require approval by a court, grand jury, or \nprosecutor. They are issued in secret, with recipients silenced, under \npenalty of law. Yet NSLs allow the Government to collect sensitive \ninformation, such as personal financial records. As Congress expanded \nthe NSL authority in recent years, I raised concerns about how the FBI \nhandles the information it collects on Americans. I noted that, with no \nreal limits imposed by Congress, the FBI could store this information \nelectronically and use it for large-scale, data-mining operations. We \nnow know that the NSL authority was significantly misused. In 2008 the \nDepartment of Justice Inspector General issued a report on the FBI's \nuse of NSLs revealing serious over-collection of information and abuse \nof the NSL authority.\n  We should reconsider the breadth of the NSL authority. This bill \nwould also impose more judicial oversight and higher standards on the \nissuance of NSLs. It would require the FBI to include a statement of \nfacts articulating why the information it is seeking is relevant to an \nauthorized investigation.\n  The bill also addresses the constitutional deficiency recently \nidentified by the Second Circuit Court of appeals in Doe v. Musasey. \nThe Second Circuit found that the nondisclosure, or ``gag orders,'' \nissued under NSLs are a constitutional infringement. I have long \nmaintained that position. The bill establishes a procedure whereby the \nrecipient of an NSL has 21 days to notify the Government that it wishes \nto challenge the nondisclosure requirement. The Government then has 21 \nadditional days to apply for a court order to compel compliance with \nthe nondisclosure requirement. This scheme corrects the constitutional \ndefects found by the Second Circuit. The bill would shift the burden of \ndefending the need for a gag order to the Government. This bill also \neliminates the NSL nondisclosure provision that allows the Government \nto ensure itself of victory by certifying that, in its view, disclosure \n``may'' endanger national security or ``may'' interfere with diplomatic \nrelations. The bill further strengthens judicial review of \nnondisclosure or ``gag orders'' associated with NSLs by imposing a one-\nyear limitation on such orders. To protect on-going law enforcement \ninvestigations, it permits renewals of the nondisclosure orders in \nappropriate cases.\n  The power of the government to collect records for tangible things \nunder Section 215 of the original Patriot Act, commonly referred to as \nthe ``library records'' provision, is another authority that I worked \nto reform during the last reauthorization. It is time to redefine the \nway we describe this authority to accurately reflect the broad scope of \ninformation it allows the government to collect. Section 215 allows the \nFISA court to secretly require any entity to produce any document or \nother tangible thing with a minimal standard of relevance and a \npresumption in favor of the Government's showing of relevance. This \nbill correctly identifies Section 215 orders as orders for ``tangible \nthings'' as opposed to only for ``business records'' as it is in \ncurrent law.\n  This bill adopts the reasonable constitutional standard that I \nsupported in 2006 for 215 orders. First, it would eliminate the \npresumption in favor of the government's assertion that the records it \nis seeking are relevant to its investigation. This bill would require \nthe Government to make a connection between the records or other things \nit seeks and a suspected terrorist or spy before it is able to obtain \nconfidential records such as library, medical and telephone records. \nSection 215 orders for tangible things permit the Government to collect \nan even broader scope of information than NSLs. For that reason, it is \ncritical that the Government show that the records it seeks are both \nrelevant to an investigation and connected to at least a suspected \nterrorist or spy.\n  This bill would also establish more meaningful judicial review of \nSection 215 orders. First, it repeals the requirement in current law \nthat requires a recipient of a Section 215 nondisclosure order to wait \nfor a full year before challenging that gag order. There is no \njustification for this mandatory waiting period for judicial review, \nand this bill eliminates it. It also repeals a provision added to the \nlaw in 2006 stating that a conclusive presumption in favor of the \nGovernment shall apply where a high level official certifies that \ndisclosure of the order for tangible things would endanger national \nsecurity or interfere with diplomatic relations. These restraints on \nmeaningful judicial review are unfair, unjustified, and completely \nunacceptable. I fought hard to keep these two provisions out of the \n2006 reauthorization, but the Republican majority at that time insisted \nthey be included.\n  This bill will strengthen court oversight of Section 215 orders by \nrequiring court oversight of minimization procedures when information \nconcerning a U.S. person is acquired, retained, or disseminated. \nRequiring FISA Court approval of minimization procedures would simply \nbring Section 215 orders in line with other FISA authorities--such as \nwiretaps, physical searches,\n\n[[Page S9675]]\n\nand pen register and trap and trace devices--that already require FISA \ncourt approval of minimization procedures. This is another common sense \nmodification to the law that was drafted in consultation with Senators \nFeingold and Durbin. If we are to allow personal information to be \ncollected in secret, the court must be more involved in making sure the \nauthorities are used responsibly and that Americans' information and \npersonal privacy are protected.\n  Finally, this bill addresses concerns over the use of pen register or \ntrap and trace devices ``pen/trap''. The bill raises the standard for \npen/trap in the same manner as it raises the standard for Section 215 \norders. The Government would be required to show that the information \nit seeks is both relevant to an investigation and connected to a \nsuspected terrorist or spy. This section also requires court review of \nminimization procedures, which are not required under current law, and \nadds an Inspector General audit of the use of pen/trap that is modeled \non the the audits of Section 215 orders and NSLs.\n  I look forward to working with the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Senate, the House and with the administration as this \nbill moves forward, and I welcome the views of others.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1692\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to allow the funding for the interoperable emergency \ncommunications grant program established under the Digital Television \nTransition and Public Safety Act of 2005 to remain available until \nexpended through fiscal year 2012, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help improve public safety communications.\n  September is a month when we remember. We remember that 8 years ago \nwe witnessed the impossible horror of September 11th. We remember that \n4 years ago we watched the watery devastation of Hurricane Katrina. We \nremember because even with the passage of time, these are wounds that \ndo not heal and losses we will never forget.\n  These events also demonstrated the tremendous bravery of our public \nsafety officials. Their courage awes and inspires. So when tragedy \nstrikes, we want to make sure that those who wear the shield have the \ncommunications systems they need to do the job. We know now that public \nsafety communications can mean the difference between security and \nharm.\n  Yet when it comes to public safety communications, we still have a \nlot of work to do. Four years ago, Congress took an important first \nstep. In the Digital Television and Public Safety Act of 2005, Congress \nauthorized the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration, in consultation with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, to implement the Public Safety Interoperable Communications \nGrant Program. This program provided a one-time, formula-based, \nmatching grant opportunity for public safety agencies to improve \ninteroperable communications systems.\n  Governors across the country lined up to designate State agencies to \napply for and administer these funds. Under the program, funds were \noriginally available for the purchase and deployment of communications \nequipment and training for system users. Later, in the Implementing \nRecommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, Congress expanded \nthe program to include planning and coordination activities.\n  But now millions of these dollars are at risk. The September 30, \n2010, deadline for expending funds that is a holdover from the original \nlegislation could inadvertently jeopardize the effectiveness of public \nsafety communications projects in States across the country. Many \ngrantees spent the first year of the grant period developing required \nplans and justifications and then awaiting approvals from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration. As a result, many grantees did not have the \nfull 3-year award period to acquire and deploy interoperable \ncommunications equipment. They face the real possibility of reaching \nthe September 30, 2010, deadline with communications projects \nincomplete. In short, it is no longer sensible to bind the States to \nthis original deadline in 2010.\n  There is no need to take my word for it. The Inspector General at the \nDepartment of Commerce reached exactly the same conclusion. In a report \npublished in March 2009, the Inspector General found that grantees were \nunlikely to finish their communications projects within the statutory \ntime frames. The Inspector General even recommended that the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration work with Congress to \nextend the deadline for grantees to expend their communications funds \nfrom this program. Now the National Governors Association and the \nAssociation of Public Safety Communications Officials also have chimed \nin to support an extension.\n  I rise today so we can do something about it. By extending the \nSeptember 30, 2010, deadline by one year and on a case-by-case basis \ntwo years, we can make sure that the funds are used exactly as Congress \nintended. We can make sure that public safety projects are not stranded \ndue to arbitrary deadlines. We can make sure that our first responders \nhave the first class communications systems they desperately need and \ndeserve. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator \nHutchison and support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1694\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PUBLIC SAFETY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding section 3006(a)(2) of the Digital \n     Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 (47U.S.C. \n     309 note), sums made available to administer the Public \n     Safety Interoperable Communications Grant Program under \n     section 309(j)(8)(E) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 309(j)(8)(E)) shall remain available until expended, \n     but not beyond September 30, 2012.\n       (b) The period for performance of any investment approved \n     under the Program as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     shall be extended by one year, but not later than September \n     30, 2011, except that the Assistant\n\n[[Page S9681]]\n\n     Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information may \n     extend, on a case-by-case basis, the period of performance \n     for any investment approved under the Program as of that date \n     for a period of not more than 2 years, but not later than \n     September 30, 2012. In making a determination as to whether \n     an extension beyond September 30, 2011, is warranted, the \n     Assistant Secretary should consider the circumstances that \n     gave rise to the need for the extension, the likelihood of \n     completion of performance within the deadline for completion, \n     and such other factors as the Assistant Secretary deems \n     necessary to make the determination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/S9681-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 279--MAKING MINORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS FOR CERTAIN \n                   COMMITTEES FOR THE 111TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I seek recognition to note the 10th \nanniversary of Temple University's China Rule of Law Program. The \nBeasley School of Law housed at Temple University stands as an \noutstanding leader in promoting cross-cultural partnership between \nlegal professionals in the United States and China. This year, the \nBeasley School celebrates ten years of cooperation with Tsinghua \nUniversity in Beijing. Temple University's China Rule-of-Law Program \nhas awarded nearly 400 Master of Laws degrees to Chinese legal \nprofessionals to date. The first foreign law degree program to be \napproved by the Chinese Ministry of Education as well as the American \nBar Association, Temple's Rule of Law Program represents a landmark \nprogram and step toward increased global understanding of legal \nprocedure by educating Chinese legal professionals in the same manners \nand by the same standards as those practiced at American law schools. I \nrespectfully submit this resolution to recognize Temple University's \noutstanding leadership in promoting cross-cultural exchange in the \nfield of international law.\n  The partnership between Temple University and China's Tsinghua \nUniversity predates the establishment in 1999 of the Master of Laws \nDegree program. Shortly after the official reestablishment of \ndiplomatic relations between the United States and China in January of \n1979, Temple University awarded Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping with an \nhonorary law degree. Educational and cultural exchange became the \ncenterpieces of renewed cooperation between the two powers over the \ncourse of the last three decades. Shortly after President Clinton and \nPresident Zemin's mutual call for collaboration in legal exchange in \n1997, Temple formally created the China Rule-of-Law Program that merits \ncommendation today.\n  Cooperating to meet the demands of a global environment in which \nlegal professionals are increasingly required to be trained in \ninternational legal standards, American faculty from Temple, Chinese \nfaculty at Tsinghua University, and highly accomplished international \npractitioners teach courses entirely in English at Tsinghua's \nfacilities in Beijing. The 30 credit curriculum concentrates on \nAmerican and international law and in particular focuses on the \nsubfields of criminal and business law. The program requires the same \nstandards of scholarship of its Chinese students that ABA accredited \nAmerican law institutions require at home and requires a full-time \nstudent to devote 15 months to complete the program. Students earning \ntheir degrees through Temple's Beasley-Tsinghua program participate in \nthe same dialogue-based methods as students in American classrooms; \nthey are also given access to the Lexis and Westlaw legal research \ntools during their studies. This means that Chinese students receiving \nthe Master of Laws degree from Temple's Beasley Law School at Tsinguah \nbecome familiar with the same processes for solving legal puzzles and \nconducting legal research as those that mark the standard within \ninternational circles. Therefore, as a capacity building tool for \nChinese professionals within the international legal environment, \nTemple's China Rule-of-Law program is indispensible.\n  As a means of promoting bilateral understanding over legal norms and \nstandards, this type of program is even more vital. Legal norms and \nstandards, we must remember, are formed and interpreted within social, \ncultural, and historical contexts. The continued growth of a strong \npartnership between our two nations is contingent upon a full \nunderstanding of this contextual environment because it serves as the \nsetting in which legal standards are shaped and in which they are \napplied. In today's international climate, this cooperation is more \nimportant than ever before, and Temple should be regarded as an \nexemplar for its leadership in cultivating such cooperation.\n  The study abroad component of this program, which brings these \nChinese\n\n[[Page S9682]]\n\nstudents to Temple's Philadelphia campus during the summer after the \nfirst full year of study, is an important means of achieving this \ncontextual understanding. However, this is just one way in which this \nlandmark program facilitates the integration of Chinese legal \nprofessionals into the international legal realm outside of the \nclassroom. An extensive alumni network includes, as previously noted, \nnearly 400 degree holders, many of whom are involved with the Temple \nLaw Alumni Association of China, which boasts around 550 members. The \nRule of Law program has educated over 900 legal professionals through \nless formal means, including roundtables that have explored topics \nranging from the subfields of Internet and Environmental Law to NGO \nAdvocacy and the WTO. The partnership is currently working with the \nState Administration of Foreign Expert Affairs of China to host a \nseries of events targeted to broadening this exchange in Beijing in the \ncoming months as a celebration of ten successful years, marking an \nemphasis on continued growth and success.\n  As our two nations look for additional means of improving and \npromoting bilateral exchange, Temple University's innovative \nprogramming efforts must be celebrated and should be seen as a paradigm \nfor future partnerships. Its increasing alumni network--both of degree \nholders and of other professionals that have benefitted from the Rule \nof Law's various programs--must be looked upon as a growing web of \nfuture leaders that understand the international legal context upon \nwhich international stability, economic development, and global \ncooperation rely. I urge the Senate to recognize Temple University's \ncontribution to American and Chinese bilateral relations and in setting \na high standard for improved and constructive international dialogue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/S9682-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 40--ENCOURAGING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN TO \n   GRANT CONSULAR ACCESS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF SWITZERLAND TO JOSHUA \nFATTAL, SHANE BAUER, AND SARAH SHOURD, AND TO ALLOW THE 3 YOUNG PEOPLE \nTO REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Ms. \nKlobuchar, Mr. Franken, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 40\n\n       Whereas, on July 31, 2009, officials of the Government of \n     Iran took 3 United States citizens, Joshua Fattal, Shane \n     Bauer, and Sarah Shourd, into custody near the Ahmed Awa \n     region of northern Iraq, after the 3 United States citizens \n     reportedly crossed into the territory of Iran while hiking in \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas officials of the Government of Iran have confirmed \n     that they are holding the 3 United States citizens; and\n       Whereas officials of the Government of Iran have not \n     allowed consular access by the Embassy of the Government of \n     Switzerland (in its formal capacity as the representative of \n     the interests of the United States in Iran) to the 3 young \n     United States citizens in accordance with the Vienna \n     Convention on Consular Relations, done at Vienna April 24, \n     1963: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) encourages the Government of Iran to grant consular \n     access by the Government of Switzerland to Joshua Fattal, \n     Shane Bauer, and Sarah Shourd, and to allow the 3 young \n     people to communicate by telephone with their families in the \n     United States; and\n       (2) encourages the Government of Iran to allow Joshua \n     Fattal, Shane Bauer, and Sarah Shourd to reunite with their \n     families in the United States as soon as possible.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to discuss legislation \nI have introduced encouraging the Government of Iran to grant consular \naccess to and promptly release three young Americans who have been \ndetained in Iran for the past 8 weeks after they reportedly crossed \ninto Iran while on a hike in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n  On July 31, 2009, University of California, Berkeley graduates Joshua \nFattal, 27, Shane Bauer, 27, and Sarah Shourd, 30, went ``on a hike \nnear the border of Iraqi Kursdistan and Iran in an area known for \nbeautiful views and a waterfall, along an unmarked section of the \nborder that zigzags.'' The three inadvertently crossed into Iranian \nterritory and were detained by Iranian officials.\n  While the Government of Iran has confirmed it is holding Joshua, \nShane and Sarah, it has yet to grant the Embassy of the Government of \nSwitzerland, in its formal capacity as the representative of the \ninterests of the United States in Iran, consular access to the three in \naccordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Nor has \nthe Government of Iran allowed Joshua, Shane and Sarah to telephone \ntheir families in the United States to let them know they are well.\n  Based on news accounts I have read, I have every confidence that the \nthree entered Iranian territory accidentally, perhaps due to, as I \nunderstand it, the absence of clear border markers in the region near \nAhmed Awa. On August 8, an Iraqi government official was quoted as \nsaying the three young Americans crossed the border ``unintentionally \nand mistakenly.''\n  The legislation which I have introduced encourages the Government of \nIran to: Grant consular access by the Embassy of the Government of \nSwitzerland to the three United States citizens in accordance with the \nVienna Convention on Consular Relations; Allow Joshua, Shane and Sarah \nto communicate by telephone with their families in the U.S.; and Allow \nJoshua, Shane and Sarah to reunite with their families in the U.S. at \nthe soonest possible opportunity.\n  It is clear to me that Joshua, Shane and Sarah made a careless \nnavigational mistake which they will not soon repeat. It is my sincere \nhope that the Government of Iran quickly comes to this conclusion and \nreleases them so they can be reunited with their families in the U.S. \nat the earliest opportunity, as all have anguished too much already.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/22/senate-section/article/S9682-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9682-S9683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2470.
