Mr. President, the next few weeks will tell us a lot about \nwhether Senators are more committed to solving problems or creating \nthem. We have before us a historic occasion. That is where we are--a \ntime in history where we have never been before--with the chance to \nensure the well-being of both our fellow citizens and our recovering \neconomy. We have before us the opportunity to relieve the suffering of \nmany and prevent even worse pain in the future.\n  But if we are to seize this opportunity, this debate must be on \nfacts, not fear. We must remain focused on how we can best help the \nAmerican people and the American economy, and we must avoid the \ntemptation to drown in distractions and distortions. In other words, we \nmust do our jobs.\n  Last week, my counterpart--the distinguished Republican leader, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S11980]]\n\nMcConnell--called the health care crisis manufactured. The American \npeople would beg to differ. I have said on this floor before, on \nseveral occasions, that last year 750,000 people filed for bankruptcy. \nThat is true. I said previously that half the people who filed \nbankruptcy filed because of medical expenses. But we have learned of a \nreport that came out last week which states that number is too small; \nthat, realistically, it is about 70 percent of the people who file for \nbankruptcy file because of health care costs.\n  I have also said on this floor that half the people who filed for \nbankruptcy because of medical expenses did so even though they had \ninsurance. We learned last week that number is also too small; that it \nis 62 percent. That means 62 percent of the people who filed for \nbankruptcy because of medical expenses were already insured. Is that a \ncrisis in America--750,000 people filing for bankruptcy and about 70 \npercent of them filing because of health care costs, with 62 percent of \nthose who filed for bankruptcy because of health care costs having \nhealth insurance? What a sad commentary on the present state of the \nhealth care delivery system in our country.\n  This weekend the assistant Republican leader said we should go back \nto square one. In fact, his exact quote was: ``There is no way to fix \nthis bill.'' That is what we do. We are legislators. I have been in \nCongress a long time. I have been fortunate to get things passed and \nnever, ever have I gotten the legislation I wrote passed the way it was \nwritten. With rare exception that happens.\n  I would say to my friend, the junior Senator from Arizona, that \nRepublicans have had a seat at the table from the very beginning of the \nhealth care debate. An example of that was in the HELP Committee, where \n161 of the amendments Republicans offered in that committee were made a \npart of the bill that was reported out of that committee. So when you \nhear someone say there is no way to fix this bill, you have to look at \nthe underlying statements this gentleman has made in the past: \nBasically, there is no problem with health care; things the way they \nare, are just fine; the fact that 750,000 people filed for bankruptcy \nlast year, 70 percent because of health care costs, not important.\n  That is exactly what the legislative process is all about--changing \nthings, working on things, trying to improve them, taking out things \nyou don't like, debating, amending, and improving. Democrats stand \nready to do so. I hope my Republican colleagues recognize that, even if \nthe party leaders deny it.\n  As we round the latest turn along this journey, I renew my plea to \nthis body--to Senators, Democrats, and Republicans: Let us discuss the \nspecifics of this bill, not the whispers and wild rumors. While we \ndisagree at times, let us at least agree that doing nothing is not an \noption. While each of us may not say yes to each word of this bill as \nit currently reads, let us at least agree that simply saying no isn't \nenough.\n  We will do this work transparently, and we will do this work \ntirelessly. That may mean debating and voting late at night. It \ndefinitely means, I say to everyone within the sound of my voice, the \nnext weekends--plural--we will be working. I have events this weekend \nthat I will have to postpone; some will have to cancel. That is the way \nit will have to be with everyone. There is not an issue more important \nthan finishing this legislation.\n  I know people have things they want to do back in their States and \nrightfully so. I know people have fundraisers because they are running \nfor reelection. I know there are other important things they have to \ndo. But nothing could be more important than this. We notified \neverybody prior to the break we would be working weekends. Our \ncloakroom did so by e-mails. We have transmitted this message time and \ntime again. So we are going to have to work Saturdays and Sundays.\n  This crisis--and, yes, it is a real crisis--is simply too hazardous \nto our country and to its health not to work as much and as long as we \nhave to. This is a good bill we have before us. It saves lives, saves \nmoney, and saves Medicare.\n  The evidence about this continues to pour in. Just a few days ago an \nMIT economist--one of the Nation's foremost economists--a man by the \nname of Jonathan Gruber, analyzed our bill and concluded it will help \nAmericans pay less and get more. He found that while the cost of \nprivate insurance continues to rise at extremely rapid rates, those who \nuse the new health care insurance changes we propose will save \nhundreds, and in some cases thousands, of dollars per year per person.\n  I am gratified we have already taken health insurance reform further \nthan at any point in American history, but I am not satisfied and will \nnot rest until we finish the job. Health care fairness will come if we \ndedicate the coming weeks to solutions, not scare tactics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/30/senate-section/article/S11980-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to reiterate the point the \nmajority leader made--that he is anticipating us being in on the \nweekends--and to underscore why that seems to be necessary, which is \nbecause the majority is intent on passing this health care bill that \nthe American people oppose. We know that from all of the surveys.\n  In addition to that, there are a number of things that actually must \nbe done this month: We have a debt ceiling expiring, or needing to be \nexpanded, according to the administration; we have not passed \nappropriations bills; there are tax extenders that expire at the end of \nthe year; there are PATRIOT Act provisions that expire at the end of \nthe year. There are many things we must do this month. Yet we are going \nto spend an enormous amount of time working on a bill the American \npeople wish we would not pass this month.\n  Let me, first, welcome everybody back--Senators and staff--after \nwhat, hopefully, was a restful and happy Thanksgiving. I actually \nworked Monday and Tuesday of last week, and I had a chance to spend a \ngood deal of time out in my State of Kentucky with a number of folks. I \nmust tell you nobody was shy about telling me what they thought about \nthe health care bill. Nobody was shy about it. They had obviously been \npaying a lot of attention to it. Many had focused on the vote to \nproceed to this 2,074-page bill, Saturday a week ago. Many people have \nan opinion. So far, not a single, solitary Kentuckian did I run into--\nadmittedly, this is anecdotal--but not a single, solitary one said \nanything other than you have to stop that health care bill. I assured \nthem we were going to do the very best we could to either dramatically \nchange it by amendment or, hopefully, on a bipartisan basis, keep this \n2,074-page bill from passing.\n  A lot of people I met had that kind of observation. I expect it is \npretty similar across the country. Kentuckians want to know how \nspending trillions of dollars we don't have on a plan that raises \nhealth insurance premiums and taxes on families and small businesses is \ngood for health care or for jobs or for the economy, for that matter. \nThe fact is, Americans feel like they have been taken for a ride in \nthis debate, and they are beginning to realize what administration \nofficials meant when they said a crisis was a terrible thing to waste. \nEarly this year, they said: A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.\n  The notion that we would even consider spending trillions of dollars \nwe don't have in a way the majority of Americans don't even want is \nproof this health care bill is completely and totally out of touch with \nthe American people. It is now perfectly clear what happened. The \nadministration and its allies in Congress have wanted to push \ngovernment-run health care for many years, and they view the economic \ncrisis we are in as their moment to do it. So they sold their plan as \nan antidote to the recession, even though their plan would only make \nthings worse. But now Americans are beginning to see the truth behind \nthe rhetoric. No one believes--no one--that trillions in spending, \ntaxes, and debt will do anything but kill jobs and darken the economic \nprospects of struggling Americans and their children.\n  The administration's health care plan will not alleviate the \nsituation we are in. Instead, it would punish struggling Americans at a \nmoment when all they want is a little help.\n\n[[Page S11981]]\n\n  Proponents of this bill couch their efforts with the refrain that \nhistory is calling. I think they have got it half right. Someone's \ncalling all right, but it is not history. It is the American worker. He \nis wondering where the jobs are. It is the middle-class family \nwondering how Congress could try to pass a scheme that won't do \nanything to control costs. It is one of the roughly 40 million seniors \nwondering when Medicare became a piggy bank to fund more government and \nhigher premiums.\n  I have enumerated the specifics about the Medicare cuts in this bill \nbefore: nearly $135 billion in cuts to hospitals, $120 billion in cuts \nto Medicare Advantage, nearly $15 billion in cuts to nursing homes, \nmore than $40 billion from home health agencies, early $8 billion from \nhospices--hospices. Nearly one-half trillion dollars in cuts: this is \nwhat some have audaciously started referring to as ``Saving Medicare.'' \nI don't know what's more preposterous: saying that this plan ``saves \nMedicare,'' or thinking that people will actually believe you.\n  Arthur Diersing gets it. He is a constituent of mine from Versailles, \nKY. Here's what he had to say about this plan. He wrote:\n\n       I . . . agree that there are some things in the health care \n     system that need to be fixed or improved. But let's work on \n     the most important 5-6 issues rather than turn the whole \n     system upside down, and run up the cost for all of us and \n     take away from us seniors.\n\n  Mr. Diersing knows what he is talking about. He knows this bill \ndoesn't reflect the views of the American people. Americans have been \nasking us to cut costs, not raise them. They want the kinds of step-by-\nstep reforms that would actually make a difference, without bankrupting \nthe country and without further expanding the role of the government in \ntheir lives. Americans don't want this bill to pass. Instead, they want \nus to earn their trust with the kind of commonsense reforms Republicans \nhave been talking about all year and which our friends have brushed \naside.\n  Americans want us to end junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals \nthat drive up costs. And yet there is not a serious word about doing so \nin the 2,074 pages of the Democrat bill. Americans want us to encourage \nhealthy choices like prevention and wellness programs. And yet Democrat \nleaders couldn't come up with a serious word about these kinds of \nreforms in 2,074 pages.\n  Americans want us to lower costs by letting consumers buy coverage \nacross State lines. They want us to let small businesses band together \nto negotiate lower insurance rates. And yet Democrats have ignored both \nof these ideas, despite having 2,074 pages to include such ideas.\n  Americans also want us to address the rampant waste, fraud, and abuse \nin the current system before we create an entirely new government \nprogram. And yet Democrats don't seriously confront this problem in \ntheir 2,074 page monument to more government, more taxes, more \nspending, and more debt.\n  Americans are fed up with big-government solutions that drive up \ntaxes and debt and which only seem to create more problems, more abuse, \nand more fraud.\n  In the face of this, our friends on the other side of the aisle \nappear determined to plow ahead with their plans. They don't seem to \ncare that Americans are telling them to stop and start over and fix the \nproblem, which is health care costs.\n  Democrat leaders may think they hear history calling. But the sounds \nthey should be hearing are the voices and the concerns of ordinary \nAmericans. The American people will be heard in this debate, I assure \nyou. In a democracy, public opinion should not be and never is \nirrelevant.\n  At the beginning of the health care debate, we were told this $1 \ntrillion experiment would actually lower premiums for American \nfamilies. Yet just this morning, this very morning, the independent \nCongressional Budget Office provided an analysis showing that the \nDemocratic bill will actually increase premiums for American families. \nThat is the CBO this morning. It indicated this will actually increase \npremiums for American families. So a bill that is being sold as a way \nto reduce costs actually drives them up.\n  The bottom line is this: After 2,074 pages and trillions more in \ngovernment spending, massive new taxes and one-half trillion dollar \ncuts in Medicare, most people, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice--most people--will see their insurance premiums go up. This is \nnot what the American people are asking for, and it certainly is not \nreform.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/30/senate-section/article/S11981-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, when we start the debate on the \nhealth bill, I will be exceptionally eager to take the floor and to \naddress some of the points the Republican leader has just addressed.\n  Most of us went home. As the minority leader said, most of us heard \nfrom our constituents who were not bashful about expressing their \nopinions. It is interesting that a lot of those opinions I heard were \nfrom the people who are just reeling in agony because they are in the \nmiddle of some medical procedure such as chemotherapy and suddenly they \nget a notice from their insurance company that they are canceled or \nthey are desperate to get health insurance coverage and have been \nterminated from their job where they had it, and then an insurance \ncompany tells them they will will not insure them because they have a \npreexisting condition.\n  I do not believe there is anybody in America who is satisfied with \nthe way the overall health care and health insurance industry delivery \nsystem is giving us our health care. Whenever it is said this bill that \nis before the Senate now is going to increase the cost, let's remember \nour costs are already increased by the people who do not have insurance \nwho end up at the most expensive place, which is the emergency room, \nsince they have not had any preventive care when they are in an \nemergency. All of the rest of us pay for it. On average that is $900 to \n$1,000 that is tacked on to our insurance policies we are paying as a \nhidden tax to pay for all those whom, if brought into the health \ninsurance system, we would not be paying for.\n  I will save the rest of my remarks until we get on the health bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/30/senate-section/article/S11981-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11981-S11982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to take this time to \ntalk about this terrible economic recession. To those people, by the \nway, who do not have a job, it is not a recession, it is a depression. \nThe times are difficult economically all over this country but \nespecially in my State of Florida which has an unemployment rate that \nis well above the national average, and there are pockets in Florida \nwhere the unemployment rate is exceptionally soaring, such as southwest \nFlorida. It is this continued economic devastation from home \nforeclosures, business closings, and high unemployment rates that is \nthreatening the prosperity of the country and particularly States such \nas mine, Florida.\n  For example, in southwest Florida, we learned last week that another \nlocal bank had been shut down by Federal regulators. It is the sixth \nbank failure to hit that region this year. On the housing front, \nnumbers were released that indicate Fort Myers still has a long way to \ngo to climb out of the housing mess. While the positive news was that \nforeclosures had declined 20 percent from September to October, the \narea still ranks fifth in the country in foreclosures.\n  We need to continue the steps to get the housing market back on its \nfeet. One of those steps we did included the $8,000 tax credit for \nfirst-time home buyers. That goes through next spring. Most recently, \nwe took one step further when we passed a $6,500 tax credit for \nexisting homeowners who sell their\n\n[[Page S11982]]\n\nhome and want to buy another. That has spurred home sales.\n  We need to stabilize the prices, which remains the top priority. We \nalso need to keep the pressure on the banks, the lenders, to work with \nfolks who are losing their homes.\n  Many places across the Nation, and specifically Florida, are \nresponding to the crisis by adopting mandatory mediation as an \nalternative to foreclosures, thereby forcing banks to modify mortgages \nand avoid a foreclosure altogether.\n  A great success story is a program in Philadelphia where borrowers \ncan keep their homes in a program that is being looked upon as a model \nfor the rest of the Nation. Under a plan put in place by the city's \ncivil court, no property can be foreclosed in that court and sold by \nthe sheriff until the mortgage company sits down with the homeowner to \ntry to find a solution.\n  Unlike the administration's effort to stem foreclosures, which relies \non giving incentives to mortgage companies to encourage them to work \nwith homeowners--a program that has not worked as the Obama \nadministration has intended--the Philadelphia program, in contrast, is \nnot a voluntary program. Mortgage companies are forced to participate. \nWhile that Philadelphia program will not result in every troubled \nhomeowner getting the outcome they are looking for, making those \nlenders come to the table is a step in the right direction. But if we \nare going to bring back health to our banking and financial system, we \nare going to have to fix the problems that are driving our community \nand regional banks to insolvency. The crisis in residential and \ncommercial real estate values, home foreclosures, and nonperforming \ncommercial real estate loans is wiping out those regional and local \nbank balance sheets.\n  In response, those regional banks are desperately hanging on to their \ndeposits and other assets. I wish I didn't have to say this, but the \nObama administration, particularly Secretary Geithner, has not done a \ngood job in leading our banking system and real estate markets to \nrecover. Their response to the collapse in residential real estate was \na tepid loan modification program which in most cases kicked the can \ndown the road for the few underwater homeowners who were fortunate \nenough to qualify. Their response to the crisis in commercial real \nestate has been absent altogether. The consequence is that the \ncommercial real estate market is on the verge of its own collapse as \ncreditors are reluctant to refinance commercial projects.\n  Half way through the year, Florida banks had over $5 billion of \ncommercial real estate loans in default. Commercial real estate makes \nup over one-third of the assets of Florida banks. These growing \nliabilities are putting the brakes on bank lending in Florida, and they \nare hurting creditworthy small businesses and prospective home buyers. \nIt is a vicious downward spiral that is not easily broken. One thing is \nclear: The Troubled Asset Relief Program has not been the answer.\n  When then-Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson, the former head of \nGoldman Sachs, first proposed TARP, there were a number of us on this \nfloor who opposed and voted against it. I thought it was massive and a \nwasteful bailout of the Wall Street banks with zero accountability and \nno meaningful reform. What have we found out about it? Of the $700 \nbillion that Congress appropriated for TARP, over $220 billion has yet \nto be loaned out and only some $70 billion has been repaid. I believe \nwe should end the program once and for all and return those funds to \nthe U.S. Treasury to prevent us from falling deeper into fiscal debt \nand a fiscal black hole. Bringing the deficit under control would then \nhelp stabilize interest rates. It would hold borrowing costs down, and \nit would reduce the growing debt burden on future generations. That \nstill leaves roughly $400 billion of TARP funds outstanding.\n  Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo need to repay the TARP \nfunds that have propped them up for more than a year. They need to \nstand on their own feet. Banks such as Goldman Sachs that have repaid \ntheir TARP funds still owe a tremendous debt to American taxpayers. \nGoldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and a slew of other banks all profited \nfrom the dollar-for-dollar taxpayer bailout of AIG's credit default \nswaps, those insurance policies. Under that AIG bailout, the most \noutrageous of all the bailouts, $70 billion of American taxpayer funds \nwas put at risk to ensure that speculators in credit default swaps were \nfully protected. The head of Goldman Sachs recently apologized for his \nfirm's reckless behavior and pledged to commit $500 million for small \nbusiness lending. That sounds like a serious commitment, until we \nconsider that Goldman Sachs has set aside $17 billion for year-end \nbonuses. So while Main Street is tightening its belt and preparing for \na lean holiday season, Wall Street is still living high on the hog. \nThat must change.\n  As banks repay their TARP loans, we need to consider how we use those \nfunds, how we reform the financial sector. To get us back on track, we \nwill have to be creative and find new solutions to ensure that \nbusinesses have access to the capital they need to grow, prosper, and \nhire new workers.\n  I have a few suggestions. First, we need to scrap the trickle-down \nTARP model and start working from the bottom up. We need to focus on \naccess to capital for small businesses and ways to shore up residential \nand commercial real estate values. TARP has focused far too much on the \nlargest Wall Street banks at the expense of community and regional \nbanks, the backbone of finance in Florida. We need to increase Federal \nsupport and assistance to community banks and credit unions.\n  Second, we need to look at other ways to improve access to capital \nsuch as promoting direct lending by the Small Business Administration.\n  Third, we need a flexible approach to dealing with underwater \nhomeowners, those whose value is now less than the value of their \nmortgage, which is so typical in the State of Florida. A flexible \napproach would be like the one in Philadelphia which is undertaking to \nrequire mediation and loan modifications.\n  These are a few suggestions I have in this very tough economic time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the health care \nlegislation because in a few minutes the official debate in the Senate \nwill commence. The American people will have before them the full \npanoply of arguments both for and against the legislation. They will \nmake their judgment about whether we are in fact carrying out their \nwill.\n  According to public opinion surveys, the will of the American people \nis that this bill should not pass. According to a relatively new \nRasmussen poll, by an 18-point margin, Americans say this bill should \nnot pass. By 56 to 38, they oppose it. In terms of people in the \nmiddle, the independents or other voters not identified with either \npolitical party, the percentage of people who oppose the legislation is \neven greater. More than 3 to 1, Independents oppose this legislation. \nThe majority believes it will both increase their costs and decrease \nthe quality of health care. It is for these reasons that I indicated \nbefore--and I will say it again--I don't think this bill can be fixed. \nIn fact, I don't think the majority will allow it to be fixed. That is \nwhy, along with my Republican colleagues, I believe we should start \nover and attack the problems that face our country in a more realistic \nway, in a step-by-step approach, first to win back the confidence of \nthe people and then to provide elements of relief to each of the \nproblems we face, rather than trying to tackle the entire health care \nsystem, the government programs, the private programs, the insurance, \nthe physicians, the hospitals, trying to do it all in one giant bill \nthat results in massive government takeover, over $1 trillion--in fact, \n$2.5 trillion--in expenditures, massive new debt, more taxes, higher \ninsurance premiums, all of which will result in, ultimately, the \nrationing of health care which is, to me, the most dangerous part of \nthis entire exercise.\n  Somehow or other, we could probably pay the expense of this. Somehow \nor\n\n[[Page S11983]]\n\nother we will survive. But we won't survive the life-and-death \ndecisions that are made every day by patients, doctors, and families, \nif the government begins intruding between the patient and the \nphysician, begins making decisions about what kind of health care we \ncan have, what kind of health care the government will allow payment \nfor and the like. Those become life-and-death decisions. That is why \nAmericans feel so strongly and personally about this debate and about \nthe decisions we are about to be making here.\n  Let me address something the distinguished majority leader said a \nmoment ago, and then I wish to talk a bit about Medicare as one of the \naspects of this insurance debate.\n  The majority leader said that Republicans have had a seat at the \ntable. I am on one of the two major committees, the Finance Committee. \nI think one amendment was adopted. It was an amendment offered by a \nRepublican and a Democrat on the committee. There were well over 100 \namendments that Republicans offered that were all shot down, defeated, \nlargely on party-line votes. I say to my distinguished friend from \nNevada that maybe we have a seat at the table but it is a little like \nthe kids table at Thanksgiving dinner where you are told to mind your \nmanners and keep the noise down. That is the way Republicans feel about \nour role at the table in fashioning this legislation.\n  The majority leader himself would acknowledge that after the two \ncommittees in the Senate acted, he went behind the closed doors of his \noffice and, along with representatives from the White House and a \ncouple of other Democratic Senators, no Republicans at all, legislation \nwas developed in his office that he then presented here on the Senate \nfloor just before the Thanksgiving recess. That is how the legislation \ngot developed. It was without Republican participation.\n\n  We will have a chance to amend this bill. Maybe he will prove me \nwrong. Maybe he will demonstrate that we can fix this bill.\n  I do, with all deference, disagree with his comment that the \nmotivation of Republicans is to do nothing. Of course, he frequently \nsays doing nothing is not an option. Nobody is arguing about doing \nnothing. Republicans have presented some very good ideas to do \nsomething, to do a lot of somethings. Our ideas have been rejected. \nLet's don't get into false debate about doing something or nothing and \nthe only alternative is the bill that is on the Senate floor. There are \nalternatives, and I will discuss one group of alternatives we have \npresented in a moment.\n  There will be a good test to see whether in fact we can amend this \nbill or if my prediction that there is no way to fix it will turn out \nto be true. That has to do, first and foremost, with what this bill \ndoes to Medicare, the program we have developed for seniors. Let me go \nover some of the Medicare cuts in this bill and then ask my Democratic \ncolleagues if they are willing to join Republicans in restoring these \nprovisions of Medicare--in other words, in striking these cuts--if they \nare willing to join Republicans in that effort. Then maybe the majority \nleader is right. Maybe we can fix this bill. If they are not willing to \ndo that, then I resubmit that this bill can't be fixed, and it can't \nbecause our Democratic friends won't allow it to be fixed.\n  Here are the ways this bill cuts Medicare benefits for seniors: \n$137.5 billion is cut from hospitals that treat seniors; $120 billion \nis cut from Medicare Advantage. I will return to Medicare Advantage in \na moment. That is the private insurance company that somewhere around a \nquarter to a third of seniors take advantage of. Well over a third of \nthe seniors in Arizona, approaching 40 percent of Arizona seniors, \nparticipate in the Medicare Program, the benefits of which are \nsubstantially cut. Continuing, $14.6 billion is cut from nursing homes; \n$42.1 billion from home health care, $7.7 billion from hospice care. \nThat is a total of $464.6 billion in Medicare cuts. Seniors know we \ncan't make these kind of cuts without jeopardizing the care they \nreceive. That is the concern I have. We are not talking about cuts in \nthe abstract. We are talking about delay and denial of care for \nAmerican citizens. These folks wonder how it is fair or justifiable to \ncut the health care that has been promised to them in order to pay for \nsome kind of new government entitlement.\n  I receive letters and phone calls every day. I have quoted from many \nof these letters. Many of them have to do with the proposed cuts in \nMedicare, in particular to Medicare Advantage.\n  I mentioned the percentage. In numbers, it is about 329,000 \nArizonans--329,000 Arizonans--a third of a million who enjoy Medicare \nAdvantage plans. That is over 37 percent of overall Medicare \nbeneficiaries in my State of Arizona. They know $120 billion in \nMedicare Advantage cuts will hit our State and, specifically, their \ncoverage very hard. They worry that under the Reid bill, they will lose \nthe low deductibles and the low copayments they enjoy under Medicare \nAdvantage and many of the other benefits I mentioned a moment ago.\n  They worry about losing the choices they have, which is one of the \nnice things about the Medicare Advantage plan, and the extra benefits, \nincluding things such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, dental benefits, \npreventative screening, free flu shots, home care for chronic \nillnesses, prescription drug management tools, wellness programs, \nmedical equipment, and access to physical fitness programs. These and \nmany more are the kinds of benefits that are included in the Medicare \nAdvantage Program, and they will lose many of these benefits under the \nlegislation that is before us right now.\n  I think they have a right to be concerned about losing these \nbenefits. If there is any doubt about this, incidentally, the \nCongressional Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan entity which serves \nboth Democrats and Republicans here--it calls it straight; sometimes \nthey give answers we do not like, but they provide the analysis of the \ncosts and benefits--and the Congressional Budget Office has confirmed \nthat under the Democrats' bill, Medicare Advantage beneficiaries will \nlose, and they will lose big. In fact, they will lose more than half \ntheir extra benefits under Medicare Advantage.\n  Well, my senior citizen constituents do not like that, and they have \nlet me know about that. Let me share a couple letters--just excerpts \nfrom letters from two of my constituents. The first is from Surprise, \nAZ:\n\n       My mother is on Medicare Advantage, and I don't know what \n     she would do without it.\n       The poor and middle class are already hurting much more \n     than government officials realize. We are on fixed incomes, \n     and have already cut back to bare minimum. What happened to \n     ``government for the people, by the people?''\n\n  Another constituent from Gold Canyon, AZ, writes:\n\n       I have been on Medicare for 11 years and have been \n     subscribing to a Medicare Advantage plan for the past 6 \n     years. It has been excellent, and has provided substantial \n     savings for us. Now we understand that the government is \n     dropping its support of the plan. Please try to stop this. It \n     is very important to many senior citizens in Arizona.\n\n  These constituents of mine, these senior citizens, know Medicare cuts \nwill hurt seniors' care, and those who try to suggest otherwise are \nsimply wrong. The Congressional Budget Office, as I have said, has \nconfirmed it.\n  One of the newspapers on Capitol Hill, Politico, recently provided a \nhelpful summary of an actuarial report on the Democrats' health care \nplan, prepared by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That \nis CMS. That is the outfit out of the Department of Health and Human \nServices that actually runs Medicare. According to page 8 of the \nreport, as Politico summarizes, the Democrats' bill:\n\n       . . . reduces Medicare payments to hospitals and nursing \n     homes over time, based on productivity targets. The idea is \n     that by paying institutions less money, they will be forced \n     to become more productive. But it's doubtful that many \n     institutions can hit those targets, which could force them to \n     withdraw from Medicare.\n\n  We hear it all the time: physicians dropping or not taking any new \nMedicare patients; entities that are no longer going to be able to \nserve Medicare patients because they are not getting paid enough by the \ngovernment for them to even break even.\n  This report I am quoting from--the CMS report--according to Politico, \nsays that by 2014, Medicare Advantage enrollment will plunge 64 \npercent--we are not talking about just a few folks--from 13.2 million \ndown to 4.7 million because of the ``less generous benefit packages.''\n\n[[Page S11984]]\n\n  One of the reasons this is being done is because those on the left do \nnot like private competition for the government program, Medicare. What \nI think they fail to appreciate is what my constituents have \nappreciated, which is this private alternative to regular Medicare \nprovides additional benefits, additional health protections. If they \nare willing to pay a little bit more for those benefits, why shouldn't \nthey be allowed to take advantage of those benefits? No. Those on the \nleft say: We don't want any private insurance companies competing to \nget Medicare patients. We want that to be strictly a government \nprogram.\n  Well, if folks like it, why shouldn't they be allowed to keep it? \nRemember what the President said: If you like your insurance company, \nyou get to keep it. No, that is not true, according to this. Medicare \nAdvantage enrollment will plunge from 13.2 million to 4.7 million \nbecause of the ``less generous benefit packages.'' So I guess it is not \ntrue: If you like it, you get to keep it.\n  The Washington Post--a newspaper here in Washington--wrote an article \nabout the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services report, the same \none I have been quoting here, and the headline was ``Bill Would Reduce \nSenior Care.'' Well, that says it in a nutshell. The story goes on to \ntell us: ``A plan to slash . . . Medicare spending--one of the biggest \nsources of funding for President Obama's proposed overhaul of the \nnation's healthcare system--would sharply reduce benefits for some \nsenior citizens.''\n  ``Would sharply reduce benefits.'' So the Medicare cuts, as proposed \nby the majority, do, in fact, jeopardize seniors' benefits. The \nmajority leader says we can amend the bill, and that is hypothetically \ncorrect, of course.\n  Let's see how many of our Democratic colleagues are willing to join \nRepublicans in striking these Medicare cuts, the cuts I have just now \nbeen referring to. If we do not do that, then I will repeat what I have \nsaid before, which is that we should start over because it is clear \nthis bill is not going to be fixed and starting over would mean taking \nsome of the Republican suggestions.\n  Let me talk about one of these suggestions. My colleague from Florida \nwas talking about the sorry state of real estate in his State of \nFlorida, and I could have added my State of Arizona as well. I agree \nwith much of what he had to say about that. But he also noted, with \nregard to health care, there is a subsidy in what those of us with \nprivate insurance pay because of the care that is given to others who \ncannot always pay for all of it. That is true.\n  I would add, there is also a subsidy for what we pay in insurance \npremiums because of the government programs, such as Medicare and \nMedicaid, which, likewise, do not pay for all the benefits they \nprovide. In fact, they only pay doctors and hospitals somewhere in the \nneighborhood of 70 to 80 percent of their cost, and we have to make up \nthe difference in that in the private insurance premiums we pay. So \nincreasing insurance premiums is, to a large degree, the fault of the \nU.S. Government, not the insurance companies.\n\n  The Democrats say the answer is yet another government program, and \nthey even have a government insurance program in the legislation they \nhave introduced. Their other answer is to write insurance policies. \nThey actually specify in the bill what policies have to include. These \nare called government mandates. What is the effect of these proposals? \nIs this the right way to go or is there a better idea?\n  Again, the Congressional Budget Office, which the distinguished \nminority leader referred to a moment ago, in its most recent report \nsaid--and it said the same thing to the Finance Committee--the premiums \nfor private insurance under this Democratic legislation will, what, go \nup. The average family is going to pay more in insurance premiums under \nthis legislation, not less.\n  What was the whole idea here? The whole idea of health care reform \nwas to reduce the cost of health care, to reduce our insurance \npremiums. They are skyrocketing. My colleagues on the other side of the \naisle say: Small businesses cannot afford to buy insurance for their \nemployees; my constituents cannot afford their health insurance \npremiums, which are increasing in price. All that is true. They are \nincreasing. So what should we be doing? We should be lowering them, not \nraising them. This legislation, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, increases insurance premiums.\n  What about the Republican alternative, the alternative that was \npresented in the House of Representatives by the House Republicans? \nThat alternative, according to the Congressional Budget Office, reduces \naverage insurance premiums by $5,000 a year. So on the one hand, you \nhave the Democratic proposal, which increases insurance premiums; on \nthe other hand, you have the Republican proposal, which decreases \npremiums.\n  There is a study by a private consulting firm, Oliver Wyman, which \nbreaks this down by State. The reason I am excited about this \nRepublican idea is the average family in Arizona would see its premiums \ngo down annually by over $7,400. So think about that. On the one hand, \nyou have insurance premiums going up, under the Democratic legislation; \nunder the other, you have insurance premiums going down, on average, \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of anywhere from $3,300 to, in my State, \nup to $7,400. I think the average is somewhere between $3,000 and \n$5,000.\n  The point is, you can cut insurance premiums with better ideas coming \nfrom Republicans, and I just ask my colleagues: Why wouldn't you do \nthat as opposed to the complicated, costly, government-run kind of \nprogram you are trying to institute under this legislation, which, \naccording to CBO, would raise insurance premiums?\n  That is why the American people, by a significant margin, say: Do not \npass this bill, why they appreciate it would raise their costs, it \nwould reduce the quality of their health care, and why, therefore, my \ncolleagues and I are going to try our best to persuade our Democratic \ncolleagues to amend the bill. But if at the end of the day they are not \nwilling to buy some of these good Republican ideas and instead insist \non pushing right ahead with their legislation, at the end of the day, \nwe will have to say: We are sorry, it does not appear this bill is \ngoing to be fixed and, therefore, we are going to follow the wishes of \nthe American people and see to it that it does not pass.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to call attention \nto the situation of three citizens of the United States--Shane Bauer, \nSarah Shourd, and Josh Fattal--who have been detained by the Government \nof Iran for nearly 4 months. One of these individuals, Shane Bauer, \ncomes from my home State of Minnesota, and so the safe return of these \nthree young Americans is of particular importance to me.\n  On July 31 of this year, Shane, Sarah, and Josh--who shared a common \npassion for travel and discovery--were on a hiking trip in a peaceful \nregion in northern Iraq, when they reportedly accidentally strayed \nacross the poorly marked border between Iraq and Iran and were \nsurrounded by Iranian border guards.\n  Since then, Shane, Sarah, and Josh have been held in near isolation \nin a Tehran prison and have been allowed no contact with their families \nin the United States.\n  Despite repeated requests by the Swiss Government, which represents \nU.S. interests in Iran, the three have\n\n[[Page S11985]]\n\nbeen denied regular consular access required by the Vienna Convention. \nThey have been denied repeated requests to be able to speak with their \nfamilies via telephone, and they have been denied public information on \nany charges they may face.\n  In the 4 months they have been detained, the three have been allowed \nonly two meetings with Swiss consular officials and have been denied \ndue process and access to legal representation.\n  Even more alarming, Iranian officials have recently declared the \nthree may be charged with espionage, a charge that is not only baseless \nbut also completely at odds with who Shane, Sarah, and Josh are as \nindividuals.\n  Shane, Sarah, and Josh made a simple mistake in accidentally crossing \nthe border, and their continued detention is unwarranted and \nunreasonable. Since the three were detained, I have gotten to know \nShane's mother Cindy and other members of the hikers' families. During \nour conversations, I have learned what a remarkable person Shane is and \nhow he is dedicated through his work to bringing the world closer \ntogether through photo journalism.\n\n  Shane grew up in Onamia, MN, a small town in the central part of our \nState, and he graduated from the University of California at Berkeley. \nPrior to being detained in Iran, Shane was living with Sarah in \nDamascus. He has traveled around the Middle East as a free-lance \njournalist, reporting from Syria, Iraq, Darfur, Yemen, and Ethiopia. \nHis writing and award-winning photographs have been published in the \nUnited States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and throughout the Middle \nEast.\n  His latest trip with Sarah and Josh brought him to the Kurdistan \nregion of Iraq, which is known for its scenic hikes among mountainous \nwaterfalls. This is hardly the background of someone who would \ndeliberately enter Iran in hopes of committing espionage.\n  A few weeks ago, I met with Shane's mom Cindy and members of Sarah \nand Josh's families in my office in Washington. As a mother, I can only \nimagine how difficult this ordeal must be for all of them. They have \nhad no contact with their sons or their daughter. Yet I have been \noverwhelmed by their resolve. They are pursuing every avenue they can \nfind to demonstrate to the Iranian Government that their children made \na simple mistake and clearly deserve to be released.\n  I came away from our meeting even more committed to seeing that Cindy \nand Shane, along with Sarah and Josh and their families, are united as \nsoon as possible. As we all know, Iran is in the center of many \npressing foreign policy challenges we currently face. I, along with my \ncolleagues, will address those, but Shane, Sarah, and Josh have \nabsolutely nothing to do with these international fights. They have \nnothing to do with what is going on in Iran or Iran's differences with \nother countries. This is strictly a humanitarian case. I urge Iranian \nofficials not to politicize it or seek to use the three hikers as \ndiplomatic pawns. There is no cause for their continued detention, and \nnothing will be gained by prolonging it any further. Iran's leaders \nshould demonstrate the necessary compassion by immediately releasing \nShane, Sarah, and Josh and allowing them to return home to their \nfamilies. In the meantime, they should at the very least allow them to \nspeak to their families in the United States over the telephone.\n  I thank my friend, the Ambassador to Switzerland, and Swiss officials \nfor their work in this area. It has been 122 days since Shane, Sarah, \nand Josh were first detained; 122 days in captivity, apparently just \nfor straying over a line on a map when they were on a hike.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 3590, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill, (H.R. 3590), to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to modify the first-time home buyers credit in the case \n     of members of the Armed Forces and certain other Federal \n     employees, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 2786, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today is the beginning of one of the most \nimportant debates in the history of our country. Today is the beginning \nof one of the most historic times in the Senate. Our two chairmen, \nSenators Baucus and Dodd, have spent months of their lives working on \nthe legislation that allows us to be where we are today. We now have \nbefore us a bill that saves money, saves lives, and saves Medicare. It \nis a bill, if you add in Medicare recipients, that will insure 98 \npercent of the people in America.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the major goals of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act is to lower Federal health care \ncosts and reduce the deficit. Our bill does that. According to the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would not add \na penny to the Federal deficit. In fact, it will reduce the deficit \nover both the short term and the long term, over the long term by as \nmuch as $650 billion.\n  In developing this bill with the Finance and HELP Committees, we were \ndetermined to ensure that the legislation not only would reduce our \ndeficit and our debt but that it would do so without relying on \nadditional surpluses in the Social Security trust fund. This \nlegislation would increase revenues in the trust fund as workers' wages \nrise. But those revenues are supposed to be for Social Security, so we \ndidn't touch a penny of them--they are all used for Social Security and \nnothing else.\n  Likewise, about $70 billion in revenues over the first 10 years of \nthis bill flows from premiums paid into the new long-term care \ninsurance program known as the CLASS Act. Several Members came to me \nand argued that none of these funds should be used for other purposes. \nI agreed. After all, these premiums would be used to build up a fund \nthat later would be used to pay benefits. So, as with Social Security, \nwe didn't use any of the CLASS surpluses for other programs.\n  I think it is important that as the Senate considers changing the \nlegislation, we maintain our commitment to protecting Social Security \nand CLASS surpluses. In both cases, all additional revenues are \ndedicated to pay benefits. Diverting them to other purposes would not \nbe fiscally responsible, and it wouldn't be fair to Social Security or \nto people who paid their CLASS premiums in good faith.\n  To help ensure we remain true to this commitment, I now ask unanimous \nconsent that all amendments to the pending bill be considered out of \norder unless they are consistent with the following two principles: The \nadditional surplus in the Social Security trust fund generated by this \nact should be reserved for Social Security and not spent in this act in \nany other fashion; and No. 2, the net savings generated by the CLASS \nprogram should be reserved for the CLASS program and not spent in any \nother manner in this act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, neither of these requests \nare the requests I was just talked to about a minute and a half ago, so \nI object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think what he saw a minute and a half ago \nis essentially the same thing, but I will recite this again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that no amendment be in order to the Reid \nsubstitute amendment 2786 or a subsequent substitute amendment and H.R.\n\n[[Page S11986]]\n\n3590 if the additional surplus in the Social Security trust fund \ngenerated by this act would be expended on other provisions of this act \nand not reserved solely for Social Security, and the net savings \ngenerated by the CLASS program in the underlying substitute amendment \nand any subsequent substitute amendment are reserved solely for the \nCLASS program provisions of this act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, in the weeks this has been sequestered \nwithout us being able to review it and now having something that is not \nunderstandable in the short period of time we have to do it here, I \nhave to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry my friend objected. It is not too \ndifficult to comprehend that any Social Security surpluses should be \nreserved for Social Security. It is not too difficult to comprehend \nthat all monies related to the CLASS Act would be reserved for paying \nbenefits for that. So I am disappointed that my friends on the other \nside of the aisle are not interested in making sure Social Security \nmonies are not used and/or CLASS Act monies are not used for anything \nother than those two programs.\n  Mr. President, I have another unanimous consent request.\n  The process for developing this legislation has been very \ntransparent. In fact, the hearings held in the Finance Committee were \ndone very publicly, and that is an understatement. For weeks and weeks, \nmembers of that committee couldn't walk out of the room without being \nquestioned by the press. The press was present at most of their \nmeetings. So both the HELP and Finance Committees marked up their \nlegislation in public markups. Republican and Democratic members of \nboth committees offered numerous amendments, all of which were \navailable to the public. Republican and Democratic members voted for or \nagainst those amendments in a public and transparent way, and each \ncommittee member can be held fully accountable to their constituents \nfor all of those votes.\n  The merged bill before us is entirely consistent with the provisions \nproduced in those public markups. The bill has been fully available on \nthe Internet for about 2 weeks. So each and every American has had the \nopportunity, if they wanted, to read the text of the legislation and to \ncommunicate their views with their Senators.\n  One of the main reasons we have gone the extra mile in ensuring a \nfully transparent process is because of the leadership of Senator \nBlanche Lincoln of Arkansas. From the very start of this debate, she \nhas made clear to me that a transparent process and debate on this \ncritical issue is a top priority of hers. To that end, Senator Lincoln \nsaid she would not allow a vote on the motion to proceed to this bill \nunless it had been available to the public for a reasonable period of \ntime. She was joined by virtually everyone on this side of the aisle to \nthat effect. They were right. The people did deserve a chance to see \nthe bill before that vote, so we were sure to give them that chance. \nThe Senator deserves credit for that, and I appreciate her standing up \non that issue.\n  She believes--and I agree--that we can do more on the transparency \nfront as this bill moves forward to the next stage of this process; \ntherefore, Senator Lincoln has asked me to propound on her behalf a \nunanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that no amendment be in order to the Reid \nsubstitute amendment No. 2786, a subsequent substitute amendment, or \nH.R. 3590 unless the text or Internet link to the text of the amendment \nis posted on the home page of the official Senate Web site of the \nMember of the Senate who is sponsoring the amendment prior to the \namendment being called up for consideration by the Senate and the \namendment is filed at the desk. Further, that this unanimous consent \nagreement shall be in effect for the duration of the consideration of \nH.R. 3590.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, in light of some of the trust problems and \ntransparency problems we have, and while it appears to lead to greater \ntransparency, we can also see ways that this can limit the ability for \nthe minority to offer amendments. Therefore, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is not a good way to start this debate. \nNo. 1, there is an objection to the moneys in Social Security being \nprotected and, No. 2, to the moneys in the CLASS Act being protected. \nThat was also objected to.\n  Finally, Senator Lincoln's request, which I support 100 percent, \nindicating that amendments should be filed on a Member's Web site--that \ndoesn't sound too outlandish--and filed at the desk before they are \noffered, sounds pretty fair and square to me. I am disappointed this is \nthe way the debate started.\n  Mr. President, there is an order before the body that there will be \ntwo amendments in order today. One will be offered by the Democrats and \none will be offered by the Republicans. The one to be offered by the \nDemocrats will be offered by the distinguished Senator from Maryland, \nBarbara Mikulski, who I had the good fortune of serving with in the \nHouse of Representatives. She and I came here together in 1986 when we \nwere elected to the Senate. She is a Senator I have such great respect \nand fondness for. We have been literally together and, because of our \nseniority, I am always one step behind her. Frankly, most people are a \nstep behind the Senator from Maryland. The amendment she is going to \noffer is very sound and good. She will explain it in detail. It expands \nwomen's health services. We had a consternation about mammograms a \ncouple weeks ago, and this will put that all to rest.\n  I express my deep appreciation for the leadership of the Senator from \nMaryland on this issue and on so many other issues she is involved in.\n  As I have indicated, the managers of the bill on our side will be \nSenators Baucus and Dodd. We look forward to a rigorous debate. With \nthe consent of my friend from Wyoming, I ask that the Senator from \nMaryland be recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I was hoping I would have a chance to \ncomment on the things I had to object to so I can give a more full \nexplanation. I am happy to wait.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no need to cut the Senator off. I \nhave indicated to my staff earlier today that there is no one easier to \nget along with in the Senate than the Senator from Wyoming. I would \nnever, ever cut him off intentionally. If there is anything he wishes \nto say, he should say it. If the Senator from Maryland will withhold \nfor a moment, the Senator from Wyoming wishes to speak for a brief \nperiod of time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I cannot be brief on what just happened \nhere. I will let the Senator go ahead. Frankly, I am a little upset \nabout what has happened--combining a couple of unanimous consent \nagreements so that part of it would be acceptable and part would not \nbe, leaving out the most important one, which is that we wouldn't take \nMedicare money from Medicare, and then not having much time to \nconsider, or to rewrite, or to do anything with those. I have a lot of \ncomments I wish to make on that, plus a general statement on the bill, \nwhich fits in with what just happened. I will defer to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2791 to Amendment No. 2786\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), for herself, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Franken, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2791 to amendment No. 2786.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S11987]]\n\n (Purpose: To clarify provisions relating to first dollar coverage for \n                     preventive services for women)\n\n       On page 17, strike lines 9 through 24, and insert the \n     following: ``ance coverage shall, at a minimum provide \n     coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \n     requirements for--\n       ``(1) evidence-based items or services that have in effect \n     a rating of `A' or `B' in the current recommendations of the \n     United States Preventive Services Task Force;\n       ``(2) immunizations that have in effect a recommendation \n     from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with respect to \n     the individual involved; and\n       ``(3) with respect to infants, children, and adolescents, \n     evidence-informed preventive care and screenings provided for \n     in the comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health \n     Resources and Services Administration.\n       ``(4) with respect to women, such additional preventive \n     care and screenings not described in paragraph (1) as \n     provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the \n     Health Resources and Services Administration for purposes of \n     this paragraph.''.\n\n     ``Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a \n     plan or issuer from providing coverage for services in \n     addition to those recommended by United States Preventive \n     Services Task Force or to deny coverage for services that are \n     not recommended by such Task Force.''.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before I go into the contents of my \namendment, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his unfailing courtesy \nto allow me to proceed to offer my amendment. I have worked with the \nSenator from Wyoming on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, and have often valued his sound counsel and steady hand as \nwe have moved complex legislation. His considerable experience as an \naccountant and his commitment to the stewardship of Federal funds have \noften added to the consideration of legislation. As we move forward on \nboth debating and refining the health care reform bill before us, I \nlook forward to working with him. Again, I thank him for his courtesy.\n  I also want to acknowledge the Democratic leader and wish to support \nhim for bringing something called the ``merged'' bill to the floor, \nwhich took the best elements of both the Finance Committee and the HELP \nCommittee and brought them forth.\n  I believe the overriding bill before us is an excellent bill. No. 1, \nit expands universal access to health care that will now cover over 90 \npercent more Americans. It will end the punitive practices of insurance \ncompanies, particularly in the area of gender, age discrimination, and \npreexisting conditions. It also stabilizes and makes Medicare secure \nand, at the same time, it begins to bend the cost curve by following \ninnovative practices related to quality control and prevention.\n  I think the overriding bill is an excellent one. I congratulate the \nmanager of the bill on the floor, the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for the excellent work his committee \ndid, for bringing in a great bill that establishes new ideas, such as \nmedical homes, emphasizing primary care and prevention, and at the same \ntime accomplishing the objectives I have mentioned.\n  However, as I reviewed the bill, I felt we could do more to be able \nto enhance and improve women's health care. That is what my amendment \ndoes. The essential aspect of my amendment is that it guarantees women \naccess to lifesaving preventive services and screenings.\n  This amendment eliminates one of the major barriers to accessing care \nin the area of cost and preventive services. It does it by getting rid \nof, or minimizing, high copays and high deductibles that are often \noverwhelming hurdles for women to access screening programs. We know \nthat screening is important and early detection is important because it \nsaves lives. But it also saves money. It does it by reducing the top \ndiseases that are killing women today, or certainly impairing their \nlives.\n  Today, according to the CDC, the top killers of women are cancer--\nbreast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer. Also \nupfront and high on the list is lung cancer which, if identified early, \ncan be treated with less invasive procedures and with lower costs. \nAnother top killer of women is heart and vascular disease. And then \nthere are the silent killers that often go undetected, such as \ndiabetes, which can result in terrible consequences, such as the loss \nof an eye, the loss of a limb, or the loss of a kidney.\n  We now have screenings that are proven to detect these diseases \nearly. Guaranteed access to these screenings, as I said, will save \nmoney and lives.\n  If we look at where women are today, we find women often forgo those \ncritical preventive screenings because they simply cannot afford it, or \ntheir insurance company won't pay for it unless it is mandated by State \nlaw. Many women right now don't have insurance at all--seventeen \nmillion women in the United States of America are uninsured--or when \nthey are insured, they have to pay large out-of-pocket expenses.\n  Three in five women have significant problems paying their medical \nbills. Women are more likely than men to neglect care or treatment \nbecause of cost. Fourteen percent of women report they delay or go \nwithout needed health care. Women of childbearing age incur 68 percent \nmore out-of-pocket health care costs than men, simply because of the \nmaternity aspect.\n  Women are often faced with the punitive practices of insurance \ncompanies. No. 1 is gender discrimination. Women often pay more and get \nless. For many insurance companies, simply being a woman is a \npreexisting condition. Let me repeat that. For many insurance \ncompanies, simply being a woman is a preexisting condition. We pay more \nbecause of our gender, anywhere from 2 percent to over 100 percent. A \n25-year-old woman is charged up to 45 percent more than a 25-year-old \nmale in the same identified health status. A 40-year-old woman is \ncharged anywhere from 2 percent to 140 percent more than a 40-year-old \nman with the same health status for the same insurance policy.\n  What does my amendment do? It guarantees access to those critical \npreventive services for women to combat their No. 1 killers. We will \nprovide these services at minimal cost.\n  The overall cost of my amendment has been scored by CBO. It says the \ncost is $1 billion. The majority leader, the Democratic leader, has \nprovided opportunities to meet this cost. This amendment eliminates \nthis big barrier of copayments and deductibles.\n  Let's talk about the benefit package. This benefit package is based \non HRSA recommendations. It is based also on the recommendations of \nCDC. If this amendment passes, women will have access to the same \npreventive health services as the women in Congress have. If this \npasses, again, the women of America will have access to the same \npreventive services that we women in Congress have.\n  What does that mean? It means a mammogram, if your doctor says you \nneed it; screening for cervical cancer, if your doctor says you need \nit; that check on diabetes, if your doctor is worried about you; and \nalong with the symptoms related to menopause, there are other things, \nsuch as a loss of weight; and they may want to know at this juncture if \nyou have diabetes. If you know that at 40, you are less likely to need \nkidney dialysis when you are 60.\n  The pending bill doesn't cover key preventive services, such as \nannual screenings for women of all ages to focus on our unique health \nneeds. We know that for many people--for example, there are 15 million \npeople in America with diabetes, and half are women. Often pregnant \nwomen with diabetes don't get the proper prenatal care. Heart disease \nis one of the top two leading causes of death in women--cancer and \nheart disease. Every year, over 267,000 women die from heart attacks. \nWomen are generally unaware of their heart risks.\n  My amendment would, again, ensure heart disease screening for women. \nRemember that famous study that said ``take an aspirin a day to keep a \nheart attack away.'' It was done on 10,000 male medical residents, and \nnot one woman was included. Thanks to a bipartisan effort, Bernadine \nHealy, NIH, and the women of the Senate, supported by the good guys of \nthe Senate, were able to get that screening for women, get that \nevaluation. We know we manifest things differently than guys do. Now we \nare on our way to detection--if you can afford to have a doctor and if \nyou can afford to have the screening.\n  My amendment also guarantees screenings for breast cancer--yes, for\n\n[[Page S11988]]\n\nmammograms. We don't mandate that you have a mammogram at age 40. What \nwe say is discuss this with your doctor. But if your doctor says you \nneed one, you are going to get one.\n  Studies have found mammogram screening decreases breast cancer among \nwomen by over 40 percent. Regular Pap smears reduce cervical cancer by \n40 percent. This year, over 4,000 women will die of cervical cancer.\n  My amendment does focus on women's health needs. Keeping a woman \nhealthy not only impacts her own life but that of her family. It \nimpacts her ability to care for her child or an aging parent.\n  Early detection saves money by treating diseases early. Screening \ntests for breast and cervical cancer cost about $150, but the treating \nof advanced breast cancer is over $10,000 and can even go much higher. \nThe treating of early stages of cervical cancer is $13,000 and can go \nmuch higher.\n  My amendment also leaves the decision of which preventive services a \npatient will use between the doctor and the patient. The health reform \ndebate is focused on what you should have when. We agree. Decisions \nshould be made in doctors' offices, not in the office of a Member of \nCongress or the office of an insurance executive. The decision about \nwhat is medically appropriate and medically necessary is between a \nwoman and her doctor.\n  The authors of the bill have done a very good job in protecting women \nin many areas. This actually refines and improves this particular \nissue. That is why I support the overall health reform bill providing \nuniversal access to health care for over 90 percent of the American \npeople, ending those punitive practices of the insurance companies, \nstabilizing and strengthening Medicare, and improving quality in public \nhealth by using innovation and preventive services and quality. We can \npass a health reform bill.\n  I conclude by saying that we will end the confusion about what is \nneeded in the area of preventive health services for women when our \ncoverage is often skimpy and spartan. We want to make sure what we do \nenables us to have access to these comprehensive services.\n  I hope this amendment is adopted unanimously. I believe good people \non both sides of the aisle will believe in its underlying premise: that \nearly detection and screening save lives and save money.\n  Often those things unique to women have not been included in health \ncare reform. Today we guarantee it and we assure it and we make it \naffordable by dealing with copayments and deductibles in a way CBO \nbelieves is fiscally achievable. In the long run, I think by doing this \nit will mean a lot to families, and it will mean a lot to the Federal \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before I give a statement on the bill, I \nwish to compliment the Senator from Maryland for standing up for and \nessentially helping the health care of women. As she has pointed out, \nwomen are discriminated against today in America in various ways. Her \namendment addresses some of that discrimination. I very much appreciate \nthat. I know all women in the country do. I do, too. I have a mom. I \nhave sisters. I have women in my family, and I very much care.\n  I don't know if she made this point, but about 80 percent of health \ncare decisions made for families are made by women. It is all the more \nimportant women are not discriminated against, partly because they make \nso many decisions that affect health care for Americans, but second, \nwomen themselves are often discriminated against. Some States have \ngender ratings which discriminate against women. In other States a \npreexisting condition is a factor that discriminates against women.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland. She has hit the nail on the head. \nIt is another reason this health care reform is going to mean so much \nfor so many Americans. I personally very much thank the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  In the Presidential campaign of 1912, Theodore Roosevelt's platform \nsaid:\n\n       We pledge ourselves to work unceasingly in State and Nation \n     for . . . the protection of home life against the hazards of \n     sickness . . . through the adoption of a system of social \n     insurance adapted to American use.\n\n  Today, nearly a century later, we are closer than ever to enacting \nmeaningful health care reform.\n  As in Teddy Roosevelt's time, we seek protection against the hazards \nof sickness. Of necessity we seek a system uniquely adapted to American \nuse. And recognizing the daunting task still ahead of us, we pledge \nourselves to work unceasingly to get the job done.\n  In the years since Teddy Roosevelt, some of our Nation's greatest \nleaders signed up for this job. But at the same time, we have never \nfaced a greater need to get the job done than we do today.\n  Why is that? Basically because health care costs are skyrocketing out \nof control. Every day American businesses are forced to cut benefits \nfor their workers. Why? To remain competitive in the global \nmarketplace. Every 30 seconds another American files for medical \nbankruptcy. Just think of that. Every 30 seconds another American files \nfor medical bankruptcy. Every year, about 1.5 million families lose \ntheir homes because of health care costs. Our system is in crisis.\n  We have a historic need and we have a historic opportunity. We have \nan opportunity to enact groundbreaking reform that will finally rein in \nthe growth of health care costs and help bring financial stability back \nto American families and businesses.\n  Unfortunately, there are some who stand in the way. Unfortunately, \nthere are some who are spreading misinformation about how health care \nreform will work. On this very floor I have heard arguments that health \ncare reform is about the government trying to take over health care. \nThat is false.\n  The truth is, health care reform is about allowing patients and \ndoctors to take back control of health care. We need to allow patients \nand their doctors together to take back control from the big insurance \ncompanies.\n  Our plan would not increase the government's commitment to health \ncare. But don't just take my word for it. The nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office says:\n\n       [D]uring the decade following the 10-year budget window, \n     the increases and decreases in the federal budgetary \n     commitment to health care stemming from this legislation \n     would roughly balance out, so that there would be no \n     significant change in that commitment.\n\n  That is right, health care reform will not increase the Federal \nGovernment's budgetary commitment to health care.\n  I have also heard it argued that health care reform will increase the \nbudget deficit. That, too, is false--plainly, patently false.\n  The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office says our plan would reduce \nthe Federal deficit by $130 billion within the first 10 years--reduce \nthe deficit in the first 10 years. That trend would continue, the CBO \nsays, over the next decade. During the next decade, CBO says our bill \nwould reduce the deficit roughly $450 billion. That is nearly one-half \ntrillion dollars in deficit reduction, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, in the second 10 years.\n  I have also heard it argued that health care reform will raise taxes. \nThat, too, is false. In fact, health care reform will provide billions \nof dollars in tax relief to help American families and small businesses \nafford quality health insurance--tax cuts.\n  The Joint Tax Committee--again bipartisan and which serves both the \nHouse and the Senate--tells us, for example, that our bill would \nprovide $40 billion in the tax cuts in the year 2017 alone--$40 billion \nin tax cuts in the year 2017. The average affected taxpayer will get a \ntax cut of nearly $450. The average affected taxpayer with an income \nunder $75,000 in 2017 will get a tax cut of more than $1,300.\n\n  Let me repeat that. The average affected taxpayer with income under \n$75,000 in 2017 will get a tax cut of more than $1,300. They will also \nget a tax cut in earlier years, but it ramps up to that amount in 2017.\n  In the same vein, I have heard claims that health care reform will \nresult in an increase in higher costs for Americans. That, too, is \nfalse.\n  Health care reform will not result in higher costs for Americans. \nHealth care reform is fundamentally about lowering health care costs \nand making quality health care affordable for all Americans. Lowering \ncosts is what health care reform is designed to do, lowering costs; and \nit will achieve this objective. How? In many ways.\n\n[[Page S11989]]\n\n  First, health care reform will end abusive practices by insurance \ncompanies. Reform will stop insurance companies from denying coverage \nor hiking up rates for those with a preexisting condition. We stop that \nin this legislation. That will lower costs. Reform will stop insurance \ncompanies from dropping coverage or reducing benefits for those who get \nsick.\n  Those reforms protect consumers, and they will protect Americans and \nreduce premium costs for Americans who are sick. These reforms will \nalso help lower costs for small businesses and their employees. Right \nnow, if one employee in a small business gets sick--just one--insurance \ncompanies can double the premiums they charge the whole business. I \nknow that is true. I have heard that time and time again from small \nbusiness owners in Montana. That is just because one employee gets \nsick, the insurance companies jack up premiums, double the premiums \nthey otherwise would charge the whole business. That is just wrong. We \nstop that in this legislation.\n  How else do we lower costs in this bill? Health care reform will \nprovide billions of dollars in tax credits and reform will limit out-\nof-pocket costs such as copayments that insurance companies are able to \ncharge. We limit them. This will also help to ensure Americans can \nafford their total health care costs and not just their premiums.\n  That is very important. Premiums and out-of-pocket costs are both \naddressed by this bill. It limits growth in premiums and also limits \ngrowth in out-of-pocket costs. So total cost--premiums plus out-of-\npocket costs--for Americans will be lower under this legislation than \notherwise would be.\n  Third, health care reform will work to repeal the hidden tax of more \nthan $1,000 in increased premiums that American families pay each year \nin order to cover the cost of caring for the uninsured.\n  Today, millions of Americans without health insurance are too often \nforced to turn to emergency rooms to get the care they need, and then \nhealth care providers shift the cost of that care to other Americans \nwith health insurance. People with insurance, therefore, pay higher \npremiums. By providing quality, affordable health insurance to millions \nmore Americans, health care reform will reduce this hidden tax and \nreduce premiums for all Americans--$1,000 per year per family due to \nuncompensated care. That is that hidden tax. This bill will virtually \nstop that hidden tax, stop that additional $1,000 that goes to average \nfamily premiums.\n  How else do we reduce health care costs? By providing affordable \nhealth care to more Americans which will increase the number of \nAmericans in the insurance market. Why? What is so good about that?\n  One reason is more people will have health insurance. But also it \nwill spread the risk of paying for an accident or disease more broadly. \nSpreading the risk more broadly should lower premium rates for \neverybody. It is a basic tenet of insurance.\n  Fifth, health care reform will reduce costs by cutting administrative \nredtape. That is no small item. Today, insurance companies spend a lot \nof time and money finding ways to discriminate against people. They \nspend time and money to find ways to drop coverage, and insurance \ncompanies pass those administrative costs on to all Americans in the \nform of higher premiums. The figure I heard is about 18 percent of \nAmerican health care dollars is administrative costs. This legislation \nwould dramatically reduce that percentage to a much lower number. We \ndon't know to exactly what level yet but a much lower level. About 18 \npercent of total health care dollars go to pay administrative costs. \nThat is not the case in other countries. They pay 4 to 5 percent in \nother countries. We have to get that down in America, and health care \nreform will significantly achieve that result.\n  Health care reform will outlaw this discrimination, and also reform \nwill eliminate those administrative costs that go along with it. \nFurthermore, health care costs will work to streamline administrative \nprocedures across the board by requiring standard enrollment forms and \nmarketing material through insurance exchanges. That, too, will help \nstreamline procedures. That, too, will help reduce administrative costs \nfor providing for standard enrollment forms and also standard marketing \nmaterials through insurance exchanges. That is going to lower \nadministrative costs and make it much easier for a person to shop and \nknow which policy is best for him or her. With the other reforms we are \nmaking competition is more on the basis of price not just underwriting, \na fancy term for denying because of a preexisting condition and putting \nin all those extra escape clauses insurance companies often provide in \nsmall print. In a letter released today, the Congressional Budget \nOffice said:\n\n       Compared with plans that would be available in the nongroup \n     market--\n\n  And they are referring there to the individual market--\n\n     under current law, nongroup policies under the proposal would \n     have lower administrative costs.\n\n  Let me say that again. Compared with plans that would be available in \nindividual markets--individuals seeking insurance--under current law, \nindividual policies under the proposal would have lower administrative \ncosts.\n  Lower, not higher. Lower.\n  Six--another way to reduce costs. Health care reform creates \ninsurance exchanges where consumers can easily shop and compare plans \nto find the right coverage. Exchanges will make it easier for Americans \nto choose the most efficient plans, and that will reduce their costs \nand put pressure on insurance companies to offer lower cost, higher \nquality plans.\n  Seven--still another way this bill reduces costs. Small business \ninsurance exchanges will allow small companies to pool together to \nspread their risk and increase their buying power. More pooling \navailable for small business insurance exchanges--this will allow small \nbusinesses to negotiate lower rates and provide more quality insurance \nplans with lower premiums to their employees.\n  Eight. Health care reform will strengthen oversight and enforcement \nmeasures to cut down on fraud, waste, and abuse in the health care \nsystem. Fraud, waste, and abuse are estimated to cost our health care \nsystem more than $60 billion every year. This bill will help reform our \nsystem to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse, which eats up way too many \nhealth care dollars.\n  Nine. Health care reform will move the focus of our system toward \nefficiency and value with payment incentives that reward quality care--\nnot quantity and volume but reward quality care, reward outcomes. Over \nthe long run, paying doctors and other health care providers for \nquality instead of quantity will reduce health care costs.\n  Ten. Health care reform will lower costs by working to change the \nfocus of our health care system from treating sickness to promoting \nwellness. The big problem we have today is that we treat sickness. We \ndon't spend enough time promoting wellness. Reform will make critical \ninvestments in policies that promote healthy living and help prevent \ncostly chronic conditions that drive up costs throughout the system.\n  These are just 10 examples of how health care reform will reduce \nhealth care costs and lower premiums for American consumers. There are \nmany more, but these are those 10, as I said. On the other hand, \nwithout reform; that is, without passing this legislation, costs are \nguaranteed to continue to skyrocket out of control.\n  Since Congress failed to enact health care reform in the 1990s, \nhealth care premiums have risen eight times faster than wages. Consider \nthat. Since the last time we attempted to pass health care reform--and \nfailed--in the 1990s, health care premiums have risen eight times \nfaster than wages. And if we don't reform our health care system now, \npremiums will increase 84 percent in the next 7 years. And that is just \npremiums. What about out-of-pocket costs? Those, too, will increase at \na rate much faster than wage increases.\n  Today, health care coverage costs the average American family more \nthan $13,000 a year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. If \ncurrent trends continue without reform, the average family plan will \ncost more than $30,000 a year in the next 10 years. That is up from \n$13,000 today to $30,000 10 years from now. And businesses could see \ntheir health care costs double in that same time. Without reform, our \nNation's long-term fiscal picture is almost certainly unsustainable.\n\n[[Page S11990]]\n\n  As Peter Orszag said when he was Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice:\n\n       Rising health care costs represent the single most \n     important factor influencing the Federal Government's long-\n     term fiscal balance.\n\n  He was right. Without reform, instead of working to reduce our \nnational deficit and stabilize the Federal budget, we will see total \nhealth care spending nearly double to encompass one-fifth of our gross \ndomestic product in less than 10 years. And the Congressional Budget \nOffice projects entitlement spending will double by the year 2050.\n  Without reform, millions of uninsured Americans will continue to \nsuffer. A Harvard study found that every year in America, lack of \nhealth care coverage leads to about 45,000 deaths. People without \nhealth insurance have a 40-percent higher risk of death than those with \nprivate health insurance. You have a 40-percent higher chance of death \nif you don't have health insurance compared with those who do. That is \n46 million Americans at risk today because they do not have health \ninsurance. A recent Johns Hopkins study found that children without \ninsurance have a 60-percent higher risk of death than those with \nprivate health insurance--a 60-percent higher risk of death than those \nwith private health insurance.\n  Another recent Harvard study found that the risk of dying from car \naccidents and other traumatic injuries is 80 percent higher for those \nwithout insurance--80 percent higher. The risk of dying from car \naccidents and other traumatic injuries is 80 percent higher if you \ndon't have health insurance. In the greatest country on Earth, no \nAmerican should die simply because they do not have health insurance.\n  So, Mr. President, we are at a crossroads in history. We have a \nhistoric opportunity to enact meaningful health care reform that will \nwork to stabilize our economy and provide quality, affordable health \ncare coverage for millions of Americans. We are not the first to be \nhere, but we have come further than ever before.\n  We laid the groundwork in the Finance Committee and the HELP \nCommittee. We held many hearings and countless hours of meetings on \nhealth care reform. Each committee crafted meaningful legislation and \nheld exhaustive markups where we incorporated amendments from both \nsides of the aisle. We produced balanced, meaningful legislation, and I \nam proud--I am very proud--of the work both committees accomplished. \nNow we have one health care plan before us in the Senate, two basic \nbills merged together. We have an opportunity to debate that plan and \noffer amendments to make it even better. Then we will be called upon to \nvote.\n  The health care of our Nation is depending on us. The health care of \nour economy is depending on us. History itself is depending on us to \nanswer the call. I am confident we will. I am confident we will at long \nlast answer the call of history. I am confident we will soon enact \nmeaningful health care reform that will lower costs and bring quality, \naffordable coverage to millions of Americans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier following the \nunanimous consent requests the leader made--who then introduced Senator \nMikulski so that she could do her amendment, which kept me from \ncommenting on the unanimous consent requests he made--I have to say I \nthink those unanimous consent requests would have to be put in the \ncategory of a stunt. Unanimous consent usually means the two leaders \nhave gotten together and negotiated some kind of agreement that we \nwould abide by during this time. There was no agreement on this. Yet \nthey went ahead and did the unanimous consent request solely so they \ncould get the objection.\n  Nobody here, I am sure, wants to use Social Security money for \nanything except Social Security. So the real key to the stunt was the \nsecond one, which is the net savings generated by the CLASS program. \nThat is a long-term care program that wound up in the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee bill.\n  The flaw with that particular amendment was that it collected money \nfor 10 years without spending any and then it wound up with a huge \nliability. So we put in a little provision that it had to be \nactuarially sound because, quite frankly, it is not very good \naccounting to collect $70 billion in exchange for a $2 billion--excuse \nme, $2 trillion--I get the b's and the t's mixed up here, because we \nare talking about real money here--a $2 trillion bill. That is how much \nwe are going to have to pay out over the next 10 years to cover the $70 \nbillion we accept in payments for this new kind of insurance that would \nbe provided. That kind of insurance is provided--it is provided in the \nprivate sector--but for considerably more than what they were providing \nfor in the CLASS Act.\n  So that was to bring a little more attention to it, and I want to \nbring a little more attention to it because I want people to take a \ncloser look at the way that winds up. It is a good idea that is not \npaid for, and it is not paid for in such a way that it winds up, once \nagain, adding to the deficit but in some cagey ways.\n  As for having the amendments posted on the Web site before they are \ngiven, I hope the initial version is posted on the Web site by \neverybody before they do it. But one of the things that happens on this \nfloor is that occasionally a good idea can be built on by somebody from \nthe other side or even somebody from your own party, and when that \nhappens you can modify the amendment. I am not sure that agreement \nwouldn't have prohibited any modifications to amendments, which is kind \nof what we ran into in the Finance Committee when we were trying to do \namendments.\n  So good ideas--they need a lot more work. And to just throw those out \nat the beginning and to have about 1\\1/2\\ minutes' notice that they are \ngoing to be thrown out--I just don't think that is the right way to go \nabout this whole process.\n  I have been working on the Nation's broken health care system ever \nsince I entered the Senate more than 12 years ago, and I had high hopes \nthis would be the year the Democrats and the Republicans of the Senate \nwould work together to provide health insurance to every American. I \nurged my colleagues to start with a blank piece of paper and develop a \nbipartisan bill that up to 80 Members of the Senate could support.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leadership had other ambitions, because \nthe bill being debated today is a testament to a partisan ideological \nvision. It appears that the drafters of this bill took to heart the \nsentiments expressed by the Speaker of the House, who earlier this year \nsaid, ``We won the election, we write the bills.'' And for a number of \nweeks, the majority leader closed his door and wrote this bill on his \nown terms without any input from many of his colleagues or anybody on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  This is a deeply flawed bill that fails to address the real needs of \nthe American people. Americans overwhelmingly want reforms that will \nhelp lower their health care costs. Instead, this bill will spend $2.4 \ntrillion when it is fully implemented and contains numerous provisions \nthat will actually drive up the costs millions of Americans pay for \ntheir health care.\n  It is important to understand how we got here. At the beginning of \nthis process, the majority staff of the HELP Committee decided they \nwere going to draft a partisan bill based on the reforms that had \nrecently been adopted in Massachusetts. Republicans were shut out of \nthe process during the drafting of the HELP Committee bill. Rather than \nworking to resolve the difficult issues, the drafters of the bill \nincluded over 200 separate instances where the bill gave the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services the authority to make important decisions \nabout the types of health care plans millions of Americans can receive. \nRather than confronting and debating these important policies--getting \nto the details, and the devil is always in the details--the majority \nempowered unelected government bureaucrats to make decisions that will \naffect the health care of every single American.\n  As a result of this partisan process, we were forced to file hundreds \nof amendments. The chairman and other Democratic members of the \ncommittee have repeatedly commented on the numerous amendments accepted \nby the majority during the markup. At the\n\n[[Page S11991]]\n\nsame time, they ignored the reality that most of these amendments were \nmerely technical corrections which were necessary because the \nunderlying bill was hastily written and filled with numerous drafting \nerrors. Unfortunately, nearly all of the accepted Republican amendments \nmerely tinkered around the edges. Almost all of the substantive \nalternative-idea amendments suffered the failing fate of the party-line \nvote. In 12 days of markup at HELP, we had 45 rollcall votes on \nRepublican-sponsored amendments and only 2 prevailed.\n  After the markup, the majority refused to release a final copy of the \nbill for over 2 months, denying the American people the chance to see \nwhat they had done. Once we finally got a copy of the bill, we learned \nthat majority staff had unilaterally made numerous changes to the bill, \nin some cases undoing agreements that had been worked out by Members on \nissues such as prevention and wellness.\n  While this was happening, there were also ongoing bipartisan \nnegotiations, led by Senator Max Baucus. And I have to congratulate him \nfor the process he started and got people involved in and for his \npersistence and the amount of time he put into it. This dwindled down \nto a Gang of 6. The Gang of 6 discussions were not an honest attempt to \ntry to develop a bipartisan health care bill that would offer real \nsolutions to the problems that face our health care system.\n  Ultimately, these negotiations failed to produce a bipartisan bill. I \ndo not believe the failure was due to a lack of effort on the part of \nthe participants but, rather, we were unsuccessful because the \nDemocratic leadership chose to impose arbitrary and unrealistic time \ndeadlines on the process that we commented on. The deadline slipped a \nfew times, moved up a week, and then became finalized. The decision was \nmade that it was more important to move fast than it was to get it \nright, and the decision ultimately doomed our efforts.\n  This, in turn, led to another partisan markup where the Finance \nCommittee rejected most GOP health reform ideas. Proposals such as \nmedical liability reform were rejected on jurisdictional grounds, while \nthe chairman unilaterally included Democratic provisions that were \nclearly within the jurisdiction of other committees. Republican \namendments were voted on and then unilaterally changed at the eleventh \nhour--actually, 1:30 in the morning--by amendments offered by the \nchairman.\n  The two bills were then merged, merged in secret, with no input from \nthe many Republicans who want to enact a bipartisan health bill. We now \nhave a 2,074-page bill that reflects many of the worst provisions from \nboth the HELP and the Finance Committee bills.\n  We did not need to end up here today with Republicans opposing a \npartisan health care reform bill. The Senate should develop legislation \nthat will impact one-sixth of our Nation's economy and affect the \nhealth of every American.\n  The former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, a Democrat from New York, once provided the following \nperspective on how the Senate should consider major policy changes. He \nsaid:\n\n       Never pass major legislation that affects most Americans \n     without real bipartisan support. It opens the doors to all \n     kinds of political trouble.\n\n  Chairman Moynihan noted that absent such bipartisan support, the \nparty that didn't vote for it would feel free to take shots at the \nresulting program whenever things go wrong and a large segment of the \npublic would never accept it unless it was an overwhelming success. \nChairman Moynihan understood a partisan legislative process guarantees \nthat any glitches that occur in implementing the bill would provide \nammunition for future attacks; thereby, further undermining public \nsupport of the new policies. There will, unfortunately, be plenty of \nglitches if this bill is ever enacted.\n  The Reid bill will impose $493 billion in new taxes, and many of them \ngo into effect immediately. At same time, most Americans will not see \nany insurance reforms or other potential benefits from this bill until \nat least 2014. That leads to some interesting accounting.\n  The Reid bill will kill jobs and cut wages. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has told us the employer mandates in this bill will likely \nresult in lower wages and higher unemployment. These job and wage cuts \nwould hit low-income workers, women, and minorities the hardest. It is \nhard to believe that with unemployment at a generational high, \nDemocrats would even consider putting more jobs on the chopping block. \nThe Reid bill mandates that Washington bureaucrats ration care. The \nbill lays the groundwork for a government takeover of health care, \ngiving Washington bureaucrats the power to prevent patients from seeing \nthe doctor they choose and obtaining new and innovative medical \ntherapies.\n  I think that is attested to by the first amendment we have, the \namendment by the Senator from Maryland, because her amendment preempts \nthe provision in the bill that allows the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce to determine what preventive services should be covered. This \namendment recognizes the problems associated with government \nbureaucrats determining what benefits should be covered. The majority \nrealized it had a political problem when the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force said that women aged less than 50 years old should not have \nannual breast screening exams. This amendment doesn't do anything to \nprotect patients who might be denied access to preventive tests in the \nfuture, such as prostate exams, colonoscopies, Pap smears, and so on, \nif bureaucrats decide to deny access.\n  This bill also shows how this will never be a truly science-based \nprocess. Bureaucrats will always have to respond to political pressure \nfor powerful constituencies.\n  I guess we are part of the powerful constituencies. If we decide \nsomething should or should not be in there, that eliminates the \nscience-based part of it.\n  I understand what they are trying to do. In the HELP Committee, when \nwe were doing the markup, we did numerous amendments around this \nclinical effectiveness research, to see what it was supposed to \neliminate from the health care for the person, separating them from \ntheir doctor by making these science-based decisions.\n  We did a series of amendments and found there, evidently, are a lot \nof things they are hoping will be precluded from people being able to \nget. I invite people to take a look at those amendments. We may have to \ntry those again to see exactly where this process is going. I \nappreciate the Senator from Maryland making an attempt to solve a part \nof the problem, but I am having a little trouble with the reading of \nthe amendment itself. At any rate, enough of that.\n  The Reid bill spends millions--billions. There is that word again. \nThe Reid bill spends billions of taxpayer dollars on new pork-barrel \nspending. The bill would build new sidewalks, jungle gyms, and farmers' \nmarkets and creates a $15 billion slush fund for additional pork-barrel \nprojects, a real deviation from what the Appropriations Committee has \never allowed.\n  This bill also fails to achieve the commonsense goals Republicans and \nDemocrats share. This bill even breaks many of the promises President \nObama has made about health care reform. President Obama repeatedly \ncalled for a health care bill that will reduce costs. This bill will \nactually drive up health care costs for millions of Americans as a \nresult of new mandates and taxes. President Obama has also said that if \nAmericans like the insurance they have, they can keep it. Under the \nbill, millions of Americans will lose their employer-provided health \ninsurance.\n  President Obama promised not to raise taxes on individuals earning \nless than $250,000 per year. The bill would impose several new taxes on \npeople who make considerably less than $250,000 a year.\n  President Obama said the health care reform would not increase the \ndeficit. This bill will not increase the deficit only if you believe \ncertain things. This bill will not increase the deficit if you believe \nMedicare payments to physicians will be cut by 40 percent over the next \ndecade. I don't think anybody believes that.\n  The bill would reduce the deficit only if you believe Medicare \npayments to other providers will be slashed to levels that endanger \npatients' ability to get the care they need. No one believes that.\n\n[[Page S11992]]\n\n  The bill will also reduce the deficit if you believe Congress will \nallow a massive new tax to be imposed on middle-class tax payers. I \nhope no one believes that.\n  If you don't believe Congress will allow all these things to happen, \nthen you can't believe this bill will reduce the deficit. President \nObama, in his remarks to the American Medical Association this summer, \nacknowledged the need to address our out-of-control medical liability. \nRather than addressing this issue, this partisan bill preserves the \ncostly, dangerous, duplicative medical malpractice system.\n  President Obama finally said no Federal dollars will go to pay for \nabortion. According to the National Right to Life and the Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, the Reid bill fails this requirement as well.\n  Despite all these failures, it is still not the worst health care \nbill in Congress. The Wall Street Journal got it right when they \ndescribed the House-passed bill as the worst bill in America. Even if \nthe Senate passed the bill before us today, it would still have to go \nto conference with the House bill and any final bill would have to move \ntoward several provisions in the House bill and poll after poll \nsuggests that the American people are opposed to this bill, let alone \nthe wild one from the House.\n  If we cannot defeat this partisan bill and get back to work for the \nAmerican people and write a bill that garners the support of both \nparties, doing it step by step so we can assure, for instance, the \nseniors that Medicare money will only be spent on Medicare--that is one \nof the pieces that ought to have been in that unanimous consent I \nstarted talking about. That is not going to happen, though. They are \ngoing to take a bunch of money out of there.\n  I think this legislation fails to meaningfully address these goals \nand will stick the American people with a bill we cannot afford. I \nbelieve we can do better, and we owe it to the American people to do \nso.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me begin, if I may, by congratulating \nthe majority leader and my colleague and dear friend from Montana, \nSenator Baucus, and members of the Finance Committee as well as the \nmembers of the HELP Committee. As I said before, I am sort of an \naccidental participant in all this, in the sense that the person who \nshould be standing at this desk and at this podium as the chairman of \nthe HELP Committee is, of course, our deceased colleague from \nMassachusetts. I was filling in for him during the months of his \nillness and managing the markup of the bill that produced part, half--\nwhatever the percentage is--of the combined legislation. All our \ncolleagues know, whether you agreed or disagreed with him, he \nconsidered this issue to be what he called the passion of his public \nlife, to make a difference for all Americans when it comes to their \nhealth care. So I know it is with a sense of sadness that, on the day \non which we begin this historic debate and discussion, he is not here \nto participate--at least physically. We sense his presence, of course, \nthose of us who had the privilege of serving with him for so many \nyears, as Senator Baucus and I did, and worked with him on these many \nissues. Of course, our colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, and \nSenator Grassley did as well over the years. I thank all members of the \ncommittee.\n  It was a laborious undertaking. The Presiding Officer was very much a \npart of that as well, during those many hours we gathered in the Senate \ncaucus room--the Russell caucus room now named the Kennedy caucus \nroom--in some 23 sessions, over many hours. But that was only the \nculmination of an effort that began a long time ago.\n  Actually, the business of writing this bill began months and months \nearlier. My colleague from Montana can appreciate the hours I know I \nspent in meetings in his office, late into the evening, long before a \nmarkup began. Long before any formal conversations and discussions, \nthere was a significant reaching out to our colleagues, to try to bring \nus together and develop what we all hoped to be the case and still can \nbe the case; that is, a consensus bill, a bipartisan bill on health \ncare.\n  I know as a matter of fact here, beginning last fall, Senator \nKennedy, when he did have his strength, met on countless occasions with \nmembers of the minority to try and navigate the minefield of health \ncare ideas, to see if it couldn't be possible to put together that kind \nof a consensus bill.\n  I know our committee began a long process, beginning last winter, to \ntry to begin, long before the markup of this summer, to draft such a \nproposal, having what they call a walk-through of legislation, going \nthrough the various ideas and listening.\n  It was with some regret that I say this idea that the bill somehow \nbeing jammed down people's throats, with little or no thought given to \nother people's ideas and thoughts, is not borne out by the facts. I \nhave been here for many years. I have been through many markups over \nthree decades in this body on various committees. This effort was and \nstill remains an effort to try to bring us together about this issue, \nwhich has such a massive impact on not only the individuals of our \nNation who go through the fear every day of wondering whether the \ncoverage they have will be adequate; and if they don't have that \ncoverage, whether an illness or tragedy could befall them that could \nwipe out everything they have--not only today but for the rest of their \nlives.\n  This journey begins. My hope is, before we have finished the task, we \nwill find that common ground that we each bear responsibility to try \nand achieve.\n  Before we left for the Thanksgiving holiday, the Senate held a \nlandmark vote on whether we should even debate health care. I must say \na lot of attention was given to that. There must be a lot of confusion \nin the minds of many Americans, wondering why we had to debate whether \nwe could debate. The one issue this body is known for is endless \ndebate. We are not limited, under our rules of the Senate, at least not \nformally limited, by how much time we can consume when we want to talk. \nThe filibuster is a unique practice which only the Senate has. So we \nhad to vote as to whether we could actually have a vote. We had a \ndebate on whether we could have a debate on the subject matter that is \nobviously of great concern, whether you agree or disagree.\n  I think all Americans agree the present system needs a lot of work. \nThe vote we took simply stated that after decades of inaction, despite \nthe efforts of others over the years, this time the Senate would not \nfail to deliver the change the people we represent across America want \nand need.\n  We now begin that long, overdue conversation over exactly what change \nshould look like in the area of health care. There are, as has been \nmade clear over the past months, many different opinions on the subject \nmatter, almost as many as there are Members of this body. I hope my \nfellow Senators are ready to share their thoughts, listen to the ideas \nof their colleagues and, most importantly, join together to act. The \nlegislation we present for debate is designed to fix the things that \nare wrong with our system, while protecting and strengthening the \nthings that are great about health care in America. As I have heard my \ncolleague from Montana say on so many occasions, we are not out here to \ndesign or copy what goes on in Canada or Europe or Australia or New \nZealand or any other country around the world. We are here to design an \nAmerican health care plan, an American plan, one we are forging after \nlistening to health care providers, our constituents, and others who \nhave great interest in the debate and discussion and who bring very \nvaluable facts to the table, as all of us, individually, even those not \non the committee, have listened over many weeks and months--in fact, \nover many years that we have been debating this subject matter.\n  Our long history of innovation and discovery--cures, vaccines, and \ntreatments, discovered and produced right here in our own country, that \nhave saved countless lives here and around the world--is something for \nwhich every American ought to be proud. Our legislation, this combined \nbill, encourages that innovation so more groundbreaking medical \ndiscoveries can be made in America.\n  In fact, one of the debates that occurred in the HELP Committee, as \nmy colleague and the Presiding Officer may recall, was on an amendment \noffered by Senator Hatch--no technical\n\n[[Page S11993]]\n\namendment--dealing with how to create a pathway for the Food and Drug \nAdministration to approve follow-on biologics and how many years of \nexclusivity innovators should receive for their original product. We \nhad a heated debate in the committee. It went on for a day or so. In a \ndivided vote, the Hatch amendment was approved with bipartisan support \nfor this very critical and important issue. No technical change, I \nmight add, a significant part of this bill.\n  Our legislation recognizes that we do best by our citizens when the \npublic and private sectors work together. It has been our history in so \nmany areas, not just in this area.\n  Medicare, the ironclad commitment to take care of our seniors, dating \nback to 1965, when Members who preceded us in this Chamber, in a heated \ndebate that went on for days, heated debate over whether we would have \na health care program for seniors, decided not on a partisan vote but \nnearly as much, that there ought to be something called Medicare. It \ntook the poorest sector of our population, the elderly, and lifted them \nout of poverty. Because we said: After their works on behalf of all of \nus, their defense of our Nation in two world wars, and their \ncontribution coming out of a depression, we ought to be able to do \nbetter by them when it comes to their health care needs, Medicare was \nestablished. And despite what some critics have said, this legislation \nprotects and strengthens Medicare. I hope even our friends who have \ntaken to labeling government-run programs such as Medicare as socialist \ntakeovers will join us in keeping this important promise to our \nseniors.\n  Of course, Americans are justifiably proud of and happy with our \nworkforce of dedicated health professionals, the doctors, specialists, \nprimary care physicians, compassionate nurses, dedicated medical \ntechnicians, and family doctors all across the Nation who make a \ndifference every single day in serving the people of our Nation. This \nlegislation is designed to guarantee that you can get the care you need \nwhen you need it from the doctor you like. Meanwhile, it will help that \nphysician spend less time filling out redundant paperwork and more time \ntaking care of you and your family. It will help you spend less time \nfighting with your insurance company and more time getting better and \ngetting back on your feet again.\n  There are many things to like about our health care system in the \nUnited States. This legislation doesn't change them. There are many \nthings that are wonderful about our health care system. I think it is \nimportant at the outset to acknowledge that and to understand, again, \nthe quality of innovation that occurs, the compassionate work done by \nhealth care providers in every community. In my State, there are 31 \nhospitals, all nonprofit hospitals, in the State of Connecticut. I have \nvisited all of them over the years, but I have gone back recently and \nalmost completed a round of going to see them all about this bill, \nsitting down with rural hospitals in northeastern Connecticut to major \nurban hospitals in Bridgeport and Hartford. I wish I could take \neveryone with me to see what everyone does. I know this is the case in \nother States where people do a remarkable job every day. If you show up \nin a hospital, they treat you. No one gets turned away. It is a \nwonderful thing about our health care system, the people who work in \nthem every single day, reaching out to try and make a difference in the \nlives of these individuals, and how frustrating it is for these health \ncare providers.\n  I met with a group of ophthamologists in Hartford. One doctor was \ntelling me how a family came to him the other night with a child that \nclearly needed a medical device and technology and knowing what a \ndifference it could make for her. Yet that insurance company said: No, \nyou can't do it; we don't provide that kind of coverage. The \nfrustration that doctor expressed because he couldn't provide what that \nfamily needed. They didn't have the resources financially to pay for \nit, and they were being turned down. That child could not get that \nhelp. Under our bill that won't happen, if we can get this legislation \ndone. Examples like that child happen every day across this great \ncountry of ours.\n  The high cost of health care has bankrupted millions of families. The \nsystem, in many ways, despite its strengths, is broken in too many \nplaces as well. Without reform, health care will continue to eat up \nlarger and larger shares of budgets--the Federal budget, State budgets, \nbusiness budgets and, of course, family budgets. Budgets, particularly \nfamily and business budgets, are at breaking points. The high cost of \nhealth care has bankrupted millions of families, shuttered the doors of \nbusinesses, forced States to make impossible choices, and put \nunimaginable strain on the Federal bottom line. If we don't address the \nskyrocketing cost of health care, more and more families, more and more \nbusinesses could lose everything and our deficit will explode. As bad \nas it is today, it gets worse if we do nothing.\n  That is the bigger picture. But the reality of our broken system can \nbe captured by the tragedies that play out in American homes every \nsingle day. As we have discussed, tens of millions of our fellow \ncitizens who don't have health insurance at all go to bed every single \nnight knowing that if they wake up sick or their children wake up ill \nor in need of medical care, they might not be able to see a doctor to \nget the medical care they need. Many of these Americans don't have \ninsurance because they can't get insurance, they have a preexisting \ncondition, and no insurance company wants them on their rolls.\n  There are even more Americans who do have insurance but can't be sure \nof anything these days when it comes to their health care. They are \npaying more and more in premiums, twice what they paid even a decade \nago. Yet they are getting less and less and less coverage for their \nmoney. They lie awake at night wondering, what if I lose my job, as \nmany have over these last number of weeks and months, what if I get \nsick and find out my policy doesn't cover the care I need or, even \nworse, my insurance company cancels my policy altogether. What if I run \nout of benefits and have to pay out of my pocket. These are not \nirrational fears. They are anything but irrational fears. Millions of \nour fellow citizens have them every single day, and these nightmares \ncome true for far too many of our citizens. People lose their homes \nbecause they get sick. People die because they can't afford care.\n  This does not happen to the 8 million of us who are Federal \nemployees, all of us who serve in this body and the 435 who serve in \nthe other body. Like all Federal employees, we have a special \nmarketplace. Every year each one of us gets to choose from a long menu \nof insurance options. We sit down. We pick a plan that makes sense for \nus and our families, and we know the coverage we have chosen will be \nthere when we need it. Every American should have the same opportunity \nas the people who represent them in the Halls of Congress. That is what \nour bill tries to do.\n  For too long health insurance has been a seller's market. Depending \nupon where you live, you may or may not have more than one option or \ntwo options to choose from. Sometimes there aren't any good options at \nall. You pay whatever the insurance companies want to charge you, and \nyou get whatever coverage they feel like giving you. You are covered \nonly until they decide they don't want to cover you any longer. By the \nway, if you lose your job, or if you want to change your job, if you \nwant to start a business, if you want to move, you could lose your \ncoverage entirely.\n  Our bill is designed to help you get a better deal and empowers every \nAmerican family to pick the plan that works for them, creating a real \nmarketplace, like the one Federal employees have, that members of \ncongress have, with multiple insurance companies competing for your \nbusiness and a real choice for you and your family. If you like what \nyou have now, great, keep it. If you don't, you will have more and \nbetter options to consider. If you are one of the millions of uninsured \nAmericans who has been denied coverage because of a preexisting \ncondition, you will immediately have access to affordable coverage so \nthat you will have insurance while this marketplace is being \nestablished. In that marketplace, you will finally have a chance to \nfind affordable insurance that works for you and your family. No matter \nwho you are or which plan you choose, you will have less expensive \noptions. Insurance will be available regardless of your age or your \nhealth. And once you\n\n[[Page S11994]]\n\nhave it, the insurance company won't be allowed to take it away. You \nstay covered even if you lose your job, even if you move, even if you \nget sick.\n\n  On the day this bill is enacted, health insurance becomes a buyer's \nmarket, not a seller's market. That is as American as apple pie, having \nchoices, good old competition out there. So little of it exists today. \nOur bill is designed to promote and create more of it. When businesses \nhave to compete for your business, we all do better. Businesses do well \nand, obviously, the consumer has better choices. As other pieces of the \nlegislation begin to take effect, our health care system will become \nless expensive and more responsive to the needs of the American people. \nBecause American families and businesses literally can't afford more of \nthe status quo, our bill makes health care more affordable.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, if you are buying \nhealth insurance in the individual market under the senate bill, \npremiums may be up to 20 percent lower than equivalent coverage today. \nAccording to CBO, if you are buying health insurance in the individual \nmarket, you could see premium costs be as much as 20 percent lower than \nwhat they are today. If you are working for a small business, according \nto CBO, your premiums may be up to 11 percent lower than what they are \ntoday. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, if you work \nfor a large employer, which five out of six Americans do, your premiums \ncould be lowered by as much as 3 percent. In every single category--\nindividuals, small businesses, as well as large employers--premium \ncosts come down under our bill, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  Compare that to the status quo of doing nothing or defeating this \nbill. I can't speak for every State, but I suspect these numbers are \nprobably pretty much true across the country. In Connecticut, in the \nyear 2000, a family of four paid on average around $6 to $7,000 a year \nin health care premiums. Today that same family in my State, 9 years \nlater, is paying over $12,000 for that same coverage. And if we do \nnothing in the coming days, those numbers will jump to around $24 to \n$25,000 in 7 years and as much as $35,000 in 10 years.\n  Compare that with what we offer here in this bill. The CBO says we \ncan actually lower premium costs in the individual market, the small \ngroup market, and the large group market. That is what is in this bill. \nThat is why it is deserving of our support.\n  Because investing in keeping people well is more cost effective than \nwaiting to treat them when they get sick, this legislation puts a focus \non prevention. Let me pay a particular tribute to Senator Tom Harkin, \nnow chairman of the HELP Committee, who spent a long time on the \nprevention piece of this bill, as I know the Finance Committee did as \nwell, combining efforts to encourage more effort in reducing the \ntremendous problems that are associated with four or five illnesses \nthat consume about 70 or 75 percent of the health care dollar. You \ncan't wipe them out altogether, but by working on prevention, dealing \nwith obesity, smoking, cardiovascular problems, you can make a \ndifference in those areas alone.\n  I know my fellow members of the HELP Committee, we passed \nlegislation--and my good friend Mike Enzi was a part of this and a \nstrong supporter on the floor of this body--when for the first time in \nAmerica history, the Food and Drug Administration can now regulate \ntobacco products. They can regulate mascara, cat food, dog food, men's \ncologne, all of those things get regulated, but tobacco did not. We \nchanged that. We finally have regulation of the sale, marketing, and \nthe production of tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration. \nThat is $180 billion a year in health-care related costs. Four hundred \nthousand people die every year from smoking-related products; 3,500 \nyoung people today will start smoking in the United States; 1,000 will \nbecome addicted for life, 3,500 a day just in that one area. If we can \nreduce people's dependency on those products, if we can get people to \nquit, if we can stop children from starting in the first place, what a \ndifference that can make for people all across the country. From \ndiabetes screenings to quit smoking programs to mammograms, you will be \nable to get preventive care at no cost to you under this bill. That we \ndo right off the bat so you can stay well even if your family is not \nwealthy.\n  Because our seniors should be able to afford the prescriptions they \nneed to stay healthy, this bill will shrink the Medicare Part D \ndoughnut hole, giving seniors a 50-percent discount on medications. \nThat is a huge savings to our people. Because 200 million American \nadults don't have insurance protection in place to handle the cost of \nlong-term services and supports, our bill creates a new program that \nwill give American families peace of mind, help working people who are \nalso taking care of a loved one, and save Medicaid dollars in State and \nFederal budgets.\n  Because we need our small businesses to do what they do best--create \njobs--our bill alleviates their burden by providing a tax credit to \nhelp them cover the cost of providing health care to their employees, \nas so many of them want to do. And because a buyers' market depends on \neducated buyers, our bill will empower consumers by eliminating the \nfine print in insurance policies. You will be able to make an apples-\nto-apples comparison when shopping for health insurance.\n  Again, according to the Congressional Budget Office, families and \nbusinesses will save money because this new marketplace will bring down \nadministrative costs, ensuring you get the most out of your premium \npayments and increased competition for your business--competition that \nis increased even further with a strong public option as well.\n  The analysis confirms that if you like the plan the way it is, the \nbill explicitly provides that you will be able to keep it. In fact, \njust so we are clear, let me quote from the CBO, the Congressional \nBudget Office, analysis released today. I quote them:\n\n       [I]f they wanted to, current policyholders in the nongroup \n     market would be allowed to keep their policy with no changes, \n     and the premiums for those policies would probably not differ \n     substantially from current-law levels.\n\n  The CBO estimates that as the marketplace gets up and running, the \ndeficit will go down by $130 billion in the first 10 years after this \nbill passes and by $650 billion more in the second decade.\n  This bill lets you keep your insurance if you like it, this bill \nprotects seniors, this bill gives families more choice, and this bill \nsaves money.\n  While I hope we can keep our facts straight, let me say at the outset \nthat I expect this to be a full, open, and at times passionate debate \nin this Chamber, as it should be. This is an issue that represents a \nfull one-sixth, as you have heard already, Madam President, of our \neconomy, and it affects every single one of our citizens. Still, I \nunderstand that no matter how patiently and thoroughly we discuss this \nissue, some will, of course, insist we are attempting to rush through a \npiece of partisan legislation. Again, let's get our facts straight. \nThus far, between the two committees responsible for drafting this \nbill, we have held more than 100 bipartisan meetings, devoted more than \n20 days toward the amendment process, considered more than 400 \namendments, and, despite what I have heard, we accepted 170 amendments \noffered by the minority, including some very substantive ones. Clearly, \nthere were technical ones. I am not suggesting otherwise. But to \nsuggest that all of these were such is not to portray an accurate \npicture of what occurred. The legislation we will now debate was made \navailable online 72 hours before even a procedural vote was cast.\n  Well, Madam President, I am committed to ensuring every Senator has \nthe opportunity to offer his or her suggestions. That is what we did in \nour committee. It took a long time. But while people may not have been \nhappy with the final outcome, I believe people ought to have an \nopportunity to be heard and their ideas to be vetted here and to \nengage, I hope, in a civil debate, a passionate but civil debate, not \nto engage in the ad hominem personal attacks that too often have \ncontaminated debate but, rather, you ought to stand or fail based on \nthe soundness of your ideas.\n  My dear friend Ted Kennedy spent a lifetime, as I said at the outset \nof these remarks, fighting for every American's right for decent health \ncare. It is a cause I know we all support. This is our chance to get it \nright.\n\n[[Page S11995]]\n\n  This moment calls for commonsense problem-solving that cuts the cost \nof health care, protects patient choice, and ensures every American \ngets the care they need when they need it, from the doctors and \nproviders of their choice.\n  This moment calls for compassion. We must finally hear the cry of the \nchild whose ear infection goes untreated because his or her parents \ncannot find jobs and cannot afford a doctor; the voice of the small \nbusiness owner who must choose between laying off workers and cutting \noff health benefits for them; the call of future generations who will \nsee the rising tide of health care costs become a tsunami if we do not \nact in these days.\n  Perhaps most of all, this moment calls for courage. This bill does \nnot necessarily guarantee a tickertape parade or a lot of applause \nlines. There are some very tough choices in this bill.\n  With the possible exception of the public option and a few other \nitems, I suspect that if the roles were reversed here and we were \nsitting in the minority and our friends on the other side were in the \nmajority, frankly, the bill we would be considering today might not be \nsubstantially different because, frankly, the options are not unlimited \nas to how to deal with costs and increased access and prevention. Yes, \nthere are differences. I accept that and understand that. But the kinds \nof choices Senator Baucus and his committee made, and the ones we \nconsidered in our committee, were ones I believe most of my colleagues \nbelieve generally have to be dealt with: the quality of care, \nstrengthening our workforce, dealing with the delivery system, \nincreasing prevention and wellness in this country. What steps do we \ntake? We can differ over this item or that, but I believe we generally \nbelieve these are items that must be part of a significant health care \nproposal. So I suspect these bills, were the roles reversed, might not \nbe substantially different. It might not be that different.\n  Perhaps most of all, it is important we find the means to come \ntogether. The road we are on, the status quo, leads to ruin, in my \nview, for our economy and for our fellow citizens. The road to reform \nis a long and difficult one, but we have taken so many unprecedented \nsteps just to come to this place. It is time now to finish the job.\n  So I am prepared--as I know our leader is and as I know my friend \nfrom Montana, the chairman of the Finance Committee, is, as are the \nmembers of that committee, as I believe most of our colleagues here--we \nwould like a legacy to be left long after we have departed this Chamber \nthat will say that in the first decade of the 21st century, when faced \nwith the daunting challenge of doing something positive to increase the \navailability, increase the quality, and decrease the cost of health \ncare in America, this Congress rose to the challenge and met its \nobligations. I feel optimistic we can achieve that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I have a few small matters here before I \nyield to my friend from Iowa.\n  First, I cannot thank my colleague from Connecticut enough. He has \nworked so hard as the former chairman of the HELP Committee and now as \na very active participant in the HELP Committee, along with Chairman \nHarkin. I cannot thank him enough. The Senator from Connecticut has \nworked on health care in such a constructive way. I deeply appreciate \nhis efforts.\n  Before I give up the floor, I wish to pay my strongest compliments to \nmy colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley is one heck \nof a guy. He represents his State, in my judgment, very, very well. As \nI am sure the Presiding Officer knows--certainly my colleague from \nConnecticut knows--we have worked very closely together, Senator \nGrassley and I, on a nonpartisan basis as much as we possibly can \nbecause we both think--and I know most people think--good legislation \nis legislation where you work together, not where you are fighting each \nother.\n  Senator Grassley and I started out trying to get this bill put \ntogether on a bipartisan basis working together. As it turned out, we \ndid not quite get there. But I know in the end he would very much like \nto find a way to vote for health care reform, as most Members of the \nSenate would.\n  I am an optimist. I think most of us in this body are optimists. I \nhave not given up yet. Who knows how this is going to evolve? Who knows \nwhat the amendments are going to be? Who knows what the votes are going \nto be in the next several weeks or so? But I am looking for an \nopportunity where Senator Grassley and other very constructive Senators \nwill join us, all together, in a way, with a little give and take here, \nperhaps, to find a solution.\n  So I just want to end by saying how much I appreciate the Senator. He \ndoes a super job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nhis kind remarks. He does describe the situation very well, \nparticularly one where there was a very close working relationship \nduring the summer and up until the middle of September, when people in \nthis body felt we were not moving fast enough to get a product before \nthe body, and so some of us were shoved to the side, not by Senator \nBaucus but by other people in this body.\n  I also compliment Senator Dodd from this standpoint--that as I look \nat this 2,074-page bill we call health care reform, that as he \ndescribed parts of this bill, I think you get a broad consensus that \nthe things he talked about should be done. But that does not describe \neverything in this bill and it does not describe the opposition that \ncomes to a certain part of this bill now, not only by Members of the \nbody, but if you follow polls and town meetings around the country, you \nfind a lot of the people are having second thoughts about the words \n``health care reform.''\n  I would suggest to you, if you were in a coffee shop in any small \ntown of the United States and they were talking about health care \nreform, and I came into that coffee meeting and I said: The bill before \nthe U.S. Senate is going to raise premiums, it is going to raise taxes, \nit is going to take hundreds of billions of dollars out of Medicare, \nand it is not going to do anything about the inflation of health care, \nI will bet you that people at the end of that would say: Well, that \ndoesn't sound like health care reform to me.\n  Even though Senator Dodd describes a lot of things that are neither \nDemocratic nor Republican nor even bipartisan, there is kind of a \nconsensus that these things ought to be done. He describes it \naccurately. But, still, a lot of goals that were sought by those of us \nwho were negotiating these things over a period of several months--that \nwe ought to have it be revenue neutral--and on the 10-year budget \nwindow, it is revenue neutral. But, remember, that is 10 years of \nincreased taxes and 6 years of program to make that happen. So you \nraise the question, if it was 10 years of expenditures and 10 years of \nincome, would it be revenue neutral? Well, obviously not. And it does \nnot do anything about health care inflation. Those are two goals that \nwere sought over a long period of time. This 2,074-page bill does not \ndo that.\n  I believe the people of the United States think our country has the \nbest doctors and nurses in the world. But as Senator Dodd pointed out, \nthere is widespread agreement that the health care system in America \ndoes have problems. Costs are rising three times the rate of inflation. \nAmericans are uninsured. Millions more fear losing their insurance in a \nweak economy and because of preexisting conditions. Doctors are ready \nto close their doors over high malpractice costs and low government \nreimbursement. So everybody says we need health care reform. Everybody \nagrees on that very much.\n  But, today, the Senate begins debate on a bill--2,074 pages--that \nwould make a bad situation worse. It is unfortunate that early efforts \nto reach bipartisan solutions in Congress deteriorated into leadership-\ndriven, partisan exercises.\n  The bills in Congress slide rapidly down the slippery slope to more \nand more government control of health care. They contain the biggest \nexpansion of Medicaid since it was created 43 years ago. They impose an \nunprecedented Federal mandate for coverage, backed by enforcement \nauthority of the Internal Revenue Service. They increase the size of \ngovernment by $2.5 trillion when fully implemented. They give the \nSecretary of Health and\n\n[[Page S11996]]\n\nHuman Services extraordinary powers to actually define benefits for \nevery private health plan in America and to redefine those benefits \nannually. They create dozens of new Federal bureaucracies and programs \nto increase the scope of the Federal Government's role in health care. \nThat is a lot of power over people's lives, and it is concentrated here \nin Washington, DC, in the Federal Government.\n  The excesses of the bill appear willfully ignorant of what is going \non in the rest of the economy outside of health care. These excesses \nmake the bill far worse than doing nothing.\n  At this point in our Nation's history, we are a nation facing very \nchallenging economic times--some people would say the great recession, \nnot quite the Great Depression; other people would say the worst \nrecession we have had since 1982. What have we seen? We have seen the \nauto industry go into bankruptcy. We have seen banks shutter their \ndoors.\n\n  I have a chart that is up. We call it the wall of debt chart. The \nFederal debt has increased by $1.4 trillion just since inauguration. \nThis chart shows the growing amount of debt the Federal Government is \ntaking on. The amount of increased debt added just since the \ninauguration is $11,500 per household. It now exceeds $12 trillion for \nthe first time in history.\n  Within 5 years, the Obama administration's policies will more than \ndouble the amount of debt held by the public, and by 2019 it will more \nthan triple the debt. That is not according to this Senator but \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office and the White House Office \nof Management and Budget. Already, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasurys \nstands at nearly $3.5 trillion or 46 percent of the Federal debt held \nby the public. In other words, people outside of this country are \nholding 46 percent of our Federal debt.\n  At the beginning of this debate, one of the key promises of health \ncare reform was--and I said this previously, but I will repeat it now--\nthat it would bring down Federal health costs. This needs to be done \nbefore health spending sinks the Federal budget and saddles the \ntaxpayer.\n  I have another chart, a health spending chart or, more accurately, a \nFederal health spending chart. As this chart illustrates, this bill \nbends the Federal spending curve further upward by $160 billion over \nthe next decade. The red area of this chart, emphasizing the red area \nof the chart, shows net additional Federal health spending--again, not \naccording to this Senator but according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  Americans have rightly lost faith when, in the face of the current \neconomic crisis--the ``great recession''--Congress thinks this $2.5 \ntrillion restructuring of our health care system is a good idea.\n  The Reid bill also includes a government-run plan. A government-run \nplan would drive private insurers out of business and lead to a \ngovernment takeover of the health care system. From rationing health \ncare to infringing on doctor-patient relationships, a government-run \nsystem would guarantee U.S. taxpayers a staggering tax burden for \ngenerations to come.\n  The government cannot be a regulator, a funder, and a competitor at \nthe same time without doing a great deal of damage to what the private \nsector has been doing for 60-some years. A government-run plan is not \nnecessary for health care reform unless perchance the goal is to put in \nplace the power of the Federal Government to drive down costs by--how? \nNot just driving them down but the consequences of that: rationing care \nand slashing payments to providers. These problems are bad enough, but \nmuch worse is that this bill--this bill--fails to solve the fundamental \nproblems in health care. None of them take serious steps to reduce \ncosts in health care.\n  The bills will cause health care premiums for scores of people to go \nup, not down. An analysis just released this very day by the \nCongressional Budget Office confirms our worst fears about the impact \nthis bill will have on people's health insurance premiums. According to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the new benefit mandates and \nregulatory changes will actually increase costs of nongroup health \ninsurance for individuals and families by 10 to 13 percent. That means \nmillions of people who are expecting lower costs as a result of health \ncare reform will end up paying more in the form of higher premiums. For \nlarge and small employers that have been struggling for years with \nskyrocketing health insurance premiums, the Congressional Budget Office \nconcludes this bill will do little, if anything, to provide relief.\n  In fact, they cover their increased premiums they cause by spending \neven more on subsidies because of the increased premiums. So what \nhappens? They do this by handing over close to $500 billion in hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars directly to health insurance companies. That \nsure doesn't sound as though this bill is actually reforming the \nmarket. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis makes \nclear the Reid bill is not fixing the problem.\n  The Reid bill also imposes new fees and taxes that will be pushed \ndirectly to the consumer. These new fees and taxes will total about \none-half trillion dollars over the next few years. On the front end, \nthese fees and taxes will cause premium increases beginning next year \nwhen they go into effect, and those new fees increase premiums--for 4 \nyears; they are there for 4 years--before most of the reforms take \neffect in 2014.\n  Then after forcing health premiums to go up, the legislation makes it \nmandatory to buy health insurance. Let's think about mandatory health \ninsurance. The Federal Government is a government of limited powers \nunder the 10th amendment. To my knowledge--and I think I know a lot \nabout U.S. history--never in 225 years has the Federal Government said \nyou had to buy anything. You don't have to buy--you buy what you want \nto buy in America, but not when this 2,054-page bill goes into effect. \nThen you will buy health insurance.\n  Somebody is going to throw at us: Well, the States make you buy car \ninsurance, and probably most States do. My State of Iowa does. But \nunder the 10th amendment, the State governments have a lot of power the \nFederal Government doesn't have.\n  The Reid bill also makes problematic changes to Medicare. It imposes \nhigher premiums for prescription drug coverage on seniors and the \ndisabled. The Reid bill creates a new independent Medicare board with \nbroad authority to make further cuts in Medicare, and this bill makes \nthat commission permanent. The damage this group of unelected people \ncould do to Medicare is, in fact, unknown.\n  What is more alarming is that so many providers got exempted--they \nhave political power, so they got exempted from the cuts this board \nwould make--that it forces the cuts. Then what happens? They fall \ndirectly and disproportionately on seniors and the disabled.\n  Sooner or later, it has to be acknowledged that by making this board \npermanent, those savings are coming more and more--are going to bring \nmore and more cuts to Medicare. That is a good example of the \nphilosophical differences between the two sides in this body, and as \nthe country divides itself more against this 2,054-page bill than for \nit, but still a large number of people in America support going in this \ndirection. So those are philosophical differences between the two \nsides.\n  There are alternatives. Some of us want to reduce the overall cost of \nthe legislation. We want to try to reduce the pervasive role of \ngovernment, make it harder for undocumented workers to get benefits, \nallow alternatives to the individual mandate and harsh penalties, and \nadd medical malpractice reforms. I bring a little bit of emphasis to \nmedical malpractice reform because at my town meetings throughout this \npast year and particularly during the month of August people would say: \nWhy don't you first try to save money in health care costs by taking on \nthe lawyers and doing medical malpractice reform? But, instead, the \nprevailing view is to move millions of people from private coverage \ninto public coverage and create new government programs that cover \nfamilies making close to $90,000. Yet, even with all of these changes, \nafter raising one-half trillion dollars in new taxes, cutting one-half \ntrillion dollars in Medicare, imposing stiff new penalties for people \nwho don't buy insurance, and increasing costs for those who do--after \nall of these changes, the Congressional\n\n[[Page S11997]]\n\nBudget Office says there are still 24 million people who will not have \nhealth insurance under the Reid bill.\n  I don't think this is what the American people had in mind when the \nPresident and the Congress promised to fix the health care system.\n  It is not too late for bipartisan legislation, so I have the hope \nthat Senator Baucus just expressed before I spoke that builds on common \nground to improve coverage, affordability, increased quality, and \ndecreased costs. So here are some more alternatives. I have worked for \nyears on bipartisan legislation that would transform Medicare from \npaying for volume of services provided to the quality of care \ndelivered. There is also widespread support for stronger rules on \ninsurance companies to make coverage more affordable and accessible, \nespecially for small businesses and for people who aren't offered \ncoverage by their employers, and for reforms to stop denials of \ncoverage due to preexisting conditions. Tort reform would reduce \nabusive lawsuits that drive up costs and surely limit access to \ndoctors. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that \ncomprehensive medical liability reform would reduce Federal budget \ndeficits by roughly $54 billion over the next 10 years. It would save \neven more when nonfederal health spending is taken into account. That \nwould mean lower premiums for individuals and families.\n\n  So far the Democratic leaders in Congress have little interest in \ncreating an environment where doctors don't have to engage in defensive \nmedicine just to keep their practices open because somebody might sue \nthem. The medical community should continue to make the case for \nreasonable reforms that will cut down on unnecessary medical tests that \nserve no purpose except to reduce malpractice premiums and to protect \nagainst frivolous lawsuits.\n  On several occasions, Republicans tried to take the legislative \nsubstance in a whole different direction. We tried to ensure the \nPresident's pledge not to tax middle-income families, seniors, and \nveterans was carried out. However, we were rebuffed at every step of \nthe way. Republicans' efforts to provide consumers with a lower cost \nbenefit option were consistently defeated. That means despite the \npromise, a lot of people are not actually going to be able to keep what \nthey have as they were promised in the last Presidential campaign.\n  The Democratic leaders in Congress are advancing their extremist \nhealth care reform bills with a bare minimum of votes to do the job. I \ndisagree with that approach. Health care is one-sixth of the economy. \nThat is as large as the entire British economy. The legislation \nCongress is considering will affect every American at every level of \nhealth and at every stage of employment. When the debate began last \nyear--in fact, it was just this month of November that I remember 8 or \n10 of us from different committees met with a solemn pledge. We were \ngoing to work together in a bipartisan way to get this job done. We met \nagain for the next 6 months several times, but it just didn't work out.\n  But when that debate began last year, interested legislators of both \nparties set benchmarks that were no-brainers:\n  Health care reform should lower the cost of premiums. It should \nreduce the deficit. It should bend the growth curve in health care the \nright way--downward. The Reid bill doesn't do any of these things.\n  It is not too late to start over. I guess Senator Baucus has put \nforth that invitation. I hope it materializes. If both sides can set \naside some philosophical differences, and if the Democratic leaders are \nwilling to refocus on the principles that brought us to the table \nmonths ago, I believe we can produce health care reform that improves \nthe quality of life for Americans who are suffering under the current \nhealth care system and doesn't degrade the quality of life for everyone \nelse.\n  But it is not the entirety of this 2,074-page bill. These issues can \nbe addressed without upending the entire health care system, with the \nresult of higher taxes, higher insurance premiums, and deficits and \ndebt that will get in the way of opportunities that result from the \ningenuity and productivity and industry of the American people.\n  I get back to that coffee shop meeting, where people are discussing \nhealth care reform. As I walk into that coffee meeting and I tell them \nthat this 2,074-page bill increases taxes, increases premiums, takes \n400 or more billion dollars out of Medicare, and it doesn't do anything \nabout controlling costs, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nthat group again will say: That doesn't sound like health care reform \nto me.\n  As we start this debate this week, I urge my colleagues to listen to \nthe American people. The Reid bill is in the wrong direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to send to the \ndesk at this time a motion to commit with instructions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] moves to commit the \n     bill H.R. 3590 to the Committee on Finance with instructions \n     to report the same back to the Senate with changes that do \n     not include the following:\n\n       (1) Medicare Advantage cuts totaling -$118.1 billion.\n       (2) Medicare Advantage payment changes totaling -$1.9 \n     billion.\n       (3) Provider cuts totaling -$150.0 billion.\n       (4) The establishment of the Independent Medicare Advisory \n     Board totaling -$23.4 billion.\n       (5) Reporting requirements for long-term care hospitals, \n     inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, and hospice programs \n     totaling -0.2 billion.\n       (6) Penalties to hospitals totaling -1.5 billion.\n       (7) The expansion of CMS spending totaling -1.3 billion\n       (8) A Medicare shared savings program totaling -4.9 \n     billion.\n       (9) Hospital penalties totaling -7.1 billion.\n       (10) A revision to the Medicare Improvement Fund totaling \n     -22.3 billion.\n       (11) Home health care cuts totaling -42.1 billion.\n       (12) Hospice payment changes totaling -0.1 billion.\n       (13) Medicare disproportionate share hospital payments \n     changes totaling -20.6 billion.\n       (14) Cuts to advanced imaging services totaling -3.0 \n     billion.\n       (15) A revision of the payment for power-driven wheelchairs \n     totaling -0.8 billion.\n       (16) Cuts for certain medigap plans totaling -0.1 billion.\n       (17) A reduction in the part D premium subsidy for high-\n     income beneficiaries totaling -10.7 billion.\n       (18) Outpatient prescription drug cuts in long-term care \n     facilities totaling -5.7 billion.\n       (19) Changes to preventive services in Medicare totaling \n     -0.7 billion.\n       (20) A limitation on the Medicare exception to the \n     prohibition on certain physician referrals for hospitals \n     totaling -0.7 billion.\n       (21) Comparative effectiveness research totaling -0.3 \n     billion.\n       (22) The elimination of indexing for part B premiums \n     totaling -25.0 billion.\n       And reflects the Sense of the Senate that any savings to \n     the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under section 1817 \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i) and the Federal \n     Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund under section 1841 \n     of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395t) by reason of the provisions of, \n     and amendments made by, sections 6401, 6405, 6407, and 6410 \n     should be used to strengthen the Medicare program under title \n     XVIII of such Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, simply put, this motion to commit would \nbe a requirement that we eliminate the one-half trillion dollars in \nMedicare cuts that are envisioned by this bill--one-half trillion \ndollars in cuts that are unspecified as to how, and one-half trillion \ndollars in cuts that would directly impact the health care of citizens \nin this country--Medicare Advantage cuts totaling $118 billion; an \nindependent Medicare advisory board that would cost $23 billion; an \nexpansion of Medicare hospital penalties totaling $7.1 billion; home \nhealth care cuts totaling $42.1 billion; and hospice--of all the \nthings--payment changes. The list goes on and on.\n  All of these are cuts in the obligations we have assumed and that are \nthe rightful benefits people have earned--particularly our senior \ncitizens--across this Nation. This eliminates one-half trillion dollars \nin cuts to Medicare that are cuts that are unspecified.\n  I eagerly look forward to hearing from the authors of this \nlegislation as to how they can possibly achieve one-half trillion \ndollars in cuts without impacting existing Medicare programs negatively \nand eventually lead to rationing of health care in this country.\n\n[[Page S11998]]\n\nThat is what this motion is all about. This motion is to eliminate \nthose unwarranted cuts. All of us know there are enormous savings in \nfraud, abuse, and waste that can be identified. No expert I know of \nbelieves that would come up to one-half trillion dollars. Hospitals are \ncut by $105 billion. Nursing homes are cut by $14.6 billion. Hospices \nare cut by $7.6 billion.\n  These are not attainable cuts, without eventually rationing health \ncare in America and rationing health care for our senior citizens, who \nhave earned these benefits, and we have guaranteed them these benefits.\n  For the life of me, how the AARP can support this 2,000-page \nlegislation is beyond my imagination. Seniors all over America, \nincluding Arizona, including the 330,000 senior citizens in my State \nwho are under the Medicare Advantage Program, which will be drastically \ncut by some $120 billion, are outraged. The more they find out about \nit, the more angry they are becoming.\n  Here we are, as my colleague from the great State of Iowa, a leader \non health care, articulated, with a totally partisan measure before the \nSenate, in which no Member on this side of the aisle has been consulted \nin any way. I point out that, historically, there has never been a \nmajor reform implemented by the Congress of the United States unless it \nis bipartisan in nature, and I don't believe the American people want \nthis 2,000-some-page monstrosity, which is full of all kinds of \nprovisions that they are either unaware of, or even in the study of \nthis legislation, many of us have also become unaware of. But \nfundamentally, the Bernie Madoff/Enron accounting that has been going \non with this bill is dependent upon envisioning one-half trillion \ndollars in cuts that are not attainable. If they are attainable, it \nwould mean a direct curtailment and reduction of the benefits we have \npromised the senior citizens of this country. That is not acceptable.\n  What this motion to commit does is send it back to the Finance \nCommittee: Come back with another bill. Only this time, don't put the \ncost of it on the backs of senior citizens of this country. Don't do \nit. It was back last summer, 3 months before he was elected President, \non a campaign stop not far from Washington, DC, now-President Obama \nvowed not only to reform health care but to do it in a new way. He \nsaid:\n\n       I am going to have all the negotiations around a big table, \n     televised on C-SPAN, so that people can see who is making \n     arguments on behalf of their constituents and who are making \n     arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance \n     companies.\n\n  Americans wanted to believe this would be true. Republicans offered \nto work with the majority on our ideas. But that was rejected. So what \nhas happened? Business as usual. Let me read from a report of this past \nweekend about business as usual:\n\n       The Associated Press has moved a story saying that health \n     care lobbyists and other interests have made 575 visits to \n     the White House between January and August. The report is \n     based on records released by the White House on Wednesday.\n       The timing of the release smells of a classic Washington \n     tactic--dumping bad news on the getaway day before a long \n     weekend. Clearly, the White House, which prides itself as \n     being the most transparent administration in the history of \n     the world, hopes this nugget gets lost over the four-day \n     Thanksgiving weekend.\n\n  AP's Sharon Theimer:\n\n       Top aides to President Barack Obama have met early and \n     often with lobbyists, Democratic political strategists and \n     other interests with a stake in the administration's national \n     health care overhaul, White House visitors records obtained \n     Wednesday by the Associated Press show.\n\n  All of my fellow citizens watching, I urge you to call the White \nHouse and say you want to have an appointment to meet with the \nPresident or members of the administration in the White House. Five-\nhundred-seventy-five special interests were able to get in. Why can't \nyou? Give them a call. Tell them you want to meet with the members of \nthe administration. That is what 575 lobbyists have been able to do. \nGive them a call.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       The records show a broad cross-section of the people most \n     heavily involved in the health care debate [except for \n     average citizens] weighted heavily with those who want to \n     overhaul the system.\n\n  It talks about who were among them.\n\n       The list also includes George Halvorson, chairman and CEO \n     of Kaiser Health Plans; Scott Serota, president and CEO of \n     Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association; Kenneth Kies, a \n     Washington lobbyist who represents Blue Cross/Blue Shield, \n     among other clients; Billy Tauzin, head of PHARMA, the drug \n     industry lobby; and Richard Umbdenstock, chief of the \n     American Hospital Associations.\n       Several lobbyists for powerful health care interests, \n     including insurers, drug companies, and large employers also \n     visited the White House complex, the records show.\n\n  Again, citizens, why don't you call the White House and ask for an \nappointment? The lobbyists and special interests--big donors--get it. \nThey are not ambassadors. They are lobbying the White House on this \nissue.\n  Health care reform should have been about both sides sitting down \ntogether and fixing what is broken, reducing health care costs, while \npreserving the highest quality health care in the world.\n  Somewhere in the course of this debate, in the process of this \nlegislation, we have lost sight of the fundamental problem with health \ncare in America, and that is the cost of health care in America, not \nthe quality. This legislation will destroy the quality and the \navailability, if the cuts envisioned in this legislation--this Enron \naccounting measure, where the first 4 years after this legislation--\nsuppose this legislation were signed on the 1st of January by the \nPresident of the United States. Immediately benefits will begin being \ncut. Immediately taxes will go up. Guess what. None of the benefits \nwill be given to any American citizen for 4 years. That is how you get \ndeficit neutrality. That is how you get deficit neutrality.\n  If you started giving the benefits at the same time you raise the \ntaxes, you have got about $1.3 trillion in deficit in a $2.5 trillion \nbill--a $2.5 trillion piece of legislation. Here we are with the \nhighest deficits in history, with deficits and debt as far as the eye \ncan see, with a stimulus package that has done so well that we now have \n10.2 percent unemployment, and many predict it will go even higher. \nWall Street is doing fine, and lobbyists are doing fine. Mr. Tauzin, \nthe PhRMA lobbyist, is doing fine. I understand his salary is a couple \nmillion dollars a year, not to mention all the other perks. But the \naverage citizen, including the 330,000 citizens of my State, who have \nthe Medicare Advantage Program, are going to see it cut and cut over \nand over again--about $120 billion worth.\n  So what happened? The White House engaged in the tradition of handing \nout favors to special interests, including PhRMA, AARP, and AMA. Shame \non AARP and shame on the AMA. We know there are many commonsense \nreforms that Americans want.\n  By the way, in this monstrosity, find me any significant, real \nmedical malpractice reform. The threat of medical malpractice causes \nphysicians to practice defensive medicine. The CBO estimates it would \nbe roughly a savings of $54 billion over 10 years. That does not take \ninto consideration the cost of defensive medicine that doctors have to \npractice because of fear of being sued.\n  I ask the distinguished chairman of the committee: Where is any \nmeaningful medical malpractice reform in this 2,000-page bill? Where is \nit?\n  I had a townhall meeting the other day in Arizona, as I do quite \nfrequently. There were a lot of doctors, nurses, and caregivers who \ncame. I asked them: What do you do about medical malpractice reform? \nEvery one of them said: We practice defensive medicine. We prescribe \nadditional tests and procedures. We have to do it because we will find \nourselves in court by the trial lawyers.\n  Do not underestimate, I say to my friends, the many special interests \nand their influence in this legislation, but do not underestimate the \nstunning success of the American Trial Lawyers Association that has \nmade sure there is no provision in this bill that has to do with \nmedical malpractice reform.\n  By the way, if there is an example, it is called the State of Texas. \nThe State of Texas enacted meaningful and yet not draconian medical \nmalpractice reform. Premiums have gone down. Cases have gone down. \nDoctors are flooding back into the State of Texas. It has worked.\n  We are going to hear from the other side that there may be \ndemonstration projects, there may be this, there may be that. The \ndemonstration project is the State of Texas. That is all we have to do. \nIt has already been proven.\n\n[[Page S11999]]\n\n  Instead of a reform which could save tens if not a couple hundred \nbillion dollars, what are we going to do? We are going to cut hospitals \nby $505 billion, nursing homes by $14.6 billion, hospices by $7.6 \nbillion, and the list goes on and on, up to one-half trillion dollars. \nMy motion will send it back to the Finance Committee and tell them to \nremove these unnecessary, unneeded, unwanted, harmful cuts in the \nMedicare system, which will not allow us to fulfill our obligation to \nthe senior citizens of this country.\n  Buried in this partisan legislation, as I mentioned, are 10 years of \ntax increases and Medicare cuts, a total over $1 trillion. Using CBO \nnumbers, this stack of partisan legislation costs $2.5 trillion over \nits 10-year implementation.\n  Let me put this in different terms for you. Suppose you want to buy a \nhouse. You go and buy the house, but the terms of the contract of \npurchasing the house say you have to make payments on the house for the \nfirst 4 years and then after 4 years you can move in. That is why this \nis Bernie Madoff accounting. It is a sham. It is a sham. It is a sham \nto make people pay taxes and have their benefits cut for 4 years and \nthen only after 4 years do the benefits kick in. That is the way, with \nthis kind of accounting, they get to deficit neutral. It is crazy. It \nis crazy.\n  The increased taxes and Medicare cuts begin impacting Americans and \nour economy in 32 days, if this is passed. Let me repeat this. Starting \nin January 2010, just 1 month from now, the majority begins tax \nincreases and Medicare cuts, starting in January, and incredibly delays \nimplementation of this bill for 4 years. That is 1,460 days and 208 \nweeks of new taxes and Medicare cuts before implementation. That is \nplaying games with the American people.\n  If they were not playing games by delaying implementation of the bill \n4 years after the tax increases and Medicare cuts, we would not even be \ndiscussing this pile of legislation because it would be scored as \nadding over $1 trillion to our deficit.\n  If the other side wanted to be honest and reject the Madoff-Enron \naccounting, they would be talking about the first 10 years of real \ncosts and the first 10 years of their tax increases and Medicare cuts.\n  The respected dean of the Washington press corps, David Broder, \npointed this out just last week in his column in the Washington Post \nentitled ``A Budget-Buster in the Making.'' By the way, the majority \nleader then felt compelled to come down and trash one of the most \nrespected columnists in America whom I don't need to take the time to \ndefend; he can defend himself and so will many others who have great \nrespect for David Broder.\n  David Broder's column said:\n\n       It's simply not true that America is ambivalent about \n     everything when it comes to the Obama health plan.\n       The day after the Congressional Budget Office gave its \n     qualified blessing to the version of health reform produced \n     by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Quinnipiac University \n     poll of a national cross section of voters reported its \n     latest results.\n       . . . by a 16-point margin, the majority in this poll said \n     they oppose the legislation moving through Congress.\n\n  Broder went on to say:\n\n       I have been writing for months that the acid test for this \n     effort lies less in the publicized fight over the public \n     option or the issue of abortion coverage than the \n     plausibility of its claim to be fiscally responsible.\n       This is obviously turning out to be the case. While the CBO \n     said that both the House-passed bill and the one Reid has \n     drafted meet Obama's test by being budget-neutral, every \n     expert I have talked to says that the public has it right. \n     These bills, as they stand, are budget-busters.\n       Here, for example, is what Robert Bixby, the executive \n     director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group of \n     budget watchdogs, told me: ``The Senate bill is better than \n     the House version, but there's not much reform in this bill. \n     As of now, it's basically a big entitlement expansion, plus \n     tax increases.''\n       These are nonpartisan sources, but Republican budget \n     experts such as former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin \n     amplify the point with specific examples and biting language. \n     Holtz-Eakin cites a long list of Democratic-sponsored \n     ``budget gimmicks'' that made it possible for the CBO to \n     estimate that Reid's bill would reduce federal deficits by \n     $130 billion by 2019.\n       Perhaps the biggest of these maneuvers was Reid's decision \n     to postpone the start of subsidies to help the uninsured buy \n     policies from mid-2013 to January 2014--long after taxes and \n     fees levied by the bill would have begun.\n       Even with that change, there is plenty in the CBO report to \n     suggest that the promised budget savings may not materialize. \n     If you read deep enough, you will find that under the Senate \n     bill, ``federal outlays for health care would increase during \n     the 2010-2019 period''--not decline. The gross increase would \n     be almost $1 trillion--$848 billion, to be exact, mainly to \n     subsidize the uninsured. The net increase would be $160 \n     billion.\n       But this depends on two big gambles. Will future Congresses \n     actually impose the assumed $420 billion in cuts to Medicare, \n     Medicaid and other federal programs? They never have.\n\n  Why don't we tell the truth to the American people and take these \nsupposed cuts out of this bill? Tell them the truth about what it costs \nand tell them the truth that this is a dramatic expansion of \nentitlements, but at the same time those presently eligible, those \nsenior citizens, such as the 330,000 who are under the Medicare \nAdvantage Program in my home State of Arizona, will not see that \nprogram maintained. You cannot reach these kinds of savings, these \nkinds of reductions, these kinds of cuts without impacting existing \nprograms. I know of no expert who says it will who is an objective \nobserver. I believe Dr. Coburn, Dr. Barrasso, and others in the medical \nprofession will say the same thing. Every time Congress has enacted so-\ncalled cuts in Medicare or contemplated it, they have never taken \nplace.\n  That doctor fix? We took care of that problem. We just took it out of \nthe bill. But you know what we are going to do about the doctor fix. \nEvery year we are going to delay it, delay it and delay it and it will \nnever happen. That has been the history of the so-called doctor fix \nsince its beginning.\n\n       And will this Congress enact the excise tax on high-premium \n     insurance policies (the so-called Cadillac plans) in Reid's \n     bill? Obama has never endorsed them, and House Democrats--\n     reacting to union pressure--turned them down in favor of a \n     surtax on millionaires' income.\n       The challenge to Congress--and to Obama--remains the same: \n     Make the promised savings real, and don't pass along unfunded \n     programs to our children and our grandchildren.\n\n  That means taking this legislation back, taking out these cuts in \nMedicare and programs that are vital to the citizens of this country \nand come back with a realistic--a realistic--piece of legislation that \nhas malpractice reform, the ability to go across State lines to get the \nhealth insurance policy of your choice, rewards for wellness and \nfitness, expansion of health savings accounts, and medical malpractice \nreform.\n  There are many cost-saving measures we can enact to bring the cost of \nhealth care in America under control and preserve quality. Instead, we \nare doing the opposite.\n  If you are going to make these kinds of cuts--the $420 billion in \ncuts to Medicare and Medicaid and other Federal health programs--then \nyou are going to impact the provision of health care in America.\n  Americans have been clear overspending has to stop, nor do the \nAmerican people believe empowering Washington bureaucrats in a new \nFederal health care entitlement is health care reform. The other side \ndisregards the message from the American people all across the country, \nand the bill does the opposite.\n  I wish to talk just for a minute about a provision in this bill that \nis very important; that is, the transfer of power, the massive transfer \nof power in this bill to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. \nThis is a huge transfer. ``HHS would become federal giant under Senate \nplan'' by Susan Ferrechio:\n\n       A quick search of the Senate health bill will bring up \n     ``secretary'' 2,500 times.\n       That's because Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen \n     Sebelius would be awarded unprecedented new powers under the \n     proposal, including the authority to decide what medical care \n     should be covered by insurers as well as the terms and \n     conditions of coverage and who should receive it.\n\n  I wish to repeat that. In this bill, the Secretary has the \n``authority to decide what medical care should be covered by insurers \nas well as the terms and conditions of coverage and who should receive \nit.''\n  We saw a little precursor of that the other day with, for example, \nrecommendations concerning mammograms. A board recommended that women \nunder 50 should not get routine\n\n[[Page S12000]]\n\nmammograms. Of course, the response was incredible and justified. Women \nall over America are now alive today because they had mammograms prior \nto the age of 50. The Secretary of Health and Human Services said that \nwould not be carried out, et cetera. We are creating a situation where \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services and a board would decide \nthat.\n\n       ``The legislation lists 1,697 times where the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services is given the authority to create, \n     determine or define things in the bill,'' said Devon Herrick, \n     a health care expert at the National Center for Policy \n     Analysis.\n       For instance, on Page 122 of this 2,079-page bill, the \n     secretary is given the power to establish ``the basic per \n     enrollee, per month cost, determined on average actuarial \n     basis, for including coverage under a qualified health care \n     plan.''\n       The HHS secretary would also have the power to decide where \n     abortion is allowed under a government-run plan, which has \n     drawn opposition from Republicans and some moderate \n     Democrats.\n       And the bill even empowers the department to establish a \n     Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation that would have \n     the authority to make cost-saving cuts without having to get \n     the approval of Congress first.\n       ``It's a huge amount of power being shifted to HHS, and \n     much of it is highly discretionary,'' said Edmund Haislmaier, \n     an expert in health care policy and insurance markets at the \n     Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n       Haislmaier said one of the greatest powers HHS would gain \n     from the bill is the authority to regulate insurance. States \n     currently hold this power, and under the Senate bill, the \n     federal government would usurp it from them. This could lead \n     to the federal government putting restrictions and changes in \n     place that destabilize the private insurance market by \n     forcing companies to lower premiums and other charges, he \n     said.\n       ``Health and Human Services doesn't have any experience \n     with this,'' Haislmaier said. ``I'm looking at the potential \n     for this whole thing to just blow up on people because they \n     have no idea what they are doing. Who in the Federal \n     Government regulates insurance today? Nobody.''\n       ``The health care reform legislation would rely on the U.S. \n     Preventive Services Task Force for recommendations as to what \n     kind of screening and preventive care should be covered. Last \n     week, the group, which operates under HHS, drew sharp \n     criticism for advising that mammograms should begin at age \n     50, a decade later than the current standard.''\n       ``Critics of the bill said this was an example of how the \n     new bill could empower HHS to alter health care delivery, but \n     Democrats argue they would rather have the government making \n     these decisions.''\n\n  That is the key to it. They would rather have the government making \nthese decisions. If you like the way the post office is run, you will \nlove the way HHS runs health care in America.\n  I understand the amendment of the other side may address some of \nthis, but under the Reid bill the Senate moved to consider, beginning \nin 32 days, the language from the bill on page 1,189 authorizes the \nSecretary to modify benefits under Medicare pursuant to task force \nrecommendations. As I mentioned, how many women would have died if the \ncoverage provisions guiding the new Federal plan under mammograms had \nbeen implemented? Then, on the following page, 1,190, the Secretary is \nauthorized to deny payment for prevention services that the task force \nrecommends against. So if this unelected panel changes the preventive \nrecommendation for some other type of cancer, the Federal Government \nplan would not cover it. I don't think the American people want their \nhealth coverage decisions coming from a panel in Washington.\n  The Reid bill drives up costs and premiums. Just today the CBO \nreleased its assessment of what will happen to health insurance \npremiums under the new entitlement compared with premiums today. The \nCBO dealt a blow to claims the health care bill introduced by Senator \nReid will lower premiums when they released an analysis showing that \npremiums will go up significantly in the individual market. Premiums \nfor individuals without employer-sponsored coverage would increase 10 \nto 13 percent or $2,100 per family in 2016. The Democrats' bill \ntherefore requires individuals to purchase insurance that is more \nexpensive than would be available under current law. For small \nbusinesses and employers, the bill largely preserves the status quo and \ndoes little if anything to lower the cost. In fact, CBO estimates that \nunder the Reid bill the average family with employer-sponsored coverage \nwill soon pay more than $20,000 per year for health insurance.\n  President Obama said the following during the campaign:\n\n       I have made a solemn pledge that I will sign a universal \n     health care bill into law by the end of my first term as \n     President that will cover every American and cut the cost of \n     a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year.\n\n  Well, CBO's analysis shows that the President is breaking that pledge \nby both failing to achieve universal coverage and raising premiums, \njust as it contradicts an analysis by MIT economist John Gruber \nreleased by the White House this weekend claiming that individual \npremiums would go down. In fact, even with the generous assumptions \nmade by CBO in a number of areas, premiums will either go up or remain \nunchanged.\n  From the CBO report just today, CBO says premiums in the individual \nmarket would be 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than under the \ncurrent law. Average premiums would increase by $300 for an individual \npolicy and by $2,100 for a family policy. The new benefit and coverage \nmandates actually drive up premiums by 27 to 30 percent, and this \nincrease is offset by other factors, such as new administrative \nefficiencies.\n  CBO says that little more than half of enrollees in the individual \nmarket would receive a government subsidy. However, the bill before us \nwould still require nearly 14 million Americans to purchase \nunsubsidized insurance that is more expensive than they have today.\n  President Obama has promised that seniors will not see a reduction in \nbenefits. In fact, he said recently:\n\n       People currently signed up for Medicare Advantage are going \n     to have Medicare and the same level of benefits.\n\n  How did he get there? How do you get there when you are cutting \nMedicare Advantage by $120 billion? There is no math--old or new--that \ngets you to no change in the benefits that they have under Medicare \nAdvantage and yet cutting $120 billion. Traditional Medicare doesn't \noffer coordinated benefits that can improve the quality of care. \nTraditional Medicare doesn't have many of the aids or benefits for our \nseniors.\n  President Obama has also promised several times, ``If you like what \nyou have, you can keep it.'' The American people took those words as a \npromise that if they had a health benefit they were happy with, they \ncould keep it. I want to make sure we are helping the President keep \nhis promise. I want to help him keep his promise by sending this bill \nback, taking out the cuts that are in it on Medicare, on the $105 \nbillion cuts to hospitals, nursing homes by $14.6 billion, hospices cut \nby $7.6 billion, Medicare Advantage by $120 billion. I want to send it \nback to the Finance Committee and come back with a bill that the \nAmerican people can believe in that will preserve the solemn \nobligations we have made to our senior citizens.\n  Medicare Advantage provides the only choice in the Medicare Program \nallowing an option for seniors who want additional benefits or a better \noption. Medicare Advantage is working for nearly 11 million seniors to \ngive them a choice about their health care and better benefits. As I \nmentioned, 330,000 beneficiaries in my State of Arizona are in Medicare \nAdvantage, and they will see benefit reductions or their plan \ndisappear. Eighty-nine percent of seniors need and have some form of \nsupplemental coverage on top of Medicare to provide protections against \nout-of-pocket costs or additional benefits. Many low-income Americans \nand minorities rely on Medicare Advantage as their supplemental \ncoverage.\n  Some have claimed that cutting the ``extra payments'' to Medicare \nAdvantage plans reduces insurance company profits. Under Federal law, \nthat is simply not the case. The fact is, 75 percent of those ``extra \npayments'' go directly to better benefits for seniors under current \nlaw. The other 25 percent goes back to the Federal Government. \nUnfortunately, those extra benefits will be taken from seniors who are \nenrolled in Medicare Advantage.\n  This bill contains $120 billion in direct cuts to private Medicare \nplans. Common sense says you can't do that without affecting benefits. \nThe Congressional Budget Office thinks so as well. CBO assumes the Reid \nbill will cut benefits by more than half, from an average of $98 in \nadditional benefits to $41 a month.\n\n[[Page S12001]]\n\n  I see one of my colleagues is waiting to speak, but I hope the \nAmerican people will understand what we are trying to do. All we are \ntrying to do is send this back to be reworked, to be fixed on a \nbipartisan basis, and not to force $400-some billion in cuts and \nbenefits that we have promised the American people. We want to send it \nback and come out with a bipartisan approach. Sit down, for the first \ntime, Republicans and Democrats, have the C-SPAN cameras rolling--the \nway the President promised he would a year ago last October.\n  Let's sit down together and figure out how we can fix this.\n  The best way to fix it is to preserve the quality of health care in \nAmerica and bring down the cost, not to pass a 2,074-page monstrosity \nthat is full of the measures that would impair the ability, \nparticularly of our senior citizens, to keep the benefits they have \nearned and we have promised them.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak about health care, as we \nbegin the debate in the Senate. I am grateful we are finally at this \npoint where the Senate at long last will be debating our health care \nbill. It has been a long time in coming. Some of us have waited years, \nsome have waited for decades to be at this point in our history.\n  On the Senate floor now is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct, and we are going to be discussing various aspects of that over the \nnext couple of weeks.\n  I am reminded, as I rise today, of something Hubert Humphrey said a \nlong time ago. He said the test of the government is how it treats \nthose in the dawn of life--our children--those in the shadows of life--\nthose who have challenges in their life, as we try to help them--and \nthose in the twilight of life--older citizens across America. In large \nmeasure, we will be talking about each of those Americans in one way or \nanother and a lot of other Americans as well. I rise to speak of our \nchildren but also to spend a couple of moments talking about older \ncitizens, especially in light of some of the arguments made most \nrecently on the Senate floor.\n  I will start with our older citizens. I come from the State of \nPennsylvania where in our little State, with more than 12 million \nPennsylvanians, we have almost 1 million Pennsylvanians over the age of \n65. We have a very high number of Pennsylvanians on Medicare and also a \nlot of families who rely upon that kind of health care coverage, as we \nhave for many generations. So when we speak of those in the twilight of \nlife, we speak of many Americans who are covered by Medicare.\n  I want to make a couple of points about the bill that is on the floor \nnow. First of all, with regard to older citizens, a couple of basic \npoints on which I will provide a little more background. First of all, \nthis bill, as it relates to Medicare, will protect Medicare's already \nguaranteed benefits. The bill also reduces premiums and copays for \nolder citizens. It will ensure that older citizens can keep their own \ndoctor or doctors with whom they have developed a relationship, on whom \nthey have come to rely, and in whom they have confidence. So we want to \nmake sure they can keep their own doctors.\n  The bill keeps Medicare from going bankrupt in 8 years by stopping \nwaste, fraud, and abuse and by other provisions as well. The bill \nprovides new preventive and wellness benefits--something we have talked \nabout for every age group, but we are finally going to do something \nabout it to give people better health care options.\n  The bill also, as it relates to older citizens, lowers prescription \ndrug costs. We will talk more about that. We have had a lot of \ndiscussion over the last couple of years about the so-called doughnut \nhole. That is a very nice-sounding way of describing falling into a \nperiod of coverage, if you are an older citizen getting prescription \ndrug coverage, where you have to pay the whole freight, so to speak. \nThis bill provides relief for those who are in that so-called doughnut \nhole with regard to Medicare prescription drug coverage.\n  Finally, this bill keeps older citizens in their homes and limits \nthose who would be compelled, if they didn't get additional help, to go \ninto nursing homes. Some do. Some choose to do that. But we want to \nprovide more opportunity for people to stay in their homes, if they \ncan.\n  In terms of preserving Medicare without the changes made in this \nbill, Medicare is going broke in 8 years--not 18, not 80, but 8 years--\nif we do nothing. Older citizens will have trouble accessing their \ndoctors if we don't take action. Older citizens will have trouble \naffording prescription drugs if we don't take action. Finally, without \nreform, cost sharing for older citizens will increase to completely \nunaffordable levels.\n\n  Next, we have to make sure older citizens across America have the \nopportunity to continue to receive guaranteed protection for hospital \nstays, access to doctors, home health care, nursing home, and \nprescription drug coverage. We have to make sure we extend the life of \nthe Medicare trust fund beyond 2022. Without reform, we cannot extend \nthe Medicare trust fund beyond 2022. Without reform, we do not have the \nopportunity to ensure that trust fund will be there for older citizens \nacross America. Finally, health reform will not interfere with any \nmedical decisions made by patients and their doctors.\n  Let me step back a moment and reflect upon what we are talking about \nwith regard to Medicare: Protecting our seniors, protecting their \nbenefits. It is interesting to note this whole debate started January \nof 2009, in a fully engaged way, when staffs of all relevant committees \nwere working on this, month after month. Then it went into the summer, \nworking on health care reform in the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee and the Finance Committee, improving bills, changing \nthe bills. Now we have one bill that is the result of all that work. So \nthis has been going on for months and months.\n  I keep hearing criticisms from my Republican colleagues on various \naspects of the bill. There is nothing unusual about that. It is natural \nto have a decision and a debate. We are starting that today, at least \non the floor. But we have been having a debate over many months. My \npoint is that on the one hand you have the legislation that resulted \nfrom work by the two committees into one bill, so you have the Patients \nProtection and Affordable Care Act on the floor and you have had \nbasically the ideas contained in that being discussed for many months. \nBut what we have not seen, what I have been waiting for and have not \nseen, is a bill by the other side.\n  In other words, when we were working in June and July in the HELP \nCommittee or when the Finance Committee was working all summer and into \nthe fall, you would think that one of the results from that would be \nthat Democrats had a point of view and they produced a bill; \nRepublicans had a point of view. But they did not produce a bill. So \nyou basically have a choice before the American people: the bill before \nus, which will change and which will be amended. I have some things I \nwould want to change. But the answer cannot be let's go back to square \none, where we were a year ago or 5 years ago or 10 years ago and just \ncancel this and try to start over. This is the result of many years of \nwork, especially many months of work by people at the staff level and \nSenators across the board.\n  Unfortunately, the other side does not have a plan, so I can only \nconclude they want to stay with the status quo. They think where we are \nin health care is OK; that we should stay where we are, maybe tinker \nwith it a little bit but not change much. I think that is unacceptable. \nToo many people I run into, in Pennsylvania especially, have said to \nus: Please provide some protections for me. We are talking about \nindividuals who have health care. Provide some consumer protections. \nMake sure the Medicare trust fund will always be there. Help me with \nthis doughnut hole problem. This is the problem too many seniors run \ninto when they cannot pay for prescription drugs at a certain point in \nthe delivery of that benefit.\n  I do not think the response of doing nothing or staying where we are \nis acceptable. That is one of the reasons why we have to make sure we \nfocus on changes or debates about this bill, not going back to where we \nwere in January or where we were 5 years ago and basically doing \nnothing year after year about health care and saying it is OK to stay \nwhere we are.\n\n[[Page S12002]]\n\n  We have a long way to go. But I think it is also important to point \nout this is not just a debate between Republicans and Democrats. We \nhave had groups, across the board, that are neutral arbiters that weigh \nin on public policy but are not representing a Democratic point of view \nor a Republican point of view. The AARP said on November 20 of this \nyear:\n\n       Opponents of health reform won't rest. They are using myths \n     and misinformation to distort the truth and wrongly suggest \n     that Medicare will be harmed. After a lifetime of hard work, \n     don't seniors deserve better?\n\n  So says the AARP, just a couple of weeks ago--not even a couple of \nweeks ago, 10 days ago. The AARP also said on November 18, 2 days \nearlier:\n\n       The new Senate bill makes improvements to the Medicare \n     program by creating a new annual wellness benefit, providing \n     preventive benefits, and most notably for AARP members, \n     reducing drug costs for seniors who fall into the dreaded \n     Medicare donut hole [that I spoke about earlier] a costly gap \n     in prescription drug coverage.\n\n  That is the AARP weighing in on not a concept, not a theory but the \nbill in front of us.\n  The American Medical Association, on that same day, November 20, \n2009:\n\n       We are working to put the scare tactics to bed once and for \n     all, and inform patients about the benefit of health care \n     reform.\n\n  I could go on from there, but we have ample evidence that there is \nstrong support for the ways this bill will strengthen Medicare.\n  I wish to move to the second topic I was going to cover today and \nthat is the other end of Hubert Humphrey's test of government, what we \ndo and what the test is of our Government as it relates to those in the \ndawn of life. I spoke of older citizens a moment ago. At the dawn of \nour life are children.\n  It has been a topic and a focus of mine since the very beginning of \nthis debate, which for me began last spring when I was working in the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee before our work this \nsummer on the bill. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \nwhich is the bill before us today, deals with many aspects of our \nhealth care system. One of them is how we take care of our children. I \nhave come back to this issue over and over. I have had just a basic \ntest for this legislation. It is very simple. It is four words: No \nchild worse off, especially and importantly, children who are low \nincome and are particularly vulnerable, therefore, and children with \nspecial needs. So ``no child worse off'' should be the foundation of \nwhat we do in this bill for our children.\n  That is particularly true for those who are vulnerable, as I said \nbefore; they are vulnerable or children with special needs. That is the \nfoundation of what we should be doing, the foundation for a guiding \nphilosophy. The way I look at this, every child in America, no matter \nwho they are, no matter what circumstance, every child in America is \nborn with a light inside them. For some, that light is boundless \nbecause of their circumstance, because of their ability, because of \nadvantages they have. Their potential is unlimited and that light burns \nvery brightly without any help from anyone else. That is some children.\n  Then there are other children who have a light inside them and are \ndeserving of our care and protection and advocacy. We have a lot of \npeople around here who get besieged by lobbyists for different points \nof view, but very rarely do we have the same kind of lobbying power, \nthe same kind of power in our system to stand for children. So we have \nto do that if an interest group will not. There are plenty who have \nadvocated strongly for our children, but they don't get enough \nattention in my judgment.\n  There are some children who are born with a light inside them that \ndoes not burn very brightly because of their own circumstances or \nlimitations or because of particular vulnerabilities that they have. \nThey are the ones for whom we have to fight the hardest. They are the \nones we have to stand up to the special interests for because they \ncannot do it for themselves. They don't have a voice sometimes in this \ndebate unless the Senate stands up for them.\n  I believe no matter what the light is inside a child, no matter what \nthe limit or whether it is unlimited potential, we have to make sure \nthat potential is reached, the full potential--not most of it, not some \nof it, the full potential of every child, the full burning of that \nlight inside them.\n  There are two programs that work well to do that. They are Medicaid \nand the Children's Health Insurance Program. Thank goodness both these \nprograms came along: Medicaid, some 40 years ago, and Children's Health \nInsurance Program less than the last 15 years.\n  We have the opportunity to listen to people who come up to us on the \nstreet or who send us an e-mail or who send us a letter. It just so \nhappens one of my constituents in Pennsylvania sent us a note the other \nday, literally 2 days ago, November 28. I will not give away her \nidentity, but I will give you a general sense of what her challenge is.\n\n  She wrote to us talking about her two children who are covered by the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program in Pennsylvania. By the way, \nPennsylvania is one of the first States that put into place this \nprogram, almost 20 years ago, back in 1992-1993.\n  She wrote and said she was concerned that the House, in their bill, \nhad made some changes that would adversely impact her situation. She \nsaid:\n\n       We qualify for free Children's Health Insurance Program \n     benefits in Pennsylvania but my husband's income is greater \n     than the 150 percent of the Federal poverty level which means \n     our children wouldn't qualify for the coverage under the \n     House's proposed plan.\n\n  Then she says:\n\n       This has us terrified.\n\n  She goes on to talk about what she and her husband are trying to do \nto make ends meet. She says:\n\n       Our water bills will increase and we are nervously awaiting \n     the annual increase in heating.\n\n  I will not go through the whole letter, but suffice it to say we have \na program in place now, the Children's Health Insurance Program, that \nworks for families right now. Now we are engaged in a great debate on \nhealth care on the floor of the Senate and we deal with programs such \nas the Children's Health Insurance Program. What we have to make sure \nabout is that we do nothing in this process to injure or harm or set \nlimits on what we can do with a program that we know works.\n  This is a program which is good for a child, to make sure he or she \nreaches the full potential of that light inside them. This is good for \nhis or her family. Imagine the peace of mind that a mother or father \nhas in the course of the day, whether they are going off to work or \nwhether they are home, to know their child has health care. Yet we have \nsome families, some parents, terrified even with the coverage they \nhave, worried that coverage will not remain in effect for their \nchildren. So we have to make sure that rule is followed: No child worse \noff in America. We want to fix what is broken and build upon what \nworks.\n  I wish to make sure, as we go through this, we have a sense of what \nthe difference is between these benefits and what can happen down the \nroad. One of the things that will have an adverse impact on our health \ncare system, generally, but in particular on a program such as the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, will be the skyrocketing cost of \ncoverage. The share of household incomes spent on premiums is climbing. \nThe New America Foundation reports that in 2008, household income \nspent--on the side, ``percent of median household income spent on \nhealth care''--is 26.3 percent. That is far too high as of 2008.\n  With no action, if we stay where we are, go down the same road we are \non, the status quo, don't change anything, let's start over and keep \nscratching our head about this, here is what is going to happen by \n2016, 7 years away. That median household income dedicated to health \ncare will skyrocket to 45 percent nationally.\n  Unfortunately, in Pennsylvania, it goes up over 51 percent instead of \n45 percent, so that is the ``do nothing'' path right now. Do nothing, \nand we can guarantee that those costs are going to keep going up and \nup.\n  I said before we know the Children's Health Insurance Program works. \nBy the way, when that bill passed and when it was reauthorized, we had \nhelp from both sides of the aisle--sometimes not enough help but we \nhave had help supporting that program. We know this program works \nbecause we can see it from the results achieved by our children because \nof this program.\n  Let's compare this to some other challenges in the economy. The \nnational poverty rate. In 2007, a little\n\n[[Page S12003]]\n\nmore than 37 million Americans were in poverty, 12.5 percent of the \npopulation. In 2008, it was up to 13 percent. So the poverty rate went \nup from 2007 to 2008. The child poverty rate went from 18 percent to 19 \npercent, almost 1 million more kids in 1 year falling into poverty \nbecause of changes in the economy. People without health insurance, \n2007 versus 2008, that has gone up. It may only be 15.3 to 15.4, but \nlook at the overall number, from 45.7 to 46.3. Everything is going up. \nWe would expect that, as tragic as that is, when times are bad. The \nnational poverty rate is up, the child poverty rate up, and the \nuninsured rate is up.\n  What has not gone up between 2007 and 2008 is the number of uninsured \nchildren: 8.1 million in 2007 were covered; 7.3 million kids covered in \n2008. That is good news, that the number of uninsured children is \nactually going down from roughly 8 to 7 million. That is good news. Why \nis that happening? It is not magic. If we didn't have a Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, that number would be going up just as the \nother numbers. Why is the uninsured number for children going down? One \nbasic reason--and we could point to maybe a few others--is because we \nhave a program called the Children's Health Insurance Program which \nworks and which, fortunately, we reauthorized a couple of months ago. \nThank goodness we did that, or more and more children would fall into \npoverty. We are on a path now to go from the number of children who are \ninsured, to get that number that is now in the double figure millions, \nto get that to 14 million children, to have that uninsured number keep \ngoing down and cover more and more children. In a couple of years, we \nwill have the opportunity to say that in America, we have 14 million \nkids covered. What we have to do is make sure we have a successful \nprogram that works for the child, for their family, and for our \nsociety. Because guess what. We are going to have a better economy \nbecause of the Children's Health Insurance Program. If we invest in a \nchild early, they get health care, and they will learn better. When \nthey learn better, they will be doing better in school and have a \nbetter job and have a higher skill level. This whole debate about \nchildren's health insurance isn't just a nice thing to do; it is how we \ncompete around the world in a tough economy. It is how we build a \nskilled workforce in a tough economy. It is how we build strong \nfamilies.\n  This isn't just some nice program. This has real results for our \neconomy, for gross national product growth, economic growth, for a \nskilled workforce. Fill in the blank. You could add 10 themes to that \nin terms of the impact of the legislation. But you have to be careful. \nIn the midst of this health care reform debate, we have to make sure we \ndon't do what some have urged which is to take the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, this program that we know works, and drop that into \nthe health insurance exchange that will be created as a result of this \nbill. The exchange is a good idea to cover a lot of people. It just \nhappens to be a bad idea when it comes to merging or putting the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program in there. It needs to remain a \nstand-alone program.\n  One of the reasons why we can say we are at that point where it is a \nstand-alone program still is because during the debate in the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Rockefeller of West Virginia ensured that we kept \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program out of the exchange and that \nthe program would continue until 2019. Unfortunately, the House doesn't \nhave the same provisions, and we want to make sure we do that by the \nend of the debate.\n  I filed an amendment today to make sure that children are protected \nby health care reform, so we can truly say that no child is worse off \nas a result of our health care reform bill. In a nutshell, this \namendment will strengthen and safeguard health care for children in \nCHIP from now until 2019 and beyond with whatever changes the future of \nhealth care reform brings.\n  I will provide a couple of highlights. It continues funding through \n2019. It ensures that children have access to the essential care they \nneed. It streamlines and simplifies enrollment. The amendment also \nprovides financial incentives for States to increase enrollment of \neligible but uninsured children and calls for a study of children under \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program compared to coverage of \nchildren under the so-called insurance exchange.\n  These are just some highlights of my amendment. I will be talking \nmore about it.\n  I conclude with this thought. I know Senator Baucus was here a moment \nago, chairman of the Finance Committee, who has worked very hard on \nthis bill, this program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and \non the health care reform bill overall to protect our kids. I return to \nthis letter I got 2 days ago from a mother, in essence commending the \nbenefits of this program, that this program gives her peace of mind. \nWhat we have to do is make sure we keep the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram intact and, if anything, strengthened over time so this mother \ndoesn't have to worry again, so she doesn't have to be ``terrified'' of \nchanges that will adversely impact her two children, especially in the \nmidst of a bad economy but even if it were not.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis comments. I certainly hope no one who is listening thinks that \nanybody wants to make any child worse off. That is a basic premise, and \nI appreciate his pointing out the way the House makes some children \npotentially worse off.\n  I want to constrain my comments to the Medicare amendment because I \nthink that is one of the key parts of this whole bill. The Senator from \nPennsylvania mentioned that there wasn't a Republican bill. Actually, \nthere are four Republican bills, and there is one bipartisan bill out \nthere that meets all of the goals the President put out. When we were \ngoing through the HELP Committee amendment process, we put one of those \nout, and it was voted down with one vote. We said: That didn't work \nvery well. There were a lot of good ideas in there. They ought to have \nto consider every one of those.\n  We have been putting our ideas out one at a time so that hopefully \nthe other side will glean something out of the amendment that will be \nworthwhile to be a part of the bill. All the good ideas couldn't be on \none side of the aisle.\n  We began the day with kind of a stunt which, of course, was to have \nthe leader propose a unanimous consent. He proposed that the Social \nSecurity money ought to stay with Social Security. I don't think there \nwas any problem with that. But then he proposed that CLASS Act money \nought to stay with the CLASS Act. That is a fund that isn't even \nactuarially sound to begin with. It is just a piece of the bill that is \nalready in existence around here. He left out what he should have put \nin that unanimous consent request. He should have said Medicare money \nshould be reserved for Medicare. That would have relaxed a lot of \nseniors. But it would have been untrue and impossible to pass this bill \nif that were the UC, because Medicare money is going to expansion of \nnew programs outside of Medicare. That is what is upsetting seniors. \nAnd it ought to.\n\n  Medicare, as everybody has said, is going broke. That is a government \noption that is going broke. Well, never mind. But Medicare is going \nbroke. We all agree on that. So why would we take $464 billion out of \nMedicare to use on other programs and then recognize that Medicare is \ngoing broke and throw in a special commission that will come to us once \na year and suggest cuts to Medicare? That is not a bad idea, but some \nside deals have been made in this whole thing that keep that from being \na very realistic option either. The hospitals can't be cut any more. \nThe doctors, we are going to have to fix that, and that is where some \nof the phony accounting comes in.\n  The pharmaceuticals, the little deal they made for the doughnut hole, \nthat will provide extra help to seniors through the doughnut hole, but \nit has to be on brand name products. We know that generics are a lot \nless expensive and a lot of seniors switch to generics, especially when \nthey get to the doughnut hole and have to make decisions on their own \nand they want to save a few dollars. But that will not be a possibility \nunder this bill because of the deal that was made with the\n\n[[Page S12004]]\n\npharmaceuticals. They are going to pay their percentage on brand name \nproducts only. Why would they do that? If they can get you to use brand \nname products through the doughnut hole, when the government starts \npaying again, you will still use the brand name.\n  One of the ideas with health care is to get a little skin in the game \nwith everybody so people are making good choices on health care. How \nmuch of a good choice are you going to make if you don't have to make a \nchoice and you can keep on doing what you have been doing, whether it \nis the best choice for you, whether it is even what the doctor agrees \nwith, and whether it is a whole lot more expensive for the government \nto keep Medicare going?\n  I rise to support the McCain motion to commit this bill and eliminate \nits Medicare cuts. Senator Reid's bill cuts $464 billion from the \nMedicare Program. These cuts will eliminate benefits for Medicare \npatients. They will make it harder for them to see doctors and other \nproviders and will threaten the survival of hospitals, nursing homes, \nand home health agencies. Don't take my word for it. The \nadministration's own chief actuary recently reviewed the House bill \nwith its similar levels of Medicare payment cuts and reached the same \nconclusion I just said.\n  Richard Foster, chief actuary at the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS, wrote that if these cuts were to take effect, \nmany providers ``could find it difficult to remain profitable and might \nend their participation in the program.'' He also noted that this could \njeopardize Medicare beneficiaries' access to care. I have heard similar \nmessages from doctors, home health aides, and nursing home owners back \nin Wyoming. They are all concerned about the one-half trillion dollars \nin Medicare cuts and what it will do to their ability to treat Medicare \npatients.\n  I have heard from folks at the Baggs Senior Center, the Star Valley \nSenior Citizens, the Southwest Sublette County Pioneers Senior Citizen \nCenter, and from other Wyoming nursing homes about how the $15 billion \nin Medicare cuts to nursing home payments will devastate their ability \nto provide care for seniors in Wyoming. Many of these nursing homes are \nsmall businesses. They struggle to make payroll every month and deal \nwith an ever increasing burden of government regulations. We have never \ncut those back. They tell me how their Medicare payment rates have \nalready been reduced and how the additional cuts in the bill could \nforce them to close their doors.\n  Connie Jenkins, executive director of the Star Valley Senior Center, \nrecently wrote to me about the important role nursing homes play in \nrural towns in Wyoming. She noted that ``in a rural state such as ours, \nclosure of nursing homes would mean families travelling farther to \nvisit [their] loved ones and in some cases loss of access altogether.''\n  In rural States--and we are about as rural as you can get; we have \nthe least population in the Nation, and we have a lot of land mass--\nthere is a lot of distance between towns. If the nursing home in your \ntown closes down, it is a long way to the next nursing home. The Reid \nbill would also cut $135 billion in Medicare payments to hospitals. In \na State such as Wyoming, with an older population, between 40 to 50 \npercent of our hospital revenue comes from Medicare. Medicare already \npays a fraction of what private insurers pay, and the cuts in this bill \nwill undermine those hospitals' ability to continue to operate. I have \nheard from several Wyoming hospital executives that because of the \npayment cuts in this bill, they are going to need to ask their people \nto work fewer hours and take pay cuts.\n  They also said they may need to lay some folks off and to find ways \nto scale back the services they offer to their patients. They do not \nwant to compromise the care they provide, but the payment cuts in this \nbill will not leave them a choice.\n  The Reid bill also cuts nearly $8 billion in payments to hospice \ncare. Hospice care helps to relieve the suffering of people who are \ndying from diseases such as cancer. These are terminal patients, \nterminal patients who, of course, are not going to be cured. But the \nhospice is intended to help manage the pain and other symptoms of the \npatients with the terminal illness, and working with the families, much \non a volunteer basis.\n  According to National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, the \ncuts in the Reid bill, combined with prior regulatory cuts, would \nreduce Medicare payments to hospice providers by 14.3 percent through \n2019. According to a June 2008 report from the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission, hospices already operate with narrow profit \nmargins that average just 3.4 percent.\n  Smaller nonprofits and hospices in rural areas such as Wyoming \nalready operate with negative profit margins. Many depend on charitable \nfundraising to keep their doors open and to enable them to keep \ntreating patients. Yet the Reid bill would further cut their Medicare \npayments by $8 billion. This will force many hospices to close, which \nwill threaten dying seniors' access to that type of care.\n  The Reid bill also cuts more than $40 billion in Medicare payments to \nhome health agencies. According to the analysis done by one industry \nassociation, this level of cuts could put nearly 70 percent of all home \nhealth agencies at risk of having to close their doors. I want to say \nthat again. The $40 billion in Medicare cuts to home health agencies, \naccording to an analysis done by one industry association, could put \nnearly 70 percent of all home health agencies at risk of having to \nclose their doors.\n  There are a lot of people who are out of nursing homes because they \nare getting home health care. If we eliminate home health care, we \ndrive up the cost of care. If the Senate passes this bill, it will mean \nthat Medicare patients may not be able to get the skilled nursing care, \nthe physical and speech therapy, and the assistance that home health \naides provide with many daily activities, such as dressing, bathing, \nhelping patients live more fully with a disability.\n  The Medicare cuts in the Reid bill are not limited to slashing \npayments to hospitals and other providers. The bill also cuts $120 \nbillion from the 11 million seniors on Medicare Advantage. These cuts \nmake a mockery out of President Obama's promise that if you like what \nyou have, you can keep it. As a result of these cuts, millions of \nMedicare beneficiaries will lose the benefits currently provided by \nMedicare Advantage plans.\n  Supporters of Senator Reid's bill have tried to gloss over the impact \nthese Medicare Advantage cuts will make, arguing they will only result \nin a loss of ``extra benefits.'' For the seniors who have come to rely \non Medicare Advantage plans to provide things such as flu shots, \neyeglasses, hearing aids, and protections against catastrophic costs, \nthese are not extra benefits but items and services they depend on.\n  We all agree Medicare needs to be strengthened and reformed. Its \nfinancing is unsustainable. The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which \npays for hospital services, will be insolvent in 2017. The physician \npayment formula, which calls for Medicare payments to doctors to be cut \nby more than 40 percent over the next 10 years, is fundamentally \nbroken. We know that. We even had a vote on that in this Chamber. We \nsaid it had to be paid for.\n  Let's see, $464 billion coming out of Medicare. Medicare is what is \nbeing affected by the doctors' payments. Why wouldn't we use some of \nthat? But it is a lot of money. It is a lot of money, but it is not as \nmuch money as we are taking out of Medicare.\n  Unfortunately, the Reid bill does nothing to fix these problems. \nInstead, it cuts one-half trillion dollars from Medicare to create a \nbrandnew entitlement program for the uninsured. This approach fails to \naddress the real problem facing Medicare; and that is the physician \nformula. Instead, it uses the same gimmick that Congress has repeatedly \nused to fix this problem and provides a temporary fix in 2010, which \nwill actually lead to steeper cuts in subsequent years.\n  Physicians have grown increasingly frustrated by Congress's repeated \nfailure to replace the current payment formula. We kind of like to keep \nthem hanging on a year at a time. I think it is a little bit of a \nhostage situation, but that is the way Washington works. It should not \nbe that way. We should redo the formula. If we do not address this \nproblem soon, many more physicians are going to decide it is not\n\n[[Page S12005]]\n\nworth it to continue to treat Medicare patients.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that truly fixing the \nphysician payment formula could cost upwards of $250 billion, yet the \nReid bill does not address this problem.\n  Spiraling costs associated with medical liability lawsuits directly \nincrease Medicare costs. These costs are calculated directly into \npayment formulas for providers such as physicians. In addition, \nphysicians and hospitals order billions of dollars in extra tests and \nprocedures to protect themselves from the threat of potential lawsuits.\n  We know that enacting commonsense medical liability reforms directly \nreduces the liability insurance premiums doctors pay. We have seen the \nresults in States such as Texas, where physicians liability insurance \npremiums have decreased every year since the State-enacted reforms, \nwith average liability rates dropping a total of 27 percent.\n  The Reid bill does nothing to address the problems of medical \nliability. Instead of including reforms that would help reduce Medicare \ncosts and extend the solvency of the program, the only thing the Reid \nbill does is include a meaningless sense-of-the-Senate resolution on \nliability reform. That will not pay the bills.\n  We owe it to the 43 million people who depend on Medicare to reject \nthe arbitrary cuts in the Reid bill. We need to come up with better \nsolutions that will not endanger their ability to see a doctor or to \nget care at a hospital or a nursing home. Yes, if we do not pay the \ndoctors, the doctors will not take them because in Medicaid they \nalready will not take 40 percent of the patients; and in Medicare it is \n20 percent already. A lot of people are being asked, when they call a \ndoctor, if they are a Medicare patient. It is my contention if you \ncannot see a doctor, you do not have any kind of insurance at all. We \ndo not take care of that problem, so we do need to come up with a \nbetter solution that will not endanger their ability to see a doctor or \nto get care at a hospital or a nursing home or to have home health \ncare.\n  I believe we can do better. If the Senate passes this motion to \ncommit, we can develop bipartisan reforms that will eliminate the \nunsustainable payment cuts and address the underlying problems facing \nthe Medicare Program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am not in favor of doing nothing. \nThe previous Democratic speaker, Senator Casey, said if we do nothing, \ncosts will go up. I think the fact is, if you look at CBO's analysis, \nit says costs will go up even more if this bill, this 2,074-page bill, \npasses. So I want to spend some time because there has been some \nobfuscation on what this Congressional Budget Office letter to Senator \nBayh means.\n  This morning, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office sent a \nletter to Senator Bayh providing a very detailed analysis of what \nhealth insurance premiums will look like as a result of this 2,074-page \nbill. I have the letter from the Congressional Budget Office right \nhere, if anybody wants to read it in detail.\n  Like many of us, Senator Bayh wants to know if the Reid bill is \naddressing our constituents' No. 1 priority: costs. I think if you were \nto have a Saturday morning coffee club meeting in almost any of the \nsmall towns of America, and they were discussing health care reform--\nand emphasis upon the word ``reform''--and I walked into that meeting, \nand if I told them under this 2,074-page Reid bill that costs were not \ngoing to be brought under control, taxes were going to go up, premiums \nwere going to go up, and we were taking $400 billion out of Medicare to \nset up a new health care program, they would probably unanimously \nrespond: Well, that does not sound like health care reform to me.\n  A lot of Senators are concerned about costs because that is what we \nare hearing from the grassroots of America. Everyone, from the dean of \nHarvard's Medical School to even the New York Times, has said this bill \ndoes not sufficiently address the rising cost of health care. But \nbefore today, we were still all anxiously waiting to hear what the \nCongressional Budget Office has now said about that issue of rising \ncosts. Well, today, CBO has spoken loudly and clearly. The Reid bill \nnot only fails to bring down costs, it will actually raise costs for \nmillions of Americans. I think that bears repeating. The Reid bill will \nmake health insurance more expensive. Families will end up paying 10 to \n13 percent more as a result of this 2,074-page bill.\n  Some proponents of the bill are trying to spin this, what they \nconsider unfortunate news, and tell the American people that taxpayer-\nfunded subsidies will actually offset these cost increases. In fact, \ntonight some Members have already been saying that this CBO analysis \nshows costs will come down.\n  But I want to make it very clear CBO says that is not the case. Well, \nthis may be true; if you take $500 billion of taxpayers' hard-earned \nmoney and give it out in subsidies directly to insurance companies, \nsure, some people may end up paying less for health insurance. But this \nargument fails to recognize two big underlying problems.\n  First, most Americans will not qualify for any subsidies. They will \nend up paying higher premiums. In fact, 160 million Americans who stay \nin employer-based plans will not see any help. In fact, despite all the \nrhetoric about how employers cannot afford the status quo, CBO says \nthis bill does little, if anything, to lower costs for employers. Maybe \nthat is why the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, and a host of other business groups, oppose this \n2,074-page bill.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office goes on to say that 14 \nmillion people who cannot get coverage through an employer will not get \nany help either, but they will see a 10- to 13-percent increase in \npremiums. And, of course, an intrusive new insurance mandate will be \nenforced by the IRS if you do not do what has never been done in the \n225-year history of America. Never has the Federal Government said any \nAmerican had to buy anything. Now you have to buy insurance. If you do \nnot buy it, pay the IRS more money. Some people are going to say: Well, \nyou have to buy car insurance. But under the tenth amendment, the State \ngovernments have any powers that are not prohibited by the Federal \nConstitution to them.\n  So families who would have paid $13,100 under current law will \nactually pay more than $15,000 as a direct result of this 2,074-page \nbill. And people in employer-based coverage will be paying more than \n$20,000 a year for health insurance in 2016.\n  The second big problem is this: Health insurance premiums are still \nmore expensive in the Reid bill than they would be under current law. \nThe government is cutting Medicare and raising taxes to offset the \nincreases. So instead of addressing the underlying issue of cost, as \nwas promised, this bill enacts policies that drive up costs by close to \n30 percent, and then hands over close to $500 billion in hard-earned \ntaxpayer dollars directly to health insurance companies to offset the \nincreases.\n  Well, you might not believe the spin. In fact, you better not believe \nthe spin because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has \nconfirmed it. This bill fails to drive down the cost of health \ninsurance premiums. It simply drives up prices with a bunch of \narbitrary regulatory reforms, very cutely shifting the cost on to the \nAmerican people in the form of higher taxes and massive Medicare cuts. \nSo, once again, don't take my word for it. Read what the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office says. They have confirmed what we have been \nhearing for months: The Democratic leadership bill means higher costs \nfor millions of Americans.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Alaska became a State in January 1959 and Pat made it her home \nless than a year later, one of thousands of people who have built our \nState over the last half century.\n  Pat was born in Wallsend, Northumberland, England, on June 4, 1931, \nto Clement and Constance Boothroyd. She grew up in Jesmond, \nNorthumberland, and was evacuated for a short time during World War II \nbefore returning home to live with her parents for the duration of the \nwar. After attending nursing school in Leeds, England, she emigrated to \nCanada and then to Alaska\n  Pat worked as a registered nurse in the labor and delivery department \nat Providence Hospital, one of Alaska's finest institutions. She began \nher Alaska nursing career at ``Old Providence'' hospital where hundreds \nof new Alaskans, including me, were born. After marrying and having two \nchildren of her own, she returned to nursing at ``New Providence'' \nwhere she worked for 30 years before her retirement in 1996.\n  Pat has an abiding love for the beauty of Alaska. She enjoys walking \non the beaches of Homer, buying summer flowers for her garden in the \ngreenhouses of the Matanuska Valley, picking berries at Sheep Mountain \nLodge, and an afternoon with a friend at Summit Lake Lodge. She is \nloved by her children Karen and John and by the close friends she has \nmade over the last 50 years.\n  Madam President and colleagues, please join me in honoring and \nrecognizing Pat Vezina on the 50th anniversary of her arrival in \nAlaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/30/senate-section/article/S12006-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE 169TH FIGHTER WING\n\n Mr. DeMINT.

The Swamp Foxes flew more than 400 combat \nmissions, performing the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses mission and \nflying numerous precision bombing missions over Iraq.\n  However, when the 169th isn't defending freedom, they are winning \nawards and bringing home trophies. We are especially proud of the \n169th's accomplishments at the 2009 Falcon Air Meet, a multinational F-\n16 competition. The Swamp Foxes represented the United States against \nother Nation's fighter crews. They finished first in four of five \ncompetition categories, earning the Large Force Employment Trophy, \nScramble Launch and Intercept Competition, Weapons Load Competition, \nTop Overall Maintenance Award, and was recognized with the Top Overall \nCompetition Award. These are impressive achievements that bring great \ncredit upon the 169th.\n  On behalf of the people of the State of South Carolina and our great \ncountry, Senator Graham and I want to salute the outstanding work of \nthe 169th.\n  We are amazed by their stories, and humbled by the immense burdens \nthey have shouldered.

Madam President, I wish to pay to tribute the \nlife and legacy of Malcolm Sherman.\n  Malcolm Sherman was part of that extraordinary generation that fought \nfor America during World War II, and then fought for what America \nstands for during the rest of his life.\n  He joined the Marines after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and \nserved during the Guadalcanal campaign. When he returned home, he built \na family with his beloved wife Mimi, and he built a career in real \nestate.\n  He truly lived his life according to the Jewish principle of ``tikkun \nolam''--the repair of the world through the pursuit of social justice. \nHe worked for peace and civil rights throughout his life. He also was a \nleader in the effort to ending segregation and discrimination in \nhousing. Perhaps his greatest legacies are his children and \ngrandchildren, who live by his principles of service.\n  I ask that an obituary of Mr. Sherman written by Frederick Rasmussen \nof the Baltimore Sun be printed in the Record.\n  The information follows.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Nov. 21, 2009]\n\n  Malcolm Sherman: Former Rouse Co. Executive Battled Blockbusting in \n             Baltimore Neighborhoods in the 1950s and 1960s\n\n                      (By Frederick N. Rasmussen)\n\n       Malcolm ``Mal'' Sherman, a former Rouse Co. executive and \n     real estate agent who battled blockbusting and worked \n     tirelessly for integrated neighborhoods during the 1950s and \n     1960s, died Thursday of pneumonia at the Broadmead retirement \n     community in Cockeysville. He was 87.\n       Mr. Sherman was born in Philadelphia and spent his early \n     years there. After the death of his father in 1927, he was \n     sent abroad to a boarding school in Lausanne, Switzerland, \n     where he lived until returning to New York City in 1932.\n       After graduating from Horace Mann School in New York City, \n     Mr. Sherman attended the University of North Carolina at \n     Chapel Hill.\n       He dropped out of college and enlisted in the Marine Corps \n     two days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n       Mr. Sherman was wounded while serving as a master sergeant \n     during the Guadalcanal campaign and was honorably discharged \n     at war's end.\n       He was a founder of the United Nations Veterans League, \n     which worked for world peace.\n       After the war, Mr. Sherman and his wife, the former Miriam \n     ``Mimi'' Heller, whom he married in 1943, moved to San \n     Francisco, where he was a salesman for Paul Masson Wines.\n       In 1949, Mr. Sherman moved to Baltimore to be closer to his \n     wife's family. He earned his real estate license and \n     established Mal Sherman Inc. Realtors. His staff consisted of \n     18 men and 18 women, at a time when there were few women in \n     the business.\n       ``I always had an interest in houses and land,'' Mr. \n     Sherman said in a 1999 interview with the Maryland Realtor. \n     ``I thought I could help people make a decision. I wanted to \n     help families find a better quality of life. It was a way for \n     me to combine business and social work all in one.''\n       In the early days, Mr. Sherman confronted anti-Semitism and \n     segregated neighborhoods.\n       ``As a Jewish real estate broker, I was not allowed to show \n     property east of Falls Road,'' he recalled in the interview.\n       In 1953, when Mr. Sherman tried to stabilize a neighborhood \n     that was undergoing blockbusting, he appealed to white \n     residents to stay.\n       They rebuffed his plea and refused to do business with him \n     because of his integrationist views.\n       Even after the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education \n     decision in 1954 that declared ``separate but equal'' \n     unconstitutional, discrimination in real estate continued.\n       In 1960, Mr. Sherman decided it was time to hire African-\n     American real estate agents and brought Lee Martin, a Morgan \n     State graduate, into his company.\n       While working for Baltimore Neighborhoods Inc. in the early \n     1960s, Mr. Sherman began to push fair-housing issues and in a \n     news conference said he would sell to anyone ``regardless of \n     race, creed, or color.''\n       When baseball great Frank Robinson came to Baltimore to \n     play for the Orioles in 1966, he instructed Mr. Sherman to \n     find a home for him and his family in a white neighborhood.\n       ``He didn't want to be segregated,'' Mr. Sherman recalled \n     in an interview. After persuading the white neighbors to \n     accept Mr. Robinson, Mr. Sherman was still attacked by a \n     local builder for ``breaking the block.''\n       President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the Equal \n     Opportunity for Housing in America Committee.\n       Mrs. Sherman, who died in 2005, joined her husband in his \n     quest for open housing and civil rights.\n       ``All that black people wanted was the right to buy or rent \n     anyplace, regardless of race, creed or color, and once given \n     that\n\n[[Page S12007]]\n\n     right, they didn't necessarily inundate and run to the \n     neighborhoods that they had been barred from,'' Mr. Sherman \n     told The Sun in 2001.\n       He was later joined by other local brokers such as Russell \n     T. Baker and Bill Wilson in the push for fair-housing laws \n     that finally became a reality in 1968 when Congress passed \n     legislation, but his crusade took a toll on his firm.\n       ``Because he felt so strongly about these issues, it \n     eventually put him out of business. It was a terrible thing \n     to have happened,'' said Sandy Marenberg, president of MEI \n     Real Estate in Baltimore.\n       ``Mal held to his views all the way until the end of his \n     life. He was a real hero and mentor in the Baltimore real \n     estate community,'' Mr. Marenberg said.\n       In 1967, Mr. Sherman was named residential land sales \n     director for the Rouse Co., and three years later was \n     promoted to director of sales and land marketing in Columbia.\n       Mr. Sherman was named Rouse Co. vice president in 1971 with \n     responsibilities for all residential land sales and helped \n     steer Columbia toward racial diversity.\n       When he went to work for the Rouse Co., Mr. Sherman found a \n     boon companion in Jim Rouse, the company founder, who shared \n     his views.\n       ``We were combating a trend, and Jim was frightened. He \n     didn't want it [Columbia] to come out like the city,'' Mr. \n     Sherman recalled in a 2000 interview in The Sun. ``He wanted \n     all of the people mixed all over the place; that was the \n     social goal.''\n       ``He was a charismatic man always trying to help someone. \n     He discriminated against no one,'' said James Holechek, a \n     retired Baltimore public relations executive.\n       ``It was a personal testimony when he was sought out and \n     hired by Jim Rouse. To me, Mal Sherman was always Mr. Real \n     Estate in Maryland,'' he said.\n       A liberal Democrat and an anti-war activist, Mr. Sherman \n     found himself on the Nixon White House's enemies list after \n     founding Businessmen Against the Vietnam War.\n       That's ``great news'' he told The Sun in 1973. ``It's the \n     best thing I have to tell my son about myself. I feel better \n     about this than any kind of honor that could come to me,'' he \n     said.\n       After leaving the Rouse Co. in the early 1970s, Mr. Sherman \n     went to work for Phipps Land Co. and later Ackerman & Co., a \n     real estate firm based in Atlanta. He returned from Atlanta \n     in 1981 when he was appointed Baltimore-Washington area \n     regional vice president for the firm.\n       Mr. Sherman continued working as a real estate consultant \n     after leaving Ackerman. He retired in 2001.\n       ``He was arguably the wisest, most caring adviser and \n     thinker in the Baltimore real estate world,'' said Martin L. \n     Millspaugh Jr., who was the first chief executive of Charles \n     Center-Inner Harbor Management Inc.\n       ``His life made a difference over many years, in ways that \n     will become even more apparent as time goes by,'' Mr. \n     Millspaugh said.\n       He was a former president of the Real Estate Board of \n     Greater Baltimore and in 1999 was awarded the Maryland Real \n     Estate Board Life Achievement Award. Recently, he was honored \n     for his civil rights work by the National Association of \n     Realtors.\n       A former resident of the Colonnade in Homewood, Mr. Sherman \n     was a member of the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation.\n       Services will be held at 1 p.m. Sunday at Sol Levinson and \n     Bros., 8900 Reisterstown Road, Pikesville.\n       Surviving are two daughters, Wendy R. Sherman of Bethesda \n     and Andrea Sherman of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.; and two \n     grandchildren. His son, Douglas Sherman, died in \n     1981.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/30/senate-section/article/S12007-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING ROYAL J. ``BUD'' WOOD\n\n Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today I mourn the loss of Royal J. \n``Bud'' Wood, of Warner SD. Bud passed away on November 19, 2009, at \nthe age of 87.\n  Born and raised in Warner, Bud will be remembered as a man who \ncommitted his life to his family and community. Bud celebrated his life \nwith his wife Dorothy, his 4 children, 12 grandchildren, and 6 great-\ngrandchildren. His passion for his faith, family, and friends was \nunwavering as he spent much of his time at church and family \nactivities.\n  Although Bud was extremely dedicated to his family, he will also be \nremembered for his service to the State of South Dakota. I got to know \nBud when his wife Dorothy managed Senator James Abdnor's office in \nAberdeen. Elected to the South Dakota House of Representatives in 1966, \nBud was one of the longest serving representatives, working for the \npeople of South Dakota for 26 years. While a member of the State \nlegislature, he served in many different capacities including: \nassistant majority leader, speaker pro tempore, speaker of the house, \nalong with vicechairman of the Legislative Research Council and \nchairman of the Local Government Study Commission and Local Government \nStanding Committee. Bud also served on the Presidential Task Force for \nboth President Ronald Reagan and President George H.W. Bush.\n  Beyond his political career, Bud was a talented auctioneer at Hub \nCity Livestock Auction for 25 years. He was on the board of directors \nfor the South Dakota Wheat Growers, the Warner Elevator Board, and at \none time a church council member at St. John's Lutheran Church in \nWarner.\n  Bud was a man who was always willing and determined to help out his \nneighbor. A mentor, confidant, and friend, he selflessly impacted his \ncommunity in a positive way.\n  Today I wish to celebrate the life of an extraordinary public servant \nand leader. As we mourn the loss of this great South Dakotan, I extend \nmy thoughts, prayers and best wishes to Bud's family, friends, and \nloved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/30/senate-section/article/S12007-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THOMAS KURT JAROS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the \nFederal Meat Inspection Act, and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct to require processors of food products to certify to the applicable \nSecretary that the processed food products are not adulterated; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nProcessed Food Safety Act. When enacted, this bill will make one very \nimportant principle clear: It is the producer's responsibility to \nproduce safe food, it is not the consumer's responsibility to make \ntheir food safe.\n  This legislation gives food producers and anyone else who modifies \nour food\n\n[[Page S12010]]\n\ntwo options: they can take an additional ``kill-step'' to eliminate all \nverifiable traces of pathogens within each ingredient they have added \nto the product, or they can certify to the Secretary of Agriculture \nthat each of the ingredients used to make our food contains no \nverifiable traces of pathogens.\n  One would think that this is common sense. Wouldn't any company \nproducing or modifying our food take the time, and the care, to make \nsure that their product was safe for us to eat?\n  Unfortunately not. Today, more than 100 years after the publishing of \nUpton Sinclair's ``The Jungle,'' much of our food is still produced by \ncompanies that put their profits over the health of their customers.\n  On any given week I can open up the newspaper and find another \nheartbreaking story about the serious health effects of food-borne \nillnesses from tainted products. Anyone who visits the Web sites of the \nUSDA or the FDA can see that recalls are not a rare occurrence.\n  In the last month the USDA has recalled: Roast beef in Iowa due to \nthe presence of undeclared allergens; canned soup in Pennsylvania due \nto the undeclared presence of egg in the product; beef tongues in \nNebraska and Wisconsin because of improperly removed tonsils, which, \nwhen consumed, increase the risk of contracting Mad Cow Disease; and \nhundreds of thousands of pounds of ground beef in California, New York, \nand Massachusetts due to the presence of E. coli 0157--the deadliest \nstrain of this common pathogen.\n  The FDA this month has recalled: Dove ice cream bars in 19 States \nincluding California for the undeclared presence of peanuts, a \npotentially deadly allergen; Jelly Belly Jelly Beans were also recalled \ndue to the presence of peanuts and peanut butter in their product; \napple and carrot pouches in California that may contain a spore that \ncan lead to botulism; vegetarian spring rolls in Maine, which were \nfound to have meat products. The uninspected meat could have contained \nany number of food-borne pathogens; pre-made sandwiches in North \nCarolina due to concerns about the presence of Listeria. These bacteria \ncan cause serious illness, pregnancy complications and even death; \nsalted herring in New York because of the possible presence of the \nspore that can lead to botulism; and dried plums in Texas, found to \ncontain traces of lead.\n  Simply put, the state of our food supply is alarming. And without \nserious reform and leadership from this Congress, things will not get \nany better. That is why today I am introducing the Processed Food \nSafety Act.\n  As I said, this bill will require companies that process any kind of \nfood, from ground beef to frozen pot pies, to test their finished \nproducts and their ingredients to make sure that they are safe to eat \nand pathogen free.\n  I mentioned ground beef and frozen pot pies, two very different \nitems, because both of these seemingly unrelated products have been the \nsubject of two recent exposes in the New York Times.\n  On October 4, 2009, writer Michael Moss highlighted the disturbing \nrealities in the ground beef industry, at each step in the process. He \nfound slaughterhouses don't take time to properly remove intestines and \nfecal matter which then contaminate meat with E. coli. These \nslaughterhouses then sell to grinders who agree not to test their \nproduct for contaminants. Meat grinders purchase scraps from a variety \nof slaughterhouses across the country and across the globe. They then \ncombine their scraps in a way that makes it virtually impossible to \ntrace back their ingredients for public health purposes. Federal \nagencies offer regulations and guidance, but they fail to compel the \nindustry to comply with their safety standards.\n  Each individual oversight is a problem, but together, they represent \na clear, systematic failure of the overall food safety system.\n  This story makes it abundantly clear that the companies producing our \nground beef spend more time worrying about how to avoid testing for \npathogens than they spend trying to make their products safe.\n  The New York Times ran another story on May 15 that highlights \nserious concerns about frozen chicken pot pies.\n  The newspaper discovered that ConAgra, a frozen food giant which \nproduced and sold over 100 million pot pies last year, decided to make \nconsumers responsible for killing pathogens in their products instead \nof taking the responsibility themselves.\n  As consumers, we expect that producers of these frozen meals have \nproperly cleaned and washed their ingredients before repackaging them \nfor sale. We expect that these frozen entrees are ready for \nconsumption--just ``heat and eat,'' the popular advertising motto tells \nus.\n  However, as this story points out, companies have actually tried to \nshift this burden to the consumer by requiring very specific, often \nburdensome cooking instructions which require the use of a meat \nthermometer to test the temperature of a product in several different \nplaces.\n  What is even more shocking is that the authors found that it was \nvirtually impossible to meet the cooking specifications put on the box \nby ConAgra.\n  On the outside of the box, the cooking instructions state that the \nproduct must reach 160 degrees in several places as tested by a meat \nthermometer, before the product is safe to eat.\n  However the New York Times found that even after using a higher power \nmicrowave than recommended by ConAgra, and cooking the product for an \nadditional 1 minute and 30 seconds, 30 percent longer than recommended, \nparts of the pot pie did not reach the temperature recommended by \nConAgra to kill pathogens within their product.\n  When asked if a sample of their product that was cooked above and \nbeyond their recommendations was safe to eat even though it did not \nreach the recommended temperature, the company conceded that it was not \nsafe for human consumption.\n  Other frozen food products from Nestle, Swanson, and Hungry-Man were \nalso tested to see if their cooking directions were clear, simple, and \nadequate. Not surprisingly, the New York Times found that their tests \non these products yielded similar results.\n  Increasingly, food producers are using consumer cooking instructions \nas a method to deflect responsibility for the safety of their product. \nThese companies effectively said that it was up to the consumer to kill \npotentially deadly doses of E. coli and Salmonella in their frozen \nmeals.\n  Under current law, food producers are allowed to get away with this. \nThat is why I am introducing the Processed Food Safety Act.\n  The bill will dean up the food industry by: amending the Poultry \nProducts Inspection Act, the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the \nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of any \nprocessed poultry, meat or FDA-regulated food that has not undergone a \npathogen reduction treatment or been certified to be virtually pathogen \nfree; doing away with loopholes in current laws that allow for \nproducers to add coloring, synthetic flavorings and spices to their \nproducts without informing the consumer; and banning the sale of food \nthat has not undergone these rigorous inspections and safety \nprocedures.\n  The Processed Food Safety Enhancement Act will force companies to \nproduce safe foods. And, it will let consumers know that their health \nis more important than the financial interests of the food industry.\n  Some may argue that this bill will be too expensive, because the \ninspections and tests required by this bill may raise the cost of food. \nI believe that these concerns are short-sighted.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that food-\nborne illnesses sicken up to 76 million people, cause 325,000 hospital \nvisits, and cause more than 5,000 deaths each year. The CDC estimates \nthat these illnesses annually cost American taxpayers up to $6 billion.\n  By another metric, the USDA food-borne illness cost calculator \nestimates that Salmonella cost the United States $2.6 billion in 2008, \nand E. coli 0157 cost $478 million.\n  By implementing more rigorous safety standards for our food, the \nProcessed Food Safety Act may actually result in a substantial cost \nsavings to the average American consumer.\n  But that misses the point. This bill, and this problem cannot be \nmeasured in dollars and cents. Food-borne illnesses kill up to 5,000 \npeople every year. In this day and age, this is simply unacceptable. We \ncannot let this go on.\n\n[[Page S12011]]\n\n  Food producers must be held responsible for the safety of their \nproducts. In the early 1900s Congress acted forcefully to prohibit the \nmost egregious violations in food production. Today, 104 years after \n``The Jungle'' was published, it is time for Congress to again take up \nthis important fight.\n  The Processed Food Safety Act puts the responsibility for food safety \nback where it belongs. This legislation protects consumers and keeps \nour food safe.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important, commonsense bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2819\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
