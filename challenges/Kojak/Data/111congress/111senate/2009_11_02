Mr. President, our job as legislators is to write and pass \na bill that will make it easier for every American family to afford to \nlive a healthy life. Democratic Members have worked tirelessly over the \npast weeks, months, and even years to fulfill this tremendous \nresponsibility. We have listened to the vast majority of Americans who \ndemand that we stop health insurance companies from taking advantage of \neach of us. We have listened to the vast majority of Americans who know \nthat a public option for health insurance is the best way to keep \ncompetition up, keep costs down, and keep insurance companies honest. \nWe continue to listen to Senators as diverse ideologically as they are \ndiverse geographically as we craft a final bill.\n  Today, we are closer than ever before to making sure every American \ncan access quality, affordable health care--and making sure they have \nthe choice of whether they get that care through their private insurer \nor a public one.\n  We are closer than ever, but we are not there quite yet. As we head \nfor the finish line, one of the most important parts of this process is \ntransparency. That is exactly why the two Senate committees that \ndrafted the foundations of this bill--the HELP and Finance Committees--\nconducted lengthy public meetings. At these meetings, the American \npeople could see that the committees considered and approved numerous \namendments and proposals by both Democrats and Republicans. For \nexample, you could go on the HELP Committee's Web site and watch them \nadopt 160 Republican amendments into this bill. It is in the name of \ntransparency that the committees' legislation has been fully available \non the Internet for many weeks now. The HELP Committee's bill has been \non its Web site since June 9, and the Finance Committee's bill has been \non its Web site since September 16.\n  It is important to understand where we are in this process. Right \nnow, we are merging those two bills into one bill. That work is \nongoing, and many different options are being weighed. The CBO is \nanalyzing those options, and based on their analysis we will decide \nwhat to put into a bill. Those who demand to see the bill this minute \nforget that a final bill doesn't yet exist. If it did, we would bring \nit to the floor. All should remember that as soon as the CBO results \nare in and as soon as important decisions are made based on those \nresults, we have pledged to make the final bill available to the full \nSenate and the American people. The final bill will be public as soon \nas it is written. I will repeat that so there is no confusion. The \nfinal bill will be made public as soon as it is written.\n  Only one final decision has been made so far. We are going to give \npeople the power of deciding whether they want to get their health \ninsurance from somewhere other than the reckless private companies that \nare responsible for the mess we are in, and we are going to give the \nStates the power of deciding whether that choice is best for its \ncitizens.\n  So that is where we stand. It is important to get these facts on the\n\n[[Page S10964]]\n\nrecord, as misinformation, half-truths, and distractions fill the \nairwaves.\n  Let's be honest. These facts don't matter much to those who are dead \nset on opposing health insurance reform for partisan reasons. They \ndon't matter to the Republican Senator who said he hopes the effort to \nfix our broken health care system will be President Obama's \n``Waterloo.'' They don't matter to the Republican Senator who said \nRepublicans will oppose the bill regardless of any concessions \nDemocrats make. They don't matter to the Republican Senator who said, \n``I don't have to read it, or know what's in it. I am going to oppose \nit anyways.'' Their strategy is to deny the undeniable fact that \nfamilies' personal health and pocketbooks are suffering. Their strategy \nis to defend the indefensible practices of insurance companies that \nmake huge profits on the backs of our seniors and our sick. Their \nstrategy is to ignore polls that clearly and consistently show the \nAmerican people support a public option and instead argue, without \nevidence, that they don't.\n  Republicans make no effort to hide their shortsighted and self-\ndestructive strategy. In fact, Roll Call newspaper today reports that \nthey ``have mapped out a strategy to draw out debate'' rather than work \nwith us to strengthen the bill. Politico reported last week that \nRepublican consultant Frank Luntz is out with a new memo urging \nRepublicans to fake bipartisanship. You will recall that, back in May, \nLuntz encouraged Republicans to oppose a health care reform bill before \nthere was a single hearing held to determine what should be in the bill \nand long before a single bill was even written. Now Luntz says \nRepublicans have more to gain by faking bipartisanship and from \ncomplaining about the health care bill than working to improve it. All \nof us--every single American--stand to lose if that happens. I know \nSenate Republicans appreciate transparency because their strategy is as \ntransparent as it comes. That strategy is simply to delay, delay, \ndelay. And now the newspaper Roll Call acknowledges that.\n\n  At the same time, I couldn't help but notice that while Senate \nRepublicans demand transparency, their own plan is being drafted, \nobviously, in secret--if, in fact, there is one. We don't know how much \ntheir bill will cost--the Republican bill--if there is one. We don't \nknow whom it will help, if anybody, or how it will keep insurance \ncompanies from abusing Americans. They won't tell us how their plan \nwill lower your health care bills so you don't have to choose between \nmedication and your mortgage. So I can only conclude one of two things: \nEither the Senate Republicans are drafting a bill in secret or their \nproposal simply doesn't exist and the Republicans have no solutions to \none of the greatest and most urgent challenges of our time--health \ninsurance reform. Whichever it is should concern the American people \ngreatly.\n  I will acknowledge there is one thing that won't be in their bill \nsecretly or in a transparent fashion, and that is to repeal the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act that exempts insurance companies from antitrust \nlaws. The insurance companies love that because they can take advantage \nof the American people, as they have since 1945, since that act became \nlaw.\n  It is increasingly clear to the American people who is trying to help \nthem. It is clear who is reaching across the aisle and negotiating in \ngood faith and compromising where necessary.\n  Mr. President, we want to work with the Republicans, but how can you \nwork with a party that says that they hope President Obama fails and \nthat this is his Waterloo? It doesn't matter what is in the bill, they \nwill oppose it. Again, today, we heard from Roll Call that their only \nstrategy is to delay. I hope that will change and they will work with \nus to come up with some ideas on how they can improve health insurance. \nLet's get the bill on the floor and start debating it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/02/senate-section/article/S10964-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, for months, the American people have \nbeen sending us a clear message about what they want to see in health \ncare reform. They want practical, common-sense reforms that drive down \nthe cost of care, improve access, and create more choices. What they \nare getting instead from Congress are higher premiums, higher taxes, \nMedicare cuts, and more government control over their health care \ndecisions.\n  They are getting the same old big-government solutions to problems \nthat call for creative, modern-day solutions.\n  Quite simply, there seems to be a disconnect between the American \npeople and Democrat leaders in Congress. And nowhere is that disconnect \nmore apparent than in the 2,000-page bureaucratic monstrosity of a bill \nthat House Democrats dropped on the American people last week.\n  At its core, this bill is very similar to what we have already seen \nin the Senate--a trillion-dollar government experiment that raises \ntaxes, raises premiums, slashes Medicare, and leads to unprecedented \ngovernment control over the health care decisions of Americans. That is \nthe foundation, the starting-off point. It doesn't get any better from \nthere.\n  Let's start with the pricetag. At a time of unprecedented government \nspending and a staggering $12 trillion debt, the Democrat health care \nbill asks taxpayers to pony up at least another trillion dollars. To \nget some sense of the size of that figure, consider the fact that this \nbill would cost more than $2 million per word. And believe it or not, \nthat is a conservative estimate.\n  Once fully implemented, the bill will spend $2.3 trillion. And this \ndoesn't even account for the $250 billion that is needed to prevent a \ncut in reimbursements to doctors who treat Medicare patients. While \nthis so-called ``Doc Fix'' is no longer in the bill, we saw last month \nhow Democrats in both the House and Senate plan to pay for it. They \nwant to put this $250 billion on the government credit card and then \nclaim their plans don't add to the deficit.\n  Well, Americans aren't buying it.\n  The bill would also hit already-struggling States by imposing a \ncrippling, 10-year, $34 billion expansion of Medicaid. And it fails to \nmeet the key test that Americans had set for reform, which was to \ncontrol costs. Indeed, contrary to early promises by the administration \nabout the need to control costs, this bill would actually increase \nlong-term Federal health care spending.\n  The health care choices that Americans currently enjoy would also be \nlimited under this bill, and the government's role would increase \ndramatically. If you don't want to buy insurance, too bad: under this \nbill, the government forces you either to buy insurance or pay a new \n2.5-percent tax. Under this bill, the government would also tell you \nwhat kind of insurance you can have by dictating the benefits you \nreceive. If a politician in Washington doesn't approve of your current \nhealth care plan, you may be forced to give it up. Ironically, the \nperson who would dictate your benefits would go by the title of the \nHealth Choices Commissioner only in Washington, Mr. President.\n  Notably, this bill no longer includes language from earlier draft \nlegislation stating that essential benefits coverage should not lead to \nthe rationing of health care. Language preventing rationing is out. We \ncan only conclude from the exclusion of this language that the bill \nwriters have opened the\n\n[[Page S10965]]\n\ndoor to rationing care at some point down the road--just like every \nother country that has gone in the direction of government-run health \ncare for all.\n\n  Business owners are also a special target of this bill. The \ngovernment will tell all but the smallest employers they must cover \nemployees even if they cannot afford it. If they refuse, they get hit \nwith a $135 billion tax--a tax that independent experts warn will lower \nwages and kill jobs.\n  Unemployment is nearly 10 percent, despite the administration's \nprediction that it would not rise past 8 percent if we passed the \nstimulus. But instead of trying to create jobs, Democrats are trying to \npush through a trillion-dollar experiment with massive new taxes that \nwould kill even more jobs right in the middle of a recession.\n  Finally, under this bill, the government would create a government-\nrun health care plan that Americans oppose. Democrats say the whole \npoint of a government plan is to give Americans a lower cost option. \nBut the CBO has said that the premiums for the House government plan \nwould actually be higher than the premiums for private plans. So in \norder for the government plan to meet its goal of offering a lower cost \nalternative, it would have to use the power of government to subsidize \ncosts, ration care, and undercut private insurers. Democrats may call \nthis an option, but it is clear to everyone else that this type of \ngovernment-run plan would eventually become the only option.\n  Americans want real reforms that lower costs and increase access--\nreforms such as getting rid of junk lawsuits, leveling the playing \nfield on health care taxes, and incentivizing healthy choices. Yet \ninstead of adopting these commonsense ideas, the authors of this bill \nseem intent on forcing the American people to accept more spending, \nmore debt, more taxes, and more government in their daily lives.\n  You can call that a lot of things. You can call it a lot of things, \nbut you cannot call it reform. The passage of time has not been good to \nDemocratic efforts at health care reform. Earlier versions were deeply \nflawed to begin with. But when Americans look closely at this latest \nversion, they will wonder who exactly congressional leaders have been \nlistening to over the past several months. Clearly, it is not the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/02/senate-section/article/S10965-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we just heard the Republican leader of the \nSenate speak, as he does every day, against health care reform. He has \nopposed it from the start. He is consistent. His message is consistent. \nHe does not propose any alternative. There is no Republican health care \nreform bill anyone has seen or heard of. He comes in each day and tells \nus what is wrong with the efforts underway in Congress, both the House \nand the Senate, to change the health care system of America.\n  Unfortunately, most Americans--certainly most business people--\nunderstand that the current health care system in America is \nunsustainable. The cost of health care is going up so fast that fewer \nand fewer businesses are protecting their employees and fewer and fewer \nindividuals can afford to buy health insurance. And those who buy \nhealth insurance know the reality of what it means today. They know \nthat when they need it the most, many health care insurance companies \nturn them down. People who had paid for a lifetime into a health \ninsurance plan they had never used finally faced an accident or a \ndiagnosis or a critical illness, went to their doctor, headed to the \nhospital, only to find that now they were not just going to have to \nbattle an illness, they had to battle their insurance company.\n  I cannot tell you how many cases have come to my office--so many that \nwe have lost count--asking: As a Senator, will you please intervene \nwith my health insurance company.\n  The most recent involved a young man who has been battling cancer in \nmy State for years, a heroic battle that I know something about because \nI know his family. He finally found a drug that worked that his \noncologist recommended. It was a new drug, but it was one that worked. \nFor a while, the health insurance company paid for it. Then they \nannounced they were going to cut off payments because it was not an \nappropriate drug. Do you know how much it will cost his family to \nprovide that lifesaving drug to him each month? It is, $13,000. How \nlong can he last? How long can the savings last? How long can we stand \nhere and tolerate that kind of mistreatment of the American people?\n  Yet day after day, the Republican leader comes and tells us he is \nopposed to change; he does not support our efforts to bring about real \nsignificant change when it comes to health insurance in this country.\n  Let me tell you what our bill does--this bill he said we should not \npass. It eliminates preexisting conditions. Do you know what that \nmeans? When you need your insurance the most and your health insurance \ncompany goes back and pulls out your health insurance application and \nsays: You forgot to tell us you had headaches as a teenager or acne \nand, therefore, we are going to walk away, disallow any medical care. \nDoes that sound outlandish? It is a fact in both instances and in cases \nthat have come to our office--preexisting conditions. Preexisting \nconditions, a battle that people have to fight all the time with these \nhealth insurance companies, would be prohibited under health insurance \nreform that we are working on.\n  Or how about their decision to cap the amount of coverage they will \nprovide. You don't know when you get into cancer treatment or serious \nbrain surgery what the ultimate bill is going to be. But the health \ninsurance companies can walk away from you when you are sick and need \ntheir help the most.\n  We know what they do with kids, young people, when they reach the age \nof 23. It happened in my family. They cut off your children. No more \nwill they cover them. They have to find their own coverage. This bill \nsays we will extend that coverage.\n  We are basically trying to plug the gaps in health insurance coverage \ntoday that haunt American families when they desperately need help. And \nthe Republican minority leader comes to the floor and objects to that, \nobjects to this health care reform. I don't understand where he is \ncoming from.\n  He says this bill is too long. I have heard the Senator from Kentucky \nand other Senators say: Why, this bill is 1,000 pages long--1,000 \npages. I don't know if there is an appropriate number of pages for \nhealth care reform. I don't know if 100 is the right number and 1,100 \nis too much. I don't know if we should be involved in that kind of \nsilly argument.\n  What we are talking about here is a piece of legislation that will \nimpact health care for every American and will literally address one-\nsixth of the American economy. Mr. President, $1 out of every $6 spent \nin America is spent on health care. We are working now to bring down \ncosts and create a system that is fair, stable, and secure for people \nacross the United States. If it takes 2,000 pages, does that mean the \nbill is wrong?\n  The other day on the floor, I asked one of the Republican Senators \nwho was talking about the bill being too long, first I said: Have you \nseen it? Of course he had not because the bill is currently being \nwritten. The final bill is not before us. It will be on the Internet \nfor at least 3 days before it is considered on the floor, as it should \nbe, but there is no final bill.\n\n  Then I asked him how many pages is the Republican alternative on \nhealth care reform. He stumbled a little bit because there is no \nRepublican alternative to health care reform. Speeches, yes, but \nnothing in writing.\n  When we went through the HELP Committee and marked up the bill--one \nof the bills that is part of the package being considered--there were \n150\n\n[[Page S10966]]\n\nRepublican amendments that were accepted. You would think that after \n150 Republican amendments were accepted out of about 500, perhaps one \nRepublican Senator would vote to move the bill forward. Not a single \none, not one in the HELP Committee would vote to move it forward.\n  It is unfortunate, but I think Majority Leader Reid is right. There \nappears to be, by most Republican Senators, a strategy to delay this as \nlong as possible and to oppose all change. I don't know if you can \nbuild a political party on that. I certainly don't believe you can \nbuild a nation on that. And you certainly cannot address the concerns \nthat people express to us every day about the current cost of health \ncare and the need for us to have health insurance we can trust and the \nneed to bring more and more people into health insurance coverage.\n  The bill before us, that we will vote on at 5 o'clock today, is about \nunemployment compensation. It is a recordbreaking bill. And you know \nwhy? Because it has taken us almost 4 weeks by Wednesday to bring up \nthe extension of unemployment compensation benefits. The reason it \nbreaks a record is that historically this was never a debatable item. \nPeople said: Of course, we are going to help people who are unemployed \non a bipartisan basis, give them a helping hand in a tough economy. Now \nwe are facing an economy with millions of people unemployed and, \nunfortunately, the Republicans have delayed us for 4 weeks to bring \nthis matter up.\n  While they have delayed us, thousands of people have lost their \nunemployment benefits. They are in my office, sending e-mails talking \nabout this, spelling out what it means when you don't have a job, you \ndon't have health insurance, you are struggling to pay the rent or the \nmortgage payment, trying to pick up some skills to find a new job and \nthe checks end.\n  We want to extend those unemployment benefits because there are six \nunemployed Americans for every available job. Even people who are \nworking the hardest to find new jobs are having a tough time. But for 4 \nweeks, the Republicans have stopped us. And why? They want to offer \namendments that have nothing to do with unemployment compensation.\n  One of the amendments the Senator from Louisiana wants to once again \ndebate is about an organization called ACORN. ACORN has not been in \nbusiness in Illinois for a long time. It is an organization that is \ncontroversial in some sectors. In fact, it has led to four or five \nvotes already on the Senate floor. This Senator has said he wants to \nhold up the extension of unemployment benefits for thousands of \nAmericans so he can debate again another effort to criticize ACORN.\n  I suppose it is an important speech to him but not as important as \nthat unemployment check is to thousands of people in Louisiana and \nIllinois who don't receive it because he and others on his side of the \naisle have held up this bill for no good reason.\n  We have work to do. We need to create a safety net for those who have \nlost their jobs. We need to push forward on the President's recovery \nand reinvestment program that is creating jobs to put people back to \nwork, and we need to sit together--I hope--come together and find a way \nto expand the number of jobs in this economy. We cannot do it if it \ntakes 4 weeks for us to provide an unemployment check for someone in my \nhome State who has been out of work for a year and is desperate to keep \nhis family together.\n  That is the reality of what this issue is all about, the reality of \nthe strategy of the party on the other side of the aisle. Whether it is \nunemployment benefits or health care reform, they believe if they delay \nlong enough, somehow the clock will run out, the calendar will end, and \nwe will do nothing. We cannot do that.\n  For the unemployed people in this economy, for those counting on us \nfor real health care reform, we must do better. I urge my colleagues--I \nhope--on the other side of the aisle--a few of them--to step forward \nand say this is an issue that goes way beyond politics. I hope they \njoin us in providing unemployment benefits long overdue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, survey after survey shows that most \nAmericans like their health plan, but they believe it costs too much. \nThat is why I am concerned that at a time when the American people are \nasking for lower health care costs, the trillion-dollar bills the \nDemocrats are trying to ram through Congress actually increase the cost \nof health care.\n  You heard me correctly. The majority of both Houses is actually \nproposing to spend $1 trillion of taxpayer funds on proposals that will \ncause an increase in health care for all Americans. That is not the \nkind of reform Americans want.\n  Back home we call that a pig in a poke. The only way to sell a pig in \na poke is to hide from Americans what their tax dollars are buying. \nThat is why, despite the President's promise of transparency, the \nmajority in charge of Congress and in charge of the Senate is working \nbehind closed doors on a complicated, probably 1,000-plus-page bill \nthat will lead to a massive government takeover of health care.\n  The assistant majority leader is correct; we have not seen a bill. It \nhas been done in secret. Just wait; sometime we will see it. But we \nheard some facts that we think are very important.\n  First, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, headed by a \nDemocratic appointee, Doug Elmendorf, has said that the majority's \ngovernment-run health plans will actually raise insurance premiums.\n  Despite the pig in a poke the majority is trying to sell to the \nAmerican people, these independent experts have said that the \ngovernment-run option being proposed will have higher premiums than \nprivate plans. There is another analysis that shows that the cost the \ngovernment would impose would increase the cost of the premiums on \nprivate health care plans, particularly if they continue to propose to \nimpose taxes on the health insurers. That is going to be shuffled off \non every health care provider, every person holding private insurance.\n  When has government ever lowered the cost of anything? We know these \nbills will raise taxes on families and small businesses. We also know \nthese bills would cut Medicare for seniors, up to one-half trillion \ndollars, leaving our seniors with fewer health care options. The \nmajority is not even denying these charges. They are hoping no one is \npaying attention. Also what the majority does not want you to know is \nunder these health care bills, government bureaucrats will have control \nover decisions that only you and your doctor should have. These are \nstartling conclusions, but that is why Missourians are rightly \nconcerned about the direction we are headed. Missourians and the people \nacross this country don't want the same kind of denial, delay, and \nrationing that is common in countries with government-driven health \ncare.\n\n  Americans are also concerned with the high price our children and \ngrandchildren will pay for these health care schemes. My constituents \nare asking why, in the midst of a recession, when unemployment is 10 \npercent, why, when Americans are already saddled with massive Federal \ndebt, the majority isn't listening to their concerns as they move ahead \nwith a costly vast expansion of government that increases rather than \nlowers the cost of their health care.\n  Also, I have heard concern about gimmicks that are being used to \nclaim the bill is deficit neutral, such as collecting all the taxes and \nfees long before the plan takes effect and has to be paid for. It is a \ngrand scheme, but no one outside of Washington actually believes a $1 \ntrillion health care bill will do anything but increase costs and pile \nmore debt on our kids and grandkids. In fact, experts have confirmed \nthere would be shortfalls outside the 10-year budget window. It is \nanother smoke and mirrors trick to disguise the fact we are heaping \nmassive debt on future generations.\n  Sadly, this proposed $1 trillion government takeover is just the \nlatest in a string of efforts to expand the government at the cost of \nour children and grandchildren's fiscal future. Already this year the \nadministration and the majority in Congress have spent $1 trillion on \nthe misnamed stimulus bill,\n\n[[Page S10967]]\n\nadopted a budget that will double the debt in 5 years and triple it in \n10, proposed a $3.6 trillion new gasoline tax, and other massive \ntakeovers of various companies and industries.\n  Mr. President, I think we are all in agreement that health care costs \ntoo much, there are too many uninsured, and we need reform. But the \nquestion is, What does real reform look like? To date, we have seen two \nvastly different philosophies. For my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle reform means a vast expansion of government costing more than \n$1 trillion that will increase health care costs, raise taxes, and cut \nMedicare benefits that are needed to pay for the services our seniors \nwill get. Under this kind of reform, Americans will end up paying more \nfor less.\n  Our view on this side of the aisle--as the majority leader has \nalready said--is reform must be commonsense solutions focused on \nlowering health care costs for families and small business. We are \noffering solutions that increase access and improve patient care as \nwell. Contrary to what has just been said on the Senate floor, we \nsupport tax equity for all families, allowing small businesses to form \ntheir own associations to purchase across State lines, and end the \nwaste of the $120 billion annually spent for malpractice insurance and \nthe defensive medicine it causes.\n  We don't need an overhaul of health care to give the American people \nwhat they want. What is needed is for Democrats to stop ignoring the \nAmerican people and start working on a bipartisan basis--which they \nhave not done so far--on real reforms that can make a difference, \nreforms that will lower costs, increase access, and improve patient \ncare. That is what Americans want and that is where our focus should \nbe, and we hope the Democrats will join us.\n  Mr. President, another example where Americans are in a position \nwhere we are going to be seeing a major expansion of government \nindebtedness and exposure of our tax burden is the measure that is \nprobably going to be adopted today to continue and expand the home \nbuyer tax credit provision.\n  Let me begin by pointing out that I originally supported the creation \nand the first extension of the home buyer tax credit. Unfortunately, \nthese days it seems as if the fastest way to make something permanent \nis to have Congress legislate a temporary program.\n  As a longtime housing advocate, I believe a temporary credit, \ncombined with other tools, such as housing counseling and refinancing \nefforts by State financing housing agencies, would help in the \nstabilization and recovery of the market.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I believed it was critical to address the \nhousing market that was at the root of the housing crisis and led to \nour recession. However, the housing crisis has evolved from a crisis \ncaused by loose lending through risky subprime loans to a crisis where \njob loss has become the primary cause of foreclosures and \ndelinquencies. But for several reasons, I strongly believe the home \nbuyer tax credit must end--primarily the disturbing news about fraud in \nthe program and the high cost to taxpayers.\n  Before voting for another extension, I hope my colleagues ask \nthemselves, based on its track record, whether the home buyer tax \ncredit is an effective tool in helping the housing market. It is clear \nto me the answer is no due to its high cost and its vulnerability to \nfraud.\n  News about the real cost to taxpayers is alarming. In reality, this \n$8,000 home buyer tax credit costs the taxpayers at least $43,000 per \nnew home sale using the most generous assumptions. According to the \nBrookings Institution, the vast majority of home buyers who used the \ncredit would have bought a home without it, and at best the credit \nsimply brought forward home sales that would have occurred in the \nfuture. Brookings estimates only 15 percent of the sales were \nattributable to the credit.\n  If we used Goldman Sachs's less generous estimate that far fewer \nsales were directly caused by the credit, the cost to taxpayers rises \nto $80,000 per new sale of homes. For the vast majority of cases, the \nhome buyer tax credit amounted to a free gift since it did not affect \ntheir decision to purchase.\n  As described in a September 19 editorial this year in the Washington \nPost, the tax credit simply moved around the demand to purchase homes \nfrom future to present and from other consumers and other sectors to \nhome buyers and homes. For the small minority of buyers whose decision \nwas directly caused by this credit, this raises the question of whether \nwe are subsidizing buyers who may not have been able to afford buying a \nhome in the first place.\n  In the face of these figures, it seems obvious the home buyer tax \ncredit is a terribly inefficient, irresponsible, and poor use of scarce \ntaxpayer resources. The expansion of the home buyer tax credit, if it \ncontinues only to affect one in five new home purchases with the new \nhigher limits, will significantly increase the cost of exposure of the \nAmerican public to the costs of these credits and to the risk.\n  Even worse than the inefficient use of tax dollars is the misuse of \nfunds. With the lack of oversight and uncovered fraud in this program, \nextending the credit could result in throwing away billions of taxpayer \ndollars. The evidence of fraud in the program was reported by the \nTreasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. According to him, \nthe IRS is investigating more than 100,000 suspicious and potentially \nfraudulent claims involving tax credits. In addition, the IRS and \nFederal law enforcement agencies are investigating 167 criminal schemes \ninvolving the credit.\n  Further, the Inspector General uncovered hundreds of cases where \nchildren--some as young as 4 years old--and illegal immigrants claimed \nthe credit. Even more disturbing, the IG found that IRS employees \nthemselves were illegally using the credit. It sounds to me as though \nwe have the fox guarding the hen house. It is, therefore, not \nsurprising that one low-income tax aide recently testified before a \ncongressional panel that the abuse of the tax credit appeared to be \nwidespread.\n  Legislative changes are being included to address this fraud. Thank \nyou. I appreciate the efforts. But it is unrealistic to believe they \nwill be successful due to the longstanding management and oversight \nchallenges of the IRS and the rampant fraud in the marketplace.\n  My colleagues on the Finance, Appropriations, and Homeland Security \nand Government Affairs Committees are very familiar with the IRS tax \nadministration shortcomings that have been well documented by the \nInspector General and the GAO. When I chaired the Treasury, \nTransportation, HUD, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, \nI became familiar with the IRS administration tax challenges. I am also \nfamiliar with other housing fraud cases because I have been working \nwith the FHA for too many years.\n\n  As I learned, waste, fraud, and abuse cannot be stopped no matter how \nmany ``thou shalt nots'' are included in the legislation.\n  In the case of the home buyer tax credit, it is nearly impossible to \nstop fraud when those who are supposed to prevent fraud are actually \ncommitting fraud at the IRS. With the FBI reporting that mortgage fraud \nis at a level even higher during the subprime boom, we are kidding \nourselves if we think we can prevent more fraud and more taxpayer \nlosses.\n  The most effective means of preventing fraud is simply not to extend \nthe credit. That was the approach taken by Congress to finally stop the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse of the so-called FHA seller no-downpayment \nprogram.\n  Finally, and most troubling, is that we are going down the same path \nthat led us to the subprime crisis. The previous two administrations \ntried to prop up home prices through government incentives and programs \nsimilar to the tax credit, which contributed to the housing bubble. No-\ndownpayment sales led to the explosion of foreclosures.\n  If a family doesn't have the dollars for a downpayment, they often \ncannot cover the unexpected but sure to occur unforeseen costs of \nowning a home. No downpayment has meant for too many people the \nAmerican dream turning into the American nightmare.\n  Are we going down the same road with the home buyer tax credit? Are \nthe credits being monetized to cover for an inability of the purchaser \nto come up with the downpayment?\n\n[[Page S10968]]\n\n  Lastly, does anyone remember President Clinton's 1995 National \nHomeownership Strategy in which he charged HUD to work with leaders in \ngovernment and the housing industry to increase home ownership? Have we \nforgotten President Bush's 2002 America's Homeownership Challenge and \nthe 2004 Ownership Society Initiative to work with the real estate and \nmortgage finance industries to help boost the home ownership rates of \nminorities with the goal of increasing the number of minority \nhomeowners?\n  All of these are extremely noble objectives. I agree with the \nobjectives. But how did the government actually encourage home \nownership? The government used a number and variety of tools, such as \ntax incentives and easy access to financing for borrowers through \nentities such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHA.\n  The Tax Code already provides generous incentives to encourage home \nownership through mortgage interest deduction, property tax deduction, \nand capital gains tax exclusion. The Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimates that for 2008 these tax incentives totaled just over $108 \nbillion.\n  Through the implicit backing of the Federal Government and its own \ntax advantages, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were to boost home ownership \nby improving access to credit for borrowers. For low-income borrowers, \nthe government pushed Fannie and Freddie to increase its purchases of \nthe riskiest loans, such as alternative A and subprime mortgages--some \nwhere they didn't even check to see if the person had an income. The \nriskiest loans eventually accounted for about 15 percent of Fannie and \nFreddie's portfolio, which included a significant number of subprime \nloans originated by lenders such as Countrywide.\n  Not surprisingly, Countrywide became Fannie Mae's top business \npartner, accounting for 28 percent of Fannie's loan portfolio in 2007. \nFHA also was used by the government to encourage home ownership by \nensuring loans at virtually no risk to lenders and with little or no \ndownpayment by borrowers.\n  In other words, nobody who was running up the tab, who was taking on \nthe obligations on the government's credit card, had any skin in the \ngame. With the implosion of the private subprime industry and the \ncredit crunch, the government--through Fannie, Freddie, and FHA--has \nbecome the primary source of mortgage funding. The Federal Reserve Bank \nrecently estimated the Federal Government now accounts for 95 percent \nof the mortgage market. In other words, the Nation's mortgage market \nhas been effectively federalized, and all of the risk is now on the \nback of the taxpayer.\n  As with previous housing bubbles, the taxpayer ends up bearing the \nbrunt. Last time I checked, the government didn't do a good job of \nbeing a landlord.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the Congressional Quarterly cover story \nof July 7, 2008, entitled ``FHA Guarantees Not A Panacea.'' By pushing \nand subsidizing home ownership, the government has turned the American \ndream into the American nightmare for homeowners, for neighbors, \ncommunities, the global financial system, and taxpayers.\n  Are we learning from past mistakes or repeating them? Even without \nthe tax credit, government has already taken unprecedented steps to \nstabilize the housing sector. The Fed has bought hundreds of billions \nof dollars' worth of mortgage-backed securities, taken on the debts of \nFannie and Freddie, replaced the private subprime lending with the \ngovernment's version of subprime through the FHA by expanding their \nbusiness in several ways, such as the enactment of HOPE for Homeowners. \nNot surprisingly, FHA losses have dramatically increased.\n  I ask unanimous consent to continue for 1 minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. The damage caused by distorting housing prices cannot be \ndenied. Economics Professor Edward Glaeser of Harvard wrote:\n\n       Subsidized lending has encouraged millions of markets to \n     leverage themselves wildly to bet on the housing market.\n\n  Betting taxpayer funds is a bad bet. Why are we continuing these \ndebt-fueled policies? Why do we keep using taxpayer dollars to distort \nand manipulate the market? What is our exit strategy from a massive \nFederal Government takeover of housing?\n  Josh Rosner, a managing director of Graham Fisher, said:\n\n       We've created a society where we love the term home \n     ownership, yet we can't allow people to understand that they \n     are being taken advantage of.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post editorial of \nSeptember 19 and articles by Professor Glaeser printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 19, 2009]\n\n                              Extra Credit\n\n       It's time for Congress to cancel a temporary tax subsidy \n     for homebuyers.\n       For the Nation's troubled housing market, things are \n     looking tentatively but undeniably better. New-home sales, \n     though still well below where they were a year previously, \n     rose at a nearly 10 percent monthly rate in July. The median \n     home price ticked up in 15 of 20 metropolitan areas in June, \n     according to the S/Case-Shiller Home Price Index. This is \n     important good news for the economy, because it promises an \n     end to the foreclosure wave that has rippled across the \n     country and because even families not threatened by \n     foreclosure tend to trim their spending in times of declining \n     home equity.\n       This fragile stability has been achieved through colossal \n     government intervention in the housing sector. To hold down \n     mortgage rates, the Federal Reserve has bought hundreds of \n     billions of dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities on \n     its way to a promised total of $1.25 trillion. The Treasury \n     has taken on the debts and operational losses of Fannie Mae \n     and Freddie Mac, which own or guarantee a combined $5.4 \n     trillion in mortgages. The Federal Housing Administration, \n     designed to insure mortgages for a relatively few low-income \n     buyers, backed 40 percent of all new home loans (together \n     with other agencies) in August, according to the Mortgage \n     Bankers Association. Yet its losses have mounted: An audit \n     shows that FHA reserves are about to fall below the legal \n     minimum, which is 2 percent of the value of all loans \n     guaranteed by the agency. In short, the very real risk of \n     homeowner default is now more concentrated than ever before \n     in the government's hands. That is perhaps necessary in an \n     emergency, but certainly undesirable in the long run.\n       The housing market has also benefited from its own version \n     of the ``Cash for Clunkers'' program, which Congress created \n     for autos. As part of the February stimulus bill, Congress \n     created an $8,000 tax credit for individual first-time \n     homebuyers who make less than $75,000, or couples who makes \n     less than $150,000; it expires in November. This was an \n     expansion of a slightly less generous ``temporary'' credit \n     Congress had adopted in 2008. The National Association of \n     Realtors says that the policy generated 350,000 home sales \n     this year. And, not surprisingly, the real estate industry \n     and its supporters on Capitol Hill are calling for an \n     extension of the $8,000 credit to save the incipient housing \n     recovery. Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) wants to make it \n     $15,000.\n       The credit probably did stimulate home sales, just as Cash \n     for Clunkers gave auto dealers a shot in the arm this summer. \n     But, like Cash for Clunkers, the housing credit does not \n     magically generate demand. It moves demand around--from the \n     future to the present, and from other consumers, and other \n     sectors, to homebuyers and homes. These ``results'' don't \n     come for free. Cash for Clunkers added $4 billion to the \n     federal deficit, and the housing tax credit is on track to \n     add $15 billion.\n       Congress should end this program while it still can. With \n     hundreds of billions of dollars in support from the Fed, the \n     Treasury and the FHA still in place, the housing market can \n     survive without it. Indeed, the looming problem for the U.S. \n     economy is how to wean housing off its dependence on federal \n     backing. That job will be hard enough without adding yet \n     another not-so-temporary subsidy to the list.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Nov. 2, 2008]\n\n                         This Old House Policy\n\n                          (By Edward Glaeser)\n\n       At the heart of this fall's historic financial crisis lies \n     a steep, nationwide fall in the price of homes. After a wild, \n     bubble-like boom, housing prices have fallen more than 30 \n     percent in some areas, wiping away the wealth of ordinary \n     Americans and bringing some of the nation's biggest financial \n     institutions to the point of insolvency.\n       For many pundits and politicians, the solution is clear: \n     find some way to keep the price of houses high, whether \n     through new government-subsidized loans or by buying up \n     troubled mortgages. Keeping house prices up has an obvious \n     appeal to home-owning voters. The banking system would \n     certainly benefit if new subsidies actually did shore up the \n     assets that lie at the center of the crisis.\n       But despite its popular appeal, the notion that the \n     government should try to prop up housing prices with more \n     mortgage subsidies is a mistake. On a practical level, even a \n     huge expenditure of taxpayer money is unlikely to have a \n     meaningful effect on the\n\n[[Page S10969]]\n\n     price of homes. And to the extent that it did work, \n     artificially high house prices will only encourage more new \n     homes to be built, adding to the glut and making the crisis \n     worse.\n       In a larger sense, the problem lies in the very idea that \n     the government should spend money to keep house prices high--\n     the legacy of an expensive national housing policy that has \n     long outlived its purpose.\n       Today, there is no more case for artificially boosting \n     housing prices than there is for artificially inflating the \n     price of tea or T-shirts. We need to start treating housing \n     markets not as some sort of ephemeral part of the American \n     dream, but with the same rigorous logic that is used to think \n     about markets for oil or software or orange juice. The goal \n     of housing policy should be not to make prices higher, but to \n     make homes more affordable--and, in so doing, to give people \n     the opportunity to choose housing that fits their needs.\n       A better response to this crisis would be to define \n     sensible housing goals and to find policies that will \n     actually help us meet them. Rather than increasing the \n     subsidies for borrowing, the government would do better to \n     offer a small, targeted tax benefit to first-time home \n     buyers. Instead of large-scale incentives that divert \n     billions of dollars toward wealthy Americans who borrow to \n     buy bigger homes, we should make housing more affordable by \n     reducing the barriers to building more housing where it's \n     needed.\n       Housing is special. It is not just a commodity or an \n     investment, but a basic human need. Our homes are the stages \n     on which much of our lives play out. For most Americans, \n     homes are also the primary form of savings, which means that \n     the government has a strong interest in not paying to fuel \n     the borrowing that helped spur this painful boom-bust cycle \n     in the first place.\n       For 75 years, through both Democratic and Republican \n     administrations, the federal government has aimed to increase \n     homeownership by making it easier for people to borrow money \n     to buy a house. The roots of this approach lie in the New \n     Deal, when the government wanted to boost employment in the \n     construction industry. The public commitment to subsidized \n     lending increased in the Housing Act of 1949, which embraced \n     the objective of ``a decent home and a suitable living \n     environment for every American family.''\n       To achieve its goals, the government established Fannie Mae \n     and Freddie Mac, which created a fluid mortgage market by \n     guaranteeing mortgages against default. On an even larger \n     scale, the government provides an immense annual subsidy to \n     mortgage holders in the form of the home mortgage interest \n     deduction--a tremendous tax advantage enjoyed by anyone who \n     borrows money to buy a house and earns enough to make \n     itemization worthwhile. The more you borrow, the more you \n     save in taxes.\n       These policies helped create a multitrillion-dollar home-\n     lending market, which has helped bring about remarkable \n     improvements in American housing. In 1940, almost 45 percent \n     of American homes lacked complete indoor plumbing. More than \n     20 percent of homes had more than one person per room. By \n     1980, less than 3 percent of homes lacked plumbing and less \n     than 5 percent had more than one person per room. Today, the \n     average American has close to 1,000 square feet of living \n     space, more than twice the norm in France or England or \n     Germany. Much of that improvement was driven by rising \n     American incomes rather than government policy. Still, by \n     those measures, federal housing policy at least looks like a \n     success.\n       But the public subsidy of credit markets has also had a \n     dark side. The tax subsidy does modestly encourage \n     homeownership. But it specifically encourages borrowing to \n     invest in expensive homes, which are risky assets that can \n     crash as well as boom. We had housing bubbles long before the \n     federal government got into the subsidy business, but \n     encouraging homeowners to buy with borrowed money certainly \n     did nothing to moderate extreme price swings.\n       The past eight years, in which housing prices first doubled \n     and then collapsed, deserve a place in the annals of market \n     mania. In states like Massachusetts, where housing supply is \n     limited, borrowing has kept prices high, which benefits \n     existing homeowners but counterproductively makes \n     homeownership more difficult for ordinary Americans. In \n     states like Nevada, with few regulations and wide-open spaces \n     to build, these policies encourage further construction of \n     more and bigger homes. In the 1940s, it may have made sense \n     to encourage Americans to house their children in larger and \n     better houses. But today, we are essentially spending federal \n     money to encourage people to live in 3,000-square-foot houses \n     instead of 2,500-square-foot houses.\n       In the midst of the crisis, it's understandable that some \n     economists would think that the right response is to try to \n     keep housing prices up by jacking up the federal subsidy for \n     borrowing. Their logic is that lower mortgage rates will \n     energize home buyers and cause housing prices to rise again. \n     This kind of policy--bolstering prices by subsidizing \n     borrowing--is like catnip to politicians, since most American \n     voters are homeowners who would like to see prices go up.\n       But trying to boost house prices through looser lending is \n     likely to be expensive, ineffective, and create a number of \n     unattractive side effects. Even a massive and expensive \n     government intervention is likely to do no more than prop up \n     house prices by 5 percent--a difference almost imperceptible \n     to the people who need it most, those who have seen their \n     house values drop by 30 percent.\n       Lending subsidies are likely to be particularly ineffective \n     in the areas that have had the biggest boom-bust cycles, like \n     Las Vegas and Phoenix. In these places, there are neither \n     natural nor man-made limits on building, and, as a result, \n     house prices in these areas stayed close to the cost of \n     construction until 2003. Between 2003 and 2006, these areas \n     experienced a brief, wild price boom. Today, prices in these \n     areas are headed down toward construction costs again. If a \n     housing subsidy did manage to keep prices higher for a time, \n     this would only encourage more overbuilding and a larger \n     housing glut.\n       Any new subsidy would only increase the cost of our current \n     system, which is already immensely expensive. We still don't \n     know how much restructuring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will \n     cost. The mortgage-interest subsidy was estimated to cost the \n     government $74 billion in 2007 alone. Most of that money \n     benefits people with the largest mortgages. The current \n     system, in other words, allocates vast amounts of money to \n     help well-off people bid up the prices of even better-off \n     people's homes.\n       Instead of continuing the debt-fueled policies that got us \n     where we are, why not rethink our approach to the housing \n     market?\n       Our current policy takes homeownership itself to be a \n     public good. Our leaders seem to like homeowners. Thomas \n     Jefferson lauded yeoman farmers and George W. Bush admires \n     the ownership society. Homeowners are indeed more likely to \n     vote in local elections or know the name of their \n     congressman; they are also more likely to garden, and own \n     guns.\n       Yet homeownership is not for everyone. As recent events \n     well illustrate, owning a home comes with large risks, \n     especially for people who aren't planning on living in the \n     same place for a long time. For people who live in \n     multifamily dwellings, the administrative costs of renting \n     can be much lower than dealing with the difficulties of \n     collective ownership. Renting creates more flexibility for \n     people in America's highly mobile workforce. A far more \n     sensible approach to housing would view homeownership as \n     one possible housing option, not a primary public goal.\n       And even if, as a society, America decides that the social \n     benefits of homeownership are sufficiently strong that \n     ownership should be encouraged, there are much cheaper and \n     more effective ways of doing that than by encouraging people \n     to borrow more money.\n       For instance, the home mortgage interest deduction could be \n     reduced or even eliminated. Most people who are on the margin \n     between renting and owning have relatively lower incomes. Yet \n     the home mortgage interest deduction targets its benefits to \n     the richest people, who buy the biggest homes. A small \n     targeted subsidy for first-time buyers could encourage \n     homeownership just as effectively as the current system, \n     without encouraging people to borrow vast amounts or to buy \n     larger homes. (Reducing the home mortgage interest deduction \n     doesn't mean that taxes need to go up--we could take the $75 \n     billion that it costs and use that money to reduce other \n     taxes.)\n       Instead of spending federal money to encourage borrowing \n     and keep prices high, it would make more sense to make \n     housing more affordable by eliminating the artificial \n     restrictions that stymie supply. In other areas of the \n     economy, the government protects consumers by eliminating \n     monopolies and other barriers to competition; our nation's \n     commitment to free markets and free trade reflects our faith \n     that ordinary Americans win when the price of clothing is \n     brought down by imports from China, or when retailers and \n     manufacturers face fewer unnecessary regulations.\n       In the housing market, prices are artificially inflated by \n     barriers to building new housing in many communities. In \n     dense states like Massachusetts, prices have been kept high \n     by localities that oppose new construction, with large \n     minimum lot sizes, Draconian barriers to subdivisions, and a \n     general hostility to any multifamily housing. If those rules \n     were eased, then housing would become more abundant and \n     affordable.\n       Today, in the depths of the crisis, it's easy to think that \n     the quickest solution is to keep house prices from falling \n     any further. Certainly, we shouldn't feed the financial panic \n     by deliberately pushing housing prices downward in the midst \n     of a price collapse. But it also doesn't make sense to try to \n     stop the natural return of housing prices to their long-run \n     levels--and to do so for reasons that no longer suit \n     America's housing needs.\n       Subsidized lending has encouraged millions of Americans to \n     leverage themselves wildly to bet on the housing market. All \n     that betting helped to create the bubble that has now popped. \n     Lending more cheap money would be like a gambler doubling \n     down and hoping for a win next time.\n       Not everyone needs to be a homeowner. Not everyone needs to \n     live in a McMansion. There's no single solution to the puzzle \n     of housing policy, but one thing is clear: it should be based \n     on good economics, not on an attachment to homeownership, the \n     political appeal of helping homeowners, or the sentimental \n     view that the American dream means owning a big house.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, once again this weekend I got an earful when \nI\n\n[[Page S10970]]\n\nwent home and heard from my constituents. Arizonians have told me \nrepeatedly they don't want government-run insurance and they deserve to \nhave their concerns taken seriously. The Democratic leaders in both \nChambers of Congress have decided to include government-run insurance, \nthe so-called public option, in their healthcare bills anyway.\n  Supporters of government-run insurance say it would be one choice of \nmany and that it would promote competition. In reality, the government-\nrun insurance would soon be the only option. Its artificially low \nprices, government backing, and ability to run at a huge loss would \nquickly put private insurers out of business, forcing millions of \nAmericans onto the government-run plan.\n  That is why the Lewin Group estimates that 88 million Americans with \nemployer-sponsored insurance would wind up on the government-run plan. \nThe Lewin Group is a well respected firm that consults in the area of \nhealth care.\n  It concludes that once the architecture for a huge government-run \nplan is in place, future Congresses need only take small steps to get \nto a single-payer system.\n  We have seen what happens in countries with government-run health \ncare--rationing, delays, and denials. No country, not even the most \nprosperous on Earth, has unlimited resources to spend on health care. \nSo when a government takes over health care--as it has in countries \nsuch as Britain, Canada, and many European countries--care ends up \nbeing rationed. People in Canada and the United Kingdom routinely wait \nmonths for procedures Americans can get in a matter of days, if not \nhours. The stories you hear about monthly, in fact years-long, waiting \nlists are not cherry-picked scare stories. They are commonplace. \nPatients often wait in pain for an MRI or a hip replacement or dental \ncare.\n  According to a study by the Fraser Institute, which is a Canadian-\nbased think tank, the average wait time for treatment from a specialist \nis 18.3 weeks in Canada.\n  The $1.055 trillion Pelosi health care bill unveiled last week sets \nus on course to experience that kind of government rationing. Under the \nPelosi plan, a new health care choices commissioner--by the way, that \nsounds a little Orwellian to me--will decide what counts as essential \nbenefits for Americans. Simply put, Washington bureaucrats at 111 new \nFederal boards, commissions, and programs will dictate your health \ninsurance.\n  The Government will order all insurance plans to offer a one-size-\nfits-all benefits package, and the same array of plan options. Rather \nthan having the freedom to compete, insurers would in essence become \nprepaid health utilities.\n  The new Federal mandates and requirements will quickly raise health \ncare costs. In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, the Chief Actuary at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, and other independent actuaries all agree: \nThe Democrats' plan will drive up premiums and overall health care \nspending faster than in the absence of such so-called reforms.\n  As premiums rise, politicians will search for ways to control \nspiraling costs without relinquishing their control. The most obvious \npath would be more tax increases and payment cuts for doctors and \nhospitals, but when those options are exhausted--and they will be--the \ngovernment's only remaining cost containment tool is to control how \nmuch health care everyone receives; that is, to ration care.\n  The Pelosi bill shows Democratic leaders have not listened to the \nAmerican people at all. Americans have been clear. They do not want a \ngovernment takeover of health care. Americans want high-quality health \ncare that is more affordable. Instead, they are getting a 2000-page, \n$1.055 trillion bill that leads to a near Washington takeover of health \ncare with rationing and increased premiums and new taxes along the way.\n  Republicans will insist on protection for our constituents from the \nharmful effects of this bill. We believe Americans have rights in this \nprocess. We want to see commonsense reforms that empower patients and \nfamilies, not government bureaucrats.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial in the Wall Street Journal, \ndated November 1, called ``The Worst Bill Ever'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 1, 2009]\n\n                          The Worst Bill Ever\n\n       Speaker Nancy Pelosi has reportedly told fellow Democrats \n     that she's prepared to lose seats in 2010 if that's what it \n     takes to pass ObamaCare, and little wonder. The health bill \n     she unwrapped last Thursday, which President Obama hailed as \n     a ``critical milestone,'' may well be the worst piece of \n     post-New Deal legislation ever introduced.\n       In a rational political world, this 1,990-page runaway \n     train would have been derailed months ago. With spending and \n     debt already at record peacetime levels, the bill creates a \n     new and probably unrepealable middle-class entitlement that \n     is designed to expand over time. Taxes will need to rise \n     precipitously, even as ObamaCare so dramatically expands \n     government control of health care that eventually all \n     medicine will be rationed via politics.\n       Yet at this point, Democrats have dumped any pretense of \n     genuine bipartisan ``reform'' and moved into the realm of \n     pure power politics as they race against the unpopularity of \n     their own agenda. The goal is to ram through whatever income-\n     redistribution scheme they can claim to be ``universal \n     coverage.'' The result will be destructive on every level--\n     for the health-care system, for the country's fiscal \n     condition, and ultimately for American freedom and \n     prosperity.\n       The spending surge. The Congressional Budget Office figures \n     the House program will cost $1.055 trillion over a decade, \n     which while far above the $829 billion net cost that Mrs. \n     Pelosi fed to credulous reporters is still a low-ball \n     estimate. Most of the money goes into government-run \n     ``exchanges'' where people earning between 150% and 400% of \n     the poverty level--that is, up to about $96,000 for a family \n     of four in 2016--could buy coverage at heavily subsidized \n     rates, tied to income. The government would pay for 93% of \n     insurance costs for a family making $42,000, 72% for another \n     making $78,000, and so forth.\n       At least at first, these benefits would be offered only to \n     those whose employers don't provide insurance or work for \n     small businesses with 100 or fewer workers. The taxpayer \n     costs would be far higher if not for this ``firewall''--which \n     is sure to cave in when people see the deal their neighbors \n     are getting on ``free'' health care. Mrs. Pelosi knows this, \n     like everyone else in Washington.\n       Even so, the House disguises hundreds of billions of \n     dollars in additional costs with budget gimmicks. It ``pays \n     for'' about six years of program with a decade of revenue, \n     with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five \n     years. The House also pretends Medicare payments to doctors \n     will be cut by 21.5% next year and deeper after that, \n     ``saving'' about $250 billion. ObamaCare will be lucky to \n     cost under $2 trillion over 10 years; it will grow more after \n     that.\n       Expanding Medicaid, gutting private Medicare. All this is \n     particularly reckless given the unfunded liabilities of \n     Medicare--now north of $37 trillion over 75 years. Mrs. \n     Pelosi wants to steal $426 billion from future Medicare \n     spending to ``pay for'' universal coverage. While Medicare's \n     price controls on doctors and hospitals are certain to be \n     tightened, the only cut that is a sure thing in practice is \n     gutting Medicare Advantage to the tune of $170 \n     billion. Democrats loathe this program because it gives \n     one of out five seniors private insurance options.\n       As for Medicaid, the House will expand eligibility to \n     everyone below 150% of the poverty level, meaning that some \n     15 million new people will be added to the rolls as private \n     insurance gets crowded out at a cost of $425 billion. A \n     decade from now more than a quarter of the population will be \n     on a program originally intended for poor women, children and \n     the disabled.\n       Even though the House will assume 91% of the ``matching \n     rate'' for this joint state-federal program--up from today's \n     57%--governors would still be forced to take on $34 billion \n     in new burdens when budgets from Albany to Sacramento are in \n     fiscal collapse. Washington's budget will collapse too, if \n     anything like the House bill passes.\n       European levels of taxation. All told, the House favors \n     $572 billion in new taxes, mostly by imposing a 5.4-\n     percentage-point ``surcharge'' on joint filers earning over \n     $1 million, $500,000 for singles. This tax will raise the top \n     marginal rate to 45% in 2011 from 39.6% when the Bush tax \n     cuts expire--not counting state income taxes and the phase-\n     out of certain deductions and exemptions. The burden will \n     mostly fall on the small businesses that have organized as \n     Subchapter S or limited liability corporations, since the \n     truly wealthy won't have any difficulty sheltering their \n     incomes.\n       This surtax could hit ever more earners because, like the \n     alternative minimum tax, it isn't indexed for inflation. Yet \n     it still won't be nearly enough. Even if Congress had \n     confiscated 100% of the taxable income of people earning over \n     $500,000 in the boom year of 2006, it would have only raised \n     $1.3 trillion. When Democrats end up soaking the middle \n     class, perhaps via the European-style value-added tax that \n     Mrs. Pelosi has endorsed, they'll claim the deficits that \n     they created made them do it.\n\n[[Page S10971]]\n\n       Under another new tax, businesses would have to surrender \n     8% of their payroll to government if they don't offer \n     insurance or pay at least 72.5% of their workers' premiums, \n     which eat into wages. Such ``play or pay'' taxes always \n     become ``pay or pay'' and will rise over time, with severe \n     consequences for hiring, job creation and ultimately growth. \n     While the U.S. already has one of the highest corporate \n     income tax rates in the world, Democrats are on the way to \n     creating a high structural unemployment rate, much as Europe \n     has done by expanding its welfare states.\n       Meanwhile, a tax equal to 2.5% of adjusted gross income \n     will also be imposed on some 18 million people who CBO \n     expects still won't buy insurance in 2019. Democrats could \n     make this penalty even higher, but that is politically \n     unacceptable, or they could make the subsidies even higher, \n     but that would expose the (already ludicrous) illusion that \n     ObamaCare will reduce the deficit.\n       The insurance takeover. A new ``health choices \n     commissioner'' will decide what counts as ``essential \n     benefits,'' which all insurers will have to offer as first-\n     dollar coverage. Private insurers will also be told how much \n     they are allowed to charge even as they will have to offer \n     coverage at virtually the same price to anyone who applies, \n     regardless of health status or medical history.\n       The cost of insurance, naturally, will skyrocket. The \n     insurer WellPoint estimates based on its own market data that \n     some premiums in the individual market will triple under \n     these new burdens. The same is likely to prove true for the \n     employer-sponsored plans that provide private coverage to \n     about 177 million people today. Over time, the new mandates \n     will apply to all contracts, including for the large \n     businesses currently given a safe harbor from bureaucratic \n     tampering under a 1974 law called Erisa.\n       The political incentive will always be for government to \n     expand benefits and reduce cost-sharing, trampling any chance \n     of giving individuals financial incentives to economize on \n     care. Essentially, all insurers will become government \n     contractors, in the business of fulfilling political demands: \n     There will be no such thing as ``private'' health insurance.\n       All of this is intentional, even if it isn't explicitly \n     acknowledged. The overriding liberal ambition is to finish \n     the work began decades ago as the Great Society of converting \n     health care into a government responsibility. Mr. Obama's own \n     Medicare actuaries estimate that the federal share of U.S. \n     health dollars will quickly climb beyond 60% from 46% today. \n     One reason Mrs. Pelosi has fought so ferociously against her \n     own Blue Dog colleagues to include at least a scaled-back \n     ``public option'' entitlement program is so that the \n     architecture is in place for future Congresses to expand this \n     share even further.\n       As Congress's balance sheet drowns in trillions of dollars \n     in new obligations, the political system will have no choice \n     but to start making cost-minded decisions about which \n     treatments patients are allowed to receive. Democrats can't \n     regulate their way out of the reality that we live in a world \n     of finite resources and infinite wants. Once health care is \n     nationalized, or mostly nationalized, medical rationing is \n     inevitable--especially for the innovative high-cost \n     technologies and drugs that are the future of medicine.\n       Mr. Obama rode into office on a wave of ``change,'' but we \n     doubt most voters realized that the change Democrats had in \n     mind was making health care even more expensive and rigid \n     than the status quo. Critics will say we are exaggerating, \n     but we believe it is no stretch to say that Mrs. Pelosi's \n     handiwork ranks with the Smoot-Hawley tariff and FDR's \n     National Industrial Recovery Act as among the worst bills \n     Congress has ever seriously contemplated.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Let me quote four sentences from this editorial.\n\n       In a rational political world, this 1,990-page runaway \n     train would have been derailed months ago. With spending and \n     debt already at record peacetime levels, the bill creates a \n     new and probably unrepealable middle-class entitlement that \n     is designed to expand over time. Taxes will need to rise \n     precipitously, even as ObamaCare so dramatically expands \n     government control of health care that eventually all \n     medicine will be rationed via politics.\n\n  The editorial goes on to say:\n\n       The result will be destructive on every level--for the \n     health-care system, for the country's fiscal condition, and \n     ultimately for American freedom and prosperity.\n\n  The editorial goes on to detail the myriad of ways this is true. I \nbelieve the conclusion is correct and mirrors the comments I made at \nthe beginning here.\n  The final thing I wish to do is to comment on a letter which \nRepublicans wrote to the majority leader and the response which we \nreceived. Out of fairness to the majority leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at the conclusion of my remarks, his letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what we wrote was to ask him if he would be \nwilling to share with us the bill that the media reported he had sent \nto the Congressional Budget Office to have scored. That is \ncongressional talk for to have the cost facts, costs of and savings \nfrom the bill, or taxes generated by the legislation provided to us. \nEvery bill that comes to the Senate floor has to be scored. The news \nhad reported that the majority leader had sent a bill to CBO to be \nscored.\n  He held a press conference in which he talked about the government \noption or government-run health care part of that, what I spoke about \nearlier. But what the majority leader said in this letter is that there \nis no bill. He talked about the part he had referred to the CBO, \nrelating to the so-called public option, but he then said that is all \nhe had sent to them, and I will quote his conclusion here: ``In other \nwords, there is no bill to release publicly--it does not exist.''\n  Apparently there is no bill yet from the majority leader, only this \nconcept of a public option which he has presented to CBO to be scored. \nHe then concluded by asking where the ``comprehensive Republican \nalternative is,'' and he said he would like to get a copy of that.\n  This is something Republicans have been saying for months now. You \nare not going to see the same size bill out of Republicans you have \nseen out of the Democratic majority. You are not going to see a 2,000-\npage bill. I exaggerate by 10 pages; I am sorry, it is 1,990 pages. We \nare not going to propose a comprehensive reform of the entire health \ncare system and insurance industry as the Pelosi bill has done. Nor are \nyou going to see an over-a-thousand-page bill such as the bills that \ncame out of the Senate committees. You are not going to see $1 trillion \ncome out of Republicans. We do not believe that is the way to deal with \nthe discrete problems that exist in our system.\n  Yes, we have problems. Those problems have specific solutions. But \nthey do not have to cost $1 trillion or consume 2,000 pages of text and \ntake over our health care system. That is the whole point of the \ndebate. You have two different philosophies: one which says we have to \ndo it in a comprehensive way that takes over everything we currently \nhave; the other says, no, we don't have to do that, that is too much \ntaxes, too much loss of freedom, an increase in premiums, too much \ngovernment control, and too much debt. We don't need to do that. What \nwe need to do is focus on the specific problems and solve them.\n  We have talked repeatedly about the ideas we have to do that. You can \nsave maybe $100 billion to $200 billion a year in unnecessary health \ncare expenditures that result from the practice of defensive medicine. \nThat is, medical malpractice reform could save that much money without \ncosting a dime.\n  You could also provide for more competition among the insurance \ncompanies--not through a government-run insurance company but allowing \nthem to compete with each other across State lines, by allowing small \nbusinesses and others to join together and expand their risk pools into \nsomething called association health plans, so they would have more \nbargaining power when they negotiate with the insurance companies, as \nbig business does, and a variety of other things.\n  My point is the Republican solutions to the specific problems are \ntargeted solutions that don't cost a lot of money, don't ration health \ncare, don't take away your freedom, and don't require 2,000 pages to \nwade through what you are doing.\n  When the majority leader tries to entice Republicans into sharing \nwith him our comprehensive bill that is like the Democrat comprehensive \nbill, my answer to him is I am sorry, Mr. Leader, you are going to be \ndisappointed because that is not our approach, as we have been saying \nall along. But at the time you have your 1,000-page or 2,000-page bill, \nwhatever it is, obviously we wish to see it.\n  I think the American people deserve to see it because, as I heard \nfrom my constituents this weekend, they are very afraid about what they \nare hearing. They are hearing about this massive government takeover, \nmassive expense, new taxes, premium increases, increase in the debt, \nand rationing of health care. They are scared to death and they have a \nreason to be frightened about this.\n  As soon as the majority bill is ready, obviously Republicans are \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S10972]]\n\nwant to examine it and share it with our constituents. In the meantime, \nwhat we have to talk about, I guess, is the bill that will be debated \nand voted on in the House of Representatives this week, the so-called \nPelosi bill which, as I said, the Wall Street Journal has editorialized \nabout today in a way that I think should continue to frighten people. \nAs I said, it is called ``The Worst Bill Ever,'' and after you read the \neditorial I think you can see the reasons why.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 2009.\n       Dear Colleague: Thank you for your recent letter on health \n     care reform. I agree with you about the importance of \n     ensuring that the Senate debate health care reform in an open \n     and transparent way, and assure you that the process for \n     considering this critical legislation will continue to meet \n     that standard.\n       As you know, both the HELP and Finance Committees conducted \n     lengthy public markups at which Republican and Democratic \n     Senators offered numerous amendments and proposals by members \n     of both parties were approved. This legislation has been \n     fully available on the Internet for many weeks.\n       As you also know, we are now working to take these \n     publicly-available provisions and meld them together into a \n     single bill. Apart from my decision to include a public \n     option from which states may opt out, no final decisions have \n     been made--and none can be made until we get more information \n     about how CBO would score different combinations. In other \n     words, there is no bill to release publicly--it does not \n     exist.\n       Once we receive the necessary information from CBO, we can \n     begin to make decisions about what to include in a merged \n     bill. I assure you that I will make the legislation available \n     to the full Senate and the American people prior to its \n     consideration. There will be ample opportunity to examine and \n     evaluate its provisions. Furthermore, if we are able to \n     overcome your opposition to permitting the Senate to even \n     debate this important legislation, all members will have the \n     opportunity to offer amendments. I have no intention of \n     rushing this process or blocking Senators from offering \n     alternatives.\n       While the two health care reform plans that are serving as \n     the main building blocks for the merged bill have been \n     publicly available for quite some time, I would note that the \n     Republican Leadership's health care plan remains a secret, \n     unless perhaps it does not exist.\n       Needless to say, I fully understand if your plan is still \n     under development, and would not presume to suggest that you \n     publicly share draft legislative text for even an individual \n     element of your plan, let alone an entire bill, before it is \n     finalized.\n       However, as soon as a comprehensive Republican alternative \n     is complete, I hope you will be willing to immediately make \n     it public. I am sure you agree that the American people \n     deserve the opportunity to fully review both parties' health \n     reform plans before we begin this important debate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid,\n                                           Senate Majority Leader.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, as I start out this afternoon, I wish \nalso to speak about health care. If I could, I wish to associate myself \nwith the remarks of the Senator from Arizona. In his comments, I \nthought Senator Kyl hit the nail on the head. What we are looking for \nand I believe what the American people are looking for in this health \ncare debate is a very thoughtful, step-by-step approach. That is what I \nhear when I go back home. I suspect other Senators are hearing the same \nthing.\n  Today I want to talk about something that I as a former Governor--and \nI know the Presiding Officer was a former Governor; we were Governors \ntogether--have experience with and that is Federal legislation that \ncomes along and it basically says to the States: If you don't like this \nFederal legislation, you can opt out. I often had that situation when I \nwas Governor. Within the last 2 weeks or so, this idea came to the \nforefront with the health care debate. All of a sudden, there was this \ntrumpeting going on that there would be a State choice here and that \nwould be kind of a compromise, I think a compromise to bring some \nreluctant votes over in favor of the bill.\n  I have to say I am very skeptical of this concept. We have not seen \nthe bill yet here on the Senate side. That is being worked on behind \nclosed doors. I was fascinated to listen to the Senator from Arizona \ntalk about the fact that the majority leader said there is no bill yet. \nIf we are going to start debate here, I hope a bill comes up soon so we \nhave an opportunity to study it. But I think we can look from past \nexperience and maybe get an idea of what this opt-out is going to look \nlike.\n  No doubt about it, in order for this health care legislation to be \nable to work at all, billions of dollars are going to have to be \ncollected through taxpayers, be collected all across the country, from \nall States and their taxpayers. So if a State such as Nebraska is \nseriously considering the possibility that it might opt out of this \nbill, it is going to have to examine what choice is available and is \nthere a choice at all. Does that mean the State of Nebraska will get to \nopt out of higher premiums?\n  Does that mean the State of Nebraska will get to opt out of any \nindividual mandates that are a part of the legislation? Does that mean \nthat if the Governor of Nebraska says, We do not want any part of this \nbill, the Medicare recipients in Nebraska will not have to experience \nthe nearly $500 billion in Medicare cuts? Does that mean that if the \nGovernor of Nebraska chooses to opt out of this legislation, he \nliterally has the ability to save Nebraska taxpayers from the $400 \nbillion, or their share of that, that they would pay in taxes for this \nlegislation, or is this going to be like so many other opt-out \nopportunities that the Federal Government gives to the States, and when \nyou really get down to it, you begin to realize there really is not an \nopt-out, there really is not a choice; you have all of the burdens of \nthe legislation but, of course, get no benefit.\n  Further, it appears the legislation--again, I am speculating to some \ndegree, but it appears the legislation would require States to opt out \nby 2014. Yet it is going to take about 3 or 4 years to get this \ngovernment plan up and running. So almost at the same time that you are \nsupposed to opt out, we will finally see, in terms of the regulations, \nwhat this government plan is going to do to States and taxpayers in \nthose States. I can't see that there is much choice.\n  You see, today we have the opportunity to opt out of various Federal \nprograms--No Child Left Behind. Nebraska could opt out of the Federal \nbureaucracy. Why don't they opt out? Why don't other States? Because \nyou really don't have a choice. The burden of the legislation is still \ngoing to be there, and by opting out, what you are saying is: I will \nforce the burden upon my taxpayers and we will forego whatever limited \nbenefit is available. So I just say, as we study this, don't be fooled. \nOpt-out in fact may have more of a downside and I suspect it is going \nto have more of a downside than any potential for an upside, and \ntherefore that is not a choice.\n  The other thing I have to tell you is that as I look at this, there \nreally is not an opt-out. I think where we are headed is a first step \ntoward a single-payer, government-type program. Government should not \nbe the sole provider of health insurance. It should not be the sole \narbiter of what kind of health care people will get in this country.\n  What is the track record when there is a government program when it \ncomes to health care? Well, we can look at the track record because \nthere is a lot of it out there. Medicare and Medicaid would be perfect \nexamples. Studies have been done of Medicare. They are done on a \nregular basis. If you are a Medicare recipient out there, you have \nheard about this. Medicare is due to be insolvent in 2017. And I am not \ntalking about a little fix that is necessary here; this is trillions of \ndollars. That is frightening when you think about it. It is especially \nfrightening when you recognize that the proposal is that about $450 \nbillion will be pulled out of this program, not to stabilize Medicare, \nalthough I would argue that would make a lot of sense in terms of \ntrying to say that any dollars that you can save in Medicare should \nstay with Medicare. No, that is not what is happening at all. You see, \nwhat is happening is that $450 billion will go to start a new \ngovernment program, a new entitlement. Then there is that estimate that \nsays about $10 billion annually is the minimum loss sustained by \ntaxpayers every year due to Medicare fraud--$10 billion due to Medicare \nfraud. Medicaid has a 10-percent waste, fraud, and abuse rate. Neither \nis sustainable under its current form.\n  Again, as a former Governor, I will tell you that Medicaid is the \ngreatest challenge Governors face in keeping\n\n[[Page S10973]]\n\ntheir budget together. We all talk about it, Democrats, Republicans; it \ndoes not make any difference. Yet a part of this health care plan will \nshift the burden to the States when they are already in very difficult \ntimes.\n  I recently got a letter from a high school junior from Kearney, NE. \nShe said to me:\n\n       In my government class, we have discussed the health care \n     issue. I feel very strongly about this issue for a few \n     reasons, the first being the fact that all the money the \n     government is spending is going to come out of the pockets of \n     Americans. This will mostly affect the youth of this country. \n     This will be my generation who will be paying off the bills \n     that you will create with this health care plan.\n\n  My goodness. Did she get that right or not?\n  You know, it is just the commonsense approach. If you are really \ngoing to try to do what we are elected to do, why would you not shore \nup current government programs first before going off in this massive, \n1,990-page bill to create a new entitlement? Why would you go off and \nsiphon nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion away from Medicare? We should ensure \nMedicare's solvency first.\n  I believe the current proposal is about advancing an agenda versus \naddressing a real need. The government-run plan will not make health \ncare more affordable. I think we are going to see that confirmed over \nand over again as it is analyzed. If affordability is the goal, let \npeople buy insurance across State lines. You will get virtually \nunanimous bipartisan support for that. Let small businesses and farmers \nand ranchers band together to get more competitive rates. Allow tax \ndeductibility to level the playing field between corporations and \nindividuals buying insurance. You see, again, if you did a step-by-step \napproach, I think you would get nearly unanimous support for these \nideas.\n  Nebraskans see through the rhetoric. I got another letter from a \nconstituent in Omaha:\n\n       Please oppose latest iteration of health care reform. This \n     reform package will accomplish none of the objectives that \n     have been laid out at the outset of this process.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank the Chair.\n\n       This bill will ultimately lead to Government-run health \n     care, will have more waste and fraud than the current system \n     and will necessarily lead to arbitrary rationing and long \n     wait times for treatment.\n\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence to just wrap up my \ncomments and say that if there were ever a time to go thoughtfully and \ncarefully one step at a time and work in a bipartisan way to fix this \nissue, it is now. My hope is that in the weeks ahead, as we debate this \nissue, we will do precisely that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I wish to follow up on the comments of my \ncolleagues from Nebraska and Arizona. I will not be as eloquent as \nthey, but I also want to lend my voice to the discussion regarding \nhealth care.\n  I had the opportunity to receive the House bill, 1,990 pages. It is \nnot an easy read. I am making my way through it. But we have learned a \nlot through it. I have already found that the taxes start on page 297. \nThere is an estimated over $1 trillion in costs over the next 10 years \nin these 1,990 pages. This is the House bill, the bill Speaker Pelosi \nhas put forth. We do not yet have a copy of the Senate bill to digest. \nSo this is the text we will go on for now. But I think it is good to \nsee this in the larger context in which we debate health care. It is \nimportant to remember that this year, this Congress has passed a budget \nthat has a record-setting $1.4 trillion deficit. That is more deficit \nthan the last 3 years of Congress combined.\n  Americans want and deserve more affordable health care. We have more \nthan 40 million Americans without health insurance, nearly 4 million of \nthem in Florida. They want better access to health care. They certainly \nwant their health care to be less expensive. But keeping this in mind, \nwe have to look at the situation in which we find ourselves. The \nreckless spending of this Congress must stop or we are going to \nbankrupt the future of our children and of our grandchildren.\n  The Senator from Nebraska was talking about a letter he received from \nhis constituent. I sat in my office and looked at some of the letters \nthat have come in from Florida. I wanted to read one from John Miller \nfrom Valrico, FL, which is in the Tampa Bay area, right near Brandon. \nHe writes--it is in handwriting, it is not typed. It is from October \n19. He says:\n\n       Mr. LeMieux, I am one of those who have not paid enough \n     attention to what is going on. Like others, I am waking up. I \n     have decided to go old school and start hand-writing letters \n     again. It was recently reported the Federal deficit for the \n     2009 fiscal year was $1.4 trillion, up from $459 billion the \n     year before. I think it is time for Congress to stop all work \n     and start working on ways to cut the deficit. One way is to \n     shrink the government.\n\n  Good thing Mr. Miller in Valrico, FL, gets it. Before we start \nembarking upon 1,990-page endeavors to create new entitlement programs \nthat cost $1 trillion, we should focus, as Senator Johanns from \nNebraska said, on the programs that we already have, and we should do \nso through the lens of the debt and deficit we have now that is going \nto bankrupt the future of our children.\n  Right now, we spend $253 billion a year in interest alone--$253 \nbillion to pay the interest on our debt. That is the third highest \nexpenditure we have in the Federal budget, $700 million a day. The \nnational debt is nearing $12 trillion. In the next few days, we will \nreach that mark. The White House projects we will be at $23 trillion in \n10 years. The national debt rose at a rate of $4 billion a day. It took \nus until 1982 to hit $1 trillion in debt; now we are near $12 trillion.\n  When I gave my maiden speech a couple of weeks ago, I tried to put \nsome real-world context into what these amounts of money mean because \n$1 trillion or $1 billion are numbers that are hard to understand. I \nsaid in that speech that $1 billion laid edge to edge in one-dollar \nbills would cover the city of Key West, FL, about 3.4 square miles, and \n$1 trillion would cover Rhode Island twice. Another way to think of it \nis if you had one-dollar bills and you stacked up $1 trillion, it would \nbe 678 miles high. These are staggering amounts of money.\n  So where will all of this spending lead us? Well, I think we know. \nWhen you have too much spending, you have to increase taxes. When you \nincrease taxes, you reduce prosperity. We know this 1,990-page bill \nalready increases taxes.\n  In the Wall Street Journal this weekend, Peggy Noonan talked about \nthe problems of New York. I do not mean to single out my friends from \nNew York, but I thought what she said in her article was telling \nbecause here is a State with high taxes. She said that the Post \nreported this week that 1\\1/2\\ million people have left high-taxed New \nYork State between 2000 and 2008, more than a million of them from ever \nhigher tax New York City. They took their tax dollars with them, more \nthan $4 billion in 2006 alone.\n  I do not know that people are going to leave the United States of \nAmerica because we have taxes that are too high, but, as I said in my \nmaiden speech 2 weeks ago, I am very concerned that one of my three \nsons--Max, Taylor, or Chase--or maybe the baby we have on the way is \ngoing to come to me when they are an adult and say: Dad, my \nopportunities are better in another country because I do not want to \npay 60-percent taxes to pay for the deficit and the debt you have laid \non my shoulders. I hope that day never comes.\n  So what should we do? Instead of focusing on new entitlement \nprograms, perhaps we should try to fix the ones we already have. \nMedicare, health care for seniors, and Medicaid, health care for the \npoor, have huge amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse, an estimated $60 \nbillion in waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare alone--$60 billion. \nThere could be as much as $225 billion in fraud and abuse and waste \nacross the whole health care system.\n  I seek to be a problem solver in this Chamber, and I seek to bring \nDemocrats and Republicans together. So last week, I introduced my first \nbill, S. 2128, the Prevent Health Care Fraud Act of 2009. What that \nbill does is simply three things: No. 1, it creates in the Department \nof Health and Human\n\n[[Page S10974]]\n\nServices a Deputy Secretary, the No. 2 person in the agency who will be \nthe chief health care fraud prevention officer of the United States.\n  They will be responsible for only one job--to make sure we ferret out \nhealth care fraud. No. 2, we will bring predictive modeling to health \ncare administration in this government. What is predictive modeling? An \neasy way to understand it is, it is the same way your credit cards \nwork. If you make a credit card purchase and your credit card company \nthinks it is a questionable transaction, the computer has a model, and \nyou get a phone call or an e-mail. If you don't call and validate that \ntransaction, the vendor doesn't get paid. It happened to me a week or \ntwo ago. I went to buy a television. I am from Florida. I get an e-mail \non my BlackBerrry before I walk out the door, saying: Did you authorize \nthis purchase? We don't do that in health care. Instead, we chase the \nbad guys later and try to get the money back. That would stop the money \nfrom ever being paid.\n  The third thing it would do is require background checks for health \ncare providers. The American people would be surprised to learn we \ndon't do this right now. We have people ripping off Medicare and \nMedicaid, $10, $20 million a shot. My State, specifically in southeast \nFlorida, is the health care fraud capital of the world.\n  We need to do a better job of spending the money of the people now \nbefore we embark upon new programs to spend trillions more. Senator Kyl \nmentioned the Wall Street Journal's editorial of today. It called this \nbill the worst bill ever--that is a heck of a name--because it \nimplements a spending surge to the tune of more than $1 trillion. It \nhas $572 billion in new taxes, and it threatens to bankrupt the States. \nSenator Johanns mentioned this as a former Governor. I was the chief of \nstaff to a Governor. I know how difficult it is to make ends meet in a \nState system where you actually have to balance budgets, not like the \nFederal Government where you can just spend more money and print more \nmoney. The States actually have to balance budgets. In Florida, we \nspend more than 30 percent on health care. If you spend more money on \nhealth care, specifically Medicaid, guess what you spend less money on. \nEducation and other good programs. With these increased Medicaid \nobligations, the States will be in more of a difficult place. They will \nhave to either cut other programs or raise taxes.\n  The Wall Street Journal said we can't regulate our way out of the \nreality that we live in a world of finite resources and infinite wants.\n  We should focus on the programs we have before we embark upon new \nprograms. The majority wants to focus on new programs and not on \neffectively and efficiently running programs we have.\n  I hope my colleagues from both sides of the aisle will join me in \nsupporting S. 2128, the Prevent Health Care Fraud Act of 2009.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/02/senate-section/article/S10974-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10974-S10979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HISTORY OF THE MEDICAL INSURANCE INDUSTRY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, since most people have some form of \nhealth insurance, I decided, after many calls from constituents who \nhave said to me: I can't afford a 20-percent increase in my medical \nhealth insurance premium; I had a 10-percent one last year, I began to \nlook into the history of the medical insurance industry in America. I \nhave come to the floor to discuss the current state of the private, \npublicly owned, for-profit health insurance industry and the ways this \nsystem must be changed during health care reform. Bottom line: Our \ncountry is the biggest health care spender in the world. In return, we \nget very average results.\n  It wasn't always this way in America. I wish, for a moment, to \nbriefly review the history of health insurance in our country. Because \nunderstanding its development and its transition to the for-profit, \ncommercial health insurance model is actually critical to this debate.\n  The story began to take shape about 90 years ago. There were very few \nhealth insurance plans before the 1920s. As a matter of fact, there was \nnot much in the way of medical services to insure. Options for medical \ncare were primitive by today's standards. In 1900, the average American \nspent $5 each year on health care-related expenses. This amounts to \nroughly $100 in today's dollars. Health insurance was not necessary \nbecause the cost of care was low. Over 90 percent of medical expenses \nwere paid out of pocket. Most patients were treated in their homes, and \nmedical technology and treatment options were very limited. The \nearliest private health insurance plans in the United States were \nfairly basic agreements, primarily sponsored through employers or \nunions. Employers deducted funds from participating workers' salaries \nand contracted with local physicians for treatment.\n  During the 1920s, medical technology was advancing and the treatment \nof acute illnesses shifted from homes to hospitals. But on the heels of \nthe Great Depression, an increasing number of Americans were unable to \nafford medical services, which were becoming more costly. In 1929, the \nBaylor University Hospital developed a plan to guarantee affordable \ntreatment options for patients while ensuring a steady stream of \nrevenue for the hospital. According to author Paul Starr, the Baylor \nplan provided up to 21 days of hospital care and certain services to \n1,500 local teachers in Dallas, TX, for $6 a year or 50 cents a month, \nif we can believe it.\n  A hospital official promoting the plan at the time said:\n\n       We spend a dollar or so at a time for cosmetics and do not \n     notice the high cost. The ribbon-counter clerk can pay 50 \n     cents, 75 cents or $1 a month, yet it would take about 20 \n     years to set aside [enough money for] a large hospital bill.\n\n  The Baylor plan proved popular and was soon expanded. It served as \nthe foundation for what would become Blue Cross, the first example of a \nmajor, nonprofit medical insurance provider. Throughout the 1930s, the \nnumber of Blue Cross plans grew and enrollments expanded. By 1937, 1 \nmillion subscribers were covered.\n  In response to the lack of coverage by Blue Cross for physician \nservices, in 1939, the precursor to Blue Shield, called the California \nPhysicians Service, was developed. This plan reimbursed physicians for \nthe cost of services based on negotiated payment schedules. According \nto the Congressional Research Service, in 1945, nonprofit Blue Cross \nand Blue Shield plans had expanded to cover 19 million subscribers \nnationally in most States. These nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield \nplans dominated the health insurance industry. At this same moment, \nCongress was reviewing the matter of insurance regulation, generally. \nIn 1945, after significant lobbying by the industry, the McCarran-\nFerguson Act was enacted. By passing this law, the Federal Government \ncommitted to a hands-off approach to insurance regulation, generally, \nincluding the regulation of for-profit, commercial health insurance \ncompanies.\n  This is where things began to change. The McCarran-Ferguson Act gave \nStates, not the Federal Government, primary responsibility for \noverseeing the insurance business. It meant, as a practical matter, \nthat whether insurance companies would be regulated forcefully or with \nlittle care would be left up to individual insurance commissioners in \neach of the 50 States. Additionally, the McCarran-Ferguson Act included \na specific antitrust exemption for the business of medical insurance. \nAs a result, practices such as price fixing, bid rigging, and market \nallocation, prohibited by Federal law in every other industry, were \nleft up to the States and their enforcement mechanisms.\n  If insurance companies colluded to raise prices above competitive \nlevels, Federal officials would not and could not investigate or \nintervene. All regulation was up to the States and, in fact, very \nlittle regulation has taken place.\n  During World War II, for-profit, employer-based health insurance \nplans expanded rapidly and took a firm hold in our country. Due to \nprice and wage controls, employers competed for workers by offering \nhealth insurance benefits. In 1944, the unemployment rate was 2 \npercent. Additionally, unions were able to collectively bargain health \ninsurance benefits and employer contributions for health insurance \nwhich were excluded from a worker's taxable income. By the 1950s, for-\n\n[[Page S10975]]\n\nprofit commercial health insurers, such as Aetna and the Connecticut \nGeneral Life Insurance Company, known now as CIGNA, became very active. \nThen things started to change. The market share of Blue Cross and Blue \nShield was significantly reduced in many parts of the country. As of \n1953, commercial insurers provided hospital insurance to 29 percent of \nAmericans versus Blue Cross's 27 percent.\n  The widespread entry of commercial insurance into the health \ninsurance market had a dramatic impact. First, the commercial health \ninsurers did not operate under the same rate restrictions as Blue \nCross. Second, Blue Cross premium rates were based on the average cost \nof medical services in a defined geographic area or community. \nCommercial insurers, on the other hand, calculated premiums based upon \nthe claims of particular groups or individuals and adjusted these \npremiums each year depending on their health status. This also allowed \ncommercial insurers to evaluate coverage on an individual rather than \nuse the community rating system of Blue Cross. Therefore, commercial \ninsurers were able to underbid Blue Cross for firms with very healthy \nworkers who were cheaper to insure.\n  Right then and there, we begin to see the skewing of the system away \nfrom a community rate toward an individual assessment; whereby \ncompanies could cherry-pick only the healthiest and, therefore, make \nmore money.\n  The loss of these healthier groups then raised average costs among \nthe remaining employees, placing Blue Cross at a competitive \ndisadvantage with commercial insurers. This competition from commercial \ninsurers eventually resulted in Blue Cross changing the way its \npremiums were calculated. The single, community-wide premium pricing \nmodel was replaced in favor of the commercial approach. This shift \ntoward charging premiums based on claims of particular groups or \nindividuals changed the nature of competition in the health insurance \nmarket. Insurers could reduce costs by shifting risk and recruiting \nemployers with healthier workers, and they did. Furthermore, because \nthey could choose whom to insure, many large, for-profit commercial \ninsurers left the individual market altogether in favor of large-scale \nemployers because they carried lower operating costs.\n  Where does that leave us today? Today we have a health insurance \nindustry where the first and foremost goal is to maximize profits for \nshareholders and CEOs, not to cover patients who have fallen ill or to \ncompensate doctors and hospitals for their services. It is an industry \nthat is increasingly concentrated and where Americans are paying more \nto receive less.\n  Here is the bottom line: According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, \nin the last 9 years, American families have seen their health insurance \npremiums more than double, while benefits have been getting worse and \nthe industry has been growing less competitive.\n  A snapshot of the American health insurance industry today presents \nan alarming picture.\n  As of 2007, just two carriers--WellPoint and UnitedHealth Group--had \ngained control of 36 percent of the national market for commercial \nhealth insurance. Both these companies had more than doubled since \n2000. Since 1998, there have been more than 400 mergers--that is in 11 \nyears--400 mergers of health insurance companies, as larger carriers \nhave purchased, absorbed, and enveloped smaller competitors.\n  In 2004 and 2005 alone, this industry had 28 mergers, valued at more \nthan $53 billion. That is more merger activity in health insurance than \nin the 8 previous years combined.\n  Today, according to a study by the American Medical Association, more \nthan 94 percent of American health insurance markets are highly \nconcentrated under U.S. Department of Justice guidelines. This means \nthese companies could raise premiums or reduce benefits with little \nfear that consumers will end their contracts and move to a more \ncompetitive carrier.\n  In 10 States--Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, \nMontana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wyoming, these 10 States--two \nhealth insurance companies control 80 percent or more of the State \nmarket. So 10 States, 2 health insurance companies control more than 80 \npercent of the statewide market.\n  In my State of California--nearly 40 million people--just two \ncompanies--WellPoint and Kaiser Permanente--control more than 58 \npercent of the market. The market presence of these two companies is up \na combined 14 percent in 1 year. Let me repeat that. The market \npresence of two companies in California is up 14 percent in 1 year.\n  When you look at specific health markets, the situation is even \nworse. In 2007, the two largest health insurance companies in \nBakersfield, CA, controlled 76 percent of the market there. In Salinas, \nthe top two controlled 65 percent. In Los Angeles, the top two carriers \ncontrolled 51 percent of the market. This is a huge market. It is a 12-\nmillion-person market, and two companies control over half of that \ninsurance market.\n  The American Medical Association described it this way:\n\n       The United States is headed toward a system dominated by a \n     few publicly traded companies that operate in the interest of \n     shareholders and not primarily in the interest of patients.\n\n  I think that is a very sobering statement.\n  The effects of this market concentration are being felt by consumers \nand families. They are being felt by American businesses. They are \nbeing felt by doctors and health care providers.\n  Premiums are skyrocketing for employers and for individuals trying to \nbuy health insurance. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, since \n1999, the average health insurance premium has more than doubled, \nrising 119 percent. That is an increase of four times the national wage \ngrowth over the same period and more than four times the rate of \ninflation. So it is ``open sesame.''\n  This is an amazing factor. Between 1999 and 2007, the average \nAmerican worker saw his wages increase 29 percent. His insurance \npremiums rose more than 120 percent during that same period. This is \nhow disproportionate it is, and it is wrong.\n  For some people, this means their employer is paying more and \nstruggling more to stay in business. For some, it means they are \npersonally paying more and struggling to make ends meet. For some, it \nmeans they have been forced to join the ever-growing group of 47 \nmillion Americans who simply cannot afford health insurance coverage \ntoday.\n  While premiums are going up, there is no evidence coverage is \nimproving. We have heard countless stories from consumers about the way \ninsurers are cutting costs and saving money by denying coverage to \npeople with preexisting conditions, rescinding care when people fall \nill and haggling administratively over coverage and benefits.\n  These stories come from health care providers too. When just a few \ncompanies control the market, physicians and hospitals have fewer \nplaces to turn when they believe they are not being reimbursed fairly. \nJust as American families and their employers have fewer choices for \npurchasing insurance, health care providers have less bargaining power \nover reimbursement rates. The net result is, consumers and health care \nproviders are losing out, while health insurance companies and their \nshareholders are bringing in record profits.\n  According to Health Care for America Now, between 2000 and 2007, \nprofits at the 10 largest publicly traded health insurance companies \nsoared up 428 percent, from $2.4 billion in 2000 to $12.9 billion in \n2007.\n  The CEOs of these companies took in record earnings. In 2007, these \n10 CEOs made a combined $118.6 million. The CEO of CIGNA took home \n$25.8 million. The CEO of Aetna took home $23 million. The CEO of \nUnitedHealth took home $13.2 million. The CEO of WellPoint took home \n$9.1 million.\n  This history, and this failed market, is a uniquely American story. I \nrecently read ``The Healing of America'' by T.R. Reid. He is a former \nWashington Post journalist who has a bum shoulder. So he decided he \nwould go from country to country and go to doctors in that country, \nexamine their health care sector, see what would help him, what they \nrecommended, and it is a very interesting book. He writes about the \nhealth care systems of the countries he visits.\n\n[[Page S10976]]\n\n  A few things are clear. First, as Reid says:\n\n       The United States is the only developed country that relies \n     on profit-making health insurance companies to pay for \n     essential and elective care.\n\n  So in every country that has health care reform--the United Kingdom, \nFrance, Switzerland, Germany, Canada--the United States is the only one \nthat allows this open, ribald, for-profit health insurance industry \nthat we do in this country.\n  Profit-seeking motives do influence insurance companies. Today, \ninsurance companies have a financial reason to deny coverage to people \nwho may actually get sick, so they exclude people with even the most \nminor preexisting conditions.\n  Secondly, if you get sick, insurance companies will comb through past \nrecords to find a reason to retroactively deny coverage. This means \npeople lose their health coverage when they need it the most.\n  In other nations, with not-for-profit insurance, there is no \nmotivation for companies to engage in these practices. Everyone is \ncovered regardless of his or her health history. This allows risk to be \neffectively spread across the entire population.\n  Other countries accomplish this with employer responsibility and an \nindividual requirement to become part of the insurance system.\n  A few examples: In Germany, most people enroll in sickness funds, \nwith premiums split between workers and employers. Only the very \nwealthy can opt out to buy separate insurance.\n  In Switzerland, everyone must purchase basic, nonprofit insurance. \nCompanies can only make a profit on the extra benefits they sell, such \nas for cosmetic surgery or a private room in a hospital, but not by \nproviding basic coverage.\n  In France, everyone is enrolled in one of several large health \ninsurance funds, which are closely regulated by the federal government.\n  In the United Kingdom, everyone is automatically covered by the \nNational Health Service.\n  Americans like to criticize other nations' systems as bureaucratic. \nBut in truth, it is our system that is wasteful and inefficient. Many \nother countries are able to deliver better health care for lower prices \nthan we do currently. I wish to point this out.\n  As T.R. Reid points out, our system, with for-profit insurance and \nmedical underwriting, has some of the highest administrative costs in \nthe world because, in the United States, roughly 20 percent of every \npremium dollar is spent on administration. This includes advertising, \nprofits, and paperwork--20 percent goes to this.\n  Let's compare this: Canada, on the other hand, spends about 6 \npercent. France spends about 5 percent. One of France's advantages \ncomes from an electronic form, a personal health record. It is called \nthe Carte Vitale. Here is a picture of it I have in the Chamber. I had \nactually asked some of my family, newly returned from living in France \nfor a long time, if they would send me their actual Carte Vitale, which \nI have seen. Unfortunately, they have not arrived. But, as shown in \nthis picture, this is what they look like.\n  As shown on this part of the picture, this is a small chip. In this \nchip is the entire medical history of a patient--every shot received, \nevery diagnosis made, everything about the patient. So the patient goes \nin for a physician's visit, which costs about $27 in France today, and \nthe doctor takes the Carte Vitale, puts it into his computer, and the \nentire background of the individual pops up.\n\n  Let's say he prescribes certain medication. That then goes into this \nsmall chip. Every French citizen over the age of 15 carries a Carte \nVitale, which has taken the place of the walls of paper records we see \nat our physicians' offices in this country.\n  Also, this system allows French physicians to bill automatically for \nthe care they provide without paperwork or bureaucracy. The Carte \nVitale has helped the French achieve what many consider to be the \nworld's best health care system.\n  As we have seen, other industrialized nations spend less on \nadministrative costs. They have nonprofit insurance. They use employers \nand individual responsibility to provide basic health care to everyone. \nThis structure does, by independent analysis, provide better results \nbecause, whatever the indicator, the United States lags behind the rest \nof the industrialized world.\n  This is painful, but I believe we have to look at it. According to \nthe World Health Organization, France leads the world in overall system \nperformance, followed by Italy. America is 37th. These are the top \nhealth care systems: France, Italy--and, as you can see, the rest. We \nare No. 37.\n  In avoidable mortality, which measures a system's effectiveness in \ncaring for people who contract a potentially serious medical condition, \nagain, France tops the list, again, followed by Japan. The United \nStates is 15th.\n  The United States lags other developed nations in infant mortality. \nHere it is, as shown on this chart. This is according to the \nCommonwealth Fund. The leader is Japan, with 3 deaths per 1,000 births. \nWe are No. 22 on that list.\n  This is surprising because you would think, particularly with infant \nmortality, we would be a real leader, but we are not.\n  To summarize, I think action is needed.\n  Other countries are far from perfect, and I am not saying anything \nother than that. But these lessons show that high-quality health care \ncan be delivered for less than we currently spend. Our system of \nrelying on for-profit medical insurance, I believe, is broken. We are \nspending more for worse results than the rest of the world. That is \nwhat I hope to show.\n\n  That is why it is essential that we take action, and take action now. \nI basically believe the medical insurance industry should be nonprofit, \nnot profit-making. There is no way a health reform plan will work when \nit is implemented by an industry that seeks to return money to \nshareholders instead of using that money to provide health care. This \nis difficult to accomplish today, but there are a number of steps that \ncan be taken in this direction.\n  The first is to repeal the antitrust exemption. I believe we must \ntake strong action to stop illegal, anti-competitive activity in the \nindustry. The Justice Department currently has authority to review \ncertain health insurance mergers. But although almost 400 health \ninsurance mergers took place during the past administration, the \nDepartment brought challenges to only two of those mergers. Even those \nthat were challenged were later allowed to proceed with relatively \nminor adjustments.\n  When a dominant market player tries to subsume a smaller competitor, \nthe Justice Department should review the acquisition carefully to \nensure that consumers, employers, and health care providers still have \nbargaining power. We should also repeal the antitrust exemption for \nhealth insurance companies. This exception is a relic of the past, and \nit has no current justification.\n  The Justice Department should be able to investigate and sue health \ninsurance companies when they engage in price fixing, bid rigging, or \nmarket allocation. These kinds of collusive activities are not fair \nplay. They are not allowed in other industries, and they should not be \nallowed in this one.\n  I also believe a public option is an essential piece of any effort. \nIt will provide robust, nonprofit competition for an industry that is \nbroken and profit-ridden. In concentrated markets, the public option \nwill provide consumers with real choice. Remember, the largest market \nin America is the Los Angeles market, and a majority of that market is \ncontrolled by two health insurance companies.\n  Because it will not attempt to make a profit, the public option will \nnot turn anyone away. It may be able to charge lower premiums because \nits goal will be to provide health care coverage, not to return profits \nto shareholders. Whether it is opt-in or opt-out, States that strongly \nobject to providing nonprofit competition to residents should have the \nopportunity not to participate. But make no mistake; the public option \nalone will not solve our Nation's problem with health care. It will be \navailable to a relatively few Americans at first. Only those who will \npurchase insurance in newly created exchanges will have the opportunity \nto buy it. But I believe it is a building block as we work to construct \na new system.\n  In addition to creating a public option, we must put health insurance \ncompanies on a path toward more responsible behavior. That is why I am\n\n[[Page S10977]]\n\nproposing a Federal medical insurance rate authority.\n  My proposal for a medical insurance rate authority builds on the \nsuccessful and well-accepted model of utility commissions. Throughout \nthis country, providers of gas, water, and electricity need to justify \nany proposed rate increase. This is required because the services they \nprovide--water, gas, and power--are considered necessities for life.\n  Well, are they more a necessity for life than health insurance? I \ndon't think so. Health insurance should be no different. Access to \naffordable medical care is certainly a necessity of life.\n  Under my proposal, the Federal Government would be required to \nestablish a medical insurance rate authority which would oversee \npremiums charged by the for-profit medical insurance industry. Premium \nincreases above a certain threshold would need to be approved. The \nmedical insurance rate authority would conduct basic oversight insuring \nthat premium funds are spent on medical care and not for profit or \noverhead.\n  These safeguards will ensure that the health insurance industry does \nnot continue their pattern of astronomic premium increases. It is fair \nfor the price of insurance to reflect the actual price of medical care, \nbut it is not fair for insurance companies to increase their profits \nwhile Americans pay higher and higher premiums.\n  It has taken many decades for our health system to evolve and break \ndown as it has, and we cannot expect to fix it overnight. We need to \nremember what health insurance originally was in this country, \nnonprofit; and what it is around the world, nonprofit; and a way to \nensure that people can get basic care to stay healthy and they are \nprotected from financial ruin when they get sick. I believe strongly \nthis must be the underlying goal of any health reform the Senate \napproves this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of sources be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Sources\n\n       1.

Reid, The Healing of America: A Global Quest for \n     Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care, 2009.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to address the issue of health \ncare reform. In order to demonstrate the complicated issues that face \nus, I have with me the House of Representatives health care reform \nbill, approximately 2,000 pages; I have over here the Senate HELP \nCommittee bill, approximately 1,000 pages; and over here, the Senate \nFinance Committee bill, approximately 1,500 pages.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle are saying their bills do not \nrepresent a government takeover of the health care system. I want to \nbelieve that. I would really like to believe it, but the facts seem to \ntell a different story. If we look at the specifics of the bill \nreported by the Senate HELP Committee or the House bill released last \nweek, I don't see how one could call it anything but a government \ntakeover.\n  So I wish to start with the Senate HELP Committee bill.\n  On September 17, the HELP Committee finally released what I \npreviously said was a bill containing about 1,000 pages--more \naccurately, 839 pages--over 2 months after the majority party on the \nHELP Committee voted to report it. When I was back in my State of Iowa \nfor the August recess, I held 17 townhall meetings. Due to the \ncontroversial health care bill the HELP Committee and the three House \ncommittees had just voted on, the attendance was the highest I have \nseen in the 2,871 townhalls I have held during my years in the Senate.\n  Many of the people who attended were citing sections from the health \nreform bills. They had good questions. I heard repeatedly about the new \npowers being granted to the government in these bills. So I decided we \nshould have a catalog of how many times these bills grant new powers to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Well, I have the HELP Committee bill with me today, and there is a \nlot going on in the 839 pages of that bill. We have gone through the \n20,725 lines of legislative text just to see how many new government \nauthorities it creates, and here is what we found: This bill creates a \ntotal of 87 new government programs.\n  In addition to the 87 new government programs created by this \nlegislation, a substantial amount of new regulatory authority has been \ngranted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I know the other \nside doesn't like to hear that this bill calls for a government \ntakeover of our health care system, but let's let the facts speak for \nthemselves. If it isn't a government takeover of our health care \nsystem, why does the word ``Secretary''--meaning Secretary of HHS--\nappear 982 times in this bill? Maybe the other side needs a reminder \nthat the Secretary of Health and Human Services is an agent of the \nFederal Government appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate.\n  Iowans keep telling me that Congress needs to just slow down, \nconsider all ideas, and, of course, common sense tells us to actually \nread the legislation. But the HELP Committee bill makes it clear that \nthe majority leadership and the White House would rather push something \nthrough quickly and leave the important decisions to an unelected, \nunaccountable government official.\n  The long list of new powers granted to the Secretary begin on page 11 \nof the HELP Committee bill, and I quote:\n\n       The Secretary shall by regulation establish a minimum size \n     for community ratings areas.\n\n  So let me put it in common language rather than statutory language.\n  This bill includes a number of controversial rating reforms, and one \nof those reforms would set a 2-to-1 age rating band. That means \npremiums for the oldest person could be no more than twice the cost of \nthe premiums to the youngest person. Now, that is going to reduce \npremiums substantially for older people, and that is a fine goal, but \nthe money has to come from somewhere. So to pay for those lower \npremiums for older people means much higher premiums for younger \npeople. It is a new hidden tax being imposed on young people. It will \nincrease premiums for young people by at least 50 percent.\n  This bill would give the Secretary the regulatory power to draw the \nmap in each State for these rating areas, and that is where we go back \nto the quote I just cited:\n\n       The Secretary shall by regulation establish a minimum size \n     for community rating areas.\n\n  Keep in mind, under current law this sort of policy is presently \ndecided by 50 different State legislatures or by 50 different insurance \ncommissioners. But some in Congress want to take this responsibility \naway from the States and turn it over to unelected bureaucrats in \nWashington, DC.\n  I spoke on the Senate floor earlier last week about how the \nDemocratic proposals for health care will increase premiums and overall \nhealth care spending. Quite the opposite: I think to most people \nhearing us talk in Washington, DC, about health care reform, the word \n``reform'' would mean to\n\n[[Page S10978]]\n\nthem not increasing premiums and overall health care spending.\n  To offset the increase in premiums, they say they will subsidize them \nusing taxpayer dollars. But guess who is given the power to decide what \nbenefits are eligible for these new subsidies? I will read the answer \nstraight from the bill on page 90, line 11. It says:\n\n       The Secretary shall establish . . . the essential health \n     care benefits eligible for credits. . . .\n\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle claim their proposal will \nincrease choice and competition in the health insurance industry. But \nafter reading this bill, it is clear that only 1 percent will have a \nchoice, and that person is the Secretary of HHS.\n  On page 74, line 17, the Secretary is given the power to regulate \nwhat type of health plan works best for you and your family. I will \nread that quote:\n\n       The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish criteria for \n     certification of health plans as qualified health plans.\n\n  After the Secretary chooses what plan works best for you and your \nfamily, the Secretary can choose what conditions your doctor must meet \nin order to contract with the plan chosen for you.\n  On page 80, line 14, it says that a qualified health plan may \ncontract with `` . . . a health care provider if such provider \nimplements such mechanisms to improve health care quality as the \nSecretary may by regulation require.''\n  That means if you want to purchase coverage through a new exchange \nestablished by this bill, the Secretary of HHS will be deciding what \nhealth plan and what doctor is best for you and your family.\n  This bill also extends the Secretary's influence into classrooms, \nwhere our future doctors are being trained. On page 685 of the bill, \nline 10, it says:\n\n       The Secretary shall support development, evaluation, and \n     dissemination of model curricula for . . . use in health \n     professions schools . . . and for other purposes determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary.\n\n  That is a lot of power in a sentence of the law that says ``and for \nother purposes determined appropriate by the Secretary.''\n  Are all of these new requirements and regulations going to help our \nhealth care system? Will they make Americans healthier? The truth is, \nwe have no way of knowing since so much in this bill, including what I \nhave highlighted, is left to the regulatory decisions of an unelected \ngovernment bureaucrat.\n  The proponents of this bill say it isn't a government takeover of \nhealth care. But after reading only a fraction of the bill out loud, as \nI have done, it is hard to argue the fact that the Secretary of HHS is \ngranted a lot of power over our health care system.\n  The Secretary will determine the size of new rating areas. The \nSecretary will decide what benefits health care plans have to cover. \nThe Secretary will decide what health plan works best for you and your \nfamily. The Secretary will decide what conditions your doctor must meet \nto be included in your plan. The Secretary will decide what curriculum \nshould be taught in our medical schools.\n  You may be tired of hearing me say ``Secretary,'' because I am tired \nof saying it. I have only said it 25 times in this speech. But this \nbill uses the word ``Secretary'' another 957 times, which is an \nindication that the HELP Committee bill is moving control of our health \ncare system in what many people in this country consider the wrong \ndirection.\n  That brings me to the House bill that was released last week. The \nHouse bill, right here--2,000-some pages--seems to be heading in the \nwrong direction also. In fact, a spokesman for the small business \nindustry said to the Hill newspaper:\n\n       [The House bill] is a ``how to'' on how not to do health \n     care reform.\n\n  That is pretty disappointing, since the bill costs about $2.2 million \nper word. You would think we would be getting something for that kind \nof investment.\n  The Wall Street Journal today calls the House bill ``the worst bill \never.'' Quoting, ``Epic new spending and taxes, pricier insurance, \nrationed care, dishonest accounting: the Pelosi bill has it all.''\n  Again, that was from the Wall Street Journal.\n  Let's start with what is in the 2,000 pages and $1 trillion in \nspending in this new bill.\n  The bill includes a government-run insurance provision. All the \ncaveats aside, it is still a government insurance plan--or let me say \ngovernment insurance company, plain and simple.\n  Interestingly, after all the promises about lower costs, the \nCongressional Budget Office has said that premiums in the government-\nrun plan would be more expensive than premiums in the private market. \nThat report just came out within the last couple of days.\n  The bill also locks every American with an income below 150 percent \ninto Medicaid. Today, a family of 4 with an income of $33,000 is at 150 \npercent of the poverty level. Under this new House bill, that family \nwould not get any assistance to get private health coverage. In other \nwords, they would not have choice.\n  Let me point out that Medicaid is already financially unsustainable \nin its current form. This is the biggest expansion of Medicaid in its \nhistory. With this Medicaid expansion, the new House bill continues to \nleave States liable for a significant share of that new spending--a \nshare States cannot afford. Ultimately, that will force States to raise \ntaxes to pay for their share of this expansion of Medicaid. That is a \nhidden tax, although it will come separately among the 50 States.\n  The bill also proposes a host of new Federal insurance market reforms \nthat will actually raise costs for most individual Americans.\n  With the creation of a new unelected Federal bureaucrat, called the \n``health choices commissioner,'' the Federal Government will now be in \ncharge of deciding what insurance you have to buy.\n  If this isn't a government takeover of health care, I don't know what \nit is. If you don't like what the new health choices commissioner comes \nup with or you cannot afford it, you will be hit with a new individual \nmandate tax penalty, and that will be enforced by the IRS.\n  Despite all the promises about being able to keep what you have, the \nbill cuts more than $150 billion from Medicare Advantage plans, \nendangering the existing coverage for millions of seniors.\n  Don't take my word for it, because the Office of the Actuary--that is \na professional office, not a political office--at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services said that with this level of cuts \n``enrollment in [Medicare Advantage] plans would decrease by 64 \npercent.''\n  The CBO has taken a look at some of the changes in the Medicare Part \nD drug benefit and concluded that the changes will actually raise \npremiums.\n  So whether you are in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, or private \ninsurance, this new House bill means higher costs, more government \ninterference, and less choice. I don't think that is what people in my \nState of Iowa have in mind when they ask us to fix the health care \nsystem.\n  The House bill also includes a part that is called the CLASS Act, \nwhich creates a new long-term care entitlement. I happen to be very \nsupportive of taking steps to improve long-term care for Americans. But \nthe CLASS Act is fiscally irresponsible. I am not going to name the \nprominent Senate Democrat, but one has been quoted as calling the CLASS \nAct a Ponzi scheme that Bernie Madoff would have been proud of.\n  Finally, I hope everyone out there pays special attention to what \nHouse Democrats call ``shared responsibility.''\n  If you make money in America, the House Democrats expect you to do \nsome extra sharing. Lots. The bill includes a massive tax increase to \npay for it.\n  Now I wish to go to what is not in the bill. Even though President \nObama continues to support medical liability reform, as I do, the House \nstill refuses to consider it. In the ``devil's in the details'' \ncategory, I find it particularly worrisome that the House bill failed \nto include a prohibition on rationing that was in their original \ndiscussion draft. The discussion draft of H.R. 3200 stated that the \ncommittee should ``ensure that essential benefit coverage does not lead \nto rationing of health care.''\n  Every time you get the government more involved in health care, the \nissue at grassroots America comes up: Will\n\n[[Page S10979]]\n\nwe have rationing? A lot of committees have tried to say that there \nwould not be any rationing coming from this, and that was in the \noriginal House bill. But as it is put together as one final package, as \nit is here, that section, unfortunately, was dropped. In other words, \nthe prohibition on rationing is not in this bill.\n  This is what the latest House bill proposes: more taxes, more \nspending, higher premiums, fewer choices, a government-run plan, the \nbiggest Medicaid expansion in history, unsustainable new entitlement \nprograms, and 2,000 pages.\n  Despite all the promises, the facts don't lie. The House bill and the \nHELP Committee bill I referred to during these remarks represent an \nunprecedented government takeover of our Nation's health care system--a \ntakeover that this country cannot afford, and a takeover that the \nAmerican people don't want.\n  I thank my colleagues for giving me this time beyond the hour of 4, \nwhen the unemployment compensation bill was to be taken up, so I could \nkeep another obligation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/02/senate-section/article/S10979-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 3548, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3548) to amend the Supplemental Appropriations \n     Act, 2008, to provide for the temporary availability of \n     certain additional emergency unemployment compensation, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Baucus/Reid) amendment No. 2712, in the nature of \n     a substitute.\n       Reid amendment No. 2713 (to amendment No. 2712), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2714 (to amendment No. 2713), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 2715 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 2712), to change the enactment \n     date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2716 (to amendment No. 2715), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Finance, \n     with instructions to report back forthwith, with Reid \n     amendment No. 2717, to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2718 (to the instructions (amendment No. \n     2717) of the motion to commit), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 2719 (to amendment No. 2718), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Illinois such \ntime as he desires.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. He will be discussing a matter of grave importance in \nIllinois and all across the Nation, the extension of unemployment \nbenefits, which we have been trying to bring to the floor for 27 days. \nOur Republican colleagues have opposed it, stopped it, delayed it, and \ndemanded every vote they can think of to stop the extension of \nunemployment benefits, even though there are millions of Americans out \nof work and desperately looking for jobs. Many of them have exhausted \ntheir family savings trying to avoid foreclosure, to feed their \nfamilies, and they need these benefits desperately. But we have been \nheld up time and again because several Republican Senators have \ninsisted on amendments that have nothing to do with unemployment and \nnothing or little to do with the economy. I hope today we can break \nthrough that. I hope we can find bipartisan support to extend the \nunemployment benefits.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for yielding a moment to me.\n  I wish to respond to my friend--and he is my friend--my colleague, \nSenator Grassley of Iowa, my neighboring State. He and I have worked on \nmany things together. Our political views differ, that is for sure, but \nI believe he is a hard-working, good representative of his State. In \nfact, when I said that once on the floor, he ended up quoting it in one \nof his campaign brochures, which got me in trouble with the Iowa \nDemocratic Party. But so be it. I like him, and I hope he feels the \nsame.\n  We have worked together on many issues, but for the Senator from Iowa \nto come to the floor and be critical of a bill saying it is too many \npages--that is what I have heard over and over again from the \nRepublican side. They have argued that health care reform in the Senate \nis going to run over 1,000 pages in length, and they say it over and \nover again.\n  I don't know historically what major legislation considered on the \nSenate floor is comprised in the number of pages, but we have had some \npretty big bills in the past--in the Senate Appropriations Committee \nand other places--because those bills take on big issues and big \nsubjects. Nothing is bigger than our health care system in America. To \ntalk about 1,000 pages really does not do justice to the enormity of \nthe task we are tackling, to try to bring costs under control so people \nand businesses across America have secure and stable health care.\n  We ought to make sure as well that the health insurance companies \nstop exploiting those who have health insurance policies. We want to \neliminate preexisting conditions as an exclusion. We want to make sure \nwhen you are sick, your health care will be there; that when you change \njobs, you can take your health care with you. We want to make sure your \nchildren are covered for longer periods of time than they are now under \ncurrent law. It takes a few pages to put that together. You cannot put \nit in a few sentences if you want to change the law and make it work.\n  So to come here and criticize the bill which has not been presented \nin a final form as I stand here I don't think makes a very strong case.\n  I asked the other day for the Republicans to tell me how many pages \ntheir health care reform bill is. The Senator from Tennessee said they \nwere working on several different bills but they would be shorter in \nlength. The closest we can come to the Republican health care reform \nbill I hold in my hand. It is 2\\1/2\\ pages long, and it consists of a \npress release from Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader. That \nis as far as the Republicans have gone in writing health care reform \nfor the American people. It is a press release. In this press release, \nthere are no positive things they stand for, only criticisms of our \nefforts to write a health care reform bill.\n  To my right is the Senator from Montana, the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee. He has spent the better part of a year--at least a \nyear--trying to put together a health care bill. He has engaged others \nin trying to bring them into this conversation. Unfortunately, at the \nend of the day, only one Republican Senator, Ms. Snowe of Maine, joined \nSenate Democrats in voting for health care reforms. So far, she is the \nonly Republican in the House or the Senate who has voted for health \ncare reform even at the committee level. The Republicans have been \nstanding on the sidelines while we have been trying our best to put \ntogether good legislation which will bring the cost of health care \ndown, protect those beneficiaries who are denied coverage under their \nhealth insurance plans, and extend the reach of competition and choice \nso more Americans have places to turn. When the Senator from Iowa \ncomplains about so-called rationing, I think he overstates the case.\n  We know there is too much money spent on the current health care \nsystem. There is duplication, waste, and fraud, and we want it to come \nto an end. If Medicare is going to be on sound financial footing, if we \ncan say to seniors today and for years to come that they can count on \nMedicare being there when they need it, we have to cut out unnecessary \nspending.\n  One of the areas in that particular program that is highly \ncontroversial is called Medicare Advantage.\n  Medicare Advantage was proposed by the insurance industry. They said \nyears ago: The government has tried to run Medicare for 40 years, but \nthey haven't done a very good job. Why don't you let the private \ninsurance companies offer a Medicare plan. We will show you what you \ncan do when you use the genius of the insurance industry in America to \noffer Medicare.\n  We took them up on their challenge and said to them: Present the \ninsurance policy to seniors that will provide Medicare benefits.\n\n[[Page S10980]]\n\n  They called it Medicare Advantage, and there are literally millions \nof these policies all across America today.\n  We stepped back after a number of years and said: How did they do?\n  They challenged the government and said: We can do it better.\n  Some did. But we also found Medicare Advantage plans that were \novercharging the government 14 percent more than the cost of basic \nMedicare the government offered. So instead of bringing the costs down, \nthe costs went up 14 percent. We were creating a subsidy to private \nhealth insurance companies to offer Medicare plans. That is a waste of \ndollars. The health insurance industry, although they used those \ndollars to their own benefit, are not helping Medicare, and they are \nnot helping the taxpayers of this country.\n  The recent news about profits of the insurance giant Humana explains \nwhy the major health insurance companies and most of the Republicans \noppose health care reform and why they have gone to such great lengths \nto defeat our efforts.\n  Last quarter, Humana saw their profits rise 65 percent, mostly due to \nthe participation in the Medicare Advantage Program, the subsidies the \ntaxpayers are sending them. This one company made $301 million in \nprofits in the last 3 months alone, and they did it, by their own \nadmission, on the backs of Medicare and Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries.\n  The insurance industry is making billions by gaming the Medicare \nAdvantage system at the expense of seniors' traditional Medicare \ncoverage, and taxpayers are picking up the bill. For some reason, the \nSenate Republicans feel the need to defend them at every turn. When you \nhear the opposition to health care reform, it is inspired not \nexclusively but to a great extent by the opposition to health care \nreform from the private health insurance companies.\n  Why are these companies opposed to health care reform? Because it \nmeans competition. A public option plan that is available around this \ncountry will create in many parts in our country the first real \ncompetition for health insurance. It means consumers have a fighting \nchance to get a lower monthly premium because there will be a not-for-\nprofit company there offering health insurance benefits. It is a \ncompany that is not focused on the bottom line of showing profits for \nshareholders. It will be a company that is not marketing and spending a \nfortune on advertising. It will be a company that is not spending so \nmuch on administrative help to say no to those covered by insurance \npolicies. This will lower costs, and this is what drives the private \nhealth insurance companies wild.\n  Secondly, they hate to hear two words--McCarran-Ferguson--because \nthey refer to a law passed by Congress 64 years ago which exempted the \ninsurance industry and health insurance industry from antitrust \nregulations. Currently under the law, health insurance companies can \nlegally conspire and collude to establish the premiums they will charge \nall across America. There is no real competition. When they set \npremiums, they have sat down and agreed on what they are going to \ncharge. And they can allocate markets. They can make sure they dominate \nmarkets so there is no real choice there for consumers.\n  I think McCarran-Ferguson is outdated. It is a travesty under the law \nto allow it continue, and it should end. You will not hear one single \nRepublican Senator say that--at least I haven't yet. I hope they join \nus in calling for real health insurance reform, in ending McCarran-\nFerguson protection and exclusions based on preexisting conditions, for \nexample, and giving real choice to consumers across this country. \nInstead, what we hear from them is the language of the health insurance \ncompanies opposing fundamental health insurance reform.\n  The American people have run out of patience with those who tolerate \nand encourage the current system--a system that fails us, as premiums \ngo up even as wages do not; a system that, unfortunately, is not \noffering health care protection for millions of Americans working for \nbusinesses that even last year offered health insurance protection but \nthey just cannot afford to do it anymore.\n  We are going to keep pressing forward. The Republican plan consists \nof a three-page press release. It will take more than that to bring \nmeaningful change to health care in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are now on the provision to extend \nunemployment insurance, as well as extend the home buyers tax credit, \nas well as expand the net operating loss provision. I wish to speak \nabout that provision because I think it is so important that it pass.\n  The British mathematical physicist Lord Kelvin once said:\n\n       Until you can measure something and express it in numbers, \n     you have only the beginning of understanding.\n\n  The numbers now measure the beginning of a recovery, and we are \nbeginning to understand the depth of the great recession of 2008 and \n2009. It has been the longest recession since World War II. The numbers \nshow that the American economy has been shrinking from the middle of \nlast year to the middle of this year--shrinking. For January through \nMarch, it declined at a 6.4-percent annual rate. It has been the \nsharpest decline in 27 years. But last week, the Commerce Department \nreported that from July through September, the numbers show the economy \ngrew at a 3.5-percent annual rate.\n  When economists talk about the end of a recession, however, they mean \nthe time when things stop getting worse, not necessarily getting better \nbut stop getting worse. For most Americans, it will still be some time \nbefore things start getting better. Even though the economists can \nmeasure some improvement and express it in the numbers, we still have \nonly the beginning of a recovery.\n  Economists say that the stimulus package we passed last winter is \npart of the reason for the growth. On Friday, the Obama administration \nreported that the stimulus package has created or saved more than \n640,000 jobs so far. Economists also credit consumer spending for the \nlatest growth. In particular, economists credit automobile and housing \nsales. From July through September, housing sales rose at a 23.4-\npercent annual rate. The home buyer tax credit played a big part in \nthat growth. That is one of the provisions we are considering in the \namendment before us today.\n  It will still take some time for the job picture to improve. Job \ngrowth turns around more slowly than the economy as a whole. Economists \ncall this a lagging indicator. Last month, the jobless rate reached 9.8 \npercent. That is the highest rate in 26 years. Economists expect this \nweek's report will show that unemployment rose again this month. \nEconomists will say jobs will still be hard to find well into 2010.\n  Last week, the Labor Department reported that 530,000 people filed \ntheir first jobless claims. That number has been heading down, but at \nmore than half a million people, it is still far too high.\n  We still need to do more to help the economy recover, and we still \nneed to do more to help Americans get and keep good jobs. The extension \nof unemployment benefits and the tax relief in this legislation are \npart of the answer. I hope that today the Senate can act to bring \nrelief to millions of Americans waiting for this important legislation. \nUnemployment insurance is a vital lifeline for millions of Americans. \nIt is a lifeline many families and communities continue to need just to \nkeep afloat.\n  Along with the rest of the Nation, my State of Montana has felt the \neffects of this great recession. Our unemployment rate is up to 6.5 \npercent, and although it is not as high as the national average, many \nin my State are suffering. This is particularly true in the Montana \nmining, lumber, and construction industries. The national demand for \nlumber is expected to fall below 30 million board feet this year. The \namount of lumber used to build new homes is expected to drop from 28 \nbillion board feet to about 5 billion board feet, and that hits Montana \nvery hard.\n  When we help unemployed Americans, let's remember, we help their \ncommunities. When we help our unemployed neighbors, we also help keep \nopen the neighborhood grocery store and the neighborhood gas station.\n\n[[Page S10981]]\n\nWhen we help our unemployed neighbors, we also help our economy and \nourselves.\n  I am gratified that a majority of my colleagues appear to agree that \nit is important to extend unemployment benefits. I am also hopeful that \nwe will deliver those benefits very soon.\n  The amendment before us today also includes an extension of the \nFederal unemployment tax. This extension covers the cost of the \nextended unemployment benefits. The Federal unemployment tax has been \nextended every year since 1982.\n  The amendment before us today would also provide tax relief to help \nour economy recover. The pending amendment would extend the home buyers \ntax credit and provide employers important tax relief.\n  The home buyers tax credit has helped millions of Americans to buy \ntheir first homes. The tax credit has boosted demand and it has helped \nreduce the inventory of unsold homes. This, in turn, has helped to \nbring much needed stability to the housing market.\n  But in the housing market, like the labor market, we are not yet in \nthe clear. The housing market is still recovering from the implosion of \nthe subprime mortgage market. In many parts of the country, housing \nprices remain at record lows and foreclosures continue as Americans \ncontinue to lose their jobs and the means to pay their mortgages.\n  That is why it is important to extend the home buyers tax credit. In \nthe amendment before us today, we have raised the income limitations to \nopen the tax credit to millions more who are thinking about buying a \nhome. Our amendment also extends the credit to include home buyers \nseeking to move up to a new home--not just for first-time home buyers \nbut those who want to move up to a new home. For those who have lived \nin their current residence for 5 years or more, they would be eligible \nfor a $6,500 tax credit if they want to buy a new home. It is $8,000 \nfor first-time buyers and a $6,500 tax credit for those who want to \nmove up--for those who have stayed in their current residence for 5 \nyears.\n  The home buyers tax credit would be extended to April 30 of next \nyear. We also include new binding contract language. This language \nwould effectively make the credit available until June 30 of next year, \nas long as the home buyer entered into a binding contract before May 1.\n  I think this temporary extension of the home buyers tax credit is the \nright approach. It would provide a much needed stimulus of the housing \nmarket, and it would remain fiscally responsible.\n  Our amendment also would add net operating loss relief for \nbusinesses. Under current law, small businesses are able to carry back \ntheir 2008 losses to profitable years for up to 5 years. Senator Snowe \nand I worked together on a bill that would expand this provision to all \nbusinesses. The amendment before us today includes that legislation. It \nwould provide all businesses with the ability to carry back losses from \n2008 and 2009 for 5 years--not just 2 years but 5 years. That is 3 \nyears longer than under current law. This type of relief will help \nsmall and large businesses alike.\n  This tax relief is paid for also in a fiscally responsible manner. \nOur amendment would delay a tax break for multinational corporations, \nmany of which would benefit from the expanded NOL relief. We also \nincluded increases and penalties for taxpayers who fail to timely file \npartners and S corporation returns. We believe these provisions will \nincrease compliance with the tax law and also help us close the tax \ngap.\n  This package provides timely and essential relief to American \nfamilies and businesses that have been affected by our economy. Our \namendment would extend benefits to the unemployed Americans who are \nhurting the most and would help home buyers to buy homes. It would \nprovide support for all businesses that are having trouble meeting \ntheir payroll in these tough economic times.\n  This amendment would help to speed the recovery from the great \nrecession. It would help to improve our economy, and it would help the \nAmerican people. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation and \nvote for cloture on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, a few moments ago, the Senator from \nIllinois was on the Senate floor essentially responding to comments \nthat had been made by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, regarding \nthe health care debate and the legislation that has been reported out \nof the House and that is going to be voted on this week--legislation \nwhich is 1,990 pages long.\n  The Senator from Illinois asked: Where is the Republican bill, if \nthey do not like the Democratic bill? Well, there are a number of \nRepublican bills out there, but I would say to the Senator from \nIllinois or anybody on the Democratic side who is waiting for \nRepublicans to produce a 2,000-page bill, it is not likely to happen. \nWe don't believe legislating with 2,000-page bills makes a lot of sense \nwhen we are talking about one-sixth of the American economy. We believe \nit makes a lot more sense to approach that in a way that fixes and \naddresses the problems that exist with the health care economy in this \ncountry today in a step-by-step way, not with a huge, massive expansion \nof the Federal Government in Washington, DC.\n  The bill that came out of the House last week--at least according to \nthe CBO--was a $1 trillion increase in spending. But that is before it \nis fully implemented. When it is fully implemented, it will be $2 \ntrillion in additional spending--a massive expansion of the Federal \nGovernment in Washington, DC, with massive tax increases on small \nbusinesses and working families in this country, massive cuts to \nMedicare Programs upon which seniors across this country rely and \ndepend. And that doesn't even include what happens if those cuts in \nMedicare don't happen. And we have reason to believe based on \nhistorical patterns they would not happen. Then it probably gets \nborrowed, and we add more trillions of dollars to the Federal debt--a \ndebt which is already growing at $1 trillion a year every year for the \nnext 10 years.\n  So we have a massive expansion of government--a $2 trillion expansion \nof government, massive tax increases, massive cuts to Medicare, and \nperhaps massive borrowing and additions to the Federal debt. That is \nwhat happens with the 2,000-page bill which is being proposed by the \nDemocratic leadership in the House of Representatives.\n  So if the Senator from Illinois or anybody on the other side is \nwaiting for Republicans to produce a 2,000-page bill that expands the \ngovernment by $2 trillion and raises taxes on small businesses--which \nare the economic engine of our economy and that will create the jobs \nand get us back on a path toward recovery--I would suggest they are \ngoing to be waiting a very long time.\n  That isn't to say for 1 minute that there aren't lots of ideas that \nRepublicans are putting forward that will help drive the cost of health \ncare down--contrary to the big government schemes put forward by the \nother side which, in addition to raising taxes, cutting Medicare, and \nborrowing more--if you can believe this--increases the cost of health \ncare by raising premiums for everybody who currently has health \ninsurance in this country.\n  So the 2,000-page bill isn't coming from us. We have a lot of great \nideas that we will have an opportunity to debate and amendments we can \noffer, if and when we get on this bill. But the 2,000-page bills--the \nmassive expansion of the Federal Government in Washington, DC--is not \nthe way we believe we should fix and address the health care economy.\n  That brings me to my point because in contrast to a 1,990-page bill \nsome are calling reform--which doesn't reform but certainly wrecks one-\nsixth of the American economy--I have a simple one-page amendment. It \nis four lines long. I would like to have the opportunity to offer it to \nthe underlying legislation that is a matter of debate on the \nunemployment insurance extension, which I think most people on both \nsides of this aisle support. I think both Republicans and Democrats in \nthe Senate believe it makes sense for us to extend unemployment \nbenefits coverage to people who are losing it, and the underlying bill \nwould do that by 14 weeks.\n  We also believe when a bill comes before the Senate, under the \nhistorical practices of the Senate, typically it is\n\n[[Page S10982]]\n\nopen to amendment. That is what makes the Senate different from the \nHouse of Representatives. Our Founders, in their infinite wisdom, \nconceived of two institutions--one, the House of Representatives; two, \nthe Senate. The Senate has a more deliberative role. In doing so, it \nallows for open consideration and debate and votes on amendments.\n  What has happened today is that the majority leader has decided to \nfill the tree; in other words, not to allow votes on any amendments. So \nmy one-page amendment, which is very simple and straightforward, isn't \ngoing to get voted on.\n  Mr. President, all my amendment does is end, on December 31 of this \nyear, TARP. If the Congress doesn't take action, the Treasury Secretary \ncan extend TARP. What is important to note about that is TARP has over \n$200 billion that hasn't been spent, and with payments that have come \nback into that fund, over $300 billion in funds that are unexpended. If \nwe don't spend those--and it doesn't become a political slush fund to \nbe spent on other priorities the Federal Government in Washington comes \nup with--that goes to pay down the Federal debt.\n\n  I can't think of anything more important now than trying to pay down \nthe Federal debt. If we are worrying about trying to help the economy \nrecover and helping taxpayers, let's take the unobligated balance in \nthe TARP fund, end that program at the end of the year, and use those \nproceeds to apply to the Federal debt so we can start making a dent in \nthese massive deficits and this massive debt building in Washington, \nDC.\n  So that is all my amendment does. It just ends TARP at the end of the \nyear. I think it is significant that since Congress created TARP, \nCongress ought to have a say in whether it gets extended. If we are \ngoing to have that say, it has to happen between now and the end of the \nyear.\n  I couldn't find many opportunities between now and the end of the \nyear to get this amendment offered, and as we had this piece of \nlegislation moving through the Senate, the sort of natural inclination \nof this institution is to allow for amendments to be considered. So I \noffered that amendment so that Congress can be on the record as to \nwhether we think TARP ought to be extended or whether it ought to be \nended and those unobligated balances be used to pay down the Federal \ndebt, which, as I said, is growing at $1 trillion a year for the next \n10 years.\n  So I think it is a very straightforward, simple amendment, and simple \nenough that it can be put on one page. It doesn't take 1,990 pages to \nexplain this. That is all it does. I think it is important to the \ntaxpayers that we have this vote and that the Senate be on the record, \nthat we be heard with respect to whether we think TARP ought to be \nextended or not, since Congress created TARP a year ago to bring \nstabilization to the financial services industry of this country.\n  That having been accomplished, it seems to me the next step ought to \nbe to focus on getting the Federal debt under control and paying down \nthe debt. We can do that by taking those unexpended balances and the \nunobligated balances in TARP and put those toward the Federal debt.\n  What is being done today is filling the tree and preventing us from \nhaving votes in the Senate. It has been done before; it is not like \nthis is entirely new. But it is important to bear in mind what my \ncolleagues on the other side have said in the past when it was done \nback when the Republicans were in charge of the Senate. I want to quote \nwhat some of the Democrats who are in leadership positions in the \nSenate today said back then.\n  This is in February of 2006.\n\n       This is a very bad practice. It runs against the basic \n     nature of the Senate.\n\n  That was Senator Harry Reid. \n\n       This is a bad way, in my opinion, to run the Senate.\n\n  Harry Reid in March of 2006.\n\n       I have a right, under the procedures of the Senate, to \n     offer this amendment. I should have the right to offer it at \n     the moment, but I am not because there is--I guess the word \n     ``obstruction'' is to be used--obstruction at the moment is \n     the tree is filled so that no one can offer an amendment.\n\n  That was Senator Byron Dorgan back in February 2006.\n\n       If you don't want to cast controversial votes, don't run \n     for the Senate. That is what this is all about. You have to \n     face the music and face the voters.\n\n  That was the Senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin, back in May of 2006.\n  Those are just a few examples of what my colleagues on the other side \nhave said about the very practice that is being employed by the leader \ntoday to prevent Republicans from offering amendments. Those are \nstatements, as I said, made by Members of the now majority back when \nthey were in the minority.\n  So we are going to have a cloture vote at 5 o'clock--in a few \nminutes--on whether to proceed to this substitute that is pending \nbefore us and whether we are going to allow this practice of filling \nthe amendment tree to be used to prevent not only Members on the \nRepublican side but Members on the Democratic side from offering \namendments.\n  Filling the tree is, as I said, not without precedent. It has been \ndone. But it has been used rarely, historically, up until now. This \nwill mark the 22nd time the Democratic leader has filled the amendment \ntree in an attempt to prevent an open and fair debate and a vote on \namendments that are offered by the Senate.\n  I served as a Member of the House of Representatives for three terms. \nThere, the Rules Committee regulates what legislation comes to the \nfloor, what amendments are made in order, how much time is allocated to \neach amendment, and it is an orderly process. That is the way the House \nwas designed by our Founders.\n  The Senate is a very different institution. The Senate is supposed to \nbe the place where we have open debate, where we have a fair process \nthat allows amendments to be heard and allows amendments to be voted \non. I think we have been very reasonable in seeking to offer amendments \nto the underlying unemployment insurance bill. But as I said, Mr. \nPresident, the majority leader has chosen to ``fill the amendment \ntree'' and thereby prevent those amendments from being offered, those \namendments from being debated, and those amendments from being voted \non.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Nebraska is here as well. He \nalso has an amendment he would like to offer that would offset in a \ndifferent way the extension of the unemployment coverage to the people \nwho are losing their coverage and should have their benefits extended \nby the additional 14 weeks. His is an amendment I also think should be \nvoted on in the Senate.\n  But I would like an opportunity to have this amendment voted on. It \nis one page. But we will not have that opportunity because the majority \nleader has opted to fill the amendment tree and prevent votes on those \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of points, not get \ninto a knockdown, drag-out argument with my good friend from South \nDakota.\n  First, he is saying the Democratic side is limiting his opportunity \nto offer amendments. I want to remind my friend that actually there has \nbeen a lot of to and fro here. The majority leader has offered many \nother opportunities for your side to offer amendments, back and forth, \nbut it has gotten to the point where the leader had to draw the line \nand say we have to get moving here, we have to get moving on extending \nunemployment insurance. The point is, there were many opportunities to \noffer amendments, both ways. We have to get moving here and get \nunemployment insurance extended.\n  The other main point I think is important, just to raise it, \nbasically suggesting this bill is not paid for. The Congressional \nBudget Office is the gold standard here. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says at least the Finance Committee bill--we don't have another \nbill before us yet in the Senate, but the Finance Committee bill, the \ncommittee I chair--the CBO said the Finance Committee bill was deficit \nneutral for 10 years. That is their assessment. The CBO is the gold \nstandard. They make these determinations. That is what they said.\n  They also concluded that the Finance Committee bill would reduce the \ndeficit in future years--reduce the deficit\n\n[[Page S10983]]\n\nin future years--and significantly reduce the deficit in subsequent 10-\nyear intervals.\n  I must say, they also made another very interesting conclusion that \nrebuts the charge that this health care legislation is more government. \nThe fact is, the Congressional Budget Office concluded, in a letter to \nour committee, the bill would ``reduce the Government's overall \ncommitment to health care.''\n  Reduce the Federal Government's overall commitment to health care--\nnot the same, not increase, but reduce. That is the Congressional \nBudget Office, in a letter: Reduce it. They gave a percentage. I think \nreduce it by a quarter or half percent GDP over time.\n  We do not have legislation before us now because the leader is \nmelding two bills together, the HELP Committee and Finance Committee \nbills. Then we have to go to conference and so on and so forth, but it \nwould be my hope, be my expectation, be my interest, to see that \ncontinues, namely that the bill we pass out of this body is deficit \nneutral, when it comes back from conference it is deficit neutral over \n10 years, actually does reduce the budget deficit over time, and \nactually reduces the Federal Government's commitment to health care. \nThat is, the Federal Government would be paying less in health care \nover time. I hope that will be the case and that will be my \nexpectation. That is something I will strive for.\n  I want to make it clear: not more government, less government--\naccording to CBO anyway. Also the proposal out of the Finance Committee \nwas deficit neutral.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 4 minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the amendment \nprocess with this unemployment bill. It is a very important point that \nwe are making this afternoon.\n  A few hours ago the very distinguished Member from Illinois, the \nsenior Senator, got up and talked about how the unemployment insurance \nbill had been stalled by Republicans. He claimed that Republicans had \nbeen stalling it for 4 weeks. I rise today to respectfully disagree \nwith that. We have come forward with a series of amendments. That is \nwhat the Senate is about. The other side has resisted votes on the \namendments. So we started this process of trying to scale this back. We \nstarted out with eight amendments. The majority leader said, no, it \ncould only be six. So Republicans got together and said we will come \nback with only three Republican amendments. Then, lo and behold, there \nwas an objection to that.\n  Let me repeat: We said eight, they said six, we said three, and they \nsaid no.\n  It turns out there is one significant vote and it is the Senator from \nSouth Dakota who I think very appropriately and, I think, wisely put an \namendment forward that would put TARP to an end at the end of the year.\n  I am new to this process. But I have to tell you, in the first weeks \nI was here when we were voting on amendments I said to myself: This is \nthe most remarkable institution. Somebody from the minority could \nliterally come with an idea from a citizen back home, put that idea out \nhere, and get a vote on that. There cannot be anything like this \nanywhere in the world.\n  What is happening today, if I might point out, is that this is being \nthwarted by filling the tree. For those who are listening to this and \nsaying what does this filling the tree mean, all it means is that the \nmajority leader, who is in control of the process, simply puts all the \namendments out there and there is no opportunity for anybody else to \noffer an amendment. It is called filling the tree.\n  Look at what is happening. This is what does concern me as a Member \nof this great institution. If you go back through the history of \nmajority leaders, you can see what has happened. Tom Daschle, when he \nwas majority leader, I think used this once. Bill Frist, when he was \nmajority leader, used this I think it was 12 times, if I remember \ncorrectly.\n  Today, this will be 22 times that the majority leader has done this. \nWhat this graph means is if you have an amendment, as I do, that \nbasically says I like what you are doing here. I don't have any problem \nwith extending unemployment. I voted for the tax credit for homes. I \nvoted, or I would vote, for the loss carryback. I talked about it on \nthe campaign trail. But I have an amendment that says we should pay for \nthis the way we did originally, with stimulus funding. That is simple. \nThis is not complicated. All I am asking is for a vote on that. I think \nthat makes a tremendous amount of sense.\n  What I am saying is if we are going to act like a Senate, if we are \ngoing to give each Member the ability to make their case, then what we \nhave to do is stop this and bring these issues to a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of the H.R. 3548, \nthe Unemployment Compensation Extension Act.\n  When the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released jobless figures \nfor September, they showed an estimated 287,300 people unemployed in my \nhome State of Arizona. The State's unemployment rate now stands at 9.1 \npercent--the highest since 1983.\n  And as if that weren't bad enough, the Bureau reports that Arizona's \nunemployment rate approaches 17.2 percent when the number of people who \nare underemployed are taken into account, along with those who are so \ndiscouraged that they have given up on their job search.\n  The construction industry in Arizona has been particularly hard hit. \nA report in the East Valley Tribune earlier this week noted that while \nthere were nearly 248,000 people employed in construction in June of \n2006, that number had declined to just 137,700 by September. That is a \ndecline of 44 percent. The State's trade and transportation sector is \noff 15 percent from its peak, and manufacturing is down nearly as much.\n  The unemployed need the support that this benefit extension will \nprovide. It is a shame, though, that we couldn't have passed this \nlegislation sooner to speed the delivery of these benefits to those who \nneed them.\n  The House of Representatives passed its version of the unemployment \nbenefits extension bill on September 22, but it was not until 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks later, on October 8, that the majority leader finally brought a \ndifferent version before the Senate for consideration. Senators were \nthen given just an hour and a half to review the bill and vote, with no \nopportunity to consider amendments.\n  In other words, the majority leader proposed that Senators either \npass his bill or no bill at all.\n  And that is a problem because there are changes that should be made \nto the bill, yet there is no opportunity for Senators of either party \nto offer amendments. Acting in my capacity as minority whip, I objected \non behalf of other Senators to the leader's short-circuited procedure, \nfully expecting that we could promptly come to an agreement to allow \nvotes on a limited number of amendments and then vote on final passage. \nHad the leader agreed, we could have disposed of the bill nearly 3 \nweeks ago, and it would probably be law by now.\n  Instead, the majority leader continued to insist that Senators vote \non his bill and only his bill, without amendment.\n  Only within the last few days has there been some willingness to work \nwith us on the important amendments Senators wanted to address. For \nexample, both Republican and Democratic Senators want to include an \nextension of the homebuyer tax credit, which some credit with reviving \nthe homebuilding industry.\n  Another colleague would like to offer an amendment to better use E-\nVerify to prevent fraudulent claims of unemployment benefits. This \namendment would help ensure that people who claim benefits are who they \nsay they are.\n  In addition, colleagues want to offer amendments on net operating \nloss as a stimulus to struggling companies. Others would sunset the \nTARP program, provide nongovernment management of the TARP, and prevent \nTARP recipients from providing funds to ACORN.\n  Another amendment proposes an alternative offset for the $2.4 billion \ncost of extending unemployment benefits. The majority's version offsets \nthe cost by extending the Federal unemployment surtax, but imposing a \ndirect tax\n\n[[Page S10984]]\n\non job creation is perhaps one of the worst things we could do when the \neconomy continues to lose jobs. The alternative that some Senators \nwould like to offer would offset the cost of the bill with unspent \nfunds from the so-called stimulus package instead.\n  How these amendments will be addressed is not yet clear; we do not \nhave the right to offer any of them under the majority leader's closed \nprocess.\n  We should also recognize that we are engaged in this exercise of \nextending unemployment benefits for one simple reason: Our economy \ncontinues to lose more jobs than it is producing. That is because the \nPresident's stimulus program is simply not working as intended.\n  According to an October 29 Associated Press report, the Obama \nadministration is overstating the impact of the stimulus and the number \nof jobs the program has created. According to the AP report, ``the \nreview found some counts were more than 10 times as high as the actual \nnumber of jobs; some jobs were credited to stimulus spending when, in \nfact, none were produced.''\n  AP went on to note that ``there's no evidence the White House sought \nto inflate job numbers in the report, but the administration embraced \nthe flawed figures the moment they were released.''\n  An October 21 report in the Phoenix Business Journal recalled that \nwhile President Obama projected that the stimulus bill would create \n70,000 new jobs in Arizona, the State has actually lost 77,300 jobs \nsince the stimulus was signed into law.\n  If the stimulus isn't working, we ought to consider alternatives or \nat least try to put some of the remaining unspent funds to better use.\n  After all, we can and should extend unemployment benefits, but unless \nnew jobs are being created, the unemployed will be no better off once \nthe additional benefits we are providing run out.\n  Mr. President, I wish the majority leader had allowed this bill to \nmove forward sooner under an open process. We could have passed it \nweeks ago. But I intend to vote for it today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 7 minutes 8 seconds on \nthe Democratic side, and 4 seconds on the Republican side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Four seconds. That is interesting.\n  I want to set the record straight for my good friend from Nebraska. I \ndon't know how wise it would be to pay for this unemployment extension \nby stopping stimulus payments. Our economy is still coming out, still \nin recovery. We are by no means out of the woods yet. I think it would \nnot make sense to pay for the extension of unemployment insurance \nbenefits by going back to stimulus money and stopping the payment of \nstimulus dollars. I do not know exactly how many stimulus dollars are \nnot yet spent, but I think it is significant and I think it would be \nunwise for us to stop them at this point.\n  Beyond that, I think we should get on, vote, and pass this \nlegislation. People are out of jobs. There is a record number of people \nseeking unemployment. There are, I think, about 15 million Americans \nchasing 3 million jobs. They can't find jobs, can't get them; they are \nunavailable. It seems to me it only makes sense for us to extend the \nunderlying unemployment insurance for another 14 weeks for all States \nand 6 weeks for those high unemployment States.\n  I mentioned earlier how important it is for us to keep spending \nstimulus dollars. I chuckled when I heard my good friend talk about \nfilling the tree. Frankly, in my State we need not to fill up trees, we \nneed to fell more trees so we can get more jobs in our State, and that \nis one reason for the extension of the home buyer's tax credit.\n  The people in our home States, as we know, are more worried about \njobs than anything else. That is what it comes down to is jobs, good-\npaying jobs. With this legislation, hopefully, if we get enough cloture \nvotes so we can invoke cloture and get to the passage of the \nlegislation, it is about jobs--extending the homeowners tax credit, it \nis expanding the net operating loss provision, which is so important to \nso many companies. Add to that, it is extending unemployment insurance \nto those people who need benefits because they are out of work, looking \nfor jobs.\n  Let me repeat two figures I mentioned earlier: There are about 15 \nmillion people in our country unemployed who are looking for about 3 \nmillion jobs. That is about one out of five. That is unconscionable in \na country such as ours.\n  Let's get on with this, let's pass this legislation so people can get \nsome help.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I guess there is only 4 seconds \nleft on this side. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask all remaining time be yielded back \nand I ask consent we proceed to the vote on the underlying measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Baucus-Reid \n     amendment No. 2712 to H.R. 3548, the Unemployment \n     Compensation Extension Act of 2009.\n         Max Baucus, Byron L.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the Senate has just voted on a motion to \nadvance the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act. This is the second \ntime--that is right, the second time--we voted on this critical \nlegislation. But, unfortunately, opponents of the extension are still \nholding it up.\n  The bill under consideration today incorporates important ideas from \nboth sides of the aisle. When the House bill included additional weeks \nonly for workers in States with unemployment rates above 8.5 percent, \nthe chairman and the majority leader allowed us to work out a \ncompromise that would support jobless workers in all 50 States.\n  An amendment by Senator Isakson to extend the home buyers tax credit \nhas now been incorporated into the Senate bill, as well as an important \namendment from Senator Bunning to extend the carryback of net operating \nlosses for up to 5 years. Both of these are good ideas that will help \nhomeowners, help our housing market, and provide relief to businesses \nthat are trying to weather this economic recession. Both have now been \nincluded in the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act.\n  Now it is time for all of us to stop playing politics and to focus on \nthe critical issue we started to address a month ago: the devastating \nrates of unemployment and the nearly 2 million Americans who are \nexhausting their benefits at the rate of 7,000 a day.\n  This is good legislation. It is legislation that provides at least 14 \nadditional weeks of unemployment insurance for those Americans who have \nbeen hardest hit by this recession and those whose benefits are \nstarting to be exhausted. I was pleased that once again the motion to \nadvance this bill received broad bipartisan support. The vote was 85 to \n2. The first vote was 87 to 13. It should receive this kind of support \nbecause unemployment isn't a New England problem or a Montana problem \nor a southern problem; it isn't a Republican or an Independent or a \nDemocratic problem; it is a hardship that hits every community in every \nState in every part of our country.\n\n  Last week, I spoke about my constituent Jane McDermott from Stoddard, \nNH. Jane wrote me last week that without this extension, she doesn't \nknow how she is going to pay for the gas she needs to get out and look \nfor a job, she doesn't know how she is going to pay for groceries for \nher family or any of the other family necessities. I was hoping that \ntoday Jane would get the news she has been waiting for--that this \nextension will be put into effect and that she, along with millions of \nother Americans who need it, will get the help to be able to continue \nto look for a job and continue to get the family necessities while she \ndoes that.\n  I think it is time--again, way past time--for us to put politics \naside. We shouldn't make Jane or any of the other hundreds of thousands \nof Americans who have been waiting for this extension wait one more \nday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor with the hopes that we will get an \nagreement today, tomorrow, as soon as possible, to help the people who \nneed help. Thank you.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week's visit to Washington by the \nEcumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew I, is an appropriate occasion to \nrenew calls for the reopening of the Halki Seminary, without further \ndelay. Founded in 1844, the Theological School of Halki, located \noutside modern-day Istanbul, served as the principal seminary for \nEcumenical Patriarchate until its forcible closure by the Turkish \nauthorities in 1971. Counted among alumni of this preeminent \neducational institution are numerous prominent Orthodox scholars, \ntheologians, priests, and bishops as well as patriarchs, including \nBartholomew I. Many of these scholars and theologians have served as \nfaculty at other institutions serving Orthodox communities around the \nworld. Despite occasional indications by the authorities of pending \naction to reopen the seminary, to date all have failed to materialize.\n  Earlier this year, several of my colleagues from the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, which I chair, joined me in a \nletter to President Obama to underscoring our longstanding concern over \nthe continued closure of this unique institution. The continued denial \nof requests for the reopening of the seminary stands in clear violation \nof Turkey's obligations pursuant to the 1989 OSCE Vienna Concluding \nDocument which affirmed the right of religious communities to provide \n``training of religious personnel in appropriate institutions.'' While \nthere is no question that the Halki Seminary is the appropriate \ninstitution for training Orthodox clergy in Turkey, the Government of \nTurkey continues to refuse to reopen the school.\n  In his address to the Turkish Gran National Assembly in April, \nPresident Obama said, ``Freedom of religion and expression lead to a \nstrong and vibrant civil society that only strengthens the state, which \nis why steps like reopening Halki Seminary will send such an important \nsignal inside Turkey and beyond.'' In a welcomed development, Turkey's \nPrime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with the Ecumenical Patriarch \nin August. In an address to a wider gathering of minority religious \nleaders that day, Erdogan concluded by stating, ``We should not be of \nthose who gather, talk and disperse. A result should come out of \nthis.''\n  Mr. President, I urge Prime Minister Erdogan to follow through on the \nsentiment of those remarks by actions that will facilitate the \nreopening of the Halki Seminary without further delay. I am told that \nthe Theological School of Halki is situated atop the summit of the Hill \nof Hope. For those of us who have pursued this issue over the years, \nour hope has been that we would indeed witness the reopening of this \nhistoric institution. I remain hopeful and encourage Prime Minister \nErdogan to act decisively and without condition on this matter before \nhis upcoming visit to Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/02/senate-section/article/S10987-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10987-S10988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING GEORGE M. SULLIVAN\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to remember one of the \ngreat public officials in the history of the State of Alaska, the \nformer mayor of Anchorage, George M. Sullivan, who died peacefully in \nhis sleep last month at age 87. George served Alaska during a time of \ntransition in our State's history.\n  A lifelong Alaskan who was born and raised in Valdez, George worked \nfor the U.S. Army's transportation corps during World War II in the \nAleutians. He later won a seat in the Alaska House of Representatives \nin 1964 and 1965, being an excellent representative for Anchorage to \nrepresent the city's vast economic needs in the State legislature. He \nwas a convincing spokesman for Anchorage in securing the aid that the \ncity so desperately needed to rebuild.\n  George became the mayor of the city of Anchorage in 1967, just 8 \nyears after statehood, but more importantly just 3 years after the Good \nFriday earthquake of 1964 that destroyed most of downtown Anchorage. \nThe city was still in the early phases of rebuilding when George became \nthe leader of city government. He guided the city through crafting new \nbuilding and zoning codes as well as implementing land use planning to \nprevent further earthquake damage from occurring in the future.\n  Meanwhile, an economic earthquake struck Alaska--the discovery of oil \non Alaska's North Slope in December 1968. That discovery did more than \nany other event, even the earthquake, to turn Anchorage from a small \nport city to Alaska's largest city and the center of business, \ncommerce, and supply in the State.\n  In preparation for the construction of the Trans-Alaska pipeline and \nthe subsequent economic boom, Sullivan had the vision to see that \nmunicipal government needed to have greater authority to regulate and \nsupervise growth. He led the effort to bring about the merger of the \ncity of Anchorage with the surrounding borough to build a unified \ngovernment, helping to write the city-borough's first charter in 1975. \nHe then stayed on to guide the young unified city-borough government, \nserving as mayor for 14 years, longer than any other person before or \nsince.\n  While guiding Anchorage to become the State's largest city, he also \nfound time to represent Alaska as the State's first member of the \nexecutive board of the National League of Cities in 1972. He also \nserved as the president of the Alaska Municipal League.\n  George also worked tirelessly to represent Alaska's needs during \ncongressional consideration of the Alaska lands act that eventually \npassed in 1980. It was then that I first met him since I was working as \nan aide for the Alaska Legislature. George truly was an inspiration. He \ncould light up a room in Juneau just by entering it and could influence \nlegislation simply with a few words of wisdom.\n  George did not speak to hear himself talk, but everyone listened when \nhe did talk. That was because everyone who knew George knew he was a \nstraight shooter, a totally honest, fair, dedicated and hard-working \nman of outstanding judgment. He was a gentleman in every sense of the \nword.\n  He worked tirelessly to develop a complete city, one with services \nfor the young which is why the town's sports center the the Sullivan \nArena--is named after him. He also worked to build facilities for \nsenior citizens and low-income individuals and he worked to build the \ninfrastructure necessary for a modern city in a cold climate.\n  While we had known of his ill health and his battle with cancer for \nsome time, there is still a great emptiness at his passing. While his \nwife Margaret passed away 2 years ago, George is survived by nine \nchildren, one of which, Dan, is Anchorage's current mayor.\n  As much as George was known for his leadership in the community and \nState, he was also known to be a family man. He and his wife Margaret \nwere married for 59 years and raised nine children. I offer my deepest \ncondolences to all of his children and grandchildren.\n  George was truly one of Alaska's original pioneers, a giant who will \nbe sorely missed. His many accomplishments will live on in Alaska's \nhistory. Many Alaskans, including myself, will continue to remember the \ngood humor, wisdom, and selflessness of the man who will always be \ncalled Mr. Mayor.\n\n[[Page S10988]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/02/senate-section/article/S10988-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO ANNA ``ANN'' ROSS KARY ANDERSON\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Anna ``Ann'' Ross \nKary Anderson who served honorably during World War II as a member of \nthe Women Airforce Service Pilots, WASP.\n  More than 1,000 women answered the call and served as pilots during \nWorld War II. However, because WASP records were classified and \narchived for over 30 years, WASPs have been left out of much of the \ndocumented history of World War II.\n  On July 1, 2009, legislation was signed into law that honors the \nservice of these women with the Congressional Gold Medal, which is \ngiven in honor of outstanding service to the United States and is one \nof the Nation's highest civilian awards. This Congressional Gold Medal \nfinally gives Anna ``Ann'' Ross Kary Anderson and the rest of these \nbrave women the honor and recognition they deserve.\n  Between 1942 and 1944, the 1,102 women of WASP were trained in Texas, \nand then went on to fly noncombat domestic military missions so all \ntheir male counterparts could be deployed to combat. WASPs were \nrequired to complete the same primary, basic, and advanced training \ncourses as male Army Air Corps pilots, and many went on to specialized \nflight training. By the conclusion of the war, WASPs logged 60 million \nmiles of flying in every kind of military aircraft.\n  Following the war, the WASPs were disbanded and the women pilots paid \ntheir own way home without pomp or circumstance. Even during the war, \nthe families of the 38 women who died in the line of duty were \nresponsible for the costs to transport their bodies and arrange \nburials. It was not until 1977 that the WASPs were granted veterans \nstatus.\n  Anna ``Ann'' Ross Kary Anderson was born in 1920 on her family's \nhomestead in Mellette County in South Dakota. Following high school, \nshe attended the University of South Dakota. After her military service \n``Kary,'' as she was known to her students, went on to instruct \nhundreds of future pilots and was one of the first female FAA \ninspectors. By the time she retired she had logged over 20,000 flight \nhours. She still has family living in South Dakota.\n  While many of the South Dakota WASPs are no longer with us, I would \nlike to recognize all of the women who joined from South Dakota in \naddition to Anna ``Ann'' Ross Kary Anderson: Helen (Anderson) Severson \nof Summit, SD. who was killed in service during a flight training \naccident in 1943; Marjorie (Redding) Christiansen of Mystic, SD; Loes \n(Monk) MacKenzie of Salem, SD; Laurine Nielsen of Deadwood, SD; Maxine \n(Nolt) Wright DeHaven of Sioux Falls, SD. I would also like to honor \nViolet (Thurn) Cowden formerly of Bowdle, SD, who now lives in \nCalifornia, and Ola Mildred ``Millie'' Rexroat, who currently resides \nin Edgemont, SD.\n  The WASPs served our country with extraordinary bravery, even in the \nface of discrimination. Their service was essential to the war effort, \nand this recognition of their heroics is long overdue and rightfully \ndeserved. Though the pages of history have thus far overlooked the \naccomplishments and even the existence of this group, which served its \ncountry so well, this bill ensures forever their rightful place in \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/02/senate-section/article/S10988-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BILL GROETHE\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Rapid City, SD, \nresident Bill Groethe on the occasion of his 86th birthday.\n  Bill has dedicated most of his life to preserving and capturing the \nhistory and heritage of Native Americans and South Dakota through his \nphotographs. This means of documentation, which Bill has so aptly and \nskillfully employed, has allowed for the preservation and study of many \nof our region's most significant events.\n  Bill's photographic experiences and services extend beyond the \nscenery and history of the South Dakota. During World War II, he served \nhis country as a photo reconnaissance technician for the Army Air \nForce.\n  Throughout his career, the photographs Bill has taken have not only \nbeen masterpieces of great artistic achievement but have also \ncontributed, in a unique way, to memorializing great events of the past \nand, oftentimes, the people whom these events affected. Examples of \nthis include photographs of Gutzon Borglum and his crew during the \ncarving of Mount Rushmore, the dedication of the Crazy Horse monument, \nsurvivors of the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, the Rapid City flood of \n1972, and, most notably, 1948 photos of the last nine Native American \nsurvivors from the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Each of these \nphotographs captures a pivotal and monumental event in our history.\n  Thanks to the efforts, talents, and generous donations of Bill \nGroethe, generations to come will have the opportunity to look upon and \nmore fully appreciate the events of the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/02/senate-section/article/S10988-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JUNE CULP ZEITNER\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the life and \naccomplishments of June Culp Zeitner, the ``First Lady of Gems,'' who \npassed away on October 11, 2009.\n  June, a longtime South Dakota resident and world-renowned \nmineralogist, contributed greatly to the study and knowledge of \nminerals and fossils through her research and published writings. Her \nwritten works include 12 books and more than 1,000 scholarly and \nmagazine articles on subjects such as natural history, cutting and \npolishing techniques, and collection methods.\n  In 1976, June acquired the nickname of the ``First Lady of Gems'' \nduring a ceremony honoring the 25th anniversary of the American \nFederation of Mineralogical Societies. Those in attendance that day in \nthe White House's Rose Garden to honor and thank June Culp Zeitner \nincluded First Lady Betty Ford and Mayor of Washington, DC, Walter \nEdward Washington.\n  As the founder of the State Stone Program, June encouraged each State \nto select an official stone, mineral, and fossil. It is thanks to \nJune's initiative in founding the State Stone Program that South \nDakota's official gem is the Fairburn Agate, our mineral is Rose \nQuartz, and our fossil is the Triceratops.\n  June's activities extended beyond the purely scientific to include \neducation and journalism, serving as a teacher and, for 38 years, a \nmember of the editorial staff of Lapidary Journal. She also founded the \nNational Rockhound and Lapidary Hall of Fame in my hometown of Murdo, \nSD. Her other accomplishments include creating a display collection for \nthe Smithsonian Institution and receiving various State and national \nawards.\n  The passion and dedication June displayed for mineralogy has done \nmuch to influence professionals and hobbyists alike. The people of \nSouth Dakota and our Nation are grateful for the contributions and life \nof June Culp Zeitner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/02/senate-section/article/S10988-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2009, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 30, 2009, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1929.

A bill to create a 3-year pilot program that makes small, \nnonprofit child care businesses eligible for loans under title V of the \nSmall Business Investment Act of 1958; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as we explore ways to help the working \nfamilies in America, we should not forget the many working parents who \nface difficulty finding quality, affordable child care. Approximately 6 \nout of 10 children are cared for by someone other than their parents on \na regular basis. And far too many children are left home alone before \nthey are ready. Across America, more households than ever are \nstruggling to make ends meet, while providing safe, nurturing \nenvironments for their children to grow up in. For many, child care is \nnot a choice, but a necessity. We owe it to America's families to \nincrease the availability of quality child care.\n  I believe one way to support this goal is to expand financing options \nfor non-profit child care centers. That is why I am reintroducing the \nChild Care Lending Pilot Act, which establishes a three-year pilot \nprogram enabling small, non-profit child care businesses to be eligible \nfor the SBA's 504 loans. Under current law, for-profit child care small \nbusinesses have access to these loans to finance facility expansions \nand building repairs but non-profit centers are shut out. Since the \nmajority of child care centers in many states are non-profit, this \nexclusion blocks needed resources from the facilities serving the \nmajority of our families. The Child Care Lending Pilot Act addresses \nthis problem and allows the centers to better serve the children they \ncare for. With low, predictable monthly payments, these non-profit \ncenters can improve their buildings and materials without breaking the \nbank or raising fees.\n  This industry is not one with high-earnings overall, so access to \ncapital is particularly difficult. Balancing the needs of maintaining a \nqualified staff while providing care that families can afford is \ndifficult at best. Calling for reductions in operating costs can result \nin decreased safety and quality in the children's environment that \nshould be structured to foster their learning and development. The cost \nof child care--ranging anywhere from around $4,000 to over $15,000 a \nyear--is highly prohibitive for many families and limited options only \nexacerbate this problem.\n  Not only is child care extremely expensive, but there are simply not \nenough spaces. Nearly 14.5 million children under the ages 6 years old \nhave working parents and need child care. But there are only an \nestimated 10.8 million legally-operating spaces for both young and \nschool-aged children.\n  Non-profit child care centers are a resource for America's working \nfamilies and deserve the same opportunities for-profit centers have \nwith access to SBA's 504 loans.

Res. 330\n\n       Whereas the members of the Army National Guard and Air \n     National Guard of the State of Pennsylvania reside throughout \n     the State and come from a number of different backgrounds, \n     professions, and communities;\n       Whereas members and units of the Pennsylvania National \n     Guard have been deployed in support of United States military \n     operations at home and in Iraq, Afghanistan, and dozens of \n     other countries;\n       Whereas one such unit, the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team \n     of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, is composed of \n     approximately 4,000 citizen-soldiers from throughout the \n     State of Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team is the only \n     National Guard Stryker Brigade serving in the United States \n     Army;\n       Whereas the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, following \n     mobilization and deployment to Kosovo in 2003, was placed on \n     Federal active duty for a second overseas mobilization on \n     September 19, 2008, and deployed to Iraq on January 15, 2009;\n       Whereas during the deployment of the 56th Stryker Brigade \n     Combat Team in Taji, Iraq, the brigade was primarily engaged \n     in convoy security, force protection, provincial \n     reconstruction, and base operations missions;\n       Whereas the members of the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team \n     performed more than 800 combined operations, captured 7 \n     brigade-level high-value targets, and discovered more than 80 \n     enemy weapon caches; and\n\n[[Page S10993]]\n\n       Whereas in September 2009, upon completion of 1 year of \n     service in support of military operations in Iraq, the 56th \n     Stryker Brigade Combat Team returned to the United States and \n     demobilized: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its gratitude to the members of the Army \n     National Guard and Air National Guard of the State of \n     Pennsylvania and their families for their service and \n     sacrifice on behalf of the United States;\n       (2) commends the members of the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat \n     Team of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard on the \n     completion of their deployment to Iraq;\n       (3) recognizes the achievements of the members of the 56th \n     Stryker Brigade Combat Team, as well as all other formerly \n     and presently deployed Pennsylvania Army National Guard and \n     Air National Guard units and members, for their exemplary \n     service; and\n       (4) offers its condolences to the family and friends of \n     Specialist Chad Edmundson of Williamsburg, Pennsylvania, and \n     Staff Sergeant Mark Baum of Quakertown, Pennsylvania, who \n     died in service to their country.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the contributions \nof the 56th Stryker Brigade, which recently returned to homes and \nfamilies across Pennsylvania. For nine months, the 56th Stryker Brigade \nhas been deployed to Camp Taji, Iraq. Here, these civilian soldiers, \nknown as the Independence Brigade, worked side by side with their Iraqi \ncounterparts to continue to bring stability and security to the Iraqi \npeople.\n  On the front lines, they patrolled neighborhoods in unrelenting \nconditions, targeted insurgents, and swept for improvised explosion \ndevices, IEDs. They performed more than 800 combined operations, \ncaptured seven brigade-level high valued targets, and discovered more \nthan 80 enemy weapon caches. Any success we have had in Iraq is not \nonly the result of military achievements. In this regard, it is equally \nimportant to recognize the $22 million in reconstruction efforts that \nthe 56th Stryker Brigade assisted with in coordination with an embedded \nU.S. provincial reconstruction team.\n  While these young men and women are now home, we must also remember \nthose who fell in battle. Two members of the 56th gave ``the last full \nmeasure of devotion.'' Specialist Chad Edmundson of Williamsburg was \nkilled by an IED and Staff Sergeant Mark Baum of Quakertown was killed \nby enemy small arms fire. To these soldiers' families and friends, I \nwant to express condolence and gratitude on behalf of the people of \nPennsylvania for their sacrifice. Please know that our prayers are with \nyou, and that we will never take for granted their personal courage and \nsacrifice. We pray for Chad and Mark and ourselves that we may be \nworthy of their valor.\n  While deployed, many things may have changed for these members of the \nPennsylvania National Guard. For example, some service members met \ntheir sons and daughters for the first time. Nevertheless for all, a \ntime of readjustment and reintegration back into their communities and \ndaily lives lies ahead.\n  I want the National Guard to know that I will always be committed to \nhelping them during this phase. I know that there are other Guard \nmembers who bear scars from battle, some visible and some not. The U.S. \nSenate must ensure that our citizen soldiers' jobs are maintained while \nthey are deployed and we must provide opportunities for them to find \nemployment upon their return. For this reason, I will continue to urge \nmy colleagues to take up and adopt the Service Members Access to \nJustice Act and the FORCE Act, which will make National Guard \nassistance programs more effective and responsive, and ensure that \nNational Guard troops keep their jobs and employment benefits as \nrequired under law.\n  Again, I want to express my appreciation to the 56th Stryker Brigade \nand all of our men and women in service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/02/senate-section/article/S10993-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 331--CONGRATULATING THE UNITED STATES MILITARY \n ACADEMY AT WEST POINT ON BEING NAMED BY FORBES MAGAZINE AS AMERICA'S \n                         BEST COLLEGE FOR 2009\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mrs. Gillibrand) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 332\n\n       Whereas, between 1945 and 1961, more than 2,500,000 people, \n     or 15 percent of the total population of the German \n     Democratic Republic (referred to in this preamble as ``East \n     Germany''), left the country to pursue economic opportunity \n     and enjoy the benefits of liberty and political freedom in \n     the Federal Republic of Germany (referred to in this preamble \n     as ``West Germany'') and other countries;\n       Whereas, at midnight on August 13, 1961, East Germany \n     sealed its border with West Berlin and began construction of \n     a 100-mile barrier that would later include bunkers, \n     watchtowers, searchlights, minefields, barbed wire, concrete \n     walls, and armed guards, to prevent the emigration of the \n     people of East Germany to seek freedom and opportunity \n     elsewhere;\n       Whereas, during the 28 years the Berlin Wall existed, \n     approximately 5,000 people successfully fled East Germany for \n     West Germany and West Berlin, more than 75,000 people were \n     imprisoned for attempting to leave East Germany, and an \n     estimated 1,200 people were killed trying to escape;\n       Whereas Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan \n     declared their vision of Berlin as a free city, in the heart \n     of a free Germany;\n       Whereas Chancellor Willi Brandt of West Germany and others \n     demonstrated great foresight in their pursuit of \n     ``Ostpolitik'', a policy of engagement that lowered tensions \n     and ultimately helped undermine the authoritarian rule of the \n     wall-builders;\n       Whereas more than 22,000,000 Americans served in the Cold \n     War, supporting the efforts to bring military, economic, and \n     diplomatic pressure to bear in the defense of Germany and the \n     West, and ultimately helping more than 400,000,000 people \n     gain their freedom from the bondage of communism in the \n     Soviet Bloc;\n       Whereas the Solidarity Movement in Poland demonstrated that \n     the will of a people united could not be silenced by winning \n     a surprise landslide victory in elections to the Contract \n     Sejm in June 1989;\n       Whereas, on August 23, 1989, Hungary officially opened the \n     border between Hungary and Austria, resulting in 13,000 \n     refugees from East Germany fleeing into West Germany through \n     Hungary;\n       Whereas, on September 4, 1989, after prayers for peace in \n     the Nikolai Church, crowds that would eventually number in \n     the hundreds of thousands gathered in Leipzig, East Germany, \n     to repeatedly and peacefully protest the authoritarian regime \n     of East Germany and to demand basic freedoms;\n       Whereas, in September 1989, thousands of people in East \n     Germany took refuge in the\n\n[[Page S10994]]\n\n     embassy of West Germany in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in order \n     to emigrate to West Germany and the West;\n       Whereas, on October 18, 1989, faced with widespread civil \n     unrest and a deteriorating political situation, East German \n     leader Erich Honecker, who had predicted that the Wall ``will \n     stand in fifty or a hundred years,'' resigned;\n       Whereas, on November 4, 1989, more than 1,000,000 people \n     gathered in Alexanderplatz in East Berlin and 40 other cities \n     and towns in East Germany to demand free elections and basic \n     civil rights, such as freedoms of opinion, movement, press, \n     and assembly;\n       Whereas, on November 9, 1989, East German politbureau \n     member Gunter Schabowki announced that the government would \n     allow ``every citizen of the German Democratic Republic to \n     leave the GDR through any of the border crossings,'' and East \n     German leader Egon Krenz promised ``free, general, democratic \n     and secret elections'';\n       Whereas thousands of people in East Berlin immediately \n     flooded the border checkpoints at the Berlin Wall and \n     demanded entry into West Berlin, causing the overwhelmed \n     border guards of East Germany to open the checkpoints to \n     allow people to cross into West Berlin;\n       Whereas, in the days following the fall of the Berlin Wall, \n     hundreds of thousands of people from East Germany freely \n     crossed the border into West Berlin and West Germany for the \n     first time in more than 28 years;\n       Whereas the Chancellor of West Germany Helmut Kohl and \n     Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher managed the political \n     situation and foreign diplomacy with great tact and in close \n     cooperation with Western allies, leading to the peaceful \n     reunification of Germany as a sovereign, democratic state on \n     October 3, 1990;\n       Whereas, on November 9, 2009, the people of Germany will \n     celebrate on both sides of the Brandenburg Gate the 20th \n     anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall with the \n     ``Festival of Freedom'';\n       Whereas the fall of the Berlin Wall was one of the \n     milestones of the 20th century, brought about by the actions \n     of many ordinary and some extraordinary people;

Res. 332\n\n       Whereas, between 1945 and 1961, more than 2,500,000 people, \n     or 15 percent of the total population of the German \n     Democratic Republic (referred to in this preamble as ``East \n     Germany''), left the country to pursue economic opportunity \n     and enjoy the benefits of liberty and political freedom in \n     the Federal Republic of Germany (referred to in this preamble \n     as ``West Germany'') and other countries;\n       Whereas, at midnight on August 13, 1961, East Germany \n     sealed its border with West Berlin and began construction of \n     a 100-mile barrier that would later include bunkers, \n     watchtowers, searchlights, minefields, barbed wire, concrete \n     walls, and armed guards, to prevent the emigration of the \n     people of East Germany to seek freedom and opportunity \n     elsewhere;\n       Whereas, during the 28 years the Berlin Wall existed, \n     approximately 5,000 people successfully fled East Germany for \n     West Germany and West Berlin, more than 75,000 people were \n     imprisoned for attempting to leave East Germany, and an \n     estimated 1,200 people were killed trying to escape;\n       Whereas Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan \n     declared their vision of Berlin as a free city, in the heart \n     of a free Germany;\n       Whereas Chancellor Willi Brandt of West Germany and others \n     demonstrated great foresight in their pursuit of \n     ``Ostpolitik'', a policy of engagement that lowered tensions \n     and ultimately helped undermine the authoritarian rule of the \n     wall-builders;\n       Whereas more than 22,000,000 Americans served in the Cold \n     War, supporting the efforts to bring military, economic, and \n     diplomatic pressure to bear in the defense of Germany and the \n     West, and ultimately helping more than 400,000,000 people \n     gain their freedom from the bondage of communism in the \n     Soviet Bloc;\n       Whereas the Solidarity Movement in Poland demonstrated that \n     the will of a people united could not be silenced by winning \n     a surprise landslide victory in elections to the Contract \n     Sejm in June 1989;\n       Whereas, on August 23, 1989, Hungary officially opened the \n     border between Hungary and Austria, resulting in 13,000 \n     refugees from East Germany fleeing into West Germany through \n     Hungary;\n       Whereas, on September 4, 1989, after prayers for peace in \n     the Nikolai Church, crowds that would eventually number in \n     the hundreds of thousands gathered in Leipzig, East Germany, \n     to repeatedly and peacefully protest the authoritarian regime \n     of East Germany and to demand basic freedoms;\n       Whereas, in September 1989, thousands of people in East \n     Germany took refuge in the embassy of West Germany in Prague, \n     Czechoslovakia, in order to emigrate to West Germany and the \n     West;\n       Whereas, on October 18, 1989, faced with widespread civil \n     unrest and a deteriorating political situation, East German \n     leader Erich Honecker, who had predicted that the Wall ``will \n     stand in fifty or a hundred years,'' resigned;\n       Whereas, on November 4, 1989, more than 1,000,000 people \n     gathered in Alexanderplatz in East Berlin and 40 other cities \n     and towns in East Germany to demand free elections and basic \n     civil rights, such as freedoms of opinion, movement, press, \n     and assembly;\n       Whereas, on November 9, 1989, East German politbureau \n     member Gunter Schabowki announced that the government would \n     allow ``every citizen of the German Democratic Republic to \n     leave the GDR through any of the\n\n[[Page S11001]]\n\n     border crossings,'' and East German leader Egon Krenz \n     promised ``free, general, democratic and secret elections'';\n       Whereas thousands of people in East Berlin immediately \n     flooded the border checkpoints at the Berlin Wall and \n     demanded entry into West Berlin, causing the overwhelmed \n     border guards of East Germany to open the checkpoints to \n     allow people to cross into West Berlin;\n       Whereas, in the days following the fall of the Berlin Wall, \n     hundreds of thousands of people from East Germany freely \n     crossed the border into West Berlin and West Germany for the \n     first time in more than 28 years;\n       Whereas the Chancellor of West Germany Helmut Kohl and \n     Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher managed the political \n     situation and foreign diplomacy with great tact and in close \n     cooperation with Western allies, leading to the peaceful \n     reunification of Germany as a sovereign, democratic state on \n     October 3, 1990;\n       Whereas, on November 9, 2009, the people of Germany will \n     celebrate on both sides of the Brandenburg Gate the 20th \n     anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall with the \n     ``Festival of Freedom'';\n       Whereas the fall of the Berlin Wall was one of the \n     milestones of the 20th century, brought about by the actions \n     of many ordinary and some extraordinary people; and\n       Whereas the fall of the Berlin Wall embodied the end of the \n     division of Europe, the opening of the Iron Curtain, and the \n     triumph of democracy over communism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 20th anniversary of the fall of the \n     Berlin Wall;\n       (2) celebrates 20 years of an undivided Europe, free from \n     the oppression of authoritarianism, with the people of the \n     former communist countries and Western Europe;\n       (3) honors the service and sacrifice of the people of \n     Germany, the United States, and other countries who served in \n     the Cold War to bring freedom to Central and Eastern Europe;\n       (4) expresses its appreciation to the people of Germany for \n     their commitment to preserving the dignity and freedom of \n     others in their leadership on international assistance, \n     peacekeeping, and security efforts, including in Afghanistan, \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Lebanon, Sudan, and \n     off the coast of the Horn of Africa;

Madam President, most of us go home every weekend and talk \nto our constituents. In places such as Mansfield, OH, and all over our \nStates, most of us are hearing a lot about people's problems with \nhealth insurance. I come to the Senate floor most nights or days and \nread letters from people in my State who have had difficulty because of \ntheir health insurance situation, and I hear a couple of things over \nand over. One I hear is that most people are generally pretty satisfied \nwith their health insurance--not the cost but generally their \ncoverage--until they get really sick and then they find out their \nhealth insurance isn't as good as they thought it was.\n  I get letters from people all over my State--from Youngstown, from \nToledo, from Bowling Green, to St. Clairsville--that a year ago they \nwould have said they had very good health insurance, but they end up \nhaving a baby with a preexisting condition or their health insurance \ncosts are so expensive because of an illness that their insurance is \ncanceled. In some cases, a woman who has a C-section is considered to \nhave a preexisting condition by insurance companies because the next \nbaby would have to be a C-section, and in some cases, even women who \nhave been victims of domestic violence are considered by their \ninsurance companies to be a risk because that is a preexisting \ncondition. If they were abused by their husband or boyfriend or \nwhomever in the household, then it is likely that person will do it \nagain, so that is a preexisting condition, and sometimes they are \nclosed out of their insurance.\n  A few weeks ago, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee chairman, Senator Harkin from Iowa--a committee I and about a \nquarter of the Senate sit on--held a hearing to examine how health \ninsurance companies discriminate against women in the private market. \nInsurance companies often deny care and charge higher premiums to \nwomen. For instance, in the case of a 32-year-old man and a 32-year-old \nwoman with very similar health backgrounds, the insurance premiums for \na woman will be significantly more. She will pay higher insurance \npremiums than the man will pay. We also heard stories about what I just \nmentioned, that women who have been victims of domestic violence or \nwomen who have had C-sections are charged higher rates or sometimes the \ninsurance industry literally rescinds--the industry term is \n``rescission''--their insurance coverage. That is only one example of \nhow insurance companies make a profit at the expense of people in need.\n  One of the reasons this legislation is so important is that these \nkinds of discrimination practices will be banned by our legislation: No \nmore cutting people off due to a preexisting condition, no more cutting \npeople off because they got sick and went over their annual cap or \nbecause they are too expensive to take care of; no more discrimination \nbased on geography, gender, or disability. We are going to ban these \npractices--no more using preexisting conditions, no more caps, no more \ndiscrimination--but even with that, it is important that we have a \npublic option--just an option. A public option will say to the \ninsurance industry: We are not going to let you do that anymore. We are \ngoing to change the law, but we are going to help to enforce it with \nthis public option.\n  I commend Leader Reid for responding to the support of the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire, and many of us who wrote \nto Senator Reid asking him to include the public option in the health \ninsurance reform bill. He has done that. That is a response from many \nMembers of the Senate, and it is also what most of this country wants. \nIn poll after poll, roughly twice as many Americans want to see a \npublic option as don't. A recent physicians poll by the Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation--certainly a group that has no dog in this hunt--\nfound that 70 percent of doctors want to see a public option because \nthey want to protect their patients. They want to make sure their \npatients aren't victimized by discrimination, by preexisting \nconditions, and by losing their insurance and all of that.\n  It is time for our Nation to get more choices, and the public option \ndoes give more choices. In Ohio, one insurance company controls 41 \npercent of the market. One company controls 41 percent of the market. \nTwo companies control 58 percent of the market. In southeast Ohio, two \ncompanies control 85 percent of the market. What does that mean? That \nmeans little competition, it means lower quality, and it means higher \nrates. You put the public option out there, and you give people a \nchoice. They do not have to choose the public option. They can choose \nAetna or CIGNA or Medical Mutual--a not-for-profit company in Ohio--or \nthey can choose WellPoint. Put that out there with the public option as \na competitor, and you bet these companies are going to behave better.\n  It is not just an Ohio problem. In fact, in some States it is worse. \nTwo health plans control 80 to 100 percent of the market share in 10 \nStates. Two companies control at least 80 percent of the market in one-\nfifth of the States in this country. In another 11 States, 2 health \nplans control 70 to 80 percent of the market. So you have 21 States \nwhere 2 companies control at least 70 percent of the market. That is \nnot competition; that is an oligopoly, I guess is the term we learned \nin high school economics class. But whatever\n\n[[Page S11002]]\n\nwe call it, we know it is simply not working to keep health care costs \ndown, it is not working to keep health insurance prices down, and it is \nnot working to provide the kind of high-quality insurance that is \nneeded.\n  In the insurance industry, what have we seen happen in the last 7 or \n8 years? Insurance premiums have doubled. The reason they have doubled \nis because they can. There are fewer insurance companies, but they have \ngotten larger and larger. These insurance companies have a business \nplan. Their plan is basically twofold. First of all, they hire lots of \npeople to make sure they deny coverage. You can't even buy insurance if \nyou are sick or if you have a preexisting condition. Then they hire \nlots of people to deny your claim. Something like 30 percent of all \nclaims submitted on the first go-round to private insurance companies \nare denied. So their business plan is to hire a bunch of bureaucrats--\nthe private, for-profit companies--to keep from buying insurance people \nwho might be costly. Then on the other end they hire a bunch of \nbureaucrats to make sure they try not to pay out for health care costs \npeople have.\n  Lots of countries in the world have private health insurance. We are \nthe only country that has private for-profits. This isn't a bunch of \ncountries around the world that have socialized medicine. Many \ncountries have private insurance doing it, but they are not-for-profit \nprivate insurance. So they do not add to the private insurance \nbureaucracy by hiring lots and lots of expensive people to keep you \nfrom buying insurance if you are sick or if you have a preexisting \ncondition, and they do not hire a bunch of people on the other end to \nstop you from collecting on your insurance when you do in fact get \nsick. That is why the public option is so important. It is going to \ncompete with these private companies. You won't see the kind of gaming \nof the system the private insurance companies are doing now.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, a strong public option \nin health reform, such as we provide for in the HELP Committee bill, \nwould save the government $25 billion over 10 years--again, because a \npublic plan wouldn't have to turn a profit.\n  So what does that mean? It means that in the last 7 or 8 years, \nprivate insurance companies have seen a 400-percent increase in their \nprofits. How do they make that profit? Well, by hiring a bunch of \nbureaucrats to stop people from getting coverage if they might get \nsick. They hire a bunch of bureaucrats, if they do get sick, to keep \nthem from having to pay for it.\n  At the same time, profits have gone up because those are good \ninvestments. Those bureaucrats who deny coverage are good for the \nindustry if they deny a lot of claims, which, of course, they do. But \nlook at the executive salaries, look at the trips they take, look at \ntheir sales meetings in Tahiti and their $20 million-a-year salaries. \nThe CEO of Aetna last year made $24 million. The average salary of the \nCEOs of the 10 largest insurance companies is $11 million. To make $11 \nmillion, you have to cut a lot of people off from getting their \ninsurance, you have to keep a lot of people out, you have to deny a lot \nof preexisting conditions, and you have to deny a lot of claims. And \nthey are very good at that. Again, that is why the public option is so \nvery important. The private insurance industry has avoided risk at the \nexpense of their enrollees when they should have been bearing risk on \nbehalf of their enrollees.\n\n  There is no better way to keep the private insurance industry honest \nthan to make sure they are not the only game in town. When they are the \nonly game in town, when there are only two companies in southwest Ohio, \nyou bet executive salaries are high and profits are high and quality is \nlow, and you bet cost is high for those small businesses and \nindividuals and large businesses, too, that are buying that insurance.\n  Too often, the private insurance industry has cast out the sick \ninstead of covering them. Too often, the industry has promised \nfinancial protection and has delivered disillusionment. No small \nbusiness is safe from unheard-of premium increases, even if they are \npaying in more than they got out from their insurance company year \nafter year.\n  There is a small business in Cincinnati, in southwest Ohio, as I \nmentioned earlier, that I believe has been in business for a quarter \ncentury. He would like to take the money he has made and plow it back \ninto the business and take a lot more of his revenues and plow that \nback into the business to grow his business, but he is spending more \nand more of his money--all of his discretionary money--on insurance, to \nthe point now where it looks as if, from what insurance companies say, \nhe may not even be able to cover his employees at all in the years \nahead.\n  Tomorrow, the HELP Committee--the committee that held the hearings on \ndiscrimination against women in health insurance--is holding a hearing \nentitled ``Increasing Health Costs Facing Small Businesses'' to examine \nhow exorbitant premium increases are affecting our small businesses. In \nthe past 2 years, half of small businesses that have offered coverage \nreported switching to plans with higher out-of-pocket costs in response \nto rising premiums.\n  So what is happening all over this country, the small businesses--and \nlarge businesses--in order to get coverage are forcing their employees \nto pay more money out of their own pockets for their insurance. \nEmployees are often not getting raises, in part because of the \nrecession, certainly, but also because the company is spending so much \nmoney on health insurance and people are having to dip into their own \npockets much more. Small businesses make up 72 percent of Ohio's \nbusinesses but only 47 percent offered health benefits in 2006, and \nthat was down 5 percent from half a decade earlier.\n  So it is important that we have this hearing tomorrow, but what \nreally matters is that our health insurance bill will, in fact, give \nsmall businesses several options. It will mean they can go into a \nlarger pool, if they would like, where their costs will be less. We \nknow a small business pays much more than a large business pays per \nemployee. Small businesses will get a tax break. Small businesses that \nhave 24 employees, 22 employees, have been paying too much for health \ninsurance. If one or two of their employees gets really sick, you know \nwhat happens: their insurance prices spike up and they may even lose \ntheir insurance overall or they may get canceled. But if you take the \nsmall business and put it into a pool, you are going to see much more \nevening. You won't see those price spikes when a handful of people get \nsick because you could spread that around the whole risk pool. That is \nwhy this is so important. It is so important for these small businesses \nto have a public option because it will, again, keep the insurance \ncompanies honest. It will mean more competition. It will mean insurance \ncompanies have to compete on price.\n  The people running the public option in every State are not going to \nbe paying $24 million to their CEO. You can bet they are not going to \nhire a bunch of people to try to keep people off of their insurance \nrolls. You can bet they are not going to hire a bunch of bureaucrats to \nstop the insurance companies--the public option--from having to pay. \nMedicare doesn't disallow or throw people off for a preexisting \ncondition. The public option won't either. Just by existing, the public \noption will keep the private insurance industry more honest.\n  Madam President, let me just close--and I think Senator Merkley is \ngoing to be joining us in a few minutes--with a couple of letters from \npeople who have been victimized, in some sense, by this insurance \nsystem.\n  This is Sheila from Richland County, the county where I grew up, in \nnorth central Ohio--the Mansfield, Shelby, Shilo, Plymouth, Lexington \narea. Sheila writes:\n\n       I moved to Ohio five years ago to be with my granddaughter. \n     I've worked hard all my life, and now, I'm 60 years old still \n     working and paying my own insurance. The other day I learned \n     my health insurance has doubled. I am alarmed because I'm \n     wondering how long I will be able to pay for my benefits. \n     I've talked to some other people my age and they are feeling \n     the same way. I have always worked, never sat down, or \n     expected hand-outs. But insurance companies are downright \n     greedy. I do have a problem with Seniors being gouged because \n     of age and health issues.\n\n  Sheila brings this to mind. There are a lot of letters we received \nthat are\n\n[[Page S11003]]\n\nfrom people like Sheila. She is 60--they might be 63; they might be 58. \nThey are typically from people who worked hard all their lives, as the \ngreat majority of people in my State have worked hard, played by the \nrules, and it is not always so easy, of course. Sheila suggests, as \nmany do, she knows she is Medicare eligible in 5 years. She is 60 now--\n4-plus years. A lot of letters I get, in addition to people thinking \nthey had good insurance until they got really sick, a lot of letters \nare from people in their early sixties. They just want to hang on until \nthey are Medicare eligible because they are paying such high premiums. \nShe said her costs doubled.\n  She knows Medicare, which looks a lot like the public option, is \nsomething that will ultimately protect her and will matter as she lives \nout the last 10, 20, 30 years of her life. That is why it is so \nimportant.\n  Linda, from Muskingum County, the Zanesville area of the State, east \nof Columbus, eastern Ohio:\n\n       I'm 60 years old and a mother of two grown sons. Since my \n     divorce earlier this year, I've had to start my life all \n     over--after 33 years of working hard and paying off bills and \n     our mortgage.\n       In May, I selected a standard plan from a private insurer. \n     As expensive as it was, I had to pay the $625 a month they \n     quoted.\n       As of September, I did not receive a policy or information \n     on my benefit plan, despite asking for a copy of my plan and \n     being charged monthly premiums.\n       The insurance company finally notified me that they \n     misplaced my form and that I would receive some information \n     in August.\n       In that time--I didn't see a doctor or use the policy in \n     any way, but I still paid the monthly premiums assuming I was \n     covered. But in just 3 months the insurance company increased \n     my premiums from $625 a month to $1,000 a month. The \n     explanation I got was that the insurer was required to \n     increase the premium in order to maintain enough money to \n     fund the plan I selected. The only thing they did was to take \n     my payments for three months for something I wasn't able to \n     use. I don't think it is fair they can increase the premium \n     that quickly or even within a year.\n\n  Linda reflects--she is the same age as Sheila. They are both from \nsort of small, medium-size towns in Ohio. Some of the same problems--60 \nyears old, onerous, very expensive premiums that they seem to have no \ncontrol over.\n  Again, what our health insurance bill will do, as we see more \ncompetition from the public option, we will see more spreading of the \nrisk so she doesn't have to buy an individual policy like this so if \nshe gets sick she will be covered.\n  Robert and Monica from Cuyahoga County, Cleveland area, northeast \nOhio, write:\n\n       Our son Jon will have no health insurance as of March, \n     2010. He's 25 years old and working on an associates degree \n     in landscape design at a community college. Our son Jon \n     supports himself as a landscaper, despite being deaf. He \n     makes just enough to buy food, pay rent and pay for some of \n     his courses. While he could file Supplemental Security \n     Income, he has never collected a penny of government \n     assistance.\n       But in March of next year, Jon will be dropped from our \n     health insurance plan. Please help Jon and millions of \n     Americans who are uninsured.\n\n  Jon is 25. In many cases people like Jon are dropped from their \ninsurance plan when they are 22. One of the things our bill says is no \nlonger will someone coming home from the Army or coming home from \ncollege, someone who moved back in with their parents, whether they are \n22, 23 years old, be dropped from their insurance. Under our bill that \npassed out of the HELP Committee, anyone can stay on their parents' \npolicy until the age of 26. But even at 26, what will happen is much \npreferable, obviously, to what is happening to Jon.\n  What is happening to Jon is--his parents say they are dropping him \nwithout much prospect, it sounds like, of getting insurance. What our \nbill says is that anyone who is uninsured, like Jon will be, at \nwhatever age he would become uninsured, anyone will be able to go into \nthe insurance exchange, and Jon will be able to choose from a whole \nmenu--Aetna, Wellpoint, Medical Mutual--or does he want to choose the \npublic option?\n  Because Jon sounds like he is pretty low income, Jon will get some \nassistance from the government, from taxpayers, to buy insurance so he \nwill be in this large insurance pool with, more or less, tens of \nmillions of other Americans, which will keep prices in check because of \nthe expanded universal pool of people. But Jon will be in a much better \nsituation because he will have insurance under this legislation.\n  Melissa, the last one I will read, from Lake County just east of \nCleveland, Willowwick, Wickliffe, Eastlake, Madison, that area of Ohio:\n\n       I'm a young, college-educated professional who has always \n     had to purchase my own health insurance because employer \n     plans were not available.\n       Even as a healthy young woman with no health problems and \n     no pre-existing conditions, my monthly insurance costs are \n     very expensive. I teeter on the brink of dropping coverage.\n       I would love to participate in a public option, and \n     especially want it to be available to family members and \n     people in my community who desperately need it.\n\n  Melissa is in a situation like so many. She works for an employer, \ncould be a small business--whomever she works for--that doesn't provide \nhealth insurance. It sounds like she has had decent jobs, but they \ndon't provide her health insurance. She has had to buy it herself. It \nis incredibly expensive, and it is increasingly expensive to buy \ninsurance on your own, even if you don't have a preexisting condition, \neven if you have not been sick, the way Melissa is. But she would like \nthe option of going into the insurance exchange and going into the \npublic option that would inject competition. It would keep prices more \nin check. She would be part of a larger pool, and she would have those \nprotections, the consumer protections that our legislation offers.\n  She, Melissa, is specifically asking to join the public option. That \nis her choice once this legislation is passed.\n  I thank you for the time on the floor. I add, this bill we are going \nto debate in the next couple of weeks, this legislation, in so many \nways, makes sense for this country.\n  First of all, anyone who is satisfied with their insurance can keep \nwhat they have, and we will build in consumer protections around it so \npeople can't lose insurance because their costs were too high or a \npreexisting condition. They might have had a C-section as a young woman \nor might have been a victim of domestic violence. Losing their \ninsurance for those things will not be allowed anymore.\n  This will help small businesses with tax incentives and other ways to \nspread their costs around so I guess they go into a bigger insurance \npool. It will help those who do not have insurance. They will have the \noption to buy it. If they are low- or middle-income Americans, they \nwill get some assistance to pay for their insurance.\n  Last, this bill will have a public option which will help to \ndiscipline the insurance market, will compete with them, will make them \nmore honest, and help to bring prices down as good, old-fashioned \nAmerican competition does.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise this evening to address the \nissue of health care in our society, and specifically the public \noption. Earlier today I had a chance to listen to some of my colleagues \ndefend the status quo system. They wanted to argue that health care \nreform should not occur now--maybe sometime later. I guess the 100 \nyears we have spent as a country, working to have affordable, \naccessible health care for every citizen, the 100 years we spent in \nthat debate isn't enough.\n  There is a novel by a couple of ladies who were turning 100. They \ntitled their novel ``The Second Hundred Years,'' or ``Our Second \nHundred Years.'' That was a beautiful glimpse into the possibility of a \nlife well-filled and a life of anticipated fulfillment as they went \ninto their old age post-100.\n  We are in a different situation with health care. This 100-year \ndebate should not go on for another 100 years; another 100 years for us \nto consider the possibility, the principle that every single person in \nAmerica should have affordable, accessible, quality health care.\n  I heard earlier today a lot of scare words thrown out to defend the \ncurrent system and encourage citizens to be\n\n[[Page S11004]]\n\nafraid of reform. Those scare words are very unnecessary because \ncitizens in America know our health care system is broken. They know it \nfrom their personal experience. So opponents of reform, they don't want \nto have a plan, they simply want to scare citizens into sticking with \nthe broken status quo.\n  Indeed, sometimes there is a certain concern about change, what \nchange will bring. Well, let's look for a moment at what the status quo \nis bringing us. Our health care costs are doubling every 6 to 8 years. \nThat means a lot of folks who could afford health care just a few years \nago cannot afford it today. A lot of small businesses that could afford \nhealth care 6 to 8 years ago cannot afford it today. A lot of big \nbusinesses that are competing internationally were more competitive 6 \nto 8 years ago than they are today.\n  I would like to be able to tell you that the rate of increase in the \ncost of health care has declined but, if anything, it has increased. We \nare looking at another doubling over the years to come, over the next 6 \nto 8 years.\n  I do not know about anyone else, but given how high health care costs \nare today for the American family, do we want a system, a broken \nsystem, that is going to double those costs again in the very near \nfuture? Is that a good future for America? Is that affordable health \ncare? Is that accessible health care? Is that an ability to acquire \nquality health care, which I think every American citizen knows in \ntheir heart that, indeed, that is not affordable or accessible or \nquality health care, to have a system that is doubling every 6 to 8 \nyears.\n  The other thing we know about health care in America is that folks \nwho have insurance still have a lot of challenges. Well, the first is \ngetting insurance in the first place because our current system allows \ninsurance companies, as incredible as this might seem, to say: No, we \ndo not want you. You have a family history of diabetes. You have a \npreexisting condition. It might simply be a skin rash. It might be \nanything. People are turned down for health care day and night in our \ncountry.\n  Well, those are a lot of American citizens who do not get to \nparticipate in our health care system. What about those folks who do \nget insurance and they go along paying their premiums year after year, \n10 years, 15 years, and then they finally have a health care problem \nand they get a letter from their health insurance company that says: We \nare dumping you off your health care plan. Now that you are sick, we do \nnot want to cover you anymore.\n  What kind of fairness is there in that for the American citizen, that \ncompanies can dump you off your plan when you finally need health care, \nafter you have been paying your premiums month after month, year after \nyear, or decade after decade, and finally you have an illness that \nneeds to be covered and, whoosh, your health care coverage is gone. \nThat is not a fair system for those who have health issues in our \nNation.\n  So we need to reform this system. It starts by ending the unfairness \nfor those who have it. It is called insurance reform. No more blocking \nfolks from being accepted into health care--universal guaranteed \naccess. No more dumping of folks off health care insurance once you \nbecome ill--an end to dumping, an end to preexisting conditions.\n  In other words, health care reform for those who have insurance is \nall about fairness. There were some other words thrown out earlier \ntoday, words such as ``deficit,'' ``government takeover,'' ``increases \nin premiums.'' All those are scare words designed to mislead the \ncitizens from following the logic of their own experience, their own \ncommon sense about the broken health care system we have in America.\n  But let's consider some other words. How about ``competition.'' It \nmay surprise some to find out we do not have much competition at all in \nhealth care here in America. Why is that? It is because the health care \ninsurance industry is exempt from competition. They are allowed to work \ntogether as an exemption for antitrust. They are allowed to coordinate \nand to compare. That works to the benefit of the companies, but it does \nnot work to the benefit of the citizens.\n  In addition, a lot of markets in this country have a single dominant \nprovider, often 80 percent of the market. That does not work toward \ncompetition. What do you get here in America in a market where you have \nno competition or very little competition? What you get are \nextraordinarily high costs that are doubling every 6 to 8 years. That \nis not a system that works for citizens.\n  So how about we introduce competition. That is as American as apple \npie. How can we do that? What we can do is have a health care \ncompetitor dedicated to healing, not dedicated to corporate profits. \nThat health care entity, that publicly created structure of health \ncare, indeed healing, they are not trying to maximize their profits at \nthe expense of citizens; they are trying to invest in the citizens to \nmaximize wellness.\n  It is a completely different model. It is a model about prevention. \nIt is a model about disease management. It is a model about healthy \nchoice incentives. That is the competition that a public option or a \ncommunity health plan will introduce with health care all over our \nNation.\n  I think lower costs and competition are good things. I think giving \ncitizens more choice is a good thing. Here are some brilliant aspects \nof this. If you do not have competition right now due to the antitrust \nprovisions or due to the dominance of a single payer, then the citizens \ncan look at the possibility and go: Well, they are all about the same. \nThat is not real competition.\n  But now, if you introduce a player that is not there to maximize \nprofits, is there to maximize wellness, that is real choice. Nobody \nwould be asked to take a public option or community health care plan \nchoice over a private insurance company. That is why they call it \nchoice. That is why they call it an option. You would get to choose.\n  Let us empower our citizens through choice in the marketplace. Again, \nthis is red, white, and blue American competition to benefit consumers \nof health care services.\n  We have had a lot of conversation about health care this year. It has \ncertainly been an intense conversation since January. We have five \nbills that have come out of committees. Many folks like to stack up all \nthose bills and say: Look how complicated it is. Look how complicated \nhealth care reform is. Well, it is a bit complicated because we have \nmultiple health care systems in our country.\n  We have a Veterans' Administration system. We have a Medicare system. \nWe have a Medicaid system. We have private insurance companies in the \nsystem. We have another system for all those folks who cannot qualify \nfor any of the first ones. It is this: Save your money and hope you \nhave enough when you get sick. If you do not, then I am sorry, you are \nin trouble.\n  There are some statistics on this: 45,000 Americans a year die \nbecause they do not have access to health care, 45,000. That can be \ncompared to just about virtually anything else that happens in this \ncountry. That is a pretty big total. That is a lot of suffering. That \nis not just folks who get sick and suffer, all those folks who get sick \nand suffer and die.\n  We had a gentleman in central Oregon who had a tumor growing on his \nspine. His doctor asked the private insurance company for an MRI, \npermission to do imaging so they would understand what was happening. \nThe insurance company, the private insurance company, turned him down. \nSo the patient and his doctor found a second expert. The second expert \nwent over the man and said: He needs to have an MRI. They sent a \nrequest to the insurance company. The insurance company turned him \ndown, again.\n  He died from that tumor on his spine. He actually had health \ninsurance, but he had health insurance with a private insurance company \ncoming between him and his doctor. Some of my colleagues like to say \nunder a public plan the government gets involved. Well, not really. It \nis you and your doctor. Right now we have insurance companies that come \nbetween you and your doctor every single day. Why not give the American \ncitizen this choice to have a different system, a system dedicated to \nhealing, a system that will create competition, a system that will hold \nthe private insurance company's feet to the fire.\n\n[[Page S11005]]\n\n  That is the community health care plan or the public option. I will \nconclude with this notion, that competition that lowers costs, \nincreases choice, and improves service is a wonderful direction for \nhealth care reform to go. We have made many steps in that direction. \nBut we have not gotten that bill to the President's desk. Let's do \nthat. Let's get that bill that increases choice, improves service, and \nlowers costs, let's get that bill to the President's desk by Christmas.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
